{"text":"Tried the prime rib pot pie, the reds burger and khao soi shrimp bowls. Tasty. Will come again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is pretty nice. It's pretty dark and has a romantic kind of feel but can be a little loud as the kitchen is in the open. The food was pretty good, I had a cheeseburger with fries and we shared a lemon cheesecake. The burger was good but nothing special. The cheesecake was really good but the portion was really small. I paid 30 dollars for the cheeseburger, coke and half a dessert. I would consider this an around average price but the general prices are a little above average from what i saw on the menu. Overall, it's a pretty nice restaurant and I would want to go back and try a more substantial entree. I took off a star because we waited a long time to be served after we were seated. We had to actually remind them we were there."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service, on the other hand, is not.   Waited about 15 minutes for a waitress to come to our table with menus and welcome us to the restaurant. The table next to us had to tell their waitress that we were seated for over 20 minutes and did not receive service."}
{"text":"So we went to Reds on a Saturday it was not that full. The waitress was very friendly and located us at one of the booths. The restaurant looks very clean I ordered a lobster cheese sandwich with fries and a Alaska eggs Benedict. The food took not so long and you could fell the freshness so the lobster sandwich was nice but the fries were little bit overcooked. But the sandwich tasted very well it was filled with lobster cheese and avocado. The eggs Benedict was delicious and the potato on the side had some light taste of garlic. It was a very nice combination.  The waitress came always to fill up the water. It's a nice place will definitely come again and recommend it. It's family friendly"}
{"text":"Butter tarts were AMAZING. But other food was mediocre (we went for dinner and got their appetizers, wings and salads).   Great drink specials though! And great service"}
{"text":"I went two days after opening day.  Loved the service and ambiance.  Wait staff was very polite. I ordered the shrimp Thai bowl and absolutely loved it.  The dish was perfectly cooked.  All my friends enjoyed their food as well.  I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"What's all the hype about at SquareOne. I'll tell you what, it's this swag new casual fine dining experience brought to you by the people that brought you Jack Astors, Scaddabush and the other REDS locations in Toronto - SirCorp!  Now I'm not about to rag on the rapid proliferation of corporate restaurants in this country - it's always been a thing and likely always will be. BUT with so much pressure from independently owned, innovative local businesses the squeeze is on the chains to innovate and create unique experiences that are far from the cost cutting, production line methods of days gone past.  You see this trend embodied by the new Red's at Square One mall in Mississauga. They offer a scratch kitchen (everything save for the ketchup basically) is made from scratch an in-house which leaves little room for mass-produced frozen entres and fast fry meals.   In addition, they've baulked the widespread spirit trend of whiskey everything and put a huge focus on being thought leaders in the Gin category offering nearly 40 varieties of the spirit in addition to the cocktail, wine and craft beer offerings that are a must have these days to compete,  The X-factor is the Create Your Own Gin and tonic section of the bar menu which allows you to choose a Gin from the list and choose your garnish to match the Gins flavour profile. The garnish options include:  FLORAL | Cucumber wheels, lavender florets & strawberries CITRUS | Lemon peel, thyme & cloves HERBAL | Orange peel & rosemary SPICE | Fresh raspberries, cacao nibs & cardamom pods  I didn't partake in a G&T (working) but I will return to sample one of each of their garnish combos (also working *wink*).  For my meal, I went with the Brixton Burger ($17.70) and a side of Truffle fries (+$3.00). The burger comes dressed with caramelized onions, portobello mushroom, Swiss cheese, onion rings, horseradish aioli, all on a freshly baked potato bun.  The burger was pretty good. It cooled pretty quick (I tend to eat my fries first) and unlike other burgers, I've had it was not really warm by the time I got to it but that's my fault and I accept it. The truffle fries weren't really executed well, they were soggy and the truffle flavours really didn't come through and were also at room temperature when dropped off. So I'm seeing a trend here that maybe things are sitting a bit too long between when they're cooked and delivered. Minor speed bumps with temperature aside, the flavours of the burger were really good and it was a perfect size for a big lunch that doesn't leave you floored for the afternoon with a food coma.  The shining star of our visit was our server Tabby. She was all smiles and super duper friendly, helpful and informative. She told us she'd worked at the other Reds in Toronto for a period of time so it's a good sign to see good people sticking with the company as it expands.  Next time, I'll go into the Gin and desserts (sounds like a trip all of its own) but I'm excited to try these 2 bite butter tarts and apple pie (especially if equally scratch made)!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Try something new in new year! I went there yesterday with a friend of mine, we were excited about this place. We've ordered 3 dishes: fried calamari, kale & quinoa salad and chicken carbonara pasta. The calamari was nice, very tasty; it could be perfect if the batter more crispy. The salad was awesome, we loved it so much!! Finally the pasta, a little disappointed that the sauce was too plain (light?) and not enough to coat everything rigatonis, I think it would be better with fusilli spirale or rotini are carry the sauce better.   Their services was good overall, the only thing is the guy who was serving our table lack of attention to us.  I gave 3 stars as there are rooms to be improved."}
{"text":"Came here with hubby for a quick dessert bite. They take reservations but the wait time was less than 5 mins without one. We ordered cappuccinos, traditional apple pie, Chicago style cheesecake and butter tarts... the cappuccinos were perfect, not too strong and not too milked down. The butter tarts were so delicious and soft while maintaining its beautiful flaky crust. The Traditional Apple pie was scrumptiously flaky with a hint of tartiness and not overly sweet, it pairs well with ice cream so make sure to ask for a scoop on the side. My absolute favourite was the Chicago style cheesecake! If you are a fan of tartiness lemon flavour you are in for a treat! I would consider this casual dining, Reds is a sister company of Scaddabush, Jack Astor's and Canyon Creek so you kind of get the idea. The interior looks like Scaddabush but without the heavy Italian menu. Service is good and staff is friendly. Within 30 mins (while writing this review) we were visited by 3 servers and the manager to ask if we were enjoying the dessert, which we definitely were.  Their window seating is quite tiny, the tables can only hold one glass and one plate person, which makes it a bit odd when you've ordered sharable platters. Moving onto coat check, due to winter season most of us are wearing bulky coats. I do wish that they offered coatcheck considering we were placed at a very tiny table. I would suggest them to add coat hooks next to the window tables if they can't offer coat check. Some of us don't want to place out purses/coats on the ground or crush them by sitting next to it. I will return to try their dinner and brunch menu for another review. Till then, Ciao Bella!"}
{"text":"Wow ... cost of meal for two: about $100; duration of meal:arrived at 6 pm, paid and left by 6:35 on a Friday night. I was looking for a relaxed after work meal - not the \"30 minutes or its free lunch special\". I have not felt this rushed in a very long time. A steak for me and a tuna bowl for my guest which arrives 5 minutes after it's ordered - maybe two sips taken from my beer? That doesn't feel right. The steak was tough and flavourless (and it was not the cheapest on the menu) -- I doubt it was a particularly good cut.  So, normally, yes I will take a look at that dessert menu and order a second drink, and a coffee or espresso. But, no, I am not going to bother running the bill up if I feel like I am being rushed to free up a table (the restaurant was more than half empty, by the way, so inexcusable.)  I would recommend going to one of the other restaurants at Square One - maybe the one around the corner with the nice patio."}
{"text":"Reds is located at the ever so busy Square One but when I entered for the first time and got settled in it took me away from that Mall atmosphere and felt totally relaxed. Our server Jen was prompt, always smiling and recommended the Butter chicken and rice ... great call Jen. The food tasted fresh and my friend had the shrimp ravioli that I so tasty and generous serving. I loved the decor and clean individual bathrooms. Great vibe , awesome food and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, it was a busy weekend but the service was good. Burger was tasty, the beef was handmade and moist. Bun tasted freshly baked, actually all their breads and baked goods are made on site. My side green salad was underwhelming.. some leaves were wilted and dressing was bland. I decided not to get the fries because from other people's meals they looked over cooked and dry. The meat pie was flaky and the  stuffing was nice. Butter tart was okay, I've tasted better.. not enough filling for my tastes.  For the price they charge it could be a tad better but it wasn't bad. Solid restaurant overall and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I only tried their butter tarts at the little takeout window. And I have to say I'm impressed. I'm not a big butter tart fan myself but this was not too sweet and their crust was crunchy. The filling tastes just like butter! *drools* I'm going to come back and dine in for lunch one day."}
{"text":"I've been to the other two Red's restaurants a year ago and it looks like they have changed their menu over the years. This time, we chose the tasting menu which my 2 other guests and I shared.   We like our steak rare and it was delicious. The pork ribs didn't have as much meat and I'm not sure if it is because we had the platter. Another friend ordered just the ribs and enjoyed it. My favourite would have to be the chicken. It was definitely juicy and the sauces they provided to pair was perfect.   Our truffle fries were excellent to start with and it was seasoned very well. The double roasted potatoes were like super crunchy potato wedges, but kind of oily. The Singapore style carrots were a bowl of harvest carrots - kind of hard and weren't as appetizing. The menu said it was cooked in peanut sauce but I didn't taste any peanuts and it was rather bland.   We also had the Dessert Sharing Platter. I wasn't a fan of the Chicago Style Cheesecake because the torched lemon curd at the top was too sour for me. The Chocolate Chess Pie was rich and flaky. Like every other yelpers' review: the butter tarts are a must order!"}
{"text":"The scrumptious looking pies and tarts restaurant's side window is enough to entice shopper's curiousity to try this out restaurant. However, sometimes the taste just doesn't live up to the hype or as they say \"there's more to this than meets the eyes\". Let me start with their \"famous\" chicken. The wait staff explained that there is a limited amount produced per hour but they'll see what they can do. Luckily, we got the last two pieces. Smells to me like marketing scheme! In terms of taste, the chicken was moist and the skin was exquisitely crispy. The marinate wasn't all that special though..it's salty, tangy with some sweetness. Then there's the ribs, which was terrible. It was dry and slattered with a sauce that lacks flavour big time. The appetizers were mediocre as well. Service was slow but it is somewhat understandable for a Friday night. And what is up with the decor concept using used shoes? They need to fire their creative person!"}
{"text":"Red's recently opened in Square One. Service was friendly and efficient. Food came out lightning fast, looked great and tasted great. Menu is similar to most upper casual places and borrows from Canyon Creek, Joey and the like. Unique to Red's is its bakery program. They bake on premises including fresh apple pies. You'll receive a baked in-house 2-bite butter tart with any glass of sparkling wine. A nice touch. Interested to try their family-style prix fixe dinner on my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been to the Red's downtown for a work event and remember that everything I tasted was great.  I had high expectations for this place.  Red's did not deliver.  The service is lacklustre.  The place is pretty.  It's intriguing to have a view of the homemade pies section.  Other than that, I had the lobster grilled cheese.  It had no taste and was super oily.  The ceasar salad was bland, not tasty yet it was so oily.  What a disappointment.  For dessert, I had the chess pie.  It was good, I would order it again.  It wasn't too sweet, which I like.  I'm not really that impressed with this place.  I saw what other people ordered around my vicinity and other than the share platter, nothing really looked that good.    Perhaps this review is marred by my experience downtown, where everything seemed to be so tasty and the service friendlier. I'm not willing to write this place off though, cause of the good memories of food I had at the downtown Red's.  I will come back and give it another chance and provide my update."}
{"text":"Saturday brunch review. rolled in around 11am and got seated immediately. Service was good but got our lobster avocado toast mixed up with the original one and forgot to take that off the bill.   unique food ingredients and quality was there but the food portions were lacking for their price point. Their bloody Caesars was barely dressed up and it tasted water downed. I'll prob come back for dinner but not for brunch."}
{"text":"The portion size and flavour of the dishes did not disappoint us! We had an amazing scrumptious dinner. The food was perfectly seasoned and their cocktail drinks are lovely. The waiter and waitresses were very friendly Will definitely keep on coming back with my boyfriend.  Délicieux!   Food 5/5 Drinks 5/5 Ambiance and environment 5/5 Service 5/5 Music 5/5 Crowd 4/5"}
{"text":"The ambiance, service, and decor was great. Their specialty is their in house baked goods which are really good. I enjoyed the apple pie and 2 bite butter tart. Apart from that, I wasn't really impressed with the food I tried. I had expectations because this place is a bit pricey. The truffle mushroom soup was okay as well as the burger. However the two asian bowls on their menu were lacking a bit in flavor and seemed to be more fusion than authentic. The ahi tuna tostados had a great guacamole but the tuna did not look or taste good. My rating is based on my entree experience primarily."}
{"text":"Pretty good, stopped by for a quick bite with my family between lunch and dinner so mostly apps!  We ordered:  Lobster guac Freshly fried chips that look oily but dont taste it!  Guac was zesty and huge chunks of lobster   Fried calamari Crispy, with great presentation and a delicious dipping mayo sauce  Sweet potato fries Crispy, a little on the burntside Love the 2 dips (curry flavor and mayo)  Lobster mac n cheese with caesar salad Didnt try this but mu dad said it was good bit the avocado made it a bit heavy  The service was great and consistent!  I definitely want to come back to try the rest of their menu!  The bakery smelled delicious, really upped the already nice environment!"}
{"text":"Having strolled past Reds several times in Square One, we finally had the chance to try out this restaurant for weekend brunch.   We ordered the eggs Benedict and the Brixton burger as part of our meal. The eggs Benedict was not your traditional one, and it surprisingly tasted better than it looked. The hollandaise sauce was doused all over the poached egg and  fried peameal bacon on the crispy English muffin, and actually brought the dish together as it was more on the acidic side and cut through the grease. The homestyle potatoes were lightly herbed and coated resulting in a crisp pocket with a fluffy interior.   The Brixton burger was deluxe but also a bit on the heavier side. The buttered brioche bun was freshly baked as evident by the store front. In between the crisp buns, was the Angus beef patty, sauteed mushrooms and onions, Swiss cheese, horseradish aioli, and onion rings. Although this was hefty, this burger could have benefited from sweetness and acidity. We also ordered the salad on the side, which was an assortment of greens in a lightly oiled vinagrette.   Overall, our first time at Reds proved to be a great addition to the restaurant scene in Mississauga. Value was also fair, and the atmosphere was rustic. With a strong menu, Reds is a great option for all occasions."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall (service outshone the food for sure).  Visited with my mom on a week night after checking out the Square One bridal market. We were seated at a cute table beside the bar which had a little lamp on it. Mentioning for all of the Instagrammers out there, the light helps with the food shots for sure!  To start we selected the lobster guacamole which was served with housemade chips - very tasty. Note, for big eaters the portion was fairly small but perfect for 2 people to share. My mom ordered the prime rib and I opted for the shrimp bowl.   Our server was really lovely and attentive but came back a few minutes after we ordered to let my mom know they ran out of her meal. She was pretty bummed - obviously not our servers fault but the kitchen should have given her a heads up IMO. My mom chose a NY strip with peppercorn sauce instead.  Our mains arrived fairly quickly and presentation was nice. My meal was tasty, but I probably wouldn't order it next time. My mom said her dinner was just ok.  Overall we did enjoy our visit and I might return if in the area again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, really cool atmosphere as well.   After a stressful day of shopping you can spend what little money you have left and enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out Red's for their drinks and I was not disappointed. It's a popular restaurant in this mall and me and my friends had to wait about an hour for a table. It wasn't so bad because we can walk around the mall while we wait for our table.   Service: service was adequate. Our server rarely checked up on our table to refill our water or take away some empty plates. I felt like service could be a lot better.   Drinks: I'll probably return for drinks. They have a variety and they have a few pages just for Gin and Tonic. I also thought it's fun to create your own G&T.   Food: we ordered the beetroot hummus, ravioli & garlic shrimp, chicken carbonara, and brixton burger. Out of the foods we ordered, the best item was the ravioli. It was really good with the shrimp on top. The beetroot hummus was different and nice. The chicken carbonara and burger was mediocre.    Overall I think Red's is a great place to grab drinks and dinner. It's a cozy atmosphere and there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"New place inside the mall! The decor is pretty, however this is the only positive! Went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was not full to capacity. Service is what needs to be worked on. Not once did they check on how the food was or if we needed more water refills or more wine after we had placed the initial order and we felt like we has to \" bother\" our server for extras. Also the food we ordered was nothing to brag hole about( kale quinoa salad and beet dip with nacho chips. Food was all bland and the quinoa salad at Costco is much tastier in comparison and cheaper! Will i go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"There really is nothing stopping me from giving a full 5 stars. Everything we got was amazing!! Even the washrooms were the best! Lol  Birthday dinner #4, and my girlfriend suggested we try this place out. She made resos for 6:30 on a Friday night and phew!, because it was poppin! A line sprawling into the mall formed as our night went on.  FLASH ROASTED CHICKEN Our server told us she had to double check if they had enough chicken. She ended up coming back saying they wouldn't have any until 6:55 and it was 6:17. I decided to wait. Luckily, they were way ahead of schedule and both the chicken and my gfs meal came out around 6:35. This whole dish was put together perfectly and deliciously. You get half a chicken, so it is quite a bit. Every part of the chicken was so tender and juicy. The breast was not dry at all and I had expected it to be. I asked for mash instead of their roasted potatoes. They were done just right. You barely get any broccoli but the couple pieces you do get pair perfectly with the chicken and potatoes.  It's the sauce on top of the broccoli that just adds the perfect flavour in your mouth.  My gf got the RAVIOLI WITH GARLIC SHRIMP and oh man. I'm allergic to shellfish but I tried one of her ravioli's and it was ammmazing!! My gf even said the whole dish was friggin amazing and hasn't said that about food in awhile. The ravioli was honestly perfection. The ricotta filling was just enough and the perfect balance. The actual pasta itself was soft, cooked just right. I wish I could get this dish myself next time but I don't know what they could substitute the shrimp for lol....a piece of chicken... lol.  CHICAGO STYLE CHEESECAKE We were expecting this to be delish since our meals were so good. You know what? They pretty much nailed this. Not too sweet and the lemon tang was not over powering. It had an interesting balance that worked. The actual cheesecake and graham were exactly how you'd want a cheesecake and graham crust to taste.  Our server was sweet and never felt invasive. She filled our waters without having us to ask. In fact, overall service was great. The timing between everything felt right.   For some reason, I came to Red's with low expectations. I just thought it would be another chain meal that's good enough to pass as an ok meal. I did not expect to get blown away. I cannot wait to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"If you're on a budget, this place isn't for you! Finally went here after I've heard good things about the Toronto location. Everything was so over priced! The place looks great! Great for family gatherings and intimate meetings.  Upon looking at the menu...my fiancé and I decided to start with their nachos! When it finally came to the table, we were soo disappointed! For 14 dollars we only got 6 pieces of nachos (crispy wonton topped with a bunch of ingredients). The taste was ok, nothing sticks out to me.  My fiancé ordered the roasted chicken and that was the best bang for your buck! Fresh roasted chicken was juicy and full of flavour! I ordered the burger and was super disappointed on how dry it was.   We decided to try the infamous butter tarts, for 2 dollars we got a two bite small butter tart, it was tasty but slightly expensive. But for every butter tart sold, the proceeds go towards breast cancer research!   This place has good quality ingredients but the price is quite steep on the quantity your receive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with girlfriends and everything was awesome!! We all had hot weather with lemon and our server topped up our mugs but also bright a kettle of hot water to our table. She also filled our regular water frequently.  One friend ordered the tomato fennel soup and enjoyed it. We all ordered the quinoa bowl with potatoes, but mine was with no cheese, one friend had it with feta and the other with goat cheese. Every order was perfect and we all loved the meal...especially the flavour from the red pepper sauce. It was one friend's birthday and they offered her a free birthday butter tart but she was too full to have it. I had a 20% off card that I received in the mail so the total including tip came to approx. $68."}
{"text":"We came here specifically for the weekend brunch (Sat & Sun 11 am - 3 pm).  We were pleasantly surprised as every dish we ordered was delicious. It must be the scratch kitchen that elevates REDS above other chain restaurants!  We especially liked the Lobster Avocado Toast; the chia seeds and cayenne pepper added an interesting texture and kick. I found the portion size a bit small, especially when compared to the Atlantic Eggs Benedict and The Tavern Breakfast. The Hibiscus Bellini was refreshing and flavourful. Several other cocktails caught my attention too.  The Apple Pie was tart and cinnamony. It paired nicely with the Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream. I noticed several guests seated in our area ordered from the lunch menu and their dishes looked appetizing. I'll definitely return!  Con: two thirds of the restaurant is high tables."}
{"text":"REDS was great. My friends and I went to celebrate a birthday and the overall experience was delightful. The food (we each had a burger) was tasty and filling, however, the meat was slightly dry. The environment of REDS is very relaxed, I would recommend it for groups of friend or business meetings.   The highlight of our night was our server Sindy. Sindy was extremely kind and looked after us the entire night by ensuring the food was tasty and we were happy. Sindy went out of her way to make sure the birthday-girl had a nice night, which was very kind. If possible, I'd recommend asking for Sindy.  Overall, the experience was great. As for food recommendations, the buttertarts were delicious and so were the sweet potatoe fries."}
{"text":"idk about this place.  it's confusing.  the melange of large sports bar-esque TVs, dim lighting, a-step-above-casual-yet-loud atmosphere, a wall of wine bottles, some odd glass case of shoes as decor, and a dj playing loud music (poorly... but i suppose this is no place for music criticism) comes across as very \"jack of all trades master of none\".  however, the food isn't bad.  the menu showcases a variety of items, such as apps, steaks, salads, and burgers, with some asian fusion items scattered throughout the list.  yet it's not clear what they excel at.  maybe that's a good thing and i'm being too harsh?  anyway, some highlights:  - chicken wings: massive pieces, good buffalo sauce, crispy skin.  can't ask for much else - kale & quinoa salad w/ added tuna option: just a straight up good vinaigrette salad, and the lightly-seared tuna was delicious, heavily-seasoned with black pepper - calamari - truffle fries  and the odd lowlight, the butter chicken dish.  though tasty, this was a dry take on the indian classic.  no curry gravy to be found  i usually preach that food always takes precedence over atmosphere and service, but this time around i just couldn't ignore the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with Red's food or service! Ordered the beets goat cheese salad, shared the lobster grilled cheese and two side dishes; mushrooms and broccoli with cheese! Just the right amount of food! Everything was on point! Thanks again for a great night!"}
{"text":"Food seemed basic and bit overpriced for portion's. Fantastic decor. Baked goods were terrific in particular the butter tarts."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We were seated quickly, but it took so long (10 mins) for someone to actually give us menus. When we were approached we weren't even asked for drinks, we had to ask ourselves.   Server was barely attentive, he came over once to fill out glasses.   Mediocre food. Not even that hot when it came out.   I asked for my food to be packed away, the plate was taken to the back of the kitchen. THIS IS AGAINST FOOD REGULATIONS OF ONTARIO. YOU MUST PACK THE FOOD IN FRONT OF THE GUEST. She didn't even pack what I wanted to take home. She only packed what was appropriate which annoyed me as I was taking my scraps home to my doggo.   Reds is a shitty dining experience."}
{"text":"Went her a few day ago with my boys... we were really sick for the holidays and survived on soup so we needed something solid... the staff was very accommodating.  We told them we need to be away from everyone as we were sick they made sure that happened... then we had demands of only room temperature beverages... again Olivia or waitress made sure she delivered that.  thank you Olivia for your patience. The food was great.  But the ambience stole the show.  we are suckers for restaurants and we endorse this one. Can't wait to come back and have all the desserts."}
{"text":"I love this place. Given it's a chain, but the menu is small and sweet. They make a killer roast chicken with potatoes and brocoli. The chicken is cooked in batches every 40 mins. I also call for reservations as it's in the mall and can get very busy. The service is always great and friendly. The nachos are ready good, mushroom soup is not cream base and yet taste amazing. The shrimp bowl and butter chicken bowl are good for a bistro - it's not a specialized Indian place or Thai place, those ethical items are very fusion and taste good."}
{"text":"Food-wise, The Cheesecake Factory makes Red's look like a Michelin Star restaurant!  I realise it's not, but I had such a bad experience at CF last week, I was hesitant in trying out another chain restaurant inside a mall.  Atmosphere:  Eclectic.  Some rustic elements, bar door, dark wood, industrial lighting with high heel shoes (owner's daughter's), old radios, shot glasses in lit, glass cases.  It is fairly dim and there are variations in seating, e.g. small booths against the front windows, taller tables with tufted leather banquettes.  Restaurant is pretty big!  Food:  Casual menu items at mall prices, BUT everything is made from scratch, e.g. breads, buns, patties for burgers, fresh cut fries, desserts, and ketchup didn't taste like French's - I forgot to ask about that.  Comparing to CF again, portions are much smaller, but the quality is there.  We ordered:  Red's Burger (~$16), Skinny Sandwich (~$15), DIY Gin (price varies depending on gin used), Cheesecake ($9), & Two-Bite Butter Tart ($2).  Fries were really good, seasoned, and crispy NOT greasy!  Side salad did arrived drenched in dressing and not so fresh looking (wilted, browning on edges).  It looked as though it was dressed quite some time prior to arriving to the table as the leaves were limp.  I did inform our model-looking server, Kayla, and she promptly agreed, took the salad away, and replaced it with a much fresher looking salad with dressing on side.  Desserts were both made in-house.  Both cheesecake and butter tart were lighter and not too sweet!  Coffee was good.  Service:  Attentive and more personalised, as it was quiet in the restaurant.  Kayla got Anthony, the bartender to come to my table when I had some questions about the gin.  Anthony was able to give me some recommendations, what to pair it with, but apparently another bartender was better in his gin knowledge.  My only criticism is about the salad that should've never been presented to the table.  Ketchup almost had a skin too, if it sat any longer.  So dressing a salad is not really something that you should do when the kitchen is quiet!  Otherwise, this was a surprise and I was impressed by the level of service provided at a mall restaurant.  Overall, it was a positive experience!"}
{"text":"Three of us came for our friend's birthday dinner on March 31. Place was  packed. We had a reservation and got a very decent and comfortable table. We ordered the tasting menu with half a barbecue chicken, half a rack of pork ribs, 11 0z new york steak and coleslaw.For the sides we had caesar salad and brocoli.Pretty good for $75. The new York steak was better than some high end upscale steakhouses.Tender, well marinated, very fresh, top grade.Grilled to perfection medium rare. Apple pie with icecream was excellent and on the house for birthday.Coffee was very good but not piping hot after long wait for sugar and cream. Service was a bit slow and disorganized. Different people served us. had to wait for coffees,pie, ice cream, sugar and cream. Very good ambience, new, chic, upscale and clean establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered truffle fries to start (they were good). My dining companion had a chicken Caesar salad as a main, which was extremely dry. The chicken meat was dark & boney. Not to my friend's liking. She barely touched her salad. I had the Brixton, which was tasty. It was quite messy as the burger fell apart. Ambiance is nice. Restaurant is spacious. Service is SLOW! Ordered wine and when it was brought to the table, Bartender noticed drinkware wasn't suitable so he brought over a wine glass. Minor requests were made; asking for condiments & dressing, which had to be requested from other employees (bus boy/bartender) because wait staff either forgot or were attending to other tables. Give yourself ample time to dine in."}
{"text":"FOOD is a 3. SERVICE on my visit is like a 10! BUTTER TARTS are a 10!  We were served by Jermaine. He was wonderful. Extremely tentative and welcoming. His client service is remarkable, played along with our jokes and is a great asset to your company.  The food is mediocre.  Nothing to amazing EXCEPT the butter tarts. These are the best thing! If I find a place that has butter tarts I get one to try and I will definitely mission all the way to this location to get them.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw this place pop up in square one and thought we should give it a shot! We really liked it and the service was great! I got the lobster grilled cheese with truffle fries and my boyfriend got the cheeseburger with Cesar salad. Both meals were super delish! When we asked for water but our waiter brought us a fancy glass water bottle and we didn't think it would be extra charge (water is always free unless you ask for sparkling water) in the end we realized that the water was $7.50 which we thought was ridiculous. We told our server and he took off the $7.50 which was nice. Overall totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"From the outside of Reds, inside the swanky Square One shopping Centre in Mississagua, two striking features are apparent: gin and pies. Reds has the biggest selection of gins, from the ordinary to local favorites to expensive imports, bar none! That includes bars. Their menu offers various garnish configurations and the tonic is always bottled (Fever Tree) not the cheap crap from the guns.   I seem to have wandered into a gin drinkers heaven. Is there such a thing?  For a drink that has enjoyed a resurgence, there may not be a better place for it. Gin used to be Americas clear liquor of choice before that Russian flavorless liqueur (vodka) became popular.   If you love pie (odd enough for a fancy mall and maybe more common for a roadside diner) you'll no doubt stop in after seeing the open kitchen and the bakers making pies (and breads) right on the premises.   I ordered the balls of bread, which were in vinegar and oil, only to find out it was Reds' version of focaccia. They looked beautiful and were served as an appetizer. Very smart of Reds to charge $4.50 for what other restaurants will put in the tale for free!  Also on the app menu was \"nachos\" but with a twist. chicken on a cracker with sprinkles of lettuce. Again, beautifully presented on a walnut plank.   Speaking of wood, the tables near the front were a gorgeous tiger maple with a bow tie joint. Your woodworking friends will also think they've gone to heaven.   Reds is a stylish, Attractive restaurant and a great place to bring a date. If you want to really impress."}
{"text":"It's just okay. I went st lunch and didn't find the best menu options. I was pretty disappointed. I got a chicken club with Caesar salad. It tasted pretty mediocre, nothing special. Will go back at dinner to try again and update my review. Hoping to try their pastries next time too"}
{"text":"For a girl's night out, we decided to check out this new restaurant inside Square One. When we got there, our reserved table was right by the door - I wasn't too thrilled with that. The decor was trendy, huge chandelier above the entrance and open bakery area was nice touch. They really like displaying their vast selection of wines and liqueurs, there were walls and walls of them. The menu is on the pricier side and nothing really stood out. The calmari was super crunchy, portion size was small, and they even deep fried a few slices of lemon. The lobster grilled cheese and caesar salad were both on the greasy side. The shrimp bowl was ok, flavours were good with a kick of heat. The burgers with the giant onion rings looked good at the other table, so maybe try that if you do go. Since Red's boasts about their homemade pies, our group decided to try both the apple and chocolate pie (and their two bite butter tart). I would say that dessert was the highlight of my meal. This is a nice restaurant for date night, but in my opinion, it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Yea, I had a good time with my friends here.  Everyone's orders was well-received.  I ordered a burger--I forget what it's called--but it was pretty legit.  I also found the truffle fries addicting, even though they had a strong flavour.  Great service, the waiter who served us was very friendly and helpful.  I liked the upscale/casual feel, that in the middle of Square One, you can treat yourself to a nice meal--that is a bit on the pricey side, but worth it.  I want to go back and try their other menu items.  I heard their lobster mac and cheese is also good."}
{"text":"This place opened up in Square One recently. I've been to the Red's in downtown Toronto and liked it so I thought I'd try out the Mississauga location. The atmosphere is pretty nice. Modern and hip. The service was decent as well. He came around often and filled everyone's drinks a lot.  The food here is pretty decent too. We had the truffle fries and sweet potato fries to start. Both were tasty. I got the Brixton Burger for my main with a caesar salad. The caesar salad was great. The burger was very tall and a decent size overall, but I actually wasn't a huge fan of the patty. Crumbled apart too easily for my liking. Because of that, I'd probably not go with a burger from here next time.  Still, I prefer this place to most other chain restaurants in the mall area."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with Red's. We ordered the mushroom soup and the Brixton burger. The soup was average and very plain. My main issue was the false advertising when it came to the Brixton burger it says it came with a portobello mushroom and I expected to get a large mushroom head not a couple of sliced up mushroom pieces. The burger had a lot gristle and was tough. We sat for a long time without any service , we were ignored when we wanted extra water and nobody wanted to leave a water jug on our table. The waiter was so run of his feet he was telling us he needed a beer was to busy to give any kind of service. The food was expensive and average and you can find better food at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Still a fan of RED's. Service was great and so was the food. I ordered the Carbonara this time to try and it was jammed packed with flavour. The only thing I did not like was the peas but that's just my preference."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is not bad for a date night. The dishes over all had a consistent smooth taste. We like the drinks. Their specialty gin was very good. However, I think with the price we pay, we had a higher expectation with the service; the plating of the dishes and taste of the dishes. But the service was alright, we felt the waitress we had, did not really introduce us the menu. I understand this place is more of a classic higher end restaurant. But the portion size... I really did not expect it to be this small. We ordered the calamari as the appetizer, the taste was great, the fried lemon was an unique touch on the dish, it is just toooo small since we were three people sharing this dish. We barely tasted and it was gone... the main dishes was good. If you are looking for some good cocktails, I definitely recommend this place, because the drink is like a meal, and the price is also like a meal."}
{"text":"Walked into the mall today really hungry and I saw a bunch of people standing in a line leading to a window. I looked up and saw REDS and I was like what the heck is this?! Reds just opened up 3 days ago and glad to be one of the many first to have tried this location out. It's a beautiful looking place and the service was great! The server recommended the prime rib pot pie from their lunch menu and that's what we had. I must say I don't really like pot pie but this was pretty good. I would definitely come back on a weekend to try out their brunch menu. Oh yeah! They also have a fresh bakery. Try out their fresh butter tarts. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch experience here and thoroughly enjoyed the food, ambience, service!   Honesty, I thought this place would have been a pretty average restaurant with overinflated prices because it's in a mall but I was so wrong! Unlike other restaurants, they don't restrict you to a brunch menu on weekends and offer a wide variety on their lunch menu (pot pies, pasta, steak, burgers, sandwiches, soup).  While there aren't a lot of options for their brunch menu, they feature really solid classics like eggs Benedict with their own housemade English muffin. My boyfriend and I ordered:  HOT & SPICY PANCAKES (4/5): I'm really adventurous with food and can't stay away from really interesting combinations. If you like savory pancakes and like it with a kick, this is worth a try! The hot sauce gives it a spicy tanginess that battles the sweetness of the buttermilk pancakes and maple syrup. I love the smokiness of the applewood bacon and that it was cooked perfectly (not burnt to a crisp). The pancakes were fluffy and not dense. Portions were good for $13.50.  SLOW COOKED PRIME RIB POT PIE (5/5) Highly recommend this - they only make a limited batch in the morning and only had 2 left when we ordered! This was such a winner for us and definitely the highlight of the meal. The pastry was so buttery and flakey, the meat and potatoes inside were tender and had such rich flavours. It also comes with a side of salad but you can upgrade to truffle fries or sweet potato fries.  --  Red is such a nice addition to SQ1 - great quality food at fair prices. I'm excited to come by and pick up some of their butter tarts - you can peer in to the kitchen and see the chefs make everything by hand."}
{"text":"The service here was great and the main meals were delicious. I tried the ravioli and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. They were filled with ricotta and the shrimp and sauce accompanied it well. I also tried the prime rib special which was an amazing deal, 30 dollars for a 10oz prime rib with Yorkshire pudding and  2 sides. The only disappointment was the truffle fries. They were not flavorful and came with ketchup! Not garlic aioli and they were expensive I think it was almost 10 bucks just for the fries."}
{"text":"I went here twice with a few friends. The service was ok since most of the staffs are new. ( forget things here and there, missing utensils, take really long to input order into tablet, etc.), We ordered brixon burgers, sushi, truffle fries and a khao soi bowl. Besides the burger (which I ordered twice and same with friends), other dishes I tried weren't really special or amazing. The drinks and cocktails, on the order hand, were on point! We got some gin and tonic, whiskey and coke, New York sour, mule... the foxy lady was really good and I don't think you can go wrong with any of the drinks (so far that I tried)."}
{"text":"This place just wasn't very great. The service was whatever, the only interaction we had with the waitress was when it was time to pay & tip. The serving sizes are a joke. It's 5 ravioli pieces on my plate for 25$? Crazy lol, I know it's fine dining but like damn I was hungry af even after we ordered more stuff. (which honestly, none of it tasted good. the pesto sauce was basically just herbs and oil.)  The ambiance was so nice, although its kinda confusing at the same time. Sports bar? Fine dining? Casual? Upscale? Kinda a mix of all of it. I found the wall decors to be so cool, of the heels and perfumes and all.. that was really cool.  And then the bill came.... wow!   This place is highly overpriced with not the greatest food or service. The 1 star goes to the look of the place which is nice."}
{"text":"I loved the decor in this place! So damn pretty! Kind of reminds you of a speak easy but not that dark.  The staff are patient and helpful and the menu is little bit different from other paces. Prices are a bit higher than average.  Bangkok nachos are a nice twist on the classic and we didn't really eat anything else and a few glasses of wine.  Cool and classy place, perfect for date nights and after work outings."}
