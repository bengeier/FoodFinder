{"text":"Eating out can be very unhealthy and I love finding somewhere where you can eat out and still have a ton of healthy options! This place is great and they have tons of vegan and gluten free options.  I got the Bangkok salad with prawns, which was filled with lettuce, cilantro, crispy noodles, peanuts, and a delicious spicy dressing. I also had a small spicy sweet potato soup, which was also amazing. Everything here is so fresh and you can tell is made with quality ingredients. They have filtered water with fresh fruit in it, which adds some nice flavour!   The staff is super friendly and bubbly. I only wish this place was closer to me, but I don't mind driving a little to get some yummy salads, soups, and wraps!"}
{"text":"Staff was excellent here. Food was fresh and tasted good. I felt the value was good for what we paid. Really dig their water of the day!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for lunch today, so glad we did! Fresh and delicious, portions were surprisingly large. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to be able to go somewhere and get something fast and so fresh. The sandwiches are great, bowls are great, salads are excellent and the Spanish quesadilla is my favourite  ( I forget what they actually call it ). fair prices. Two negatives... The  fruit waters don't have enough flavour and every time I order the Cesar with grilled chicken  they always forget the chicken."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and was throughly disappointed today....  For starters the garbage bags left lying on the floor by the till was a big turn off. The staff also kept a very messy workspace behind the till. I'm not sure if it went under new ownership but very disappointed in the cleanliness of the place.  The food was alright but it's hard to screw up a salad roll, however on that not I've had much better from here before.  Not sure if I'll be back after this experience. With the dirty and messy atmosphere and the sub-par food I'm better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place... Bangkok salad with prawns is delish."}
{"text":"I find this chopped leaf to be the best one I have been to. Love the food, the toppings. Would approve for any vegetarians out there, or people wanting to make healthier choices.   My faves are the Thai soup, the bowl number 1, and create your own salad is always a winner too."}
{"text":"Amazing place ! Wish it was a little bit cheaper but always worth it ! Great service as well ! Glad there is somewhere healthier close to me ! Must try"}
{"text":"The Mexican place was too busy and the Chinese place sucks so we went to the chopped leaf.  I had the chopped salad. The price was good. The salad came right away. I ate it. It was good. I was happy about it. It gave me a good feeling similar to getting a good checkup at the dentist.  It was really healthy. Especially since we had to park a mile away because the parking lot sucks."}
{"text":"Food was fresh. Had the thai curry bowl (3/5), and the No. 2 bowl (4/5) with added chicken. The No 2. bowl was delicious! The Thai curry bowl was decent.   Would recommend this place to those looking for a healthier alternative."}
{"text":"The Chopped leaf makes eating healthy a breeze! Not only are the menu items extremely delicious they are also absolutely nutritious!   This place literally has the best salads in the world!! I'm never one to choose a salad on a menu but after trying the Popeye salad I can't wait to come back!  Be sure to visit before or after the 12:30pm lunch rush!"}
{"text":"The salad was good, but the wow factor was the way the staff rushed around the counter to hand an older lady a menu and seat her rather than have her wait in line and order at the counter. Service was great, the salad was fresh and the chicken was still warm. Overall amazing first visit."}
{"text":"If you want a salad I highly recommend eating here.  I prefer eating in, but takeout is good as well.  Favourite is the Whole bowl number 1 with Chicken.  I always leave feeling full, but healthy.  There is some sour cream on the side, so if you don't like that just ask for it without.  Next favourite is a Pegasus with Chicken.  It's the best Greek salad I've had and the dressing is absolutely great.  I also like the salad rolls, either prawn, or just veggie.  The vieggie one has peppers in it which are great. My he peanut sauce is great.  The salad I was disappointed with is the Ceasar.  Unlike the other salads, the caesar dressing is quite bland, and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"After a recommendation from one of the mom's in my community, I thought I would finally try this  place out. Drove by it a million times but just never had the urge to try it.   I assumed it was one of those \"hippie places\" and they didn't serve allot or any meat and this is one of the main reason's it never interested me. Was I wrong. They do have allot of veggie options as well as gluten free options, however they also have chicken and tuna. A bit of everything for everyone, including a kids menu.  After looking at the board to see what caught my eye, I realized they have great options and healthy food choices. Mental note, next time I am craving a burger that I dont need - come here instead.  I tried the BBQ chicken quesadilla and it was delicious. It's your typical quesadilla however it also had mushrooms and hot peppers which was very flavourful and gave it a unique kick for lunch. At just under $10, I would say this is more than reasonable for lunch.  Staff was friendly and food was made quick. Waited less than 10 minutes and worth it. Food was great.  They have a great menu and I will be back again since I really want to try one of the whole bowls I heard about."}
{"text":"Carnivores like me need to eat leaves occasionally too.  I like the idea of the Chopped Leaf and truly adore the Chopped Water.  The cashier fella seemed inept and needed help ringing in a drink after the main order was placed.   Table runner was in and out fast so I guess thats what I expected.   Service a 4 by 5.  Now.   I do have a propensity to enjoying my salads lightly dressed, so I have to weigh that in here.   I ordered the Pegasus (Greek) salad and for me it was WAY over dressed to the extent I couldn't finish it.  The dressing was actually very tasty mind you, just way too much for my liking.  I had to also remove a few wilted black leaves, and being their core ingredient in their brand name I expected immaculate lettuce.   Too much black and yellow in the color array.  My entree salad was balanced out with the Prawn salad rolls.  Staying true to their core theme,  the salad rolls were vermicelli free.  My wife really enjoyed her Southwest salad.     Overall I would try here again but order dressing on the side.   (Control freak!)  Food experience 3 by 5 and hoping for better on my next try."}
{"text":"Just quickly grabbed a wrap to go, I think the one I picked was Sunshine and added grilled chicken, but when I opened it, there's only Salad, NO chicken!  If I don't need a receipt doesn't mean you can take away my protein, Mr Juan!  Such a bad experience.. Be cautious for your to-go food!"}
{"text":"I was in today for the first time. I was greeted right away and the service was really good.  I ordered the pesto chicken quesadilla to go.  Came up quickly so I headed right back to work to enjoy my lunch.  It smells really good and the flavours were actually really good! The reason for the 2 stars is that when I opened the container (not even 5 minutes after they handed it to me) my quesadilla was REALLY soggy.  Not sure if it was the cheese or they didn't grill it long enough.  It for sure was not what I am used to having with a quesadilla.  The flavours were good though."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic.  The first time we went, my fiancee and I both enjoyed our Bowl #2s.  The tahini sauce on the rice really allowed all the flavours in the rice, fresh vegetables and pecans to pop.  I had chicken for my protein, while she had tofu.  My chicken was well cooked and juicy, while her tofu was flavourful.  We had chopped waters, essentially a chilled, weak fruit stock that changes from day to day, which were light, delicious and refreshing.  They are $3 a piece unless you buy a Chopped Leaf cup, in which case they are always free, but even at the $3 price point, totally worth it.  We went back a second time and I had a Bowl #1, while to her delight, my fiancee enjoyed a vegan sweet potato soup.  Vegan/vegetarian soup is particularly hard to find as most stocks use chicken, beef, or fish bones for flavour, so we quite appreciated that it was there and that it was yummy.  She had salad rolls, one of which I sampled which were surprisingly minty, which was nice.  The next time we went back, we both had wraps, delicious again.  They use fresh, local ingredients whenever possible, and you can taste the difference.  Their dishes are quick, but all land very well on the palate, and are mercifully lacking in the salad texture present in other wraps.  If you are watching your weight, you're better off getting the Bowl #1 and building your own wrap, as some of their dressings can be quite high in fat, but certainly go check out this amazing place."}
{"text":"Great healthy food at a good price. Tomato soup was AMAZING and the grilled sandwiches are hearty and flavorful. Finally a fast food place that is healthy and has tons of variety. Friendly staff and very clean. Love this place and coming back for sure! Kid friendly too."}
{"text":"Excellent salads, very feeling and we'll priced. No wonder why my significant other eats there every day."}
{"text":"Back again for my salad fix within just a few days!! One word - BANGKOK! You have to try this salad! Noodly, salady cilantroey goodness, fully loaded with 'stuff!' I opted for prawns this time as my protein - well executed. Wow! I got to meet the owner of this franchise (started in Kelowna, only as far east as Regina. New one opening in Airdrie in Dec!!!) The owner was so nice to talk to, very down to earth! She loves the Spa salad That will be my next order! Not sure if I can wait another 3 days, good thing I live close-by! :)"}
{"text":"Very nice flavours combined with solid nutrition, pleasant staff and good presentation make one's lunch a pleasure in more than one way.  The first time, chose one of their multi-leaved and seeded lunch salads, and much enjoyed the house vinagrette. The second time, selected one of their noodle dishes spiked with kale and other greens, and was glad I'd come.  There's something good about eating a meal, large or small, that lands in the belly with an assurance of physical wellness. This is one place in the city to go to get that satisfaction.  Will I return. Oh yes, when in that area, for sure."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is a higher quality version of Freshii.  It has a similar menu with many types of bowls, some soups and options to choose between wrap, salad and sandwich.  I've had the Thai curry bowl, Thai lemongrass soup, and the No. 2 bowl.    My first time here, I had the Thai curry bowl and I thought it was average and also not that filling.  I came a 2nd time today and I ordered the no. 2 bowl and a small Thai lemongrass soup. The soup was tasty, though a bit small and pricey for $4.50.  In terms of the no. 2 bowl, it had a hearty portion of brown rice and roasted pecans with some spring mix, sun dried berries and some lentils with the \"Goddess\" dressing. It was very good and filling.    Verdict: A perfect post workout meal."}
{"text":"Chopped leaf was not a place I was immediately drawn to - I thought it would be a typical healthy sandwich place, nothing spectacular.  I was wrong, the sandwiches are amazing. I have had 2 there so far and each one is as delicious as the other.  The concept is pay at the counter and order - I cant recall if they bring your sandwich to your table, but either way its uncomplicated.  I ordered a Bangkok wrap with Tofu.  The flavours were delicious -peanut sauce, cilantro  - so tasty.  I had a wrap but you can get the sandwich fillings made into Salads too,  The staff were pleasant and genuine.  The decor is relaxed and clean. They far surpass anything you can get at Subway.  So fresh and delicious. My new favourite sandwich place."}
{"text":"Great food, very tasty salads that are actually interesting and delicious. It gets quite pricey though. Ive found the service to be very inconsistent. Mistakes have been made, and they can be soul crushingly slow sometimes (even when the place is empty) but very concise and quick others."}
{"text":"Just noticed that chopped leaf opened up in Deerfoot meadows. Working in the area it's nice to see some healthier restaurants opening up.   Went for lunch with a coworker. Went around 12:20 the line was a little longer then I'd hoped for but the service was fantastic. The line went pretty quickly and once I paid my salad came within 10 minutes.   I ordered the Cesar salad with grilled chicken. It was a great choice. All in all I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch if your in the area."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm that impressed with the salads here. The one I had lacked flavour. The dressing was unimpressive and when you add protein it is under-seasoned. The concept is good and it's probably a healthier meal than other fast-food places. Prices are reasonable but it's not somewhere I would head for if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Love the salads and wraps.. highly recommend if you are looking for a light meal  Awesome. .........."}
{"text":"good.  southwestern wrap was decent  9$ for a wrap is kinda ridickudonks.  NEed more salads though so its great to find a place with bowls of healthy fresh vegetables"}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place, it's supposed to be a fresh fast food place. I would give the place 3.5 if I could give half star ratings!  I don't think they have anything outstanding on the menu, sandwiches, wraps, soups, etc. Everything sounds pretty healthy and green though.   I tried the sandwich and the soup here, and they were both pretty good but a bit on the pricey side.   I would go back if I am ever in the mood for eating a healthy sandwich/wrap and soup, and don't mind dropping some extra money versus eating cheap sandwich and soup at Timmies around the corner."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh made to order, very clean environment. It's a refreshing change up to the fast pace lifestyle that we're all on nowadays. So if you're interested in healthy clean eats check it out."}
{"text":"My friends and I were grabbing some take out while in the Heartland area, and this restaurant looked appealing and healthy, so we chose to try it out! I got a starter bangkok salad (the smaller of their two sizes), which was super yummy. I liked that it came with noodles for added grains (a lot of the other salads don't come with a grain product). The prices are very reasonable at this place, as well. If you have an SPC card, make sure to use it for a free fruit-infused water!  The two girls working at the time I went in were both super helpful with my friend's dietary restrictions. They were also more than happy to walk me through the menu and answer any additional questions I had.   Verdict: A great place to get reasonably priced healthy and filling food. Will be coming back to try their other options."}
{"text":"I kinda stalked chopped leaf while they were building as the concept really spoke to me.   Healthy food on a chef designed menu which took flavor profiles into consideration so it feels like a real treat.  Their moto is even \"feel good after you eat\"  Yes please!   Best part?  Vegan and gluten free conscious - not tolerant with an item or two - it's basically catering to them without alienating all the regular folks.  Amazing.  I was telling my sister in grand prairie about the place and I found out she already had one - what!?  What took so long Calgary ... seriously!  My love goes on for this place.  First off,  they go organic and local wherever possible without crossing the line into the insane costs putting the price point into unattainable except for some people or on some occasions.  So far they are doing a good job because I'm loving their price point.  It's an \"every day\" price point pretty much if that's what you'd consider a place like McDonalds.   It's a definite alternative to cooking (many items couldn't be cooked at home that cheaply with fresh ingredients)  without sacrifice to health.  You do need to be careful though,  sometimes the calorie info is a shocker like the full bowls.  They are fiance's favorites but they have a lot of fat and that makes the calories rise quickly.    The space is casual but classy.  The staff and owners are very welcoming and nice.  You order at the till and then the food is delivered to your table in china bowls like sit down place.   You can also do take out and or catering.   My favorites are the bowls (but there is a lot of eating, and the fat is high),  the salad rolls (they use basil and they are so fresh tasting), and the soups.  I love that there is a vegan soup each day and then one more (and it's often vegetarian too...).   The grilled tofu can be added to any meal and I find it actually tastes like smoked gouda in some ways.   I've even ordered this on the side and eaten it plain (I would rarely do that with tofu).   The only food complaints are a general dislike of the chopped shakes but they are a nifty idea.  I've also made up some rather gross wraps for myself but I think that was me choosing things that don't work well together.   Chopped water here is interesting.  They let fruit infuse into their water (a special combo each day) and you get a subtle kick to your water.  It's $1.50 or for $16 you can get a refillable cup that's got free refills for life.  You still have to remember the cup... and we've already broken one but I still think it comes out ahead so far and more so if you consider the lack of wasted cups.   They also have a membership program - spend $150 over time and get $10.   It certainly helps if they manage to convert you here.   At the moment my only criticism is the hours.   They were only open until 7pm (although I noticed they bumped Thurs/Fri to 8 recently).   I'm hoping for a bit longer hours but one of the owners promised it would come with time as they establish better."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! My sister and I are obsessed with it! The rice bowls are delicious and the Bangkok salad is my favourite! So good!!!"}
{"text":"A great place for a quick healthy lunch! They have great menu items, but if nothing strikes your fancy you can customize your own.  My only complaint is that I ordered a Cesar salad without chicken/bacon and the did out chicken which was no big deal"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to for fresh salads and soups. Unfortunately I showed up here with my family at 11:15 on a Sunday and they had 4 employees working but none of the food was ready. No soups available, ovens weren't running so anything hot would have to wait. If I come to a fast food restaurant I expect food to be ready and available when I arrive. This is unacceptable, I'll just go to Freshii down the street. The quality and service are far better. Sorry chopped leaf, when you were the only healthy lunch option in town I went with you but now I get why nobody goes here any more."}
{"text":"Chopped Leaf has opened another location in Calgary. This one is in Deerfoot Meadows where Teriyaki Experience used to be.  I arrived just before 12:00 to find a line about 10 people deep, with another 6 or so people already ordered and waiting for their meals. The line did not move very fast and all said and done it took me a half hour to get my salad.  I went with the southwest salad with spinach instead of romaine. I chose the full size salad, grabbed a peanut butter cookie, and tried their Chopped water of the day which was orange mango. The salad was really good, nice and filling, and they don't douse it with dressing. The cookie though was awful. It had an off flavour like the plastic wrap it came in or something. It was definitely not worth the $2.50(?) I paid. The water was fine.  Overall this was an expensive lunch for $17 that took 45 minutes from the time I walked in to the time I was done eating. While I like these types of QSR's as a healthy alternative to the regular fast food options, they're just not quick enough and always a little too high on the price point for what they are."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. I ordered a medium salad with grilled chicken, avocado, croutons, pita chips, chopped mix, cherry tomatoes and balsamic vinegar. It was really delicious and filling. The salad was very fresh and flavourful with a nice texture! I would give it 5 stars but I have to admit, the salad was a bit on the pricy end. My total came up to $15.50 which I think is a bit much for a salad. But the place had a really nice, bright atmosphere and I received excellent customer service. All three employees there were very kind even though I showed up right before closing. A young lady welcomed me warmly and when I told the gentleman at the front counter that I was new to the place, he kindly and informatively explained the whole menu to me, which I appreciated. And the other gentleman who made my food was friendly and delivered it quickly. Overall, I am very impressed with the customer service and how fresh and tasty the salad was."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  I had read some reviews online about Chopped Leaf before I finally decided to check it out for myself. I'm on the Wild Rose Detox right now, so I wasn't sure if I would be able to eat anything, but I gave it a chance. The idea here is you can create your own salads, wraps, or rice bowls with the numerous options they offer. Or, you can simply order one of their creations and customize it to your liking.   I saw that they were offering a Vegetarian Chili that day, but I wanted to double check what was in it (I cant have mushrooms, among other things) and I was pleasantly surprised to find they have a small flip book at the register with all the menu options and ingredients inside! This was super handy in helping us pick out a salad dressing we could have as well, as vinegar is a no-no. We each ordered a chili, and a salad with chicken, tomatoes, nuts, and apples with the Chipotle Lime dressing. I was also hoping to have some of their Chopped Water (which was Grapefruit, Pineapple, and Melon infused that day) but unfortunately I wasn't allowed any of those fruits. Looked delicious though, and the refills are free!  Our meal was a little pricey, but worth it. Very generous portions and delicious, fresh food. We were able to chat with the owner briefly and you could tell she was very passionate about what she does. She wasn't annoyed with all of my questions and substitution requests. The atmosphere is casual, but classy - no fast food ambiance here. I also really love the dishes they use!   I will definitely return to Chopped Leaf as it's close to my house and a lovely alternative to most quick service restaurants. I love the healthy options and the chili really hit the spot. The only negative was parking in that area can be tricky. Otherwise, I'm definitely a fan!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time and was not too impressed. My go-to is Freshii across the street, but thought I would try something new.   I ordered the Sunrise salad with chicken. You're essentially paying $13.50 for 1/2 an avocado and 4 ounces of chicken breast + greens. It just didnt feel justified for that cost.  Giving 3 stars because of the generous amount of avocado and the chicken breast was fresh and tasty - not that cubed stuff. Also the goddess dressing is really good."}
{"text":"Love it here! Really fun friendly staff, very tasty food you can feel good about. An average meal with protein is about $10-12. If you're vegan or vegetarian there are so many options as well! I've tried their soups, wraps, salads, salad rolls, and sandwiches - all amazing. My personal favorite is the whole bowl number 1 and the wild mushroom chowder. It does add up quickly at the till sometimes but totally worth it for a quick healthy lunch on the go."}
{"text":"Yum. Anytime I'm in the area I pop in here for an awesome healthy lunch. I have tried a few menu items and they're all amazing! Staff is always friendly and bring the food out with a smile. It feels a little expensive at the till but when you see how much you get (bowls are huge) and the quality of the protein and fresh veggies I say totally worth it. My faves: whole bowl 1 and whole bowl 3, chopped signature wrap, and their wild mushroom chowder is to die for!"}
{"text":"The staff and service deserves 4 stars but I can see why other people have mentioned 'The Subway of Salads' at other locations.  As good as the people are, the food tastes and offering doesn't let you feel satisfied.  Im always looking for healthy options when going out... if I can eat a wonderful salad, you bet I will order that first.  Chopped Leaf is brand new and the interior is quite nice.  It's quite open with lots of woods.  It's clean and has a nice big window in the front.  During the winter or cold seasons, the door opens and you get a big blast of cold air.  So you may want to see as far back as possible.  There's a decent amount of seating so you dont have to necessarily do take out.  Menu is easy to read and you can either choose one of the preset sandwiches, salads, or bowls OR you can customize.  I asked for the most flavourful and they recommended the bangkok bowl. I did ask for a swap as I dont like noodles in my salad.  Also got a soup and bbq chicken sandwich on sour dough.   Service here is pleasant, patient, and very quick.  I also liked how they politely asked during our meal if everything was good.  For a fast casual, service is great.    I have a great spot I go to for lunch that is a bit further west.  It's Porta Via with it's amazing vegetable selections, fresh cut meat offerings, and gourmet sandwiches.  That place is delicious... Chopped leaf feels quite boring and eating to survive instead of enjoying it.  Bangkok Salad - It is supposed to have romaine, peppers, beans, noodles, and peanuts.  I would say that this was 90% romaine lettuce that was dressed.  Very little of the salad was any variety other than boring romaine.  I saw maybe 5 pieces of beans and less than 10 pieces of peppers.  At my favourite place Porta Via, easily the salad is 25% the good stuff ... here, it's a big difference.  Even though it is fairly affordable at $9, it's $9 for just lettuce mostly.  At least the sauce made the lettuce more edible.  2/5  Thai Curry Soup - Bold and creamy... this was definitely the best options given and a generous portion.  I felt the heat of the soup.  Of the items, this was the most flavourful.  3.5/5  BBQ Chicken Salad - Im not sure where they get their sourdough but it did not taste like it.  It didnt even have the nice big holes that's classic of the bread.  It felt more like white bread with some chicken pieces.  It wasn't bad but nothing made this stand out for flavour.  It felt like eating the grilled chicken sub at Subway.  3/5  I know store is really pushing the whole 'custom' and 'hand made' spin but the flavours are lacking.  Though if you do come here, expect good and quick service.  They have that right."}
{"text":"Two different experiences so far here. The first one, I ordered the southwest salad and asked for no chips in the salad among some other minor customization. I got chips in the salad. Not a big deal as it wasn't an allergy or anything, but too late to go back and get it fixed since my order was to go. The staff also seemed a little uninterested at the time too.  The most recent visit everything was great here. The staff were awesome and they got everything right. My order also seemed to be made a little quicker too."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now as I work in the area a few days a week and I'm always looking for healthy options.  The atmosphere is a bit dark for a salad restaurant. I was expecting something a bit brighter. I just don't think the vibe fits. Although, it is still nice and I can see myself eating in with a colleague some time.    With regards to the food, I ordered the salad twice and haven't been overly impressed. They should include the protein and be more generous with the toppings for it to be filling.  On the other hand, the sandwiches are delicious and they're really good about swapping out the chicken for tofu.  I'd give this place a 3 1/2 if I could!"}
{"text":"Ive been working on  keeping my reviews short  and to the point with minimal narrative so fellow foodies can read   them faster and check out the same places  as well. so without further adieu The Chopped Leaf Just opened up  in the Heartland Town Center area. They serve  fresh food and sandwiches  . They have  salads such as bangkok, southwest,signature, pegasus, popeye.  I recommend  any of them. Service is good    with no complaints. My recommendation is to get he salad as a starter salad, light dressing, and  avoid having it as a wrap to avoid  extra carbs . Also order your salad minus the cheese to cut out the fat  The popeye is a nice wrap  to start of with and  comes with  apple, orange, spinach, pecans, cranberries.  It tastes refreshing  with the fruits and spinach providing a great medley of tastes. Next on the list is Bangkok,Pegasus, Sunshine for Salads , checking out the  salad rolls, stuffed cups and soups.  I was not too impressed with the sandwiches and quesadilla menu but i still recommend  trying it as you might like something on it .  Its good to have a health food outlet opening up"}
{"text":"This place has been under renovations for a while and I kept tabs on it when I went to the gym to see when it would be opened. I saw the opened light flashing today! So def had to give this place a try. I'm not entirely sure when the grand opening was though.   Walking inside.. sorta gave me a semi chic vibe based off the lights LOL. Few seats avail (more then then freshii nearby). This place is pretty similar to freshii in terms of the type of food they serve. I came on a Monday evening around 630 and there were a lot of employees working and wasn't that busy as it's new. The cash is at the end and I was introduced to the menu. I wanted to get their special which was the Thai rice bowl but I guess they ran out or something and it'll be offered tomorrow? Opted for the no.2 bowl which is a spinach salad with rice. If you wanted to add protein it's an extra $3 depending. I added chicken. My bowl was good, I would have prefer more sauce to the salad and then some for the rice cause it tasted kinda bland.   Service was great. When you order you get a number and they bring your meal to you. Got checked up on by another employee and asked if I needed anything else. They're on the ball! Will be coming back to try the Thai bowl that's here for a limited time!"}
{"text":"I love The Chopped Leaf in Beacon Hill.  This is go-to place for healthy eating, for sure!  I like Bowl no. 2 - it had the brown basmati rice with a nice nutty flavour, spinach salad with cranberries, walnuts and a very nice salad dressing.  I also added chicken.  I tasted Bowl no.3 - greek salad with chicken and brown basmati rice - also quite tasty.  On another occasion, I had the Mushroom soup and it was delicious!!  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I like The Chopped Leaf!  It's both wholesome and superb!  Tried: Whole Bowl No.2 with Chicken - it's got brown basmati rice with spinach, roasted pecans. chick peas, sundried cranberries, carrots, cucubers and tahli sauce - Very, very good; combines a fresh spinach salad with basmati rice and chicken with this tahli sauce.  Pesto Quesadilla - comes with chicken, peppers, pesto, cheddar in a warm tortilla - comes with salsa and ranch sauce.  So ooey and gooey and so good!  Love it with the sals and the ranch sauce.  I've never had quesadilla with ranch sauce ever!   Soup - Thai Curry Soup - Nice blend of flavours - curry, carrots, ginger - these are what I can taste.    Spicy Chicken Sandwich - chicken, chipotle aioli, mushrooms, onions, cheddar & romaine on toasted multgrain bread - Very good sandwich.    Prawn Salad Rolls - Very good and fresh - 1 order comes with 3 rolls  I would definitely like to try The Chopped Leaf again!"}
{"text":"THE CHOPPED LEAF here at Heartland recently opened. I'm glad there's a healthy food choice that's open from 9:00am-8:00pm.  It's good that it's right beside GOODLIFE FITNESS too.

Friendly staff and very customer focused ensuring that you are satisfied and happy with your order. I love greens and this is heaven for me. The greens and fruits are fresh and crisp. The quality is very good.  They have CHEF CRAFTED SALADS and WRAPS like Bangkok, Southwest, Caesar, Sunshine, Chopped Signature, Popeye and Pegasus.  They also have chef crafted bowls, quesadillas, sandwiches and soup.  They also have kids menu. A great way to encourage kids to eat fresh and healthy meals when dining outside.  They also serve coffee. THAI CURRY BOWL is a BEST SELLER. Price is around $9.50 + tax for a large bowl. The ambiance is classy. Lighting is soft and warm. They have FREE WIFI.  There is huge free parking space in front as it is located inside a plaza."}
{"text":"Glad to see a healthy eating option in the area. A lot of people are now eating healthy and we really needed a place that not only served healthy food but also tasty. Brad, the owner, was amazing. Very warm and courteous. Explained the entire menu in detail to me. Checked up on me twice. I tried a bowl but am looking forward to trying the rest of their menu. Nice ambience.  Smiling & attentive staff made the experience a pleasure. Highly recommended."}
