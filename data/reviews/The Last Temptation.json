{"text":"Sucked. Treated us like shit here."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and chill.    Until you hear the owner's wife yelling at her employees. How rude. I hope she learns some manners. It's a Saturday night and people are trying to eat in peace.   Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The Temp as it's called by regulars and locals is pure Kensington Market. The patio in the summer is a great place to stop for a cheap beer and casually run into friends on a Saturday shop.  I like it best in the winter though, when it's cold and the Temp is a warm, candle lit joint with bartenders that can carry a decent conversation.  Like most Kensington Market joints, the staff live in the market and hang out there as well.  The food is good for what it is, cheap. Pad Thai is okay, greasy breakfast, even better.  The service is up and down, but you don't go here for fine dinning or a quick meal. It's the charm baby, the charm that sucks you back in."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to hang out for food and drinks. I loved the menu as they have such a great variety. The staff were all wonderful and so helpful in suggesting new cocktails. The patio is great and inside is very chill. I highly recommend and definitely will be going back again in the future!"}
{"text":"Very rude servers. Sadly good venue but overrated.  Drinks are normal priced but better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that everyone needs to have in their back-pocket. Its conveniently located, and it feels like a more honest version of the pseudo-dive bars that dot Ossington. Its also usually mostly empty, meaning that arriving in a large group is very possible.   Its also versatile. I've ended up here in the following situations, and its gotten the job done: -First date and you don't want to seem like you're trying too hard. -Hanging out with a few friends and getting copiously drunk without judgement.  -Wanting to get a quick meal and drinks for the price of an average meal, or average drinks.   It's essentially Nirvana on College or Java on Queen, but minus the crowds that go to Nirvana on weekend nights, and the hipster-of-yesteryear attitude that tends to envelop Java."}
{"text":"I had a great sangria here with my friends. I like drinking outside. There is a space to drink at front of the bar. I felt relaxing a atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to this crummy den of rat turds on a blind date and needless to say it did not impress.  The music was fairly decent (David Bowie) and there was a candle on our table so I thought things might turn out better than they did.  Nope.  N.  O.  P.  E.  No sir.  I chose the location and felt like a total dipshit because she stuck up her nose at the dingy atmosphere and the sticky table.  My bad I guess.  We found it awkward to engage in small talk as an old creepy perv guy kept staring at my date from his seat by the wall. THEN later on, after she had put on a sweater to avoid his wandering eyes,  the creepy perv went behind the bar and yelled at the nice server. He was the owner or something!  I nearly shit my pants!  The beer made me barf.  My date thought I was stupid.  I wouldn't feed their peanut butter noodles to a suicidal racoon.  The servers were really great though and one of them ended up giving my date a lift home on his bike at the end of the night after  I got sick."}
{"text":"I had possibly the grossest food experience ever at The Last Temptation. I ordered the perogies (have had them before, usually good). I bit into one and it was frozen, no big deal. Ask the bartender to take them back and get me cooked ones. He asks if he can try one to see if they indeed are frozen, he tries one, it's more cooked, so he TRIES THE ONE I ALREADY BIT and decrees it to be frozen. He takes them away and then 3 minutes later gives me the exact same ones back, bite marks and all. No discount, no new perogies, pure disgusting."}
{"text":"Good cheap food, hot staff and cold beer- works for me!"}
{"text":"Wow.... yes... it is cheap beer and food. You get what you pay for.  Nacho's came with just cheese.... yeah... no salsa or anything. 3$ calameri anyone?  It was freezing in this place.... I asked for a hot water and lemon, she gave me the candle, she said it would last longer. I will not go back. In all fairness she did bring the water after."}
{"text":"Not bad...  Despite the fact that we got swarmed by bees while we were trying to eat lunch, my travel companion and I enjoyed a delicious lunch here. The menu has a little bit of everything and prices are v. reasonable.  We had the brie and roasted garlic with pita (gooey and delicious), the honey garlic chicken wings (sweet and crispy), the pierogies (soft and pillowy), and the kolbassa sandwich (buttery bread and salty sausage). We washed everything down with a white wine sangria. The sangria tasted more like orange juice than wine, but it was still refreshing.  The outdoor seating is super picturesque, but like I mentioned above, there were dozens of bees that gathered around our table and we freaked out and ended up having to sit indoors to finish our meal."}
{"text":"One of the cheap spots to go in t-dot ! 16$ pitcher of beer with cheap tasty eats !  We tried the brie and avocado sandwich and the pad thai , we were left satisfied and full !  Also sweet terrasse"}
{"text":"Has to be my favorite place in Toronto. The servers are awesome and so are the food and drinks. Not to mention the price! I think I've had everything on the menu and I have nothing to complain about. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Rye and Ginger. The Whiskey was 1/2 watered down. Waitress charged before making the drink, and tipped herself by taking the change without my consent."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, attentive service and ok decor. You'll like it if you like dive bars and indie rock or old school rock. I'm not a fan of the music, but I like the prices and im not put off by the shabby interior. I've always overlooked this place til last year and the ~$5.75 2oz cocktails are delicious! I recommend the orange pekoe blueberry tea with grandmarnier and amaretto"}
{"text":"To get the \"vibe\" of Kensington Market locals eating out, come here.  A great place for conversation, yummy food and brewski's (beer).    Yummy = The shrimp Pad Thai for about $8, makes for a medium dinner.  No refined taste-bud discoveries here, but more fuel for a student appetite.  The owners often hang out there and generally people know each other.  People talk between tables.  Crazy people come around sometimes.  Famous people come here too, but not for the food I don't think but because it's actually cool.  The locals forget that it's cool, they're just bored, tired or stoned.  Actually that's not true either.  This is a place where the music and conversations still allow pen-and-paper work and reading... as well as picking up turkeys."}
{"text":"Just came for drinks and they are cheap which is most of the appeal but me and my boyfriend split a pitcher of sangria and it was so watered down! We had like 4 glasses each and felt nothing (and I have a pretty low tolerance). Also, the waiter was taking smoking breaks outside on the front patio in front of the customers which was unsettling."}
{"text":"Bi√®res pas chers et super patio en plein Kensington, j'adore!  Cheap beers and awesome patio in the middle of Kensington, just love it!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place if your plans are to drink cheap beer. If you plan to eat anything, you may want to consider somewhere else. I have tried the food here a few times and each and everytime has been a disappointment. The avocado brie sandwich was way too salty... plus, I can't trust the food here anymore since my nickname for this place is The Last Toothtation... and you do not want to know why. Or maybe you do, since you're probably planning on going here which is why you are reading this review. Let's just say it involves a hamburger and a tooth. But I don't want to think about that right now. Let's just focus on how great this place is for it's beer!! Except when the ATM doesn't work."}
{"text":"I love this place whole heartedly.. the interior is alright but not the greatest. This is one of the first places i ever had a drink in when I turned 19. I still stop in here sometimes when im in the k market. Definitley try the spring rolls with the peanut sauce.. really delicous.. best thing on the menu IMO.. really affordable as well. Great music, great staff."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and each time the service was warm and friendly without being overbearing, and the food's pretty good and the beer's better. The last time I was there was New Year's Day. We were with a friend on crutches who'd been struggling through the snow. They saw us waiting and let us in early so that we could make our friend comfortable. We were there several hours playing cards and just visiting, and I felt very welcome and comfortable. I am not in Toronto that often, but when I am I am sure I'll enjoy another visit to The Last Temptation."}
{"text":"A Kensington Market institution.  The Last Temptation has a great patio in the summer and is super cozy when it's cold outside. Oozes with character just like the surrounding market and the clientele that visit regularily.  The food ain't nothing to write home about but at least you get what you pay for and that's a good thing if you're scraping by as a student or starving artist or just generally broke. Drinks are cheap too. Bonus."}
{"text":"Eating here was a truly awful experience. My girlfriend and I walked into this restaurant and waited ten minutes before going up to the bartender and asking whether we should seat ourselves. The bartender who could barely spoke English told us to seat ourselves as if we should have known this.   We sit down at a table that was sticky and dirty and don't get a waitress to come over for almost ten minutes. When the waitress came over, she simply said \"What do you want?\" In broken English. We asked that she please clean the table so she walks away before taking our order and returns 5 minutes later.  After taking our order, our food did not come out at the same time so mu girlfriend ate alone for 5 minutes or so before my food came out. My girlfriend's food was a soupy, disgusting paella and mine was a terrible fish sandwich that had a blob of mayo that wasn't spread.  Overall, we had a terrible experience in terms of service, cleanliness, and food quality and will not be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"this place is spacious and can fit big groups. also has table soccer and a cozy patio up front.   the menu has a good variety of choices for both veg'ns and non veg'ns.  however I found the food to be a bit bland... I had market stir fry (veg) and my friend had cajun ckicken. the prices are low but again it felt like there wasn't enough spices or salt in general.  the variety of beer and other drinks is huge too.  not a bad place esp for the summer as the patio seems nice but wouldn't come here for food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars I say!  This is exactly what I picture when I think \"Kensington establishment\". Cheap and pleasant, and in my mind it's a far better version of The Red Room. Service was not the quickest but it was definitely friendly, it is very run down looking but not in a bad way? (at least it did the night I went with it's very low lighting). The washroom was surprisingly cleaner than I expected, but then again I did have low expectations.   I ordered myself some french onion soup and a spicy chicken dish, and that is why this review is not a 4 star one. Both were below par, the \"spicy\" chicken was not spicy at all (yes I realise I'm Sri Lankan and spicy does not hold the same meaning to me as it does to most people here). But I was too hungry to really care.   However there's a great atmosphere, cheap drinks and friendly staff and I would not hesitate to visit again, and would like to check it out in the light of day as well."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, cheap drinks and a nice patio. What else do you need for summer??  I got a pitcher ($16) and their omelette of the day which had spinach, mushrooms and feta cheese. It was delicious and came with home fries on the side. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Petit bar plac√© dans Kengsington Market, cela met d√©ja une id√©e sur l'ambiance du bar, et on est servi, l'ambiance est bien sympa! Le bar est en longueur mais on ne se sent pas serr√© entre les places! Il y a une salle arri√®re ou des jeunes talents peuvent monter sur sc√®ne, ce qui donne une vrai ambiance cosy!  les tarifs sont tr√®s raisonnables!"}
{"text":"This, this is a place I will return to on a semi-regular basis!! The place has everything I want in a place to drink. Cozy settings, cheap (CHEAP) alcohol, small crowds, friendly and low key staff, and pretty boys! The place was eclectic in a \"not trying\" sort of way that really appealed to me. I must admit though, the one barman had this annoying obsession with the candles on the tables in the back room. After large amounts of rye and ginger, I thought it was funny to blow out the candles, just to watch the barman scuttle back to light them, only to have my blow them out again. I left a big tip though, so I could feel better about it! I love this place!"}
{"text":"~ could have made the same burger at home ~ typical yucky bar food ~ fries portion was small and they were really potato wedges"}
{"text":"Ahh..I'm still intoxicated when I write this. TLT is a classic Kensington dive bar, filled with lively locals and friendly staff.  Drinks are affordable! I had a blueberry tea (not blue, no blueberries) with Amaretto and Orange pekoe-it was ok. Followed by an unknown shot (I think whiskey and coke?) courteousy of Evelyn our lovely Yelp CM!! The patio was great, very laid back. Inside is nice too...just a little humid on one of our last summer days."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after work with a couple of friends for a quick and cheap dinner.  We ordered a ton of food and everything was just ok.  I ordered the 'hot' chicken wings along with a side of sweet potato fries.  The wings were only 'meh'...the wing sauce was way too sweet, more BBQ than hot sauce and since I like my wings hot, I was a bit disappointed.  The sweet potato fries were also average, though the flavour of the fries clearly indicated that their fryer grease was VERY clean...so that's always a plus.    My friends ordered a few other items, the spring roll, a pad thai, the honey garlic wings, deep fried tofu, nachos and their pizza.  I only tried the spring roll and the deep fried tofu and again, nothing to write home about.  I should mention that the service was mediocre at best.  Mediocre food + mediocre service + cheap prices = 3 stars"}
{"text":"The decor is a bit of mish-mash, and the food lacks ANY sort of the culinary aesthetic people have started to expect in Toronto restaurants. I mean, both the nachos and the burger looked EXACTLY like something I could (and have) made at home.  But, you know what? I make GREAT nachos and grill an EXCELLENT burger at home. So how could I complain about these ones? And looks/presentation aside, there was certainly no lack of quality for either item. The nachos were a decent size and not at all hurting for cheese,  the burger tasted great, and even the fries (something I couldn't make at home) were thick and tasty. I got a bit of a diner feel from everything, but with a fraction of the grease you'd usually see.  So maybe you're thinking, \"Great. But why would I pay restaurant prices for something I could get at home?\"  Yeah, no. This MAY be the last bastion of sane restaurant prices in Toronto. I'm not kidding when I say the meals were half, nearly a third, of what I actually expected to pay. And even a pitcher (of any of their very respectable selection) of beers for $14.50 isn't bad. Yes, they were on a nightly special, but even their menu prices surprised me.  I love both of those \"mish-mashed\" ambiances I mentioned earlier, so what's wrong with seeing them both in one space? It was the funky, string-light, randomly decorated front that drew me in, and the surprisingly stylish, conventionally decorated rear of the restaurant where I ended up sitting.  They even had some kind-of-hilarious, conversation-creating art hung up back there.  All in all, if you're looking for a polished dining experience, maybe don't go here. If you're looking for a pretty great ambiance, some respectable food, and to re-live the nostalgia of mid-90s food prices, this is probably a must-see..."}
{"text":"I came to the Last Temptation for my birthday this year. It was a lot of fun. Most staff would roll their eyes at a large party, but they helped us get a table together, brought food & drinks out in a timely matter, & were really attentive to all new arrivals to the table (people were coming in and out). Seriously, most places would not be cool with this, but they were really relaxed & yet attentive.  Get the sangria & get the pad thai & drink, smoke and eat to your hearts content.   It gets five stars, because it is the best out of all of its peers. Usually if these places seem clean enough to eat, the service is really bad (nirvana, redroom). If the service is good, usually I'd die before I ate there (green room). Compared to  these types of places, the last temptation really is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Great patio! The food was good and prices were even better! Servers were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Decent food, cheap prices and a great place to hang out every Sunday after a few games of kickball.  The staff is welcoming, and you get a lot for your money. They also make good Pad Thai, and I'm picky about my Pad Thai. You can't ask for much more.   I also love the mural on the back wall."}
{"text":"this place is pretty but it was creepy because it was empty. Drinks are cheap but the food is really bad the fries were rotten and couldnt eat them. Also the person who served us was really rude and told us to never come back ! creppy"}
{"text":"I went here after work one saturday night.  The one thing that was clear from all that I heard about this place was it was cheap with a chill vibe.  I am proud to say that after experiencing just one evening there, it completely lives up to the buzz.    Everything was inexpensive. I ordered a Woo Woo cocktail and paid $4 bucks for it.  I remember it having peach schnapps and vodka.  Very easy on the palette. If you don`t like sweet drinks just look at the drinks special board and pick something else to your liking.  The food prices are absolutely ridiculous! Burgers cost 3.95, my friend.  Order it even if you aren`t hungry!  Now, I`ll have to admit that none of us were blown away by the food.  I wasn`t expecting much for the price I was paying.    It`s a great place to go with folks that just want to hang out without any snootiness.  On top of all those wonderful things, the staff are friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Right off the bat - I haven't had much food from here and am ranking this solely as a patio/dive bar experience.  This place has a decent sized patio in Kensington Market. The inside is dive bar-y opens onto the patio so you still get some fresh air coming in. Beer and food prices are cheap -- a pitcher is $17 and you can get a snack for $5-$6. Last time I came here, we tried the veggie spring rolls and they were decent.   There is not a huge beer selection here. The service is friendly but hit and miss on being attentive. I definitely wouldn't come here looking for a gourmet meal or fancy beer -- but I'd suggest this if you want to nibble on something and get some cheap drinks."}
{"text":"It's cheap, but disappointing. Prices are low, but so is the quantity and quality of the food.  There are far superior options in Kensington Market and China Town for the same price.  The service, despite being friendly, can be slow and distracted.  Good for a cheap drink, especially if you have a decent sized group or you want to sit on the patio. For food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very central location, kind of nice staff, may be a good option for a chill out beer experience although terrible food (like, terrible).  I ordered hot chicken wings and I ended up getting undercooked, nothing but crispy, dipped in a ketchup-like red sauce weird things. My friend ordered a crepe and the thing they brought was anything but a crepe. The dough reminded me of a tortilla, of course not fresh, with some huge portion of sour cream on top.   The patio might accommodate large groups for drinks. You have zillions of cheap and delicious food options around, so do not waste your time here.   Last but not least; the service is beyond slow even though the restaurant isn't full capacity -due to some connection problems etc. they aren't able to make you pay at the table, so you have to go to the bar-   Toilets; not clean."}
{"text":"Love the food here! I come here once and a while, I always order the breakfast food + tom yum soup and it's great every time. Service was good. All in all, will come back again!"}
{"text":"Ah... another cheap place in Toronto which is generally raved about by all my friends. And this is better than the last (cheap) place that I reviewed, and once again it really came down to the service. Unlike the Java House, the service here was of alright friendliness, no one forgot about us, and we didn't have to see a waitress cry.   The atmosphere was what you expect from a dive restaurant. Dark and dingy, and that kind of atmosphere that borders on making you worry that you might get an infection if you ever cut yourself. But despite my jokes I get why people enjoy it. It's relaxed and accessible.   My friends and I all had bacon cheeseburgers and wine (a most classy combination) because with our student budgets, the 6.50$ (or something like that) was a great deal. To be honest, we were all pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meat and veggies in our burger. The fries weren't too bad either!  I look forward to visiting here again once this city defrosts."}
{"text":"I discovered this place when looking for something to do on Christmas night in Chinatown. Its a great patio location in the heart of Kensington Market.  Right next to bubble blowing machine the hubub of people shopping  outdoors and all the trees and colourful garments  on the street make this a very nice location.   Friendly  staff. Inexpensive good eats and a few decent local  beers on taps. The sangria is also really good !!!"}
{"text":"Really cheap food and friendly staff. The sangria is pretty good and they have nce beers as well. Pretty good bar food. Espically for the price. More of an alternative vibe.  Rhe have  foozeball table rhat you can use for free"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with cheap drinks and cheap food. If you're picky with atmosphere and, dare I say, cleanliness, go at night, avoid the washroom, and stay out at the front or patio area. Despite that my friend's and I like this place. It's a cozy little recluse from the city, especially at night, when the patio lights are all lit up.  Best valued pitchers and pints I believe. The food isn't spectacular, but it's decent and cheap. Go for the burger and fries combo, a regular special and favorite. So is the pad thai, but I've never tried it though.."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the inexpensive food and drinks and the chill and down to earth atmosphere. One thing that sets this place apart from other joints in Kensington is the service and relative cleanliness. Broaden your horizons beyond beer here, as they make a mean sangria."}
{"text":"Very very underrated burger and fries cut and made in house. Trevor, my host, was most excellent. Ask him about lost breakfast cereals of the 80s."}
{"text":"- Two Jagger bombs and a single shot of Jagger... $18 - Two shots of Malibu... $6 - Amazing Pad Thai...$8 - Foozeball... Free - A/C... Broken! - Ending every Sunday night kickball game with a pint surrounded by a crew of amazing rowdy 20-30 something hispsters... PRICELESS!"}
{"text":"I went to the Last Temptation for the first time a couple months ago, and have been a handful of times since. As the other reviews said, it's definitely a really cool, chill place to grab a few drinks and ridiculously cheap (I mean SO cheap!) food. I've seen the same bartender everytime I've been, and it's pretty clear that it's full of regulars and everyone kind of knows each other. That all makes for a very cool vibe, and it makes me kinda want to be one of those regulars, haha!   With cheap drinks and like I said, very inexpensive food, it's a place that I can afford to go to even on my pathetic student budget. The patio is large and the inside is pretty cozy. And the staff are friendly but not overly so. So if you're in the market, definitely be sure to check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great bar to sit outside and soak in Kensington Market. Decent pints.we didn't get the food so I can't comment on it, but great atmosphere and brews."}
{"text":"Very chill environment with some foosball. Need to come back on a busy night to get a better feel of the crowd and food."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious food & a very cozy spring atmosphere. Great lunch spot or stop for drinks!"}
{"text":"This place was super cheep.. a meal starts at something like $6. And the drinks were really affordable. I had the omelette special with salad for $7.5. The food quality was pretty good for the price. The patio was nice and shaded. The service was super slow but I think the were understaffed just for today because it was surprisingly hot out."}
{"text":"This dive spot let's me sit with my dog ON the patio, not tied up outside it, which is really nice in the summer. I know this is illegal, but all the locals seem to really appreciate it.   Booze is cheap (especially pitchers) and they serve until 2 nightly.   Food is cheap (right cheap!) and is decent. I usually go for the brie and avocado sandwich on a croissant, or the tom yum soup. Others I've been with have really enjoyed the pad thai or the all day breakfast.  Movember Game: This month, try to tell the Mo Bros from the hipsters. Dare ya!  PS: I started this review as a 3/4, and after reflecting on the amazing people watching one can do from this patio/window seat, I upped it. Can't beat being drunk in the afternoon and making up peoples stories."}
{"text":"The pasta sauce was tasteless, pad Thai was okay.   However the service wasn't the best. They did forget the sangria we ordered and the whole time we were there no body brought a cup of water."}
