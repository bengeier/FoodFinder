{"text":"Shisha is on point, the atmosphere is relaxed and laid back vibes, tv always has a mix of sports or music videos on, food is delicious and bountiful, tea hits the spot every time with their quality mint leaves, ask for Siyam or Qais or Elyas to make you a head...recommend the kiwi mint or hot pot mix. Price is $12 for quality shisha that's not prepared hastily or poorly and its consistently done well thanks to hard working staff and family ownership."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, this unassuming little place has the best biryani I've had so far in this city. You will wait a little while for it but that means the food is real.  Funny I first stumbled into it a year ago thinking it was a chinese hot pot place due to the name. Ah who cares, it's great."}
{"text":"Awesome food! love the kebabs and steaks. your taste bud never lies! Best restaurant for take away food in Toronto. I always recommend this place to my friends and family who loves east Indian style food."}
{"text":"Today was a first visit and I was very happy with the food, service, space.  Laid back place.  My lunch plate was $7.50, yet large and generously endowed.  It has a delicious salad (nice lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, fresh parsley), some chicken shwarma, and some tasty Afghan rice and potatoes.  All were yummy.  Garlickly, which suits me.  There was a table that was big enough to get a bit of work done as well.  I could do without the TV, but it wasn't on very loudly."}
