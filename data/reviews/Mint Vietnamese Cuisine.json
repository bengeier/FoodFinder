{"text":"I'm pretty excited about this new place opening up in the neighborhood. I got the shrimp vermecelli bowl and found the ingredients quite fresh and tasty. The noodles were not clummped together as you might  find at other places a the savory fish sauce was more thn abundant. Cant wait to go here again."}
{"text":"I saw the \"now open\" sign one day so I decided to check it out for lunch.  Service was super slow and the venue was small... a couple people after me that asked for chicken were told they ran out and had to pick a different meat. If that was me I would have been super disappointed...  When I got my meal, I was expecting chunks of chicken but they were tiny pieces on skewers.. it didn't say that on the menu so I was a bit underwhelmed.   Flavour was ok, but they didn't give you any to go hot sauce so I had to go buy some sriracha after the first few bites... it was lacking and needed spice.   Probably won't be a frequent here."}
{"text":"My weekly dip of indulgence. Service is amazing. The young guy is amazing! They are lucky to have him! I ordered the beef sub and veggie spring rolls each time. Always very fresh and fast."}
{"text":"I found this because of the previous good reviews, and did not disappoint!  I got the beef pho and spring rolls and it was amazing.   I was a little scared by the \"beef balls\" until I actually tried one, they were delicious.   I wish we had a place like this back in Ontario."}
