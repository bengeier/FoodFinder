{"text":"This is a great takeout option when you don't want fast food but don't want to go through the whole sit-down restaurant routine. The interior is clean, stylish, and simple (didn't feel weird about eating here in workout gear), and the staff are super nice and friendly.  Another great bonus is that it's easy to walk in with a stroller.  I've eaten here 3 times now and every single time has been delicious with very generous portions.  The salads are great and a reasonable add on to an entree for $2.50.  The food tastes wholesome and is full of flavour.  Absolutely LOVE the Chester Burger: no ketchup needed on this guy!  My only lament is they don't have a deep fryer.  Would love to get some fries on the side of my burger!  Very excited to see what will be on the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out and it was excellent! Great quality, great flavour...simply a great meal! I recommend the sweet potato burger and fruit crumble."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a coffee and small bite while exploring the Junction neighborhood. Exceedingly friendly service in a great, clean atmosphere. Very nice setup and excellent prices. We took our time with the paper and weren't rushed at all. WiFi."}
{"text":"Mind blasted. Take it and splatter it everywhere because that's how delicious it was to eat the jerk chicken here. My god it was delicious! I will be back. See you soon Humble Bumble!  The decor is beautiful , such an elegant place and the staff and chef are so friendly!  Will be happy to be back soon with friends."}
{"text":"This is a review of Humble Beginnings as a caterer. My wife and I lived in the Junction for a while and noticed when these folks opened shop. When it came time to find a caterer for our wedding we called them up to ask about what could be done. We wanted a local-oriented, creative, summer wedding on a budget. I have to say that Elisa and her team stood out from the rest of the caterers we spoke to - she took on our ideas of a rustic family bbq on an \"economic\" dime and infused creativity in the menu, cost cutting tips and brought refined and interesting cooking to the table. Other caterers didnt even call us back when we told them our budget - the folks at Humble took it as a challenge and came up with lots of ideas that could work for us. So about the food then...  Apps were savoury two bite empanadas - 3 kinds and mini grill cheese (think brie and crostini) with chilled gazpacho soup shooters.   The main included flank steak Argentina style with Chimichurri sauce, cajun rubbed turkey breast served with peach-mango chutney,  and curried roasted eggplant with yogurt and figs for the vegetarians.   Dessert was an assortment of fresh fruit pies in place of the traditional cake.   Aside from the food being excellent, fresh, local where possible, and exciting, the service was great too - Elisa helped out with a lot of the planning so we didnt have to worry about many details, which was a load off on a crazy day where you have other things to worry about!   Definitely recommended as a caterer for any kind of event I can imagine! You'd be hard pressed to find better value in the city."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading all the nice things about their quality ingredients. We decided to try them for a take out dinner and found very few selections and a complicated ordering menu. I tried a chicken main with chickpea side and was disappointed all around. The food wasn't even warm when we got it, the chickpeas were very undercooked to the point where I decided not to eat it at all. It's basically like eating at the Whole Foods buffet, only there are a lot less choices and somehow it seems more overpriced for what you get. I guess this place might be okay for a lunch on the run, but for me I don't think i'll be returning."}
{"text":"We were catered for lunch and the food was a terrible experience. It was bland, small-portioned and over-priced. I rarely complain about portion too, but this unjust and unfair. My entire work team agrees at the blandness. Presentation isn't a big deal either, but this food didn't even look appetizing (which i guess is representative of how it tastes). We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The fancy decor doesn't quite match the 'quality home cooked food' vibe of this place. They need some rustic wooden tables. It sounds silly but this had put us off going in... Until we did go in and found that the food was great and reasonably priced, and the fancy chairs were really comfortable! My bf had jerk pork hash and it was gorgeous - proper cooking, not just assembling. I'd overindulged that week and just had a Caesar salad, which was very nice. Well dressed using quality olive oil and slivers of parmesan. Was still jealous of his jerk pork though. Really tempted by the fish taco Fridays sign out front. That sounds like I'm going to eat the sign..."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food, really nice environment, friendly service, reasonably priced. Must try the baked goods. They also have live music on Friday night and Saturday afternoons, featuring local Toronto talent."}
{"text":"Like a home cooked meal at reasonable prices.  Great take out too.   Friendly, warm service.  They have live music on the weekends.  :-)"}
{"text":"So glad I finally got a chance to eat here. Very cute little veggie friendly cafe in the Junction. Great service and delicious food! I'm sure I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Wow, you gotta eat here. We have ate here a few times and never been disappointed. This is a great local restaurant offering fresh and delicious vegan options as well as vegetarian and meat lovers entrees. They are reasonably priced and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"I meant to photograph my teriyaki salmon and farmer's market salad (mixed greens with potatoes, olives and tomatoes) but I opened up my compostable take out container and it looked so yummy I just dove in.  As someone who dislikes cooking, its tricky to balance the ease of take out with the quality of nourishment.  I was excited to see Humble Beginnings slowly arrive to the Junction -- gourmet healthy dinners for sitting in or take away? I crossed my fingers for something tasty and affordable.   The selection of mains all sounded delicious, with fish, chicken and more than one veggie option. I was in the mood for ease tonight, and wanted to make as few choices as possible. No problem. Choose a main, choose a side (they all looked great, lots of variety). I can't list all the things I saw in this review because I really just wanted to come home and have dinner, hence the take out. But I do remember a lentil salad with feta that I considered for a moment before taking the chefs recommendation of the farmer's market salad.   The salmon was cooked medium, beautifully. It was so tasty. And the portion was perfect -- filling, but not overwhelming.   The price was reasonable, around 11 - 14 or so, depending on the main you choose. I have easily spent that on delivery, with food that is much less lovely for my body.   There was no one there when I went in, and the staff of two were both very friendly and helpful. The chef greeted me right away and invited me to ask questions. I get the feeling they are quite proud of what they offer, and if my first meal was any indication, they have every right to be.   Expectations met! I will certainly be back.  P.S. that last star is  really about the decor.  It's nice, it's clean, it's fine.  But somehow it doesn't feel cozy...and it just isn't inviting to me.  I don't ever think about eating there, and it's purely because for me personally, I feel a disconnect between the food and the space.  The entire place is the colour of a latte."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and never blown away by the food. Meals are quite pricey  and nothing really that special.   Most recently, I got take out of salad. The Kale and Kasha Salad - $10.99 + tax. There was only 3 leaves of baby kale in it, and the rest kasha. the portion was good, but not worth $12.   I got the junction casear salad, it was really nothing special to me, and I regret the $12 price tag. It's served with just croutons, and a garlicky dressing. Could have added some cheese."}
{"text":"Charming little restaurant, specializing in fresh, local food. I had the steak with chimichurri sauce and one of the best Caesar salads I've had in Toronto - light, yet subtlety garlicky. A refreshing peach sangria and peach crisp at the end highlighted current seasonal fruit. My companion's Cajun tilapia was likewise delicious.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The live music in the afternoon was also a highlight."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place by accident and we're super happy we did.  The service is awesome and the food was super fresh, and really flavourful with reasonable prices.  Lots of gluten free options.  Will definitely  be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try it since it was new in the hood, but was extremely disappointed. My wife had the flank steak, which was missing seasoning. It was like eating a plain jane piece of beef. Not tantalizing at all. Had the veggie lasagna, and was not impressed. The cheese was there, but where's the sauce? Needed salt too. Was looking for a flavorful meal, alas it was definitely not waiting fit me here :P"}
{"text":"This place has great potential, their passion for good quality ingredients and home-cooked style means you feel great about everything you eat!  We had their burger and flank steak flat bread, both were fantastic - it some garlicy aioli in it that was awesome! It seemed a bit cheap and complicated to not include any sides with dishes, but I'm hoping they correct that as time goes on.  We'll definitely be going back for lunch again."}
