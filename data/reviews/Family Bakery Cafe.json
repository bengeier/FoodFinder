{"text":"Its good I really like their bread and bureks. Sometimes the pastries aren't so fresh though.."}
{"text":"Nor much selection but their burkes are good. They have a mini patio too which is nice."}
{"text":"We live practically next door to this little Jem. We frequent this bakery for one reason only...the delicious fresh made and always warm Burek.  I know they have other gorgeous and delicious treats but we enjoy getting a slice of burek for a different breakfast or brunch and we mix up a salad to go with .  It's perfect, fresh made and it warm up our hearts!"}
{"text":"Not much selection for such a big place, they just opened so maybe they are still deciding on their goods. Would love to see more types of breads. Also an early opening on Saturdays would be great so that we can use them for breakfast run. Overall prices were fair and the stuff that they did have was good. I'll be back later and will add to review then."}
{"text":"This part of the east end is a bit of a void when it comes to coffee and pastries.   A few places, ranging from bad to adequate, have come and gone in the last 15 years.

There is hope!

Family Bakery Cafe opened this week.  A new Serbian Bakery and coffee shop at the corner of Woodbine/Lumsden (where it turns into Mortimer).   Terrific strudels, rye bread, challah, bureks (including a case of frozen ones to take home to prepare) muffins and more.   Apparently the coffee is tasty but strong for some Canadian taste buds.  Sort of along the line of Greek and Turkish coffee.  Several Stash teas are available.  No black tea today.  I think business the first week might have been a bit better than they'd expected. 

The bakers come in at 2 a.m. to start the breads so when you go in for your morning coffee/pastry it is FRESH.  A small rye bread is $2, the challah is $3.  One-quarter of a spiced beef burek to share was $4.50.  It was way more than 2 of us could have finished alone if we hadn't had 2 dogs with us.  Clean.  Tables and chairs inside and a few tables and chairs outside on the Woodbine side.  A bit noisy out there but way better than NO options to have tea/coffee outside with the dogs.

Wonderful service.  The owners are very enthusiastic and helpful.

On the excuse of taking photos, I'll be back in again tomorrow for another cheese croissant.  

Oh, the cheese croissant.  Perfect layers and layers of dough with a light smattering of something that tasted like an extraordinarily fresh feta.  I need to learn more about that cheese.   That croissant was perfect."}
