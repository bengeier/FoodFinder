{"text":"This place is FANtastic.  Very delicious.  Hidden gem.  The quality and flavours come through especially for a foodie like me.  I brought my co-worker today and we both think it is something to behold. A taco, a wrap, and a panini plus two chocolate mousse.  Terrific spot.  A must try.  Worth it.  You won't leave hungry But You will leave with a craving for more."}
{"text":"Five stars because I can't put 6 stars! Im from France and that's even better than the tacos we can get in France! So consider yourself lucky Toronto!"}
{"text":"I am so glad finally find a place where i feel home!!!! 
The food is fresh and de-li-cious!!!! The owner is awesome!!! And the crème brûlée.....Omg (you have to try) !!!!"}
{"text":"The one time I went to France (on a stopover), I ate Chinese, so I had no idea what to expect from French street food. I've had plenty of time to speculate since I passed Mister Frenchy's \"Coming Soon!\" on my way to work every day. It was well worth the wait!

I tried Le Lyonnais in their first week and when it arrived, I completely understood the $10 taco because the portion sizes are massive. It was stuffed full of ground beef, sweet peppers, and fries. The meat was fresh and the Algerian sauce adds a burst of flavour that still makes my mouth water. I've tried a few items on the menu (L'Oriental, Le Parisien, Simple Croque-Monsieur) and so far, I've been very impressed.

The side(s) are no slouch either! The fries seasoned, so there's no need for ketchup, but I'd highly recommend the dipping sauce. The curry-based sauce is probably my personal favourite, but I've yet to try one that I haven't liked and I could live on their profiteroles. 

The customer service is fantastic. Their staff are friendly, solicitous, and eager to tell you all about French street food. The only downside is that they take a while because food is made-to-order, but the owners were so solicitous that I can't really complain. I'd encourage you to call in ahead of time if you're in a rush, but it's not a bad place to wait: there's plenty of seating, the restaurant's décor is awesome, and it's clean.

I'm still working my way through the menu, but so far, Mister Frenchy has really set itself apart. Fantastic addition to the Danforth and to Toronto! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. Great service also makes this a must-visit place on the Danforth"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night and it wasn't busy.

Pros:
- Decently priced
- Excellent customer service
- Food tastes good
- Seating area
- Great creme Brulee 

Cons:
- Food took about 12 minutes to be ready BUT I'm not taking any stars off because they make everything from scratch and it tasted fresh. When we go fries they LITERALLY took a raw potato, peeled it and put it in the fryer to make us French fries."}
{"text":"Was fortunate enough to first find Mister Frenchy during its soft opening. The menu and the process of preparation as well as the genesis of the establishment were explained to me in detail as I ate an extremely wonderful meal. I have returned alone and with my wife on a handful of occasions and we are working our way through their menu. Everything to date has been fantastic. There is no need to name the meals I have eaten as they are all superb. I cannot wait to try every single item and then start again. Kudos to all the wonderful sauces which are all homemade. The crème brulé is a must have and also made fresh in house. Heated old school with a blow torch. The baguettes are sourced from Montreal and always fresh and delicious. I can go on and on but just go and see for yourselves!!"}
{"text":"This is a wake up call for the taste buds. You walk in to a very clean, very well-run, casual style dining area. The employees are knowledgeable and friendly.
I went and tried a French taco: Le Lyonnais. It has ground beef, spices, fries, and a delicious, slightly piquant cheese sauce. Its so good that I had to come back a few days later. This time I tried the panini pressed baguette: Le Mediterranean. It has ground beef, spices, onions, and fries in a baguette. Its so good I can't decide which I like better! All I know is this may be a new (at least weekly) dining spot. 
Prices are reasonable for what you get. Around 15 dollars for a good, filling meal. Next up is the Lyonnais Pizza Boisee. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've worked in a lot of good and bona fide French restaurants. This isn't one of them. Ordered the Crogue Monsieur combo and all we got was a sandwich with bologne for ham, paid extra for extra cheese and received a skin of it in the outside. The bread was sandwich bread and mushy. Terrible. The 3 mozzarella sticks were cold and uncooked inside. The coleslaw was a lot of commercial mayo on cabbage/carrots. The creme brullee was runny and separated. The fries were half dregs and soggy; no crisp, just limp oily potatoes. Terrible $40 meal. Poor ingredients poorly prepared."}
{"text":"first impression clean and friendly environment. I had a groupon and asked the cashier for any recommendations. Since it was my first time they suggested taco #1 Lyonnais. I also got the Veggie Baguette to go. Although it took maybe 35 minutes to get my food, a look around the restaurant showed ppl were not surprised, anxious or angry. Patiently waited and when my taco came...well it was actually worth it! There was 1 cook and 1 cashier who would help the cook  and they were moving around trying their best to get the food out. I would normally get upset with such a long wait, but for the quality and hard work you could see from the 2 gentlemen, you really couldnt be upset. The Sauce was phenomenal, the fries are awesome! You know a place is legit, when even the veggie option is tasty. Great compliment to the Danforth. will definitely be back, but may bring a snack while I wait :)"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! If you haven't checked out Mister Frenchy what are you waiting for? Went in here for lunch and was happy to see they have vegetarian options. I got their Vegi French Taco with fries and my taste buds couldn't be happier. Their Algerian sauce was amazing and went well with the fries. The staff was very helpful and service was fast and on point. Will definitely make this place a regular one on my list!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and deserts. Food is authentic and made well with fresh ingredients and delicious seasoning. Loved the \"French Taco\" with ground beef croque monsieur . Creme brulee is great too. Friendly staff & clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our second time getting food from this restaurant. We got french tacos and the food was very good this time like the first time we went. 
The reason for the 3 star review was the rude service that we received. The first time we went was right after opening and the owner was very friendly and made us want to come back. 
Today we were served by a young man who made it very clear he did not enjoy his job. It was a little surprising because I think we were his first customers of the day, yet he already seemed tired of dealing with people. There were several eye rolls and gruff responses thrown our way. 
We ordered the kids meal for our 3 year old daughter which is listed as coming with yogurt and a small drink. We knew it was going to be a little  wait before our food was ready so my wife asked if we could come back to pick up and he sneered at us and said \"of course\" in a tone implying that we were stupid for asking. 
When we picked up our order I looked inside the bag and then asked about the yogurt. He simply pointed at the fridge and said \"there is no yogurt, what do you want me to do? Make yogurt just for you?\". He didn't say anything about it until I asked and also didn't offer any alternative. I feel bad for the owner as his staff is driving away what could have been a repeat customer.

Edit: I was contacted by the owner 5 minutes after posting my review and he informed me that the individual in question has been let go as my complaint was not the first he had received. I feel bad having contributed to someone losing their job but as a new business in a competitive neighborhood I understand the decision. Thank you very much for your quick response and offer of free meal."}
{"text":"my new go to place! excellent variety and super friendly staff. a wonderful addition to greektown. my favorites are le lyonnais and croque monsieur!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nicely located on the Danforth, in a good pedestrian-friendly area and in a decently sized space. The decor isn't as nice as it looks on the photos, but it's pretty clean and the straight outta France mural adds a fun touch. It might be fun if they played some French pop music or something during the day because besides the menu it wasn't anything that seemed French. 

I had the number 13 (Cordon Bleu: Fried chicken breast stuffed with cheese and smoked turkey, ham, tomatoes, onions, pepper sauce and French fries.) which was a little on the dry side, and also came wrapped in something that was not a tortilla - instead, it was something that sort of resembled this time I tried to make a yeastless flatbread and then had to eat my terrible flatbread because I didn't bother to have a back up? I've had a look and according to the internet, it's a pizza crust instead of a wrap - which explains some things but should maybe be noted on the menu. It was thick, dry, and the edges were untrimmed so the first 2 or 3 bites of the wrap were pure dry flatbread. Not the best. The actual wrap wasn't bad, although it was still a little dry, and the french fry to sauce ratio needed to be tweaked as I got very little of the famous cheese sauce. 

My lunch companion had the no. 2 French taco (la dijonaise: marinated chicken breast in mustard, onions, tomatoes, salad and French fries.) which I actually ended up swapping with her as the taco was very strong on the mustard. The taco was good, the chicken was tasty and the sauce to fries ratio was much better than it was on the Cordon Bleu, although it was a little over sauced and about halfway through the tortilla lost its structural integrity and I had to eat it with a fork. 

One thing to note is that the portions are LARGE. Neither of us finished the entire serving - I would suggest getting some of the menu items and a side to split if you're dining with another person - you'll be full either way."}
{"text":"I had never heard of French tacos! Been here few times now, food is always delicious and service quick and pleasent. Great addition to the Danforth."}
{"text":"Mister Frenchy is an amazing restaurant. I would even argue that this is a must try.
Their food is authentic and extremely tasty.
You can truly tell  they put their heart into everything they make.
This is a fabulous addition to the Danforth!"}
{"text":"On m'a recommandé ce restaurant et je ne regrette pas d'y avoir été. J'ai commandé un French tacos dijonnais. Il était généreux et goûteux. La moutarde est de la réelle moutarde dijonnais à l'ancienne. J'ai également goûté la mousse au chocolat. Elle est faite maison et délicieuse.
Gros avantage, il se trouve à deux pas de la station de métro. Très utile l'hiver et il dispose même d'un accès wifi :) !!!"}
{"text":"Went to Mister Frenchy restaurant for Sunday lunch. Mister Frenchy is nicely decorated restaurant on the Danforth strip. The service is kind of slow since everything is made to order. Everybody has to wait 10 to 15 minutes for their food. 

I ordered the le lyonnais taco sandwich while my brother ordered the le mediterrannen pressed french bread. We have never eaten French street food before. I was surprised to get a long subway sandwich that had french fries on top of the food toppings. The beef was kind of bland. The sandwich was okay. My brother got a panini pressed sandwich. He was pretty happy with it.

Would we go back? Maybe, but I think I rather try another restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone likes this place! We ordered the Croque and it was made with WONDER BREAD! I was in shock! No self-respecting French place would EVER use Wonder bread. And as if that weren't worse, tha \"ham\" was Bologna! Like the type in awful kid's school lunches. We also got a French \"taco\" and it was beyond plain and flavourless. I could have been eating anything, there was no definition of taste whatsoever. This place would make any French person cringe. And how dare they say they are a French Street Food place if they don't serve crepes! The quintessential French street food! Never ever ever going back there. Was sooo disappointed, had waited months and months for this place to open."}
{"text":"Mr Frenchy is a nice introduction to the Danforth. Despite it taking a little longer than expected (admittingly they were busy, so totally understandable) they delivered fresh and traditional French street food. The fries were fresh cut, with a few unique dipping sauces. The pressed French Bread (Bollywood) and Croque Monsieur were delightfully satisfying. The team working there were great, personable and so sincere about the food. Don't go if you're looking for fast (serve), go if you want unique and fresh. Definitely will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to this interesting sounding restaurant opening in my neighborhood. However I am very sure it won't stay long I was served today the most disgusting item of food I have ever being served. 
The Croque Monsieur, which is supposed to be a buttered ham sandwich with melted cheese over it. Instead I was served dry white bread with greasy slices of a salami and they squeezed a cheese sauce that didn't even cover the top slice. I'm adding the pictures to show you."}
