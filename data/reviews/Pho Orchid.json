{"text":"Pho Hung has been going downhill in their food/service, so I've been searching for a replacement pho place. (I felt like a cheater for walking in...)  I really don't understand the low ratings for Pho Orchid. I had great service and great food. The pho was nice and hot when it arrived and the beansprouts were fresh. The soup was definitely more flavorful than the watered down stuff Pho Hung's been serving. I didn't think the meat was microwaved or old like others did. Springrolls were crispy and perfectly cooked, but I wish they gave me more sauce. They had orange slices in the water (which was a little strange), but it was a hot day so I didn't mind.   The food came quickly (under 10 minutes) and the waiter got me extra limes when I requested it. He came back to check on me once and got my my bill when I needed it. Pricing is similar to other pho places, but more expensive than Pho Hung. I don't mind though; enen the small is a huge portion.  Sure, this place is in the basement and the windows face the street, but it is definitely not a dump. Everything at least feels clean and the atmosphere is nice (didn't smell a whiff of cigarette smoke) They have their namesake orchids all around too.   I've been here twice now and I enjoyed it both times. It's not the best pho ever, but it does a good job."}
{"text":"Service and Pho was decent.  A bit over priced compared to others  XD"}
{"text":"Abominable food and service!  Went here for quick work lunch and ordered a bowl of beef pho and spring rolls. It was around 1:30 and the place was almost empty except for myself and a take-out customer.   Waited about 10 minutes, the rolls came and were burnt around the edges but I wasn't in the mood to complain. Overall, they were mediocre. Sauce was good, though.   Another 15 min. passed and the noodles came. I appreciated how they served the sprouts and basil on a separate plate. The problem was the soup was barely hot enough to cook them! It was lukewarm in fact, I was quite surprised that they would serve it like that! The beef was dry, I asked for rare but the thing was cooked completely through and was very hard.  It seemed as if they had simply microwaved a leftover order from lunch service that was not picked up by a customer....  A couple mouthfuls later I was so disgruntled with the noodles that I asked for it to be re-heated. The sprouts and herbs were still raw. The server moved like a snail and finally got it back to me in 15min.  All in all, the lunch about an hour. I will NOT be back.   Owners: please do not serve microwaved leftover portions again!"}

The pho was not memorable, the quality and quantity is mediocre.  I first visited the place a few years back when they just opened. It was hot summer day and the AC was busted, I never returned until recently.   I have eaten in holes in the wall all over the world: A noddle cart in Rural Thailand, street vendor in Tijuana, a wooden shack in South Korea, an old school Chinese restaurant in San Francisco which probably never washed the exhaust fan since they opened 30 years ago.   But I have never been so disgusted until now..... when I come face to face with a big cockroach crawling on the wall inches from my face, directly over the utensils..... I wasn't sure if I should be relived or disgusted..... Needless to say I would never return. I never given a 0 out of 5 for cleanness until now."}
{"text":"Been here for take out a few times - not bad Pho, but only really go back because there aren't many options in the neighbourhood.  Broth is good, but meat was a little tough"}
{"text":"This used to be a great Pho place, and I used to go there quite frequently. The portion sizes were good, and they had a good variety of food options. However, there was always a slight issue with cleanliness. The tables were a bit sticky, the entrance to the restaurant has always been grimy, and the sauces didn't look too fresh. However, my most recent visit may have been my last. While browsing the menu, my friend noticed something scurry across the table next to us. I got up and took a look at what it was, and it turned out to be a small cockroach. Seeing that, we quickly got up and left. The Pho Orchid has always been a decent, cheap place to satisfy your Pho craving. I really hope that the owners pay more attention to the cleanliness of their establishment."}
{"text":"The Table Gave Off the, Smelliest, WORST Stench Ever!  My colleague and I showed up at that restaurant today at around 12:20pm.  The waitress directed us to a table she just cleaned.  We sat down and were overwhelmed by a penetrating STENCH which was the smell of a towel that had wiped down too many tables and not washed in a long time.  My colleague and I actually put up with it for a whole minute before we finally could not take it anymore and said to each other \"the stench here is really unbearable\"!  So we quickly got up to walk away from the stench.  I told that waitress about it and I said \"we are not imagining this or making this up.  Please go smell it for yourself and tell us if we are lying or not.\"  She went to smell it and said \"but I really don't smell anything\".  Just then, a tall waitress with a ponytail and a light-blue top walked by us with plates of food and nonchalantly said, just loud enough so I could hear clearly, \"if you don't like it here, you can leave.\"  My colleague and I looked at each other, shocked, and just walked out.  You can bet we will not only NEVER come back again, but will tell all our colleagues about this so they don't go there either.  I was not yelling or being rude at all.  To say that to a customer was rude and unacceptable.  (Also, I am usually the one who can never smell anything when the rest of the world is complaining, so if I can smell it, it must have been a very, very bad smell.)    STINGY on the Noodles!  The last time I was there for pho, I remember that they gave me a BIG bowl filled with broth but there were hardly ANY noodles in the bowl.  They think people cannot see it because of the brown broth so they can get away with it.  I didn't want to go there in the first place but my colleague wanted to take me there to treat me in celebration of my one-year wedding anniversary today.  We ended up going to Asian Bowl which was much cleaner, with much better food and, not to mention, better service.  This was the FIRST time in my life that I sat down at a table at a restaurant that gave off a stench.  UNBELIEVABLE."}
{"text":"I ordered the bun bo hue and it is plain. I have been here before for the pho and the portions are small considering the price.  My reasoning for the low ratings is also due to the staff who only speak Vietnamese with each other. As someone who understands Vietnamese, it is annoying to hear the staff talk about customers in their own language.   I wrote on the order sheet that I did not want onions or bean sprouts. I later heard the staff complaining about my request & saying in Vietnamese that I am \"difficult\".   Do not come here if you want good portions or good tasting pho. Staff are also very gossipy in Vietnamese."}
{"text":"The dish I tried was very good with interesting ingredients ie. sugar cane. Haven't tried the pho yet so I need to come back. The spring rolls were good. Nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Place is weirdly located underground, however the location is very convenient. About 5min walk west of Yonge/Dundas. Service is also friendly. How is the pho you ask? The broth has a weird tangy flavor. And the 3 times I went, they served me moldy chilli peppers. Why would you serve your asian customers moldy chilli peppers? Sorry but you have lost a few stars as a result.  It takes me about a 10 min walk to either visit this joint, or Ginger at Yonge/Bloor from my workplace, and I'm forced to having to choose the latter due to the food alone. Check out my Ginger review!  Food: 2 Service: 4 Ambience: 4 Overall: 2 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"I think people are rating this restaurant a bit unfairly. Thought it was decent pho, really quick service, and a good location. The servers were to the point, but not in a bad way. I would come here again."}
{"text":"This place was nice a couple years back. I went there recently, and found service to be terrible and the space is not very clean.   Someone mentioned they saw cockroaches. I didn't see one, but wouldn't be surprised if there are some... as the corners are dirty and it's located in a half basement, so naturally the space would be more damp.   There are just so many options for Asian food around that area, so I would go elsewhere for more friendly service and a cleaner space."}
{"text":"Aweful, eat somewhere else.  The worst Vietnamese restaurant experience I've had in Toronto.  The food is cheap and even then you still don't get what you paid for... I went in to eat for the first time for dinner. My friend and I were disapponted with the pho. We definitely will not be coming back.    We don't recomment this fast food place to any one."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) Convenient location near Eatons for quick lunch meal, service is quick and the place does get really packed. The menu items are around $6-$9 generally, depending on what you order. I got the chicken vermicelli with spring rolls (~$8) and my friend got medium pho (~$7). My dish was alright, the only downfall in my opinion is that the vermicelli was a bit dry even with the sauce and portions stuck together in chunks. Other than the both the chicken and spring rolls were pretty tasty. However, after the meal both of us were extremely thirsty which mostly likely is MSG....   I would only come back here for the convenience factor, but with so many options on this stretch of Dundas W, I would recommend trying other places for around the same price."}
{"text":"WORST PHO RESTAURANT !!  We waited more than 1 hour to just get our appetizer and main meal. The soup and noodles were bland and the service was terrible. They showed little care or interest. Never go here"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very clean.  Pho is ok, not the best Pho I ever had but the soup taste good.   The price is ok, not expensive and you can have spring rolls + a medium soup for 14$. Beef balls taste weird though.   As it is located in a basement, it's funny to eat and to see people outside looking at you :)"}
{"text":"This was located in a basement and was empty when I walked in. The food was pretty quick but mediocre. The service was ok"}
{"text":"I was really torn about this one. Pho and spring rolls were great - but cleanliness was absent. Things floating my water glass, it just really needs a good wipe down top to bottom. That said, the food was good. I'm pretty sure I don't want to know how clean the kitchen is."}
{"text":"Went last year and from what I remember, food wasn't that great and service was pretty lacking. Food mostly edible, I guess, so not terrible, but definitely not recommended.  I do like their atmosphere, though! As some people pointed out, they're in a basement, but I thought it was pretty well decorated and looked nice."}
{"text":"It's more of 2.5.  Everything average.  Had to medium Rare Beef,Beef Brisket and Beef Balls Noodle Soup ($7.75).  Noodle, average, beef and beef brisket was okay.    Good place for quick lunch.  Don't expect above average food here."}
{"text":"The Veggie Pho was fine and the restaurant clean and offered fast service. RIght next door to the Metropolitan hotel."}
{"text":"Fast. Conveniently located near the bus station. Yummy. This little basement pho place is just about indistinguishable from most of the other pho places downtown, but sometimes that's all you need."}
{"text":"The pho tai must have made record time; it was served in less than 2 mins even with the restaurant at about 70% capacity. Soup base was much better than my expectation of \"downtown food court grade\". Came with a lot of meat and noodle, also beyond my expectation for a Small (Medium). Very good value as the service was also acceptable. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Good food, however I found the salad too plain. The rest was tasty though."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a no-frills, \"hole in the wall\" spot, then this place is for you. Decent prices, standard food! Quick service and bathrooms were clean. Probably a good option for take-out if you care about a fancy setting."}
{"text":"New Pho place on Dundas, a little hidden but very well worth seeking out.   I find pho places to be hit or miss, and this one is definitely a hit. While the prices are a tad higher than average, they are well worth it. I would recommend the Pho with all the goodies (rare beef, tripe, brisket). I think the medium size should be plenty, I'm a big eater and I couldn't even finish the large. My one complaint is that they did put a bit too much rice noodle in the bowl, at least for my tastes.   The broth was VERY tasty, and was served at the perfect temperature, I hate when its scorching hot and it takes 5 minutes to cool to edible.   Def. check this place out, one of the better pho joints in the area."}
{"text":"Very greasy for the rice dishes and I unfortunately had food poisoning following :( wanted to like this place as it was close by my home"}
{"text":"Love stopping by this restaurant for lunch! Really a good spot for getting your Pho fix.  I have been coming to this place for quite some time and have noticed that the food and the overall presentation of their dishes has improved drastically.  I typically order grilled chicken vermicelli bowl with a spring roll and it's absolutely delish. The dish is always beautifully plated,  the bean sprouts are fresh and crispy, the salad is full of rich flavors, the meat is lean and well cooked and the spring rolls are fresh and well spiced. They now serve this dish in larger bowls, so you definitely get more food for the same price.  The only negative would be the interior of the restaurant, as it looks quite outdated. Otherwise, I really thought that the was food was fresh and tasty and I will defiantly be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We just walked into the place because our other fave restaurant close by was closed. The food is okay. The service was very very bad. The guy who worked there seemed like he didn't want to have guest at all. Go choose other restaurants instead."}
{"text":"A complete miss!  I had ordered a cubed beef dish, a chef specialty according to the menu. It turns out it's a rump steak of grade of F(ail) cut. The beef was not cut in cubes they were more like sloppy strips. The dish was over salted and tough to chew.  Very disappointing.  As for the environment, this restaurant is basement level. Many passerby smoke in the area and while sitting in the restaurant the front door is ajar. Not a good idea because patrons get big whiffs of second hand cigarette smoke that just hangs in the air. Unpleasant."}
{"text":"This is the best sweet & sour soup in Toronto!  I haven't found anything that comes close to this!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant where I fell in love with Pho!  Their pho is soooooooo delicious, I could not stop coming back for more."}
{"text":"Love this place and go almost every week. We only get the pho satay - so can't say anything about the rest of the food - but the satay is great! Very addictive"}
{"text":"We ordered their house special vermicelli, yeung chow fried rice, wonton soup and spring rolls. Fast service, yummy food, cozy space, convenient location. The food was well-cooked and not overly greasy. Great lunch or dinner spot! We will definitely be coming again to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but a bit pricey for pho ($7-8 for a small) and they seem to have less selection for combinations of meat in your pho.  For instance, they didn't have rare beef + tendon, which is what I normally order.  The rice and vermicelli dishes are really good and priced about the same as the pho, so feels much more worth it.  I had the pork chop rice with steamed and fried egg, and it was tasty and filling.  I had the cold rice paper shrimp roll for appetizer and it was one of the better restaurant shrimp rolls I've had.  The decor is marginally nicer than your average hole-in-the-wall pho, and the service is quick although no frills. It's a good friday lunch place."}
{"text":"They've been open for 2 months. They look interesting since their decor is similar to Pho Phuong (Dundas & Brock).  We find that appealing, unlike the usual grungier looking Pho places.  Think of it like a comparison between a Hero burger joint and a McDonald's rather an insult to the more common pho places.   There are less options than your traditional Viet restaurant, since they do not offer as many combinations.  I.e. you can get grilled chicken with rice or a \"grilled\" pork chop (was actually pan-fried) with rice, but there was no option of getting both on the menu.  It was also nice to see some options you don't tend to see in other Viet restaurants though.  They offered banh cuon (super thin rice rolls with ground pork & woodear).  My daughter and I started with their crispy spring rolls which were ready in less than 4 minutes, served perfectly crispy & tasty.  I had their house pho, which was very flavorful.  The balance between meat and noodles was perfect for me, as I like to get lots of meat.  The herbs were fresh and obviously just washed which was refreshing.   My daughter had the house rice special which came with a fried pork chop (even though the menu indicated it should be grilled), steamed egg & crab meat pie (cha), a sunny side up egg and a special preparation of pork skin and tenderloin (bi).  The pork chop was well marinated and the egg was the perfect addition.  Their meat pie skimpy but yummy. Nothing on the plate seemed to warrant the price tag of $9.50, but it was filling.    If I had to compare their food to other popular dives such as Pho Tien Thanh or Pho Hung, they would all blend in depending on which exact dish you were planning on eating and your preference is all that matters (never happens in a group setting).  The reason places like Pho Phuong & Pho Orchid can charge the prices they charge ( i.e. $8 for pho when you can get it for $5 on average) is because they are also selling the dining experience.  The décor matters to some diners.  The attentive servers is enjoyed by most diners.  The fact that they accept debit & credit for our convenience matters to most of us.  Their cleanliness appeals to all patrons.  The service was much warmer and customer centric than the service you get a Pho Phuong.  Upon entering, we were advised we could choose any seat of our choice.  The server was kind enough to advise us which seat might be cooler since it was close to their air conditioning.  Our water glasses were tended to at least 3 times during our meal.  They serve their water in a nice icey pitcher with citrus fruit slices, which was a nice touch.    My daughter and I will be returning customers.  The next time we're hungry after shopping, we will be visiting Pho Orchid."}
{"text":"One of the worst pho restaurants I have ever been too. The location is in the basement, and it was extremely humid inside, its like they never turned on the A/C. The doorway and staircase were absolutely filthy. I ordered the house special pho. The soup was extremely bland, tasted like hot water. There was exactly 1 anemic sized meatball in the soup. Service was neither friendly or rude, the server basically just gave me a piece of paper and a pencil, and didn't speak a word. Would not recommend, there are a ton of other pho restaurants in and near Chinatown."}
{"text":"Dropped in here as the nearby ramen place was busy. Food was ok and the pho had nice soup base. I had the crispy noodles which was tasty as well and good sized portion. Seems to be a trend now with the halving of beef balls though!  Oh, they didn't have the bubble tea when we went, which was a disappointment but their Viet iced coffee is rather nice being a strong flavour.  To get to this restaurant, go downstairs, the one up is the middle eastern."}
{"text":"I like the convenient location to my school and the fresh roll was good as I was starving. The pho I chose was veggie and since I've never ordered veggie pho before I have nothing to compare it to unfortunately but I would say the broth tasted sour? and not hearty and comforting like I'm used to. It tasted salty and a bit off. But It wasn't horrible or anything. I loved that they loaded the veggies which I find ginger skimps on. They didn't just throw onion on top and call it a day. Broccoli Bol Choy sprouts leaves I can't remember what they are and carrots. Supposed to be mushroom but didn't see any. I ordered green tea which they were confused about. the boy who I'm not sure is even 16 kept asking if I wanted nestea lol like NO hot tea dammit ! He then said its a dollar extra which is usually free at places like ginger  the place did see to be dingy as its in a basement and old building. The decorations are from the early 80s but I was there for the food and to be left alone to study. I wish I took a picture of the crowd. The guy across from Me was the loudest eater and he was gaming while slurping soup and dipping dumplings and a straw sipping cola all at once. Nice butt crack for the view. Girl to the left was suspiciously eyeing me and I was probably looking the same to her. I was just wondering why she was reading her Margaret Atwood book aloud or I think that's what she was doing ? Strange noises over there ... Overall exactly the type of place I wanted as I was left alone to study and refresh even if ginger is better i would never have known if I didn't come here and I like to give businesses a fair chance to compete   Anywho 4.00 for two spring rolls cut in half and 7.50 for the small veggie pho plus 1.00 green tea by tetley also would Love to point out that I gave my leftovers to a beggar lady who sits outside the temple across the street. She is wear a face and body covering and mumbling to herself. I gave her the soup she started screaming and spitting at me and acted like I was murdering her goodness sake so do yourselves a favour and continue to not acknowledge her because I don't know what her deal is but she seemed to be cursing me not in English and I felt my feel good gesture go to waste especially since as a student that half a meal would have been nice for tomorrow :("}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Not sure why this place has such a low rating. Came here because we wanted a quick, hearty bite in the area.  The service was professional, friendly, and fast! Our server was very nice and always filled up our tea and water. We left a generous tip. No complaints.  We ordered their beef noodle soup (pho), and their non-fried spring rolls (goi cuon). As a person who grew up with a lot of vietnamese food, it lived up to my standards! Nothing was wrong as far as my taste buds went - all well-seasoned, savoury, cooked right, and with fresh ingredients. Sauces were on point. Nothing too special or above average, though.  But for under $10 for an entree, it's very filling. Can't complain about the location either.  Would come back here again for a quick and cheap meal! :)"}
{"text":"Not the worst, definitely not the best. I like it because it is conveniently located close to my work. It normally has a line up for the typical lunchtime hour so it can't be all that bad. Not a fan of their deep fried spring rolls though - something off about its filling that I can't put my finger on why it's not up to par. But the pho and vermicelli are decent, nothing stands out as a 'wow' or  'heck no'. I think the size is a bit small for the price point compared to other viet restos. What I like is that the pho noodles have never been over or under-cooked every visit, it's not too oily and the service is super-fast."}
{"text":"Maybe this rating is overly harsh because I came here for lunch when I was really, REALLY craving some bun (basically the cold version of Pho - rice noodles, veggies, grilled meat an no broth). And when I am really craving something, I have pretty high expectations. So when I ordered grilled lemongrass chicken and spring roll bun, and was met with a bowl of soggy noodles, skimpy vegetables, one very greasy spring roll, and chicken that looked and tasted boiled, needles to say I was very disappointed. And for $9.50, the amount of food was pretty pathetic compared to almost every other Vietnamese restaurant I have visited."}
{"text":"The place itself  is outdated and doesn't look clean. I tried not to think about that because I was so hungry and there was no quick alternative. The staff was nice and friendly. The food was better then you can expect after long and boring  waiting time. But after all, portions were generous  and grilled chicken and fresh spring rolls were good."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? (????????)?"}
{"text":"How this establishment has more than 2 stars is beyond me. If I can give it 0 stars, I would but sadly Yelp doesn't offer that option.   The place is absolutely filthy and needs a good cleaning. Very dingy.  Food is subpar (and I like almost everything so this means A LOT). The soup base is full of MSG and whatever food flavouring there is, makes you extremely parched. Meat is sketchy as well. My friend and I got stomachaches right afterwards.  Then after this terrible meal, we went up to pay. Lady barked at us that if we wanted to split the bill, we had to come to the front. She was extremely rude and we think she is the owner. I tried to pay with AMEX and she barked again \"NO AMEX\". Then proceeds to take my card and ninja flick it off the counter. So, at the point I had to pick up my credit card off their nasty floor AND still had to pay for such a bad experience. A tip? Yeah right."}
{"text":"Good pho (lrg ~ 8$) n spring rolls. Mmh."}
{"text":"We went for lunch at Pho Orchid, where the restaurant is below ground level, but still surprisingly bright.  The menu is simple with pho available in different sized bowls. We each ordered the medium bowl ($8.00), but found that the beef was sparse.   Service was fast, which is to be expected for pho. Waiters checked in with us several times during lunch, even when it started getting busy.   I would return, if looking for a quick meal. Restaurant decor is modern and clean, but pho is just alright."}
{"text":"I'm mystified by the negativity about this place. I acknowledge that I developed my taste for Vietnamese food on Spadina, so I may not know what elite Vietnamese cuisine should be, but the vermicelli I had was exactly the comfort food I had been craving. Spring rolls with that perfect mix of crispy and tender, and a lovely flavour. Springy (a little sticky) noodles topped with fresh, crunchy veggies and chicken. A subtle tangy dressing. I'm used to peanuts on top, but maybe I am betraying the humble origins of my vermicelli obsession  The menu covers the basics - more vegetarian options would have been nice. The bar has 4 beers, but maybe that's enough.  Also, this is a bright little restaurant, despite the basement location, so it may become one of my lunchtime special treats.  The reason I'm not ready to go above 3 stars is that I do have to acknowledge that service is efficient, but charm-free, and the bathroom was a little off-putting (nothing gross, just...a little shabby? I'm probably mostly reacting to the sign that said I couldn't put toilet paper in the toilet).  I will go again. I will try to use the bathroom somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not the best Pho, but not the worst. Service was friendly and efficient with many water refills. I wouldn't say this place was the cleanest looking spot I've been to. The table had a little bit of schmutz on it. There was a decent amount of meat, but maybe too many noodles and not enough broth."}
{"text":"Decent pho for downtown area. My friend and I used to be regulars here, and we prefer this place to Pho Hung on Spadina (more flavourful broth and better service). We would usually get the house special pho, beef ball pho or the spicy Hue noodles (really good- if you ask them, they might serve it to you for lunch!). We always leave feeling full, and a medium bowl is under $10 (card is only accepted above $10). Also, they make a mean avocado smoothie!  We *used* to be regulars because, earlier this winter, a cockroach crawled onto our table in the middle of our meal. When we moved tables I saw another cockroach on the wall near the ceiling. We were really disappointed because the food is good, and I've returned once after that, but she's still a bit too scared to come back.   td;lr: if you want decent pho downtown, and don't mind the risk of bugs, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Vietnamese Pho, I was in the bay and dundas area so found this pho place that locate underneath of another restaurant.   Went in for lunch ordered a medium rare beef pho and asked beef on the side and an order of spring roll.   Always ask for beef on the side because most places will serve you with the fresher beef and nicer ones.   The beef I got was not the freshest and best one because can still see a darker color of the beef. But it was still ok cause different restaurant uses different part of beef for the rare beef pho.   Spring roll was ok too but a little over fried and you can tell by looking at it. Still eatable and taste ok.   This place I would say is just a below average pho place to go to. There's is more in the area that taste better."}
{"text":"Place is not too bad. Located in the basement in the core of downtown, the Pho isn't too bad. Only thing was when I ordered take out, it took almost 40 mins as they served all the new people being seated before my order."}
{"text":"The sign outside says \"Authentic\" but I highly doubt this. I had a pho special and the broth is clearly lacking something. And the prices are not cheap either. Not expensive, but I can get much better pho for the same price.   Even if I am craving pho I would go out of my way to find a better place before considering here."}
{"text":"This was my & my colleagues go to Vietnamese place when I worked on University Avenue. Great spot for a fast & delicious lunch!  It's a bit of a hole in the wall (or hole in the basement rather) but no different than any other mom & pop Asian place in Chinatown.  Their pho is my favourite in the area and I still crave their bun vermicelli. I also like their cold rolls a lot.Their prices are reasonable, and the portion sizes are big."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick meal if you need to catch a bus and probably the best (or only) Vietnamese place in the area. My friends commented that it's the quietest restaurant they've been to, it was not empty by any means but  everyone had somehow come to a silent agreement that they should speak in whispers only. It was very noticeable once pointed out to me. It's also a little weird that anyone looking down walking by automatically peeps down to the restaurant or anyone inside can look up at people.  Apart from that, this place is a pretty routine restaurant, it's not the best or cheapest pho I've had but it's good enou for repeat visits. Nothing in the menu stands out as a must try to my memory and the staff are not too spectacular.   For some reason the tv playing cp24 is a notable positive. But maybe that's not a great reflection on the actual restaurant? Pretty solid food if you're in the mood for it."}
{"text":"Came here with my non-Asian colleagues for lunch here and was very disappointed.  My colleagues loves this place, no comment.  I ordered the satay beef noodle soup and it was the worst I've had in my life.  It tasted like crappy pho soup with added chilli.  The noodles were overcooked.  I would never come back here, not even if it was free as it would be a waste of my calories."}
{"text":"Pho Orchid is in a basement, pretty much, however it is very well lit and nicely decorated. Right under what seems like a busy shawarma place.   I have visited a few time when I was in the area and they have yet to disappoint. Prices are great for lunch and for portion size and quality you receive.  The Pho is great as well as their pad thai.   Stop by if you're in the area too!"}
{"text":"WARNING: DON'T COME TO THIS RESTAURANT, ITS FOR UR OWN GOOD. This is the worst restaurant I've ever been.  The waiter \"served\" us with the worst attitude like we owe him money. And there were only few customers in the restaurant, and we still have waited our pho for half an hour. Then I asked the waitress, who I believe is the chef as well, how much longer should we wait? The she yelled at us, \" u r not ordering fast food, I have to cook!\" Believe me, she said that without any manners. Then my friends and I left right after, however she began to curse us and say don't come again. Well, i think at some points, don't come again, is the only thing we shared. PS: I do believe if we stay, that waitress would spit  in our food."}
{"text":"Need I say more? Cockroach found in my friend's pho! This was the most disgusting dining experience of my entire life."}
{"text":"Ok, so I took my daughter here for lunch today...not impressed. She is part Vietnamese so she knows good pho as do I since I have been having it for over 20 years. The broth was missing something. Just couldn't figure it out.  So we ate our meat (her, beef and me, seafood).  The fresh shrimp rolls were good though. And I like that they served it with individual peanut sauce for both of us. Allowed us to double dip all we wanted. It surprises me because this place is always packed up so I had high expectations.   Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I used to come to this restaurant a lot. Their Pho noodle soups used to be tasty and reasonably priced. However, recently the restaurant cut down on quality and quantity. I ordered a large chicken Pho and got such a tiny portion of it that I was still hungry after lunch. Honestly, rice noodle is very cheap. The chef should not cut down on the quantity of noodle to make more profit. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"okay I rarely give 1 star on yelp but this place was really not getting it right.  too much noodles and can't find my meat. the whatever famous Vietnamese noodle was so flavorless, noodles were all clumped together, and it had only two sad little fish balls in it. not impressed. I'd walk a bit further to china town for better pho places next time.  Oh best part was, i got stomach ache couple of hours after - okay how is that possible if all i had was salted water and clumps of noodle and one fish ball?   Definitely will NOT come back"}
{"text":"Bun bo hue - pretty good and comparable to homemade. It's a few dollars more than what I'm used to paying for viet food - but, their decor was nice and clean - which helped justify it."}
{"text":"This place is 'A-ok' as 3 stars would say.. I decided to eat here today after starving myself to go to sansotei ramen down the street. IT WAS CLOSED. Boo, so I used the last of my energy to drag my dying body down the road before I settled on pho orchid (Or 'pho o chid' since the R was ripped off or something)  I went downstairs to find an empty restaurant but I was greeted and given menus right away. My boyfriend and I sat at a table, and everything seemed to be nice and clean even though the atmosphere gave off a bit of a filthy/old vibe. I started reading yelp reviews as I was peering through the menu and was horrified that I made a bad choice when I saw only 2.5 stars... but you know what... I had no more energy and if I go back up the stairs without food in me, I may only make it halfway.  One thing I don't like is the fact you need to go to the front to order (I think this time they just didn't see us even though we were waving our hands like a mad man) and you have to go to the front to pay- even cash...  However, the food came super quickly and I was full after a M size house special pho. The beef was ok.. I like mine rare and soft, but it was already fully cooked. Not a HUGE fan, but the boyfriend loved it. The noodles were quite good, very chewy and had the 'pho bounce'. The broth was nothing memorable.. but maybe that's because I doused it in sriracha before I could try it raw. I also got a mango milkshake, which was quite small for $4. It was ok.. I could taste the pure mango but also the little chunks of ice that survived the wrath of the blender. I couldn't finish it, and that has never happened with me and ANYTHING mango before.  This place is convenient and I can see myself coming here if I'm downtown and I need a place to eat quickly. Servings are nothing to brag about, and it's also pricey for pho. Then again, I'm used to pho luxury uptown so..."}
{"text":"The spring was okay. As for the pho, the meat was not fresh. You can tell that they have been sitting in the fridge for a a long time. I have had better pho."}
{"text":"Stopped by with co-worker for quick lunch, in the mood for pho.  Got the rare beef pho, a staple, and it was fine. The broth was a bit greasy but had decent flavor, beef was a bit tougher than I like but mostly fine.  They have beer on the menu but apparently no license so you can't order a beer. That's fine but we asked for green tea instead, again a staple for a joint like this, and they threw an old Tetley Green Tea bag into a pot and served us that.  No. Not what I was expecting.   Service was quick and friendly. Place was kinda dive-y.  Probably won't go back but wasn't as bad as some reviews on here make it seem. Though I should have read them before I went, lol."}
{"text":"I read the reviews below and quite a few people thought the pho was just \"meh\". I actually really enjoyed it. I've eaten at quite a few \"top pho\" places in Toronto and while this is definitely not up there, I really enjoyed the broth, noodles and brisket. My major concern with this restaurant is CLEANLINESS. The wall next to my table was filthy. It was coated with some kind of grease or grime. I was really sketched out because of this and this will be the reason I probably wouldn't return. The owners of the restaurant really need to deep clean this place.... if the restaurant is so filthy, then how is the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant with an acquaintance for the first time and wasn't quite sure what to order as I've never had Vietnamese food. Played it safe and had the stir fried rice noodles. Absolutely delicious. The water was room temperature but our server never returned to check on us so I just drank what I could. Went back a second time and tried the nice sized crab meat spring rolls and had the grilled vermicelli, chicken and spring rolls for the main. Amazing! Coupled with the fish sauce was an excellent dish. Made sure to ask for ice in the water this time LOL"}
{"text":"If you want the best Vietnamese Cuisine in all of North America, you should come to Pho Orchid where the chicken is crispier than my step back three. Me and the boys, Extend Lu,  Andeye the 13th, and Edwhin, were HOUNDING for some rice noodles and we knew the place to be at. Absolutely LITTY in the city and right near Eaton Centre where I cop some fresh kicks to resale to get those racks. Don't forget about the staff there. They have one of the best servers on the block with amazing hair and swaggy swagger. 10/10 but 10/10 with rice."}
{"text":"Ordered pho with rare beef and meat balls and a crab roll appetizer.  The crab roll was a bit too greasy and there was stuff in there but it has no crab flavor.  The pho was decent and I can't fault it aside from to say I've had better.  The glass of water they have me had stuff floating in it so I just didn't drink it.    The place is in a basement and there isn't much, if any, atmosphere.  Its like a cafeteria.  The service is quiet and efficient, but not friendly.  There are too many other good restaurants around to return here."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of pho places and this place was just not good. I came here because I was looking for somewhere close to the Greyhound station. I got the rare beef and beef balls pho and received it very quickly - A+ for speed. However, the beef was stuck together as though it was just thrown in frozen and cooked quickly. The noodles were also just stuck together in a huge clump. The soup was extremely bland tasting (I felt like something was missing in it - it just lacked flavour). Lastly, there was a what looked like a nose hair in my pho which completely ruined my appetite. I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Had the classic rare beef pho - the broth wasn't hot (it couldn't cook the bean sprouts that you add at the table)... The taste wasn't very exceptional either, I had to add a lot of sriracha and hoisin sauce after the first couple spoons. It works in a fix but next time I will choose from the other great Asian restaurants on this street!"}
{"text":"For downtown pho, it's decent.  Can understand some of the concerns on cleanliness here, but I honestly think it's on par for most cheap Vietnamese joints.  Of course, being downtown a large dac biet pho is $10 here - and it's loaded with flank meat.  Just keep expectations reasonable here and you'll do fine."}
{"text":"Service is sub-par but the pho was served very quickly and piping hot. I ordered the pho duc biet and it came with a reasonable amount of meat. Not much to complain about.   The restaurant itself is starting to show its age and needs a facelift. Only street parking is available (as expected of restaurants in downtown core). Good place to get quick bite if craving pho for a reasonable price and in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a drink and a late bite to eat after our day trip to Niagara Falls.  Although beer is listed on their menu, they lost their liquor license, so NO BEER.  Ok, I'll get a beer at the hotel bar, so we get a couple of appetizers to go, Sate Chicken Wings and Coconut Shrimp.  Meh. Nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to look at but we love the Pho. They've got a great appetizer platter perfect for sharing if you're a group of 4+ people. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Very good pho for good prices. Fast efficient service.  Large quantities of food. The restaurant is in the basement but is well kept and relatively clean (compared to restaurants in nearby Chinatown). Been here several times before, and will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"Definitely do not recommend this place. For starters, its in a basement with little ventilation. It is dirty inside, with a weird odor. Furthermore, the food wasn't \"authentic vietnamese\" food. It was easily below average and the food makes you super thirsty afterwards. Service wasn't really good mainly bc they didnt pay much attention to their customers. Overall, it was disappointing..."}
{"text":"Meh, pretty passable Pho, but I have indeed experienced better.  I came here for a work lunch, but wouldn't choose it over other options closer to Spadina. Recessed pit of a room was crowded and tight, and it's a bit odd staring at passerbys' lower halves. Pho was okay, but nothing to write home about (but something to yelp about?).  A lot of cleaner, newer restaurants on this stretch of Dundas, so they have to step up their game.  20/30"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near the greyhound terminal.  I ordered the banh xeo for $8. And it was actually pretty decent. Though I wish I could have got a little more lettuce.  munch munch crumble crumble  ---  I came back to try some different dishes. Tried the canh chua sour soup and bo cha beef stew. I will never order these again.  The fish in the canh chua was good, but poor quality overall and not to my liking. It came with a bowl of thin vermicelli that did compliment well so I ordered a bowl of rice, which was $1. The rice was not dry enough making it soggy to eat with soup.  The bo cha is a definite no. The stew was not thick enough to be a stew and was oddly sweet."}
{"text":"Wow. I was really skeptical about trying this place out because of the iffy reviews but I decided to give them a shot because I was getting sleepy and they were on the corner of my hotel. I'm so glad I did! I ordered the Large House Pho and it was sooooo PhoKing good. Heehee. The flavors were excellent, noodles were awesome and the price was great! I'm certain I'll return tomorrow.   1 bad thing: on my out of the restaurant I noticed that their health rating was passed on a \"conditional\" basis.  Overall I was very pleased with this restaurant"}
{"text":"This place seems like your classic sketchy Asian eatery, it gives you exactly what you would expect. Service is essentially minimal where they bring you menus, water, your food and the bill. The space is definitely not why people are coming here.  The food is average pho and other Vietnamese dishes. They have all the staples, including the noodle+meat bowls, rice plates and all your standard phos. The pho broth tastes like your generic pho broth (not bad, but definitely not something you can't find a 100000000 other places). The noodles were slightly overcooked, but I like my noodles pulled out as soon as they are ready, so take that with a grain of salt.   I think the real pull here is the price. It's sooooo cheap for food that is still comforting with large portions. It's also fast and consistent.   If I was craving pho (which there seems to be a relative deficit of in Toronto), then I'd probably come back, but it's not a must try if you have other options!"}
{"text":"This was my worst vietnamese experience in Toronto. Went with two friends. I got pho, my friends got rice with chicken. I'm used to paying around 7-8 bucks +tax for a large pho to fill me up, i expected the same here. However, the portions was really small and the broth tasted sour. My friends plate was white rice with flat piece of chicken on top... no lettuce or tomatoes. Service was slow even though we were there with only 4 other tables."}
{"text":"2.5/5 Came here because I was craving grilled chicken & spring rolls vermicelli. It's my usual order at various pho places (mostly in Mississauga) and although the taste of the chicken was good, it just wasn't up to par for my usual standards. The grilled chicken portion was small and the Spring roll isn't the authentic crispy ones I am used to. It had a muted flavour and taro? Taro or it was undercooked because it was mushy inside. The noodles were clumped up. I did have pho here two years back and I remember it being okay. That's why I decided to stop by again today! Probably won't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Usually when u see a Pho restaurant that looks like a hole in the ground the food turns out great, but here it reflected the quality. Ordered the P01, the most basic and common Pho special bowl. The beef ball was spoiled and so was the tendon. While the soup tasted ok, the meat was not fresh at all, and the portions were so small. Next time make the trip to Spadina no matter how desperate you are for Pho. Eating here was a major regret and a robbery of my $11. Never again"}
{"text":"Subpar pho place. Prices are reasonably priced for pho $7-9 for a medium or large sized pho... Although the large wasn't that much larger than a medium.  I got a rare beef pho, but my beef slices were fully cooked when it arrived and was a little too chewy for my liking.   This is the sort of place you'd come to when you don't wanna wait in line to eat at other places (ie Santouka) and looking for a fast and decently cheap meal."}

{"text":"Maybe the pho is better, I don't know... but the $9 house special rice platter only gave me one tiny piece of pork chop. For Asian food standard, this is a joke. You're better off with a $1.39 McDouble."}
{"text":"New and clean. Service is OK, friendly and not too pushy. Very fresh food, at least in my pho. I would not say that the decor is super hype... it is just new and clean (some wall mirrors with bamboo-shape drawings does not mean nicer decor than some other Pho places to me...)  Fried rolls are a little bit too oily inside. Pho was clearly good and of perfect taste balance, but not generous enough in meat. Basic and satisfying, but a little bit overpriced to my opinion for the quantity served."}
{"text":"Good: Good portion even for a Medium-sized bowl. Good price. Lots of rice noodle, quite a lot of meat as well. Broth as pretty good. Decent place, pretty clean environment.   Could be better: I wished the meat was more tender (it was a little tough). The interior setting is a little dated, it's a good place to bring your long term mate but probably not to impress your first date.   Overall though, it's still a nice family-owned restaurant with decent pho for good price. Just not my favourite though because the meat was too tough for me."}
{"text":"This small spot gets super packed at lunch! I have only had their veggie pho which is really delicious. Lots of bok choy, broccoli, carrot, mushrooms and tofu. The fresh spring rolls are amazing as well. Be sure to get there before noon as the lineups tend to get long. Decent pho spot if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"It has two stars because it is very very cheap with much noodles and beef. It only has two stars because on such a hot day it don't have any air conditioning and it is underground, plus the food tastes so so."}
{"text":"I went here once. And never again.  As you can tell from my name, I'm Vietnamese and I've had my share of bad experiences of Vietnamese cuisine in the city. Pho Orchid takes the place for dead last (for now, I hope).   Situated in the basement of a building, there is no view, just the feet, and crotch, of the busy Dundas Street. I went here on a whim with two buddies and so begins our journey to the worst Vietnamese food ever. Maybe it was an off day but I'll never return to find out. We each ordered something different, rice with grilled pork, fried egg, and salad for me, pho for my friend to my left, and vermicelli for my friend to my left.   My rice was hard, like it was cooked and dried back to becoming rice grains. It was edible, but barely. My salad? literally a half of a tomato slice. The fried egg? Didn't come. I asked for it, still didn't come. They didn't charge me for it so that was nice. The pork? Nothing notable. As for my friend's dishes, the pho broth was bland. I'm a bit of a purist so I always taste the broth before adding the extras. The noodles? Might as well had been bean sprouts.   Looked at the kitchen and there were a bunch of guys in there squatting by the back.  Never again.  Just. Never again."}
{"text":"Average pho place, I would only come back if it was the only pho place open around town. The soup wasn't hot coming out of the kitchen which is my biggest gripe."}
{"text":"This place is solid for a good quick bowl of pho. Also, it's family run so it has a great cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for rice noodles with grilled chicken and the delicious spring rolls. Above the crunchy salad is yummy. I always get extra basil on the side with chili peppers. It gives this meal an extra wonderful flavor. The hostess is exceptional and even remember exactly what I ordered when I was here last. Now that's service.  I could not wait to dig into my meal and kept on eating because it was so delicious."}
{"text":"I had the Lemon Grass Bun B11. Very light on the meat, everything else was good. I wish more Pho places had Bun Cari Ga. I might go back and try the curry chicken next time."}
{"text":"I'm never a fan of giving bad reviews but this was probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant in a while. I came here on the recommendation of my colleague and found that the food was mediocre at best and their service A LOT LESS SO. The cold/fresh spring roll was flavourless and the lettuce seemed to be like fast food lettuce. The pho tai was only okay... Though I've had much better elsewhere but that I could deal with but the service was horrible.   My colleagues and I had also gone there for lunch so it was quite busy but even after about 40 mins (trying to finish up our food etc.) one of their servers had started making comments/yelling to us about how we needed to leave due to the lunch rush. I understand that there are people waiting but to be yelled at and rushed while trying to finish a meal is just plain rude.   I would want to try this place again at a different time but it left such a sour taste in my mouth that I couldn't bring myself to go back :("}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped in for lunch to try pho for the first time. We loved it, she had the seafood pho and I had the chicken and beef. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So I decided to come try this place out as we were craving some pho and didn't want to walk all the way to Chinatown.  My gf and I got the rare beef pho and was pretty disappointed.  The broth is flavourful, but it's quite salty and I'm pretty sure it's probably MSG which gives it that flaourful taste.  The noodles should have been cooked longer before being served and the beef was lower quality than most places.  Our server was a friendly dude and tried his best to make it an enjoyable meal, but the food was just passable.  This is what happens when your Yelp friends go to a place, try it and say it's a miss... you end up with a pretty mediocre dinner.  Go to this place if you're wayyy too lazy and you're craving pho, personally... next time I'm just going to walk to Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place is so mediocre. I don't know why, but I ended up here on both of my Toronto trips. It's located on a lower level, but the space is pretty big. Everything feels a bit grimy from the moment you walk in, including the seating and utensils. You order by writing your menu numbers on a notepad. The food comes out super quickly .. But you wish they spent a little more time on it. Trust me, it doesn't taste bad. It's just that all the other pho I had in Paris and NY are so much better. This pho just fails to quench my pho cravings and at the same time has me tired of pho for the next month. Finally they don't give you a check, but have you come to the counter to pay. You are given a paper with the prices on it...why couldn't you just bring that to the table so I could peacefully calculate my tip if you were gonna write it down anyway? Sigh.."}
{"text":"Oh god. First of all I'd like to say: my friend gave me a really good review of the place beforehand and I almost believed it. The place looks okay on the outside but looks can be deceiving.  Went at noon yesterday and I ordered a large bowl of pho with rare beef and beef balls. It was fast service but when I got it the broth was not hot -- it was warm at best and the meat was not cooked properly. It was pricey for what I got and the only thing I liked was that the broth was decent tasting. We were ok with the place up until an hour late. Me and 2 of my friends both got really bad stomachaches and were stuck in the washroom for an hour. Read some reviews and it's probably not the first time this has happened to anyone. This has NEVER happened to me at any other pho restaurant. Yes it may look clean on the outside but you do not know what happens in the kitchen. Won't be going back to this place."}
