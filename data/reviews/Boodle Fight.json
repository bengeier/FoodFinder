{"text":"This place has the potential to be a great little resturant. Wait times are long. Service is not up to par. If the had a good server and kitchen manager they would be rich over night. Quality and food price is fair. Not enough seats and if you dont have reservations go else where. A few ceiling fans would make it a more comfortable place to dine.  If you haven't gone here as yet its worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants, and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and very attentive.   The food is delicious, and all for an amazing price, at 15$ per person for the boodle fight, I don't think this place can be beat! The fish is cooked perfectly, and the vegetables compliment it so nicely.   Definitely recommend the lachong kawali, the lumpia and the the milkfish sisig. After the boodle fight, we love to finish off the meal with turon (deep fried banana with ice cream!)  We go to Boodle Fight almost weekly, and have brought many friends and family who all enjoy it as well. Can't wait for our next delicious meal! Thanks Sarah :)"}
{"text":"New experience.... deliouses grill food... no msg & no oil .. me & my friends really enjoyed the food... we never had a experience like this before... actually I want to give 10star ... food + service excellent..."}
{"text":"While not so remarkable from outside, we found that Filipino gem on the Danforth. It is hard to see what it is but it is a great place for kamayan style food. Served on banana leaves you can feast on fresh grilled fish, pork, seafood and rice. If you know of such place like Tinuno downtown, it is the place to go. And it is properly priced and you too can feast for $15. Don't be fooled by the apparence, just go for great Filipino food as they also do other dishes too!"}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend for a birthday dinner.   Definately looks like a small cafe when you sit down.   Ordered the St dinner $15 per person or $30 a couple ( difference is they add some pork belly and I believe another fish).  The dinner comes with milk fish, Talapi, some shrimp, a pork skewer, a bottle of water and squid all served on a bed of garlic rice.   We ordered the lachong ($10 for about 10 PC's), and 2 other pork dishes ( they didn't have the chicken dishes available).  Everything is served on a banana leaf and you eat with your hands ( gloves are available).   Presentation was very nice, garlic rice and the grilled fish were really good.   Don't be shy as they are more than happy to give you more rice with your meal.  The meat dishes we ordered on the side could have a bigger portion for what you are paying, but over all a great meal and the main is very affordable ( but not much meat there as well).  Dessert we grabbed some ube ice cream (purple yam), very tasty and some fried banana that comes with vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.    Desserts were quite nice.  Would visit again, customer service is very good with a very polite and knowledgeable staff.  Finally worth a trip with friend and experience this type of eating."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find this place completely empty on a Sunday evening having been to a joint that serves a similar kamayan format meal which is usually filled to the brim with patrons.   I got the Boodle for two, which is a beast of a feast. For only $30, you get a full tilapia, milk fish fillet, 2 pork skewers, a few mussels, some veggies, a couple of slivers of pork belly, octopus, shrimp, all served on top a fragrant bed of garlic fried rice. You also get a bottle of water with your meal. While they have other menu items, like burgers, I would highly recommend getting the Boodle if you're coming here in a group, there are also options for 1 person. I personally liked the kamayan feast better than   This place seems to be a bit of a hidden gem in the Danforth. Take a break from the usual and try this place out! It's also easily accessible by TTC. There's plenty of paid street parking out front too."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm traumatized after coming here. It was like a sauna. No air conditioning and no windows in 30C weather, so it felt like 40C inside. Combine that with seafood and servers dripping in sweat and the place smelling like gym socks and you're asking for food poisoning.  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) I almost fainted from the heat and didn't even get to try the food. It didn't look fresh anyway and I'm happy we left even before eating. Saved me a trip to the ER."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place but it may have just been a busy night, but we got boodle for 6, which was meant to be 3 servings of each but what arrived was 1 less fish serving, we only got 1 squid for the 6 of us, and everything seemed to be proportioned very scarcely - we basically felt cheated on the meal. We even had to ask for the chicken skewers which were meant to come with the meal and they seemed to have had to contemplate giving it to us. What bothers me isn't that they were low on food, if that's the case, just let us know and we would've ordered something else.   The staff are very nice, but it sounded like they were saving food for tables that reserved after we had been seated to ensure they had enough too, but again, just communicate that and we wouldn't have had to head to Square Boys down the street after for another meal to fill us up."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience in this restaurant, the food was great and the service is friendly. In terms of the venue easily to be low-key but I went for the food which is what matters. I would certainly come back here many times. And the prices are pretty decent"}
{"text":"First time trying any sort of Boodle Fight and it did not disappoint. The service was nice, you place your order, and then they start piling food in front of you (it did take some time). They even have a box of gloves on the table because you eat with your hands. The food was fine, nothing spectacular, though the garlic rice was pretty good. I only wish there was more pork belly because it's listed on their menu, but it was more like a pork belly garnish. Overall, it was a fun experience and I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Just tried Boodle Fight for the first time tonight. My son and I had the Boodle, which is $15 and a fabulous meal. I am already looking forward to going back again. Not only was the food great, the staff (owners?) were friendly and helpful to us newbies.   Wonderful addition to our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"These Kamayan feasts have been growing in trend and I finally got my opportunity to try this out.  Result?  A very pleasant experience, something I'd easily do again.    When I saw these feasts on online videos, I was so intimidated by the volume of food and thought I would burst through the seams if I ever engaged in one of those feasts.  Surprisingly, this place portions the food just right (or maybe I'm just a really slow eater), and I came out feeling satisfied (unlike those AYCE meals).  As I got in, they had us seated (we were a group of 8) and began to set up the table itself. I managed to get some good shots/videos as they lay the table with plastic wrap, banana leaves, fruits, garlic rice, all the seafood and the meat/vegetables.  All in all, seeing the whole setup became part of the experience, as well obviously the eating of food.    This place delivers mainly positive on most fronts, the garlic rice super aromatic, milkfish/tilapia cooked to perfection, and the mussels/shrimps very tasty.  I think for $15 per head, you get an incredible amount of value.  It's great and super interactive, and you gotta get in there and use your hands (they do provide gloves) and enjoy the food, family style.  Especially in this day and age where meals have become rather individualistic, I'm glad places like this exist.    Slight negatives: I would say that their meat offering, they could have offered a bit more meat as I felt the feast was very seafood heavy.  There were only a few pieces of pork belly sprinkled throughout the feast and I personally felt that the meat skewers were kind of small and served on the colder side.  I would have also encouraged more vegetables to decorate the feast as well, as the eggplant/okra were really good, just...not enough of it.  Do note, they only accept cash/debit (no credit).  Great place, great value, and a place I'd encourage everyone to try out!"}
{"text":"Service is sweet but useless. Asked for items twice or three times and never got them. What's worse is that the food wasn't all that good. If you're looking for a kamayan experience, opt for Tinuno instead. Servers there look resentful/hostile but the food was downright amazing."}
