{"text":"I discovered this place a few years ago while visiting my daughter and now I have to order a pie every time I'm in town. The flavour and aroma is fantastic and the toppings are very generous. Beware, this pizza is addictive. I keep trying to figure out how to take it home on the plane."}
{"text":"Best old school pizza ever!! Take-out or delivery. Located on the south shore. Worth the drive"}
