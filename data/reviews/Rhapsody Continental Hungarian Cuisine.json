{"text":"Outstanding little gem for authentic Hungarian food.  Been here a few times and will continue to come back and recommend.  But be warned you must have reservations or you are taking a chance go walking away hungry and wishing you called."}
{"text":"Firstly, I just visited Hungary recently so I had a certain expectation for the food and rhapsody exceeded my expectation in terms of taste and variety. The goulash was served in a cute bowl hung by a wooden contraption giving a classic feel. The chef special was a simple mix of chicken and potatoe but the pickles with the sauce really makes it flavourful. Remember to use the coupon bc the apricot crepe we got was delicious. Definitely a place to go if you miss Budapest!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. I first stumbled upon this place just over 12 years ago on a trip to Toronto and loved the food. The flavours are strong and the food melts in your mouth! If you love McDonalds or are a picky eater like a 4 year old child then totally skip this place. If you like ethnic food with great taste then this is the place to go. I've been going to this restaurant every year when I am visiting in Toronto and the quality of the food has stayed consistently the same and is as great as it ever was. 

Some quick notes about the inside of that place. It is cosy, small and has an intimate feel to it (darker painted walls, candles) with live music on weekends (soloist or duos) - I say weekends because that is the only time I've made those Toronto trips so I have no idea what it is like on a weekday.

Reserve in advance because in the last 12 years from 6pm onward the place is really full and then thins out later after the dinner rush is over.

Menu - read it carefully before you order. I once saw a table of 4 order this garlic mushroom entréee which the menu described as very garlicky and then the whiners summoned the waiter because... you guessed it - the dish was too garlicky. Don't be that knob. Read the menu first.

Awesome food. I'll be there again in a few weeks time!"}
{"text":"I've taken family and friends here and few times, and I'm never disappointed with the food. Portions are huge for the Wiener Schnitzel. The goulash is excellent. The atmosphere is nice, but sometimes the music makes it a little loud for conversation. There are enough breaks that it shouldn't be a huge issue."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Service was excellent. Very attentive and quick. However, food is overly salted. 

I tried really hard to like the this place but in the end, the food isn't good enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was not disappointed. Service was great and the food even better. Will go back, perhaps on a night with music."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great live music, perhaps a tad loud but still great!  If you like traditional hungarian cuisine  than this place will not disappoint.  As a side note debit is not accepted."}
{"text":"It was time for my friends and I to break out of our normal routine of grabbing Middle Eastern or Korean for dinner after an all-day board games session (seriously, one game can last for 2-5 hours!?), so what better way than travelling up Yonge St to experience the East?

Restaurant size:
Nice and spacious, plenty of spaces to sit...but you might want to call ahead for a reservation if you're going on a weekend night! There is live music (at least on Saturday nights there is), and there is one table which is right beside the amplifier. There is the main restaurant area which is dimly lit and has a more upscale look, and to the side is a brightly lit nook which houses a small bar, long table and a few smaller tables (and a fan, for when it's hot!).

Food quality:
One of my friends and I used to get a pork schnitzel at our office cafeteria, and trying an authentic Hungarian-style one blew us away! These. Schnitzels. Are. HUGE (larger than my faceeeeeeeee). And they're also resting on top of a bed of roasted potatoes. The meat to breading ratio was quite good; there wasn't too much breading! Very filling!

Service:
Being a Saturday night, and being a group of friends who didn't bother to make a reservation, and also not wanting to have our eardrums blasted out by sitting beside the amplifier...we had to wait around 10-15 minutes for a table. But it was all worth it in the end!

Our server was very friendly and helpful in explaining certain dishes to us if we had questions, and she came to check up on our water levels once in a while. 

Final thoughts:
I will definitely return to try some other authentic dishes! Parking along Yonge around the restaurant is free Saturday nights after 6pm. Consider making a reservation beforehand so you don't have to be stuck beside the amplifier."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, came here on Saturday evening to enjoy a nice authentic Hungarian dinner and we were not disappointed. That evening there was musical entertainment, pianist and a violin.. very nice. 


We order two entrees and decided to share them

Weimar Schnitzel served with cabbage and roasted potatoes 

Chicken Paprikash served with Nokedli - stewed dark chicken meat with red sauce and dollop of sour cream served with fresh dumplings.


The Schnitzel, I've never seen something that big, it was literally the size of the entire plate!  Bigger than ones head. Done perfect light, crisp and paper thin.

Paprikash  was a tasty paprika flavoured stewed chicken with home made dumplings.. delicious.

Nice place in downtown Richmond Hill. We'll be sure to visit again in the future to try some other authentic Hungarian cuisine."}
{"text":"Judging from the cliental of mainly Eastern Europeans I would think it's safe to say that this place serves authentic Hungarian food. 
We had the goulash soup, cabbage roll and chicken almandine. All were very delicious! 
I would say the pricing is a bit expensive for what you are getting though. 

If you come here on a cold day dress warm as it can be cold inside."}
{"text":"The food and the value at this restaurant are just fine.  This comment is more about the attitude and service.  

I arranged and made a reservation for a dinner for 4 people for a Saturday evening.  At the last minute, we added a 5th friend who we were happy to have join us for a nibble, although they had already eaten.  I called up and changed the reservation to 5 people.

The restaurant was perhaps half full at most through the entire time we were there.  The first four of us ordered a complete meal as planned.  When the 5th person said that she would not have anything, the waiter immediately responsed, quite harshly, that everyone has to order a full meal on weekends.  He went over to the owner to check with him who came over and reluctanty said 'this time, but we don't allow this on weekends'.  Our 5th guest, to keep the peace, ordered a salad.  Notwithstanding I was embarrased and I think the owner should be embarrased.  4 people ordered full meals....it should not have been such a big deal to have a 5th tag along.   I understand that the restaurant is in the business of serving meals and drinks to make money.   If the restaurant was full I might understand the attitude, but it was nowhere near the case.  

I regret not making a bigger fuss over this when I was there, but I did now want to put on a show in front of my company.  However, I will speak with my wallet.  We have gone to this restaurant several times over a number of years, but it is unlikely that we will go there again.  I don't want to go to a place that makes their guests as uncomfortable as we were made to feel that evening."}
{"text":"Place is super old skool with lots of funky decor.  Had mlusical entertainment throughout the night - pianist and a violin.  The schnitzel is to die for. The size was very big, I say almost enough for 2 people.  Staff was friendly and attentive asking if you need anything else a few times and refilled our water.  Nice place will be back for sure"}
{"text":"It feels very cozy once inside. It feels like you're in Eastern Europe and not in Richmond Hill. It is one of the few authentic European restaurants if you're not looking to head to Toronto. 

I had the cabbage rolls and many of the other customers had the schnitzel. Another popular dish is the goulash. The cabbage rolls were stuffed with meat and rice, and topped with sour cream and some potatoes on the side. The potatoes were chewy and slightly crisp on the outside. The rolls were cooked in a tomato sauce. The schnitzel was thin and crispy. I highly recommend pairing it with red cabbage and potatoes. 

Beware of the amount of meat. I don't eat a lot of meat so I found it a bit heavy. The service was also a bit slow, but the staff were all very friendly. Overall, good atmosphere, food, and experience."}
{"text":"I love Hungarian food and I must say this is as good as it gets for authentic.  Parking is not a problem. The decor is a bit of a shocker. The price is right. The selection of wine is minimal, beer is a better choice. The live music on the weekends is a bonus. We tip the musicians when they come to our table for special requests. The  bean soup, cabbage rolls, wiener schnitzel, chicken paprikash, chicken liver, cucumber salad with sour cream, and crepes for desert are  all very good.  As a matter of fact, I have never been dissatisfied and return regularly. The service is good and polite."}
{"text":"Excellent ! Cabbage rolls delicious and chicken schnitzel with cabbage was delicious, as well as the veal paprikash (delicious and hearty but a bit salty for me) the portions were generous and service was fast and pleasant for a Friday evening. I'd recommend reservations thou ! We also had a chestnut type of dessert called gesztenyepüré which was great. We had one appetizer two mains, two glasses of wine and one dessert for $98 tip included. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Very heavy low quality food and Very Expensive !!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! We went for a group dinner last week and the staff was cheerful and helpful on the phone taking our reservation, accommodating for large group of 15. All but two of the group had never been there before and they were all wowed by the quality and presentation. Unanimously said they would all go back again! The menu provided a great variety such as chicken, schnitzel, sausage, goulash...etc. I had some very delicious red cabbage, not too vinegary which I find can happen with cabbage. The cabbage rolls were wonderful - hot and delish with a dollop of sour cream. There were many choices for schnitzel and all were thin and crispy. Very tasty! The home fry potatoes or nokedli (noodles) made a wonderful side. Starter salads were large, very fresh and appealing. Delicate apricot crepes for desert...YUM!
They provided very friendly service and we were very pleased with the food. We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Invited by friends of Hungarian descent, I visited this little gem which is just off major mack &yonge, making it a convenient location. 

Being unaware of Eastern European cuisine,  I let my host choose the food. He recommended the Hungarian Goulash Soup, which was okay but the bread served with the soup was very fresh and crispy.

For mains we were recommended to go for the meat platter but I preferred the famous Hungarian Goulash with rice. My friends had the Goulash but with noodle and a Gypsy steak. The portions are very generous with plenty of meat. Perhaps my Asian palette does not appease Eastern European cuisine but the food was pretty okay. The chestnut puree was amazingly good, highly recommend this dessert that is if you have any space remaining as it is pretty heavy. 

All in all it was a great experience,  just a word of caution,  parking is a problem but if you park behind the restaurant,  there are two lots available. I am not into eating a lot of meat, therefore I found the meat to be an overkill"}
{"text":"The stuffed mushroom caps appetizer was amazing. We pretty much licked the parmesan sauce off the plate, and the schnitzel is big enough to feed two people!"}
{"text":"We went there on a rainy day and sat by the only table by the window. That corner was recently painted and we could smell it though our meal. Our server was friendly yet not too much. She gave us space and came back to answer our questions. The schnitzel was huge! Though paper-thin, it was very flavourful.  I'd like to go back soon in the evening, I am sure it will be a different experience with live music, good food sans the smell of wet paint."}
{"text":"This may have been my first time trying Hungarian food so I don't have anything to reference but regardless, the service and tastes of the meal were remarkable!  It is a small, cozy place that feels authentic although decor is probably now very dated.  The server (who may have been an owner) was very attentive.  There was a musician who played accordion and then piano.  

For apps, we ordered the stuffed mushroom caps with spinach in cream sauce and the cabbage rolls.  The cream sauce was oh so velvety and cheesy. Cabbage roll was meaty but still light.  For my main, I ordered the chicken parm only because I knew that they would schnitzel it up and I have no regrets.  It was the thinnest piece of fried chicken ever, drowned in oh so rich tomato sauce and mozzarella. The portions are quite large.  I tried some of the Paprika Chicken and it was also very tasty and moist.  

This was an excellent first taste of Hungarian food and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Tired of all the same old same old? Rhapsody is a Hungarian restaurant with a menu of veal, beef, goulash and schnitzels of course. The schnitzels are perfect. They are paper thin so one doesn't get the oil and the fat, but are large so one is not left hungry.
The menu has a half a dozen schnitzel options. We had a schnitzel and a goulash and both are recommended.
The pianist entertains the diners on Friday and Saturdays. The atmosphere is somewhat old-fashioned, which just adds to the uniqueness of this restaurant.
The owner-cum-waiter is polite and understated, but brings a kind personality if the customer demands it. He is not pushy in any way, which is appreciated.
There used to be a nice Hungarian restaurant on Bloor Street that is not there anymore. With that gone Rhapsody may be the only such restaurant in the GTA, but they are not resting on their laurels and doing a good job."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, the atmosphere to the food. Come on a weekend and they have love music, piano and singer usually. Nothing bad to say about this place. Excellent menu! Can tell its family run."}
{"text":"Outstanding little gem for authentic Hungarian food.  Been here a few times and will continue to come back and recommend.  But be warned you must have reservations or you are taking a chance go walking away hungry and wishing you called."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I ordered the goulash. The service was friendly too. I will definitely be returning to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Hungarian and Central EU food. The atmosphere is dated but has a home style feel to it. Live music on the weekends and great cabbage rolls and goulash. As good as trips to Budapest and Prague for similar fare."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The service is quick and friendly.

And the food is wonderful. Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Very cute place.  The Goulash soup was huge and big enough for 4 people.  There were 6 of us and we ordered 2 soups for 2 people which ended up feeding all 6 and still lots left.  

I wasn't a big fan of the schnitzel and we had 3 different ones ordered.  Too thin for my liking and I tasted more bread than meat and since I am not a big fan of bread, it wasn't my fav.  The cabbage was delicious.  The noodle appetizer was way too carby for my liking and too much flour.  

Overall, the place is nice, the guy who plays the instruments is very talented and its nice to listen to his music while you are eating real authentic Hungarian food.  The 2 other family members with us really love the food here.  I guess everyone has different taste.  I have had way better tasting Schnitzel elsewhere.  BUT, I think you should try this place for the experience.  The owners are very nice and friendly too and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Ever since we had some great European food in the west end, I've been searching for European food in the Richmond Hill/Markham area.  Rhapsody is the first one that I found and I was really hoping that I don't have to go all the way to Etobicoke/Mississauga.  Unfortunately, the food that we had last night wasn't too tasty.  We notice that everyone was getting schnitzels after we already order the beef stroganoff and cabbage rolls.  The cabbage rolls were bland and the beef was a bit salty.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes.

The service was very good and there was live piano music so it made the evening very enjoyable.

We will probably come back and give it another chance and try the schnitzels."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious food. I always have the chicken schnitzel with dumplings.  Best chestnut dessert too."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It's a true family-run restaurant and they really care. Try the platter for two - it's a mountain of food.  It comes with 3 types of Schnitzel, sausage, red cabbage and rice.  Prices are very reasonable.  On some evenings they have a band playing traditional gypsy music.  You can almost imagine you're in rural Europe, even if you're suck in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Yes, the decor kinda threw us off when we walked in, looks a bit dated and not a whole lot of customers on a Thurday night. 
The server (suspected to be the owner)  was friendly, he offered assistance to answer questions about the cuisine, never rushed us, and attentive to us the entire time.
We ordered chicken cordon bleu and beef goulash. Food served out just in time and tasted wonderful, nothing too fancy, portion was perfect.

The cordon bleu looks small but the sides make it proportional. And the nokedli with beef goulash was cooked to the perfect temperature and texture. 

Nowadays with so many options, its difficult to find a restaurant that does everything right, not over the top, but everything was to satisfactory. 

What really surprised me was they keep the place so clean, very clean, even the floor was spotless clean!  That shows the dedication to the business and guests."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. There are not many European restaurants in that area, and this is the best you could get if you don't want to go to Etobicoke or Toronto. 

You need to make reservation as it is a small restaurant. We went twice recently on a friday and sunday evening and they had someone played piano there and it was very relax and enjoyable.

We had chicken and veal paprika, chicken schnizel. The schnizel would never disappoint you!! Very thin, cryspy and tender. yummy.   The paprika were so tender and went very well with rice."}
