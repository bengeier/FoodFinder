{"text":"Decent food mostly. Nothing spectacular. Scallops were gritty which is pretty off-putting . Service was not good, the waitress seemed to take issue with just about any request and forgot items on several occasions. If the service were better I'd consider returning since the location is nice, but I can spent my money better elsewhere."}
{"text":"The dining room has a really charming décor with a cozy and romantic ambiance. We popped in on a whim for a late dinner about 8ish on a Saturday back in December. Surprisingly they were not busy so we were seated immediately. I'd recommend this place for a special occasion dinner when you have time to enjoy a meal at a leisurely pace. We were brought fresh slices of bread and the olive oil was already on the table but strangely we didn't have any balsamic vinegar. I ordered the Ravioli Di Patate Dolci Giapponesi Al Gorgonzola which is a Japanese sweet potato pasta in a Gorgonzola cheese cream sauce. The ravioli was delicious and the to-die-for sauce rich & creamy!"}
{"text":"I'll be blunt, my experience here was in a word, disappointing. The service was subpar at best, and their pizza just plain sucks. I had their \"signature\" margarita (sp) pizza which can be best described as a soggy mess of oily cheese on an even soggier crust. That was preceded by a salad that had canned pears and easily a full cup of stale walnuts dumped on it. I hate writing bad reviews, so I'm being generous with two stars."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant for dinner and ordered the sea bass.  It was delicious and it came with a side order of vegetables. I really like this place and will return in the future."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. So much so that we take all our out of town guests here for dinner. On our most recent visit, 3/21/15, not only were our meals fantastic but our server was wonderful as well. We even braved the BBQ fest traffic to visit!"}
{"text":"Ok so to be fair, I'm giving 4 stars here based on how I'm averaging everything. First of all, the food here is AMAZING. Be prepared to wait if you order a baked dish because it is all made the moment you order. It's worth it though. Personally, my favorite is the Orechiette Alla Norma - Fresh Orechiette pasta, sauteed eggplant, garlic, fresh mozzarella and salted ricotta cheese in a hearty tomato sauce. VERY fresh ingredients. I believe they use ricotta salata which they freshly grate on top. OMG SO GOOD. I've also tried the manicotti and ceasar salad, etc. ALL the food is great.
SO..what to improve. Each time Ive been there, there has always been the same waitress working the whole place herself. Most times this is no biggie but there are times where she is clearly overworked and stretched too thin. I don't mind waiting for the food but I want it right when it comes out, as this place does it all right-made to order, fresh, piping hot deliciousness. They could use a busboy or some help at times. Just a suggestion :)
If you love Italian, you HAVE to try La Stalla!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Try it!

Adorable, small restaurant, so make a reservation.  The service was top notch.  Full bar, including a fairly extensive wine list.  I had the Insalata Pera e Gorgonzola (mixed greens with pears, walnuts, gorgonzola, and blue cheese dressing) and the Stuffed Asiago Gnocchi (potato dumplings stuffed with potatoes and asiago cheese.)  Both the salad and entree were delicious!  The gnocchi was particularly interesting as I hadn't had cheese in gnocchi before.  If you haven't had gnocchi before, be forewarned that it is a very rich and filling dish.  I took at least half of it home with me.  It heated up well for lunch the next day.  My friends ordered the Calamari Fritti appetizer and I have to say that it didn't look too special.  Everything else looked great though, and there were certainly no complaints at our table.  There is a small selection of desserts on the menu, but we were all so full that we couldn't partake.  I definitely need to come back to try other menu items including the Prosciutto e Melon.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Food-wise, I'd give the place another star, but the waitress ruined it for me. La Stalla is located across from the historic San Marcos hotel. It is a very intimate place, bordering sappy-romantic, Italian restaurant.

I dined here for a business talk with  possible clients (two awesome children's book authors, by the way). They love this place and I don't blame them.  The food is excellent! I had the gnocchi with tomato sauce, topped with slices of fresh mozarella. It wasn't the most divine gnocchi I've ever tasted, but it was certainly delectable. I wished the gnocchis were a little less play-do like (not that I've ever tasted play-do) and a bit more pillowy. Can't complain about the sauce.

One of my dining partners had chicken soup, which seemed the perfect food for that rainy evening. The other had the chicken marsala, which was devoured heartily. The heavily sauced plate was wiped clean with fresh-baked bread and olive oil. Yes, it's that good!

Oh, and the pinot noir from the Russian River area was superb. it was delicate and the aroma was not overwhelming...just the way I prefer.

Here's the problem : KIM. She was our waitress and I think she really should take a lesson about \"when to butt in without being rude.\" Don't get me wrong, she was attentive...in fact too attentive, bordering rude. Remember that this was a business dinner meeting so we had a lot of topics to cover, and KIM managed to butt in at anttime stopping the momentum of what I and my possible clients were discussing. It was flat out annoying. I would be in a middle of a sentence, and she would blurt out, \"care for some more bread, are you doing alright?\" Don't you think that she should've waited for the window of pause and ask that question when that arose?!!!

Well, I didn't finish my pasta dish because KIM kept asking evey 10 minutes if I was done with my meal. Annoying!

Anyway, I highly recommend the place because of their food. But by golly, run out the door if the waitress introduces her self as KIM."}
{"text":"It was our first time there with my fiance and the service was horrid. We heard nothing more than \"do you know what you want\" to take our order and \"are you all finished\" after. No hello, have you been here before, welcome anything like that. The food was great, but service ruined the night. Won't be back, ever. Too Many good Italian places with good service."}
{"text":"If you love authentic Italian food in a festive, holiday atmosphere, La Stalla is the restaurant to try. They have an extensive wine list and they give  you enough  wine  to enjoy the evening. 

We were a party of 8 on a Friday night and the service was superb. The wait staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. 

My minestrone soup was warm and delicious.  The grilled salmon was prepared well and served with steamed veggies that included cabbage.  I love steamed cabbage but since  most restaurants tend to overcook cabbage, La Stalla stole my heart. My group also ordered the lasagna and sweet potato ravioli. These dishes were made with fresh ingredients and well presented.  The desserts were delicious but my all time favorite dessert was the tiramisu. 

La Stalla Cucina is a great place to take your guest during the upcoming holiday."}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a good Italian restaurant since we moved here a year ago, and finally found a great one at La Stalla. The food was exceptional, and our waitress was wonderful and funny. I wish I could give more stars. My husband and I both ordered the chicken parm and shared a wonderful creme brûlée. The portions are large, so go with an appetite. Our water glasses were never empty. Now to find a good German restaurant..."}
{"text":"I moved to the Chandler/East Valley area in late March.  Since then, I've been doing a lot of eating in restaurants...and I will only mention this one...it WOWed me!! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that I felt it was a bit expensive (i.e $16 for a vegetarian pasta dish).
However, this place only had one other large table of people-all speaking Italian and having a great time. I had a penne pasta with roasted tomato sauce, eggplant (which I normally hate), mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  The bread is worth eating a bit of-as it is warm, authentic italian style bread. I couldn't stop eating the pasta-the portions are on the big side-which helped me accept the higher prices. I ate half and it was great the next day as well. Wonderful wine selections...great service. This place is a true representation of good italian food-I would recommend it to ANYONE-especially those who agree that Olive Garden does NOT qualify as authentic italian food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 1 pm on a Thursday.  Two of us.  Had an iced tea that was horrible.  Probably from a bottle or can, was not fresh brewed.  Then we waited.  And waited.  20 minutes we sat there waiting to give our order.  There were 2 large tables that were getting ready to leave.  There was no excuse for the service.  There was a young server and a lady and they never once came to take our order.  Will never go back.  We walked out and went down the street for lunch.  What was strange is that both servers were just wandering around the restaurant.  Almost like they didn't want to serve us.  There were no other tables ordering and I find this just odd. Bad business practice for sure."}
{"text":"Ahh, what can I say.  The food is simply delizioso.  Went there tonight on an off chance for fine Italian and I was not disappointed.  The Pollo Al Limone was breathtakingly good.  My husband had the Pollo Alla Parmigiana -- hmm the food was melt in your mouth good.  Previously had tried a neighborhood Italian place in Chandler and it did not hit me at all.  This one in downtown Chandler is definitely worth the trip.  Topped off dinner with the Limon Gelato -- wow -- delicious, light and satisfying. They have lunch specials for $6 so I will be back to try those also."}
{"text":"This was a true let down of an experience. Food was clearly not fresh. The ambiance was a classic tacky Italian theme, which you could find at any little Italian spot. I love tacky so this worked for me, but the power cords all visible did not. The service was slow and we waited way too long to even be greeted. About 8 minutes. The specials were on a piece of paper and not explained so we were off to a slow start. 

On to the food. The olive oil that sat in a clearly old reused bottle was spoiled and not pleasing. When we did get bread after a wait it was good but upon the refresh for the bread it was a focaccia instead of the baguette like before, that was not warm and delicious like the first batch. The server also had balsamic in a bullet that he spilled on the napkin it was resting on before it got to the table. Just sloppy service points. 

The burrata got there and was not a bruschetta like it said on the menu. A lot of prosciutto on the plate, 7 total grape tomatoes, and burrata. It was decent, but arrived before we got the bread mentioned above. 

Next was the cannellini and pasta soup and Gorgonzola pear salad. The soup was under seasoned and sloshed on the rim of the bowl. It was undersalted and definitely beans from a can versus fresh like we were told. The pears and bleu cheese dressing were also from a can being mushy on the pear front, and processed on the dressing front. Overall a let down, but appeased us once we added some salt and pepper. 

Entree was the gnocchi in tomato sauce with mozzarella and fusilli pesto with mushrooms and pancetta. The fussili was decent overall but bland like the rest of the courses. The gnocchi was not even close. The sauce was definitely out of a can and blended with some basil, so nothing to write home about. The actual gnocchi was shameful at best. They had the texture of mashed potatoes bound with a touch of flour and no salt. It smooshed into the side of the bowl with the back of the fork, and left imprints as it was not either mixed properly, or boiled and blanched properly. It was definitely not seared in the pan for texture that the dish needed, but if it was cooked properly originally we would have been able to look past that as it is a preference for crispy. When I made sure to explain how it is not properly cooked, our server joe (joeseph as it read on the receipt) told us there's nothing they could do to fix it. Offered no apology. And still charged us for it at the end. Never spoke to, or even saw a manager on the floor. This would have definitely helped us to explain further how to help with future guests. 

I have been in the hospitality industry for 15 years holding multiple chef titles specializing in overhauling restaurants systems and standards. I want to make sure that they can improve on the finer points and make downtown chandler that much better for food."}
{"text":"The BEST place for Italian and the service is phenomenal (especially if you have the pleasure of being served by Tina).

I have celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, brought out of town family and business folks here and I get the same reaction from everyone...this place is amazing!!

They always have great specials, sometimes things like boar or rabbit and you can always count on a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Really, for the price, I expected more. I had the lasagna. I'm wondering if I ordered the wrong thing, because this place has some pretty stellar reviews on here. For similar prices though, for me, the food is better at Macaroni Grill and Oregano's. Additionally I found the ambiance to be pretty stifling and the waitstaff not terribly friendly to two people who came in wearing casual clothing."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday, it was my first visit. It was very busy but we were seated within the timeframe we were told, about 15 mins which really is not bad for a Saturday night. It was uncomfortably hot inside so we asked the manager if she would please turn the ac on & she did so we were comfortable by the time dinner arrived. I ordered the veal, my fiancé ordered the lasagna, my best friend ordered the balsamic steak, & her boyfriend ordered the lamb. His lamb was a little gamey but he still enjoyed it, & the rest of us were very happy with our meals. As far as entrees, the calamari wasn't the best (missing that crunch I like) but the prosciutto with assorted cheese was really good. I'd definitely go back if I'm in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant in downtown Chandler is a very good place to go to for a delicious and fulfilling Italian meal.  They have excellent pasta dishes, always friendly service and great ambience.  The homemade lemoncello is delicious. A good place to put on your list of classy restaurants."}
{"text":"Mmmm mmm

At the recommendation of Julie M. we made reservations and it was a good thing we did as it was pretty busy. The restaurant is super cute and has a real Tuscan feel to it. We were seated promptly when our waitress came over to introduce herself...Fredriko! I must say I was a little leary as one of the previous reviews had commented on the bad service she received from this waitress. Lucky for us Fredriko was very friendly and efficient. 

The menu is rather extensive so plan being a bit more descive that day or you'll stare at for a long time. We started with a house salad and enjoyed the complementary bread. The bread was crusty and bit chewy, just like I like it. I found the olive oil to be a little awkward to pour but I soon got over it when I tasted the combination. I had a craving for fish and wanted to know just how fresh it was. Fredriko told me the fish is frozen fresh and brought in daily. I had the Bavette con Vongole - Bavette pasta with clams in a light clam sauce. The sauce was very light in consistency and had a nice smooth flavor to it with just the right amount of garlic. Jill T. ordered the Tortelloni Aurora - Prosciutto & veal filled tortelloni with diced prosciutto cotto & peas in a pink sauce. Jill T. let me try her dish and I think it was even better than my Bavette con Vongole. We ended the meal with a nice dessert that I haven't seen at any of the Italian restaurants I frequent - Fruta di bosco con Zabaione. The dessert was good but a little to potent for our liking.

I'm looking forward to trying their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love La Stalla! The food is always delicious, the staff is friendly and the desserts are to die for!  

We went for a birthday dinner a few nights ago and I had chicken Marsala and my husband had the special which was elk.  Neither of us have ever had elk, and we were not disappointed.  Our friend had the lasagne.  The lasagne is quite possibly the best lasagne I have ever had.  It is a large serving, big enough for two meals.

We had to finish off with dessert, so we ordered the chocolate soufflé as well as creme brûlée!

La Stalla is an awesome choice for a nice, relaxing Italian dinner.  It is not somewhere to run in for a quick meal. Plan to enjoy the wine, your friends and the amazing food.  A little piece of Italy right in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"We always love coming to La Stalla because we feel like family there.  Paolo is a wonderful host & chef.  Ricardo, thank you for the house Italian white wine suggestion...we will get that in the future.

My wife had the Bronzino, cooked to perfection.  I had one of my favorites, the squid ink pasta with seafood...fabulous as usual.  And we had our secret appetizer of grilled sausage & peppers....  Great Italian in the valley, and close to home.  What could be better."}
{"text":"As a follow-up to a negative review for service for La Stalla in Chandler, our review following our New Year's eve dinner is outstanding. The service was excellent even though they were extremely busy the waiter was there when he needed to be and not there when he did not need to be, perfect service. The food was timely and excellent! This place should never be overlooked as it is a gem. Thank You !"}
{"text":"We will not be going back.  The service was slow and lousy. We were sat at a dirty table, had to ask for silverware, napkins and drink refills. There was a terrible smell throughout the restaurant the waitress blamed on the calamari. Come to find out a toilet stall had overflowed and there was feces everywhere in the men's restroom. DO NOT GO FOR HAPPY HOUR!! Totally not worth it. Calamari is chewy texture, barely fried, and way over salted. Drinks were sub par. We were never offered the specials. No one cleaned our dirty plates off of the table. Portions were small. Horrible experience overall. The bill was astronomical for the lousy food, terrible atmosphere and awful service. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were searching for a new restaurant we've never been to before and found this place in downtown Chandler. I gave this 4 stars because the staff did not make you feel very welcome when we first entered and we were not greeted by the server with a smile. I wanted to leave but my husband said we should give it a chance and I'm glad we did.
We got there around 4pm so there were only a couple customers beside us. 
We were served warm bread with olive oil and vinegar to start with. It was delicious !
I ordered the ravioli soup and Ceasar salad with chicken. Omg, it was so flavorful and the salad was so fresh. 
My husbands cannoli( ??)  entree was heavenly!
We would like to try it again during the evening hours to experience the patio with lights ambiance. The inside is beautiful."}
{"text":"If I could select 0 stars I definitely would. My husband and I have been coming here for 8 years since we moved to Chandler. Unfortunately, in that time the service and quality of food leaves less and less to be desired. Despite the poor reviews La Stalla has been receiving recently, my husband and I decided to come in for dinner.  What a mistake! We were one of three parties in the restaurant.  Which would lead you to believe the service should be attentive. However, it was not.  Our waitress disappeared throughout our meal, stating that she would bring something and then go MIA.  She then spilled the oily sauce that my husband's meal was swimming in on my purse. When I said something to her, she asked if she had done that. (What??? She can't be serious right?).  She sheepishly apologized and then scurried away. The owner/manager came over and barely said she was sorry and then gave us the check!?!  I understand that accidents happen but feel the way the situation was handled was shameful on their part especially since we have been going there for so many years. Safe to say, we will never go back."}
{"text":"We visited La Stalla for Happy Hour with another couple after it was recommended to us by a friend who frequents \"happy hours\" around town. 

The Happy Hour prices were extremely reasonable and the food was quite tasty and well portioned.  We ordered the bruschetta al pomodoro, calamari fritti and three pizzas -  Funghi E Prosciutto, Margherita and sausage.  

Our waitress, Kami, had such attention to detail !  She made sure we got our \"Happy Hour\" drink prices in (we arrived a half hour before Happy Hour was over) but didn't serve our wine until we were finished with the previous glass so that our white wines stayed chilled !!  She refilled our water constantly and gave us just the right amount of attention.

Food and service at La Stalla will assure that we will definitely visit again and highly recommend this restaurant !!"}
{"text":"We went back for lunch on a Sunday  and it was fantastic. Reasonable prices and the food was SO good! I had salmon that absolutely melted in my mouth with a tasty side of steamed veggies. Planning another lunch trip soon!"}
{"text":"management is rude and obnoxious.  they also spread rumors about people. the food may be good but almost every one there is self centered and don't mind talking crap about people.  so unless you would like to be insulted about the way you look or put down because you have a family,  DON'T go to this restaurant! !"}
{"text":"The place was pretty busy when my husband and I visited one night. 
The decor was ok but very kitschy.
My husband and I split the pear salad although the pears were the ones out of a can. 
The special that night was beef cheeks which if you are familiar and like them, they can be amazing. But I could barely find them on the plate because they were drowned in a heavy overpowering sauce.
My husband had the lasagna which was decent and I honestly had more of that then my entree.
For what we had, it was totally overpriced. I could imagine Olive Garden would be just as good."}
{"text":"Tiramisu so thick and creamy you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. That's usually the sign of a good Italian restaurant and I'm glad this place is in downtown Chandler.

This place is still a little sleepy on week nights, but is really busy on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"This place are authentic, the food was outstanding and the all ambience let you feel like in Italy, we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was wonderful! The atmosphere was romantic and rustic, the food tasted like something out of old world Italy and the staff was friendly. This is definatley the place to go for a romatic night out. I recommend saving room for one of their desserts."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice atmosphere, several good Italian beers on tap and a wonderful wine selection.   

The problem is I have eaten here four times in two years. The two times I had seafood with the pasta I got sick. Like almost food poisoning sick. 

Normally I would not have gone back after the first time but my wife loves the atmosphere here. So after 6 months or so I would give in and give La Stalla another try. The seafood appetizer did not sit well with her this last time so we won't be going back again for another try in 6 months. 

This place is busy when the resort is full and not so busy other times so maybe we were just unlucky and got some old seafood.  The problem I had with the non-seafood dishes I tried is that they were just OK and you can get just OK Italian food in Chandler at several other places for 1/2 what this place charges.

We had excellent service 3 times and rude service once."}
{"text":"Started with bruschetta. It was very good tomatoes very fresh, excellent olive oil. The sweet potato ravioli was amazing, very rich. We also tried the chocolate soufflé ....yummmmt!!"}
{"text":"The chocolate soufflé is to die for!! I come here every year for my birthday and always leave extremely happy. The staff is very helpful. The atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyable. The food and wine is delicious! I will continue to come here! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place was open past nine on a Thursday night.  I'll give four stars for that alone, but in all seriousness, our dining experience was very pleasant.  The waiter was excellent, knowing exactly what to say and do at all times, and the food was very good.  Sometimes I'm disappointed in pasta dishes at Italian restaurants; often they seem to taste better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld, but the Penne alla Norma was very tasty.  The wine was good, although I could not finish the large amount poured, but at least I felt I wasn't being ripped off.  

Nice atmosphere.  I look forward to trying this place out again, possibly for take-out lunch when the prices are a little lower."}
{"text":"Had 1 hour to eat last night before show.  We walked in off the street just because of the cute decor from the street!  The food was So amazing, service was great and we were out within an hour.  There was a big party in the place, however service was not slowed down.  Very impressed homemade bread, pizza and salad.  Did I say Amazing, Amazing???"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews below a 4 or if I've only visited once, but we had some of the most terrible service I've ever encountered. I brought my friend out to see chandler when she was in town and found this place through Yelp. We were seated at hi top by the bar, which was fine, because it was a busier Friday night. A waiter came over for our drink orders and then.... We got our bottle of wine but not iced teas. We asked again, knowing it was busy, but no dice (that time or the next time we asked). We then asked about the cheese plate. Our server didn't know what was on it and took ten minutes finding somebody who did. It was paltry at best for $14, but that's the nature of cheese plates. We asked about the specials and the waiter went off to find somebody who knew, again. He was gone for 30 minutes. No further service during this time. At this point we were so frustrated that we decided to leave. We asked for the check (which took 10 minutes) and then the waiter very awkwardly asked if he had done anything wrong :/ 

Based on that time only, I would give this place a 1. Since it was my first time and a Friday, I feel like that isn't fair. I did want to leave this review though so management is aware of some deficiencies in service. 

We left, went next door to San Tan on a very busy Friday and had dinner, beers, AND iced teas and were out the door in 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Quite the dichotomy. Food/service 5 stars. The temperature inside was so stifling we were all sweating at our table. Mentioned this to our waitress who said she would take care of it, to no avail. Saw two other tables fanning themselves with their menus. Will make sure we return only November through April."}
{"text":"Food was excellent Great atmosphere Seemed way short on wait staff very slow on service but when they got to you very personable"}
{"text":"Chicken was very tender loved it.
The red sauce had a soft taste as well.
service was very good."}
{"text":"The BEST HAPPT HOUR Spot in Town! Great Italian Food & Import Beers on tap.  This is our secret spot tnat has become quite popular! You Simply MUST Try It!"}
{"text":"Nice place for couple night out. Get good bottle of wine, a little Prosciutto and cheese, followed up by the lamb chops. Great meal! Waiter was very friendly and helpful. Very reasonably priced as well.
Next time will try pizza and wine happy hour."}
{"text":"Not very good food. Way overpriced. Food is over salted to make up for the taste. Waiter was not very attentive. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner that we happened upon.  All six of us had something different and it was all amazing.  Lovely decor and prompt service.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"we wait for 20 min till the wine was served, got the wrong salad, but they bring what we ordered, once we done with the salad we got the bread, then my pasta was al dente dente....... I guess it was cooked only for the half time what it should be for al dente. I traveled 4 times a week to Italy from Switzerland,  and I know Italy food. 
It was a busy night, but that is no excuse for me, I still pay the same price."}
{"text":"Love it! Love it! Love it! This is the perfect date night. Everything on the menu is homemade and super good. Ive been comming to this place for years and have never been disappointed. When you go make sure you get lemon chello shot at the end of your meal., the owner makes it himself.  Every dessert is super good and worth saving room for.  There have been times I have had slow service, but Im on a date so I dont mind too much.  Please try it out one time, and support real homemade food and not a chain."}
{"text":"A pretty large group of us decided to try out this spot for an early dinner.  First visit and we really enjoyed the experience.  Although they offer the typical Italian fare they also do some unique twists and menu items.  Everyone at the table ordered something different and it was all delicious.

Nice atmosphere and a welcoming staff.  It literally feels like you are hanging at a friends home.  Our server was having a bit of an \"off\" night.  She forgot a few drinks but it was a big group and early in the night so not a big deal.  We would definitely try it again.  A little spendy but a nice change from the typical Olive Garden experience."}
{"text":"\"Old World Italy in Chandler, AZ\" sounds like the set up for a joke.  You wouldn't expect to find one of the best Italian restaurants in metro Phoenix located in downtown Chandler, but that's the case with La Stalla Cucina Rustica. 

The decor clearly conveys the Old World focus of the restaurant.  From the wood tables and chairs to the faux finished walls and the hand painted murals, this place is evocative of rural Italy.  If you've traveled throughout Italy, the atmosphere at La Stalla won't magically transport you back, but you will appreciate the elements that have been gathered together to bring a bit of the old school Italian vibe to downtown Chandler.  After all, that's no small feat. 

The food is traditional and consistently good.  Don't come here for cutting-edge Italian, but for the classics.

For appetizers, the Calamari Fritti ($12) features crispy calamari and a spicy marinara sauce.  I do not order calamari because it's usually not fresh in Arizona, but it's a favorite of my dear friend who lives in Chandler and the La Stalla version is pretty good.  The Pasta e Fagioli soup ($6) is true to the classic and features tender cannellini beans and pasta.  They sometimes feature an appetizer special of stuffed mushrooms that are baked in their brick oven and they are fantastic.

For pasta dishes, the Tortelloni Panna Proscuitto e Piselli ($18) includes tortelloni pasta with ham and peas in a cheese cream sauce.  It's unbelievably rich.  We're talking heart attack on a plate rich, but it's darn tasty.  Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18) is another true-to-form old school dish.  It features spaghetti with smoked pancetta in a parmesan egg cream sauce.  The BF enjoys the Risotto Agli Scampi ($19) that combines baby shrimp and arborio rice.

In the entree category, Involtini di Vitello ($23) is the favorite of my Chandler friend.  It features mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal and pan seared in a sherry sauce.  Personally, I avoid this dish due to the veal.  I'm starting to come around to veal and will try it as soon as I find a restaurant that offers true free range veal.  Be sure to ask about the specials because they are often excellent and even the vegetables served alongside many of the entrees are perfectly seasoned. 

Here's an admonition to La Stalla and other spendy Italian restaurants in Phoenix:  Grated parmesan cheese (even Parmigiano Reggiano) is not a controlled substance.  It's cheese, not crack.  Please do not make a huge deal out of spooning out the tiniest amount for me on top of my soup or pasta.  When I ask for grated cheese, just leave me a small bowl at the table to use at my discretion.  You can trust me to not bring a Ziploc bag to steal what I don't use during my dinner.  If the cost of the cheese is an issue, then tack a dollar or two onto each dish and be done with it because the food cost of the cheese should already be factored into your prices.  The cost of the grated cheese at La Stalla should not be an issue because the price point of the menu has risen noticeably in the past year.

For desserts, the standout is the Fruta di bosco con Zabaione ($9).  It's a mix of seasonal berries topped with Grand Marnier Zabaione sauce.  I always marvel at the perfect, beautiful berries that La Stalla manages to source at all times.  The Zabaione sauce is generously flavored with Grand Marnier and sugar and it's whipped up to a delightfully fluffy texture.  It's flat out fantastic!  The Chocolate \"Souffle\" ($10) is more of a molten chocolate cake than a true chocolate souffle that you would find at Christopher's.  However, it's the favorite of my Chandler friend, so it often gets ordered.

If you're lucky, you will be offered a shot of the housemade Limoncello to finish off your meal.  It's popular and they often run out, but it is the perfect end to a meal at La Stalla.

La Stalla is a bit spendy.  Dinner for two can easily near $100 with appetizers, soups/salads, pasta dishes or entrees, desserts, drinks, tax and tip. The quality is definitely worth the expense, but this is not your inexpensive neighborhood Italian joint.

As my Italian Grandmothers would say, \"Mange! Mange!\""}
{"text":"We dined here last night and were very impressed with the place. We made a reservation and I'm glad we did because it was pretty busy when we arrived; however, we spied a bar where people seemed to be waiting. The decor is nice and the place is homey and comfortable without being cramped. I don't think there really is a bad table in the house. 

Service was excellent, friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and wine list. The wine list was impressive with some very unique offerings. We ordered a lovely bottle of white and I love that our waiter brought the ice bucket without having to be asked. Little touches like that make this a lovely place. (I also love any Italian restaurant that doesn't have the words \"meatball\", \"spaghetti\" and \"marinara\" on it; all these words are wonderfully absent)

I had the pappardelle mari e monti which was a spinach pasta served with scallops and a porcini tomato sauce. It was excellent. The pasta was cooked very well and still had a bite. The scallops were well done and the sauce, with burst cherry tomatoes and porcini mushrooms complimented the scallops beautifully. 

My husband had the squid ink pasta which is a fairly new item on their menu, we learned. The seafood was all cooked very well and the pasta was again properly cooked with a nice bite. The flavors were good but my husband was hoping for more of a distinctive flavor from the squid ink. 

We will definitely be coming back to enjoy their brick oven pizzas which looked excellent and their chocolate souffle."}
{"text":"Want to give more stars but.... The food is good, not great. The restaurant is nice and in an ideal location. The service was fine. It took a long time to get our meals.
The bruschetta was bland- anemic tomatoes, not enough basil or garlic. We tried two different veal dishes. The saltimbocca was tough and boring. The  involutini was really tasty.
Unlike other yelpers, we liked the authentic feel of the paper on the tables. The place was busy for a Wednesday night and they had live music. We will try happy hour or lunch specials next time. We don't like to spend that kind of money for food that is just \"good\"."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!!! From the bruschetta to the limon chicken to the special of the day... Every bite was wonderful. The lemon sauce on my chicken was so flavorful! I've never had better!!! The restaurant itself is lovely, and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places I've had Italian food in a very, very long time. The wait time was less than the standard length I typically experience in downtown Chandler and the staff was very pleasant. I ordered the Orechiette Alla Norma $17 and it is absolutely worth every cent. The serving size was more than gracious- plenty of leftovers to bring home. It had the perfect combinations of flavors and was made with delicious fresh cheeses. My boyfriend ordered a sweet potato ravioli dish and also raved about the taste. I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"The caprese salad was pretty good.

The lasagna was good but way too greasy, I guess the cheese did the damage (to my diet, lol).

Good coffee. 

Good service although a little slow.

Great place in Chandler if you don't have too high expectations.

Fair prices."}
{"text":"We went to La Stalla on a Saturday night. It's a warm, cozy restaurant that appears to attract an older crowd. Reservations were not needed.

First, the bread you get to start seems commercially made. It's really unremarkable and not worth eating on it's own (or with the balsamic they give you). Instead, hold onto it and use it to mop up the sauce from your entree.

Second, during the summer they have a pre-fixe menu. If you're on a budget, one person can get the pre-fixe and the other just an entree and you'll have more than enough food. It's three courses and a glass of wine, so it was a great deal.

Third, prices online appear to be lower than in the restaurant (although I could be wrong; it just seems cheaper online than what we saw at the restaurant).

We did just that--pre fixe and entree-- and started with a generous caprese salad. Thick slices of tomatos and mozzarella. It was delicious.

Next, hubby got the tagliatelle alla toscana. It was really just average. Instead, you should get the sweet potato ravioli. Eat just three of your six three-bite pods, and use that bread you've been saving to fill up on the sauce (after all, the cream sauce won't be nearly as yummy the next day!).

We finished with the cannoli, which weren't overly sweet. Two small lemon-ricotta filled (we couldn't taste the white chocolate) ones."}
{"text":"We went last night after making reservations, even though we didn't make them for the patio, they were very accommodating and put us out there with no problems.  Very friendly hostess, waiter Ricardo was the bomb!  We had the calamari, little too rubbery mushy for me.  Also had the bruschetta yummy, fresh flavors.  Husband had the lasagna, loved it...sopped up the sauce with the bread, yum.  I had the alla Toscana OMG!  Hearty meat sauce, complex flavors, nice pasta, I will be back for this dish! Finished up with the chocolate souffle....wish I could have licked the dish.  

Highly recommend the genuine flavors of southern Italy....

It gets noisy in there, the patio is great but small.  Reservations could not be made until 8:30 pm on Saturday night.  Otherwise, great experience, will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Wait staff is super friendly, courteous and prompt. I went once for lunch and dinner. Their meals are interesting, unique and very delicious for the price. The price, although higher than your mom and pop stores, is very reasonable for the quality of food you get. The creme brulee is the highest quality I have had in the East Valley. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I do not know what is going on at this place.  Big sign out front ($8.00) lunch specials.  This is the second time this has happened.  I took friends there last week for lunch.  I asked for the \"lunch menu\" and was given a menu.  I inquired about lunch, and the waitress emphatically stated \"this is the lunch menu.\"  This did not show the $8 specials.  After we had the regular lunch I asked the waitress about this and she said \"you did not say you wanted the special lunch menu.\"   She said \"I gave you the lunch menu.\"  I don't think they should advertise this special and then try and prevent patrons from having it.  Also, they advertise \"Happy Hour\" but you have to personally walk around to the bar and order your drink even it you are having diner in order for Happy Hour to apply.  I don't understand this \"bait and switch mentality.\""}
{"text":"For the look and feel of a mom and pop / non-corporate restaurant, it seemed like the meals were almost prepackaged from the frozen section of a grocery store. We got the calamari (rubbery), Caesar salad (not bad but not special), orecchiette (chewy), and lasagna. Even the table bread tasted exactly like what I buy from the grocery store. None of the food was terrible, but none of it tasted remotely fresh or scratch-made, which is what I expect for the price."}
{"text":"Service- A+ as soon as I walked through the door I was greeted with a smile. I asked for a to go menu and was offered a seat at the bar and water while I made my selection. I had a couple of beers and a nice conversation with the bartender. 

Food A+ It was good and some of the best Italian food I have ever had. Seasoned well, cooked to perfection and it was a big portion for the right price. I had the Pollo al Marsala topped with a excellent mushroom marsala wine sauce. Hmmmmm.....delicious!!!!! 

Although I didn't eat there my experience was great and very clean place. I highly recommend eating here. I'm glad I did. I went to a place right next to the hotel I'm staying in but chose to leave after the service was disappointing from the moment I walked in. Totally different experience at La Stalla. Thanks for the great food and great service. When I come back to town I will visit."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it. The decor is lovely and it is a good atmosphere. But the important part is the food. This is probably as good as Phoenix can get; it will never be amazing Italian - the cooks can't go to a nearby dairy and get fresh cheese, they can't go to a local butcher and handpick the meats, and I doubt they have the time to make the pasta by hand - all of which they do in Italy. But that being  said, they did a good job with the ingredients that they have access to and everything was fine. Better than Olive Garden, and isn't that what you're looking for?
The staff is not effusive in greetings, but definitely not rude. Our server, an older gentleman, was courteous and friendly and spot on the service. Plate used? Replaced? Fork used? Replaced. New dishes for every course, perfect.
And frankly, if you go during happy hour with half off appetizers (REAL appetizers, not cheapo fried stuff - options like calamari, mussels, antipasto, bruchetta, etc) life was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"First timer and the food was GREAT. I think our waiter was having a bad day. HE WASN'T RUDE but he didn't give much warmth. We will return and hope we don't get him again."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and always love it.  The service is friendly and prompt and the food is always delicious.  What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"Holy cow! Best  Italian  food in AZ!! Went here  with  a party of 9 people and everyone loved their food."}
{"text":"Wine was great and the food was even better. Service was definitely lacking some attention, but overall great food, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out this place because I was looking to try a new local Italian spot and this place had pretty good reviews on Yelp. 

I ordered the Shrimp Scampi with zucchini and my husband and I both tried it and loved it! Not only that, the shrimp was king-size and the waitress recommended an excellent white wine that complimented my dish real well. Forgot the name of it though! However, my husband ordered the Tortelloni Aurora and we both agreed it was awful. 

They have a fresh dessert menu, but we didn't try any of the dessert options because we were full from the bread and food. 

The highlight of our time there was definitely the great ambiance and interior decor! 

They have limited menu selections and one of our dishes wasn't so appetizing, so we give this place a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.    Small restaurant which gave it intimate feel.    Located in downtown Chandler across from golf resort on quiet side street.   Went for lunch.   Had about 6 or 7 items on their $7 lunch menu.   Good selections.   We tried the philly cheese steak sandwich that came with fries.    All delicious.    Bread was like home made."}
{"text":"Went with a group of four with a reservation (highly encouraged) and had a great experience. I love the fact that this restaurant is individually owned, has a nice ambiance, and a great selection of authentic Italian food that is not \"americanized\". Tried their burrata special for appetizer with warm bread and prosciutto and it was perfection. Asked for a substitution in the menu for gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce and it was out of this world. The gnocchis literally \"melt in your mouth\". Tried my husband's steak with mushroom and beer sauce and it was equally perfectly executed. Wine selection was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"I really cannot express how I feel about this place with a simple 5 stars. This place was absolutely AMAZING! My boyfriend took us here as a surprise for our first valentine's day together. I was a bit skeptical at first since this is downtown chandler (which I HATE) and I had never heard of it before. Especially because it's the only one around. So we get in and it was very intimate and relaxing. Our server was on top of everything and kept our drinks filled and made sure we were doing okay regularly. We ordered the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto with mushrooms and bread crumbs appetizer. AMAZING! I got the manicotti for my meal. ANOTHER AMAZING dish. My boyfriend ordered their smoke salmon. I do not like fish so I did not care for it but my boyfriend said it was fantastic. Got to take the word of a fish eater. We then went there recently for a date. We got the same appetizer again and it was still great! We also shared a pizza. Their pizza was cooked in a brick oven and came out tasting better than most places we usually go to ie: native new yorker, venezia's, nypd. Prices are amazing and I would really like to try the desserts next time but I am always so full when I am finished eating!

Lets just say I would give this place a million stars and we will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, decor and location. They have their own parking lot, too, which is convenient on those busy weekend evenings in Downtown Chandler when it can be a challenge to find a parking spot close by. The service was good; our server was attentive for as busy as it was. Our group ordered a variety of dishes (Veal, chicken, steak, pasta and pizza) and everyone rated their food 7 out of 10, at best. Not bad, but a bit lacking in flavor and substance. I guess we just expected better based on the atmosphere and other reviews."}
{"text":"I was hoping to give this a better revue. I tried but I just can't. I had the risotto which was not bad but way too much and I would rather asparagus or some other vegetable than that tasteless and teeny shrimp. My daughter had the margarita pizza which again is NOT a margarita pizza. That was not fresh mozzarella. I don't like (boxing) my food up even if I have extra. But this was definitely left at the table. I kind of had the idea when I started to walk into the restaurant. The outside patio is surrounded by big potted dead as a doornail pots outside. Now, I know no one is probably using the patio in the dead of summer but it is the face of the restaurant and it should be kept up. When I walked in I understood why. The whole place looks dated and not that clean. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour on the 1/2 price pizza and apps.

The bartender is the best you will find. He is a doll, and if you show up regularly he'll know what you like. 

The pizzas are great; we usually get the Capricciosa pizza with the Caprese salad. And lots of bread with olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette, and Parmesan. I could fill up alone on the Caprese salad and bread. 

I honestly can't say anything about the other food, because I've only ever been in for happy hour. It's so good, I never want to go for anything but. 

Be sure to get there early, because the happy hour is only good in the bar area, and there aren't many tables. It fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Typically we have a positive review of this place. Not this time. After being seated we didn't get waited on for a full 15 minutes - no water, nothing. Then our waiter absently asked if anyone helped us yet and when we answered no he said it's probably me....and asked do you know what you want? We didn't hear any specials which we heard him explain to the table next to us later. Then he brought the wrong meal that we were sharing. Had to wait at least 25 more minutes - at this point we had been there an hour...never refilled our
water the entire time. will think twice before going back."}
{"text":"I love La Stalla.  The atmosphere is perfect for a date or special occassion.  The thin crust pizzas are delicious, and the tiramisu is perfect.  My husband loves the gnocchi, and the frutti di mare pasta is to die for.  

They are also very generous with the wine, and I've always had excellent service."}
{"text":"The decor was amazing. That is by far the only positive I can muster from my visit. First of all the bread was old. Second of all I ordered a dirty martini and it was served in what appeared to be a miniature martini glass for $9. Now to the food....my husband and I both ordered the specials that were recommended which were osso buco and monk fish. The monk fish could have been cod for all I know it was completely drenched in a heavy vodka cream sauce and was chewy. I could not take more than one bite. The osso buco did not have any flavor and was FAR from falling off the bone and tender. The server did not offer any apologies about the monk fish that I did not eat, nor did she offer any sort of discount or substitution. So, 2 entrees and 3 drinks later the bill was $110 and I was hungry when I left. 
This was the worst experience at a restaurant that I can remember, and it is a shame because as I said, the decor was amazing."}
{"text":"I came here with the fam for dinner before my sister and brother in law headed out of town for the holidays. It's a solid place for Italian food with decent wine list. 

I had the Saltinbocca, which was pretty good. My mom got the lamb and gave me a piece since she couldn't finish. We split a few tiramisu for dessert and they were delicious. Service was great."}
{"text":"We drove 20-plus miles to attend the Greek Festival in Chandler last night, but upon learning of the parking situation, we decided to look for dinner in the downtown area.  
We stumbled upon La Stalla, one of nearly 20 restaurants in the downtown area.  Jeez, are we glad we did! 
From the easy parking, excellent service, complimentary bread service, dynamic menu, delicious entrees & reasonable pricing, we were relieved we made that right choice.  We enjoyed a specialty pizza & size-able Mediterranean salad for $25!
We learned that 'the Rustic Kitchen Stall' has been in operation for 13 years; we weren't surprised by their success!"}
{"text":"Today was my first day at this restaurant. I love Italian food and this little restaurant has it just right. Cozy, friendly, good prices, and yummy food. 

I took my left overs (big plates) home and ate them 7 hours later and to my surprise the food still tastes delicious. Definitely worth it :)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and you could tell that everyone paid attention to the little details. We loved the service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"They should rename this place to \"la little portions cucina rustica.\" I was with the family looking for a nice sit down restaurant in chandler. We came in for a late lunch and were seated promptly.

To tell you the truth, we realized that the place was understaffed since there was only 1 waitress with at least 5-6 tables. It took forever to get our orders in, get us water and then the appetizers finally arrive but she forgets to bring us plates so we can't start eating. I feel for the waitress but the manager really should have staffed better especially when your patrons are starving. 

I would have left this at a 3 star review given the situation if it wasn't for the food. My hubby and I ordered the squid ink seafood pasta which was actually pretty tasty but so tiny in portion size. The family had ordered 2 pizzas as well to share which were thin like paper and not cheap. I felt like I had to fight for my food!

Overall, the experience just left a bad taste in my mouth and did not give me the classy restaurant vibe I had gotten when I walked into the place. Call me a snob, but I expect decent portions and decent service if we are dropping $20 a person on food."}
{"text":"The food was good (sort of).   The red sauce is actually not that good.  But the other pasta without the red sauce very good.    The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 3 is that the bread we got was taken from another table reheated and given to us.   How do I know this.  The first tray of bread was fine.   But the second tray of bread had obvious pieces misshapen and taken from other \"used\" bread and was toasted crisp instead of the previous bread.   Looked the same, but this practice should be stopped.  Lost appetite after that."}
{"text":"Tried the red pepper, capers and black olive pizza today. Probably one of the best pizzas we have ever had, including several in Italy. This place is consistently good. Never had an entree, desert or vino we did not thoroughly enjoy. Service is always top notch! Prices are reasonable too. We keep going back"}
{"text":"Great night!   Great food, great service!  Waiter had wonderful suggestions.  We made reservations for a Saturday night for a late dinner.  Restaurant was busy but we could have probably gotten in without a reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Japanese sweet potato raviolis are to die for. So good, I proposed to my wife there. We go for special occasions like Valentine's day last week, even though prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was not to my expectations. It didn't taste authentic at all. Just average, a little better than Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Took my mom here on a whim for her birthday.  12 of us ate that night and 12 of us left happy!  Great atmosphere and pleasant service.  The biggest disappointment was the pizza, which was clearly not up to the standards set by the other dishes we tried.  Avoid the pizza, however, and you're sure to be blown away by a myriad of great flavors, a solid selection of wines and appetizers and some really unique offerings at this great little restaurant in South Chandler."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday at 4:30 pm, hoping to beat the crowd, I beat the crowd as i was the only one in there and I had to be served by the hostess, I guess no servers on the floor until 5? I was sat at a table in the bar area that wasn't even set yet either, maybe they think single diners don't deserve a real table, but I digress, I ordered the proscuitto and mozzarella baked appetizer, it took a long to come out for an app, as for taste, i found it quite bland and the mozzarella wasn't that good, there are different grades of mozzarella and found this one to be on the cheap side. I loved the bread! olive oil, parmesan balsamic..YUM...entree.. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara, now i love carbonara and have had it many times in my life and I had high hopes for this one, but I was disappointed, I was expecting pancetta and that is what the menu said it was made with so I was expecting a good Italian bacon, and that bacon flavor with a good cream sauce you can't go wrong, but their carbonara is made with a smoked ham that didn't resemble pancetta at all, the sauce was good and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Since it is made with a smoked ham you don't get that good bacon flavor in the sauce. Service was less than desired too, dropped the pasta and never came back and asked how my meal was, I dine alone a lot ( unfortunately ) and some places really treat me well and others don't , I still can't figure out why, Im a 20% tipper if the service is good. I haven't decided if Ill be back or not, it wasn't so bad that I would never go back but it probably won't be anytime soon"}
{"text":"My mom and I went on Sunday. I had the sweet potato ravioli with a gorgonzola cream sauce. It was very good and very rich. It would be better to have in the winter. I should know better, but I really wanted to try it. The sweet potato filling worked very well with the rich gorgonzola sauce. My mom had the cavatelli salcise & broccoli. It was delicious also, light dish and the flavors worked well together. The sweet sausage was excellent. It is hard to find good sausage. I had the limoncello for dessert. It was cool and refreshing. The lemon had just the right amount of tartness. My only wish is that it was more creamy and less icy. My mother had the creme brulee. The custard was perfect, but the crust was burnt. She liked it that way; I do not. The service was very friendly. The restaurant was clean and the decor was very pretty. I felt like I was in Tuscany. We will definitely be going back. I'd like to go back during dinner. We were there for the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Looking for some great \"homemade\" style Italian food close to home, I checked out Yelp for suggestions. I saw this my husband and I figured we'd try it for lunch. It was a shame that the place was nearly empty, but it was a Sunday afternoon and figure most were still in Church and the like. Being one of the few tables few did provide for amazing service. We shared a lunch Caesar salad, which was easily big enough to be a meal for the both of us with freshly shaved Parmesan on top- so yummy! I had a Margarita pizza, which for the price, was huge and my husband had the Chicken Parm on foccicia- SO GOOD and super filling. I've not had pizza that tasted so authentically Italian since being in Venice! We walked out for less than 25 dollars, a great deal! We'll be back for sure, just sorry we hadn't found it sooner!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant - we have eaten there before and took company from California with us tonight and everyone was pleased with their meal

It is authentic food and it is delicious and the variety of choices are excellent - one of the choices I always order is the salmon because it is absolutely perfect - the side salads are terrific too as a compliment to the dinner it is a gem in downtown"}
{"text":"While here in Phoenix on business, I happened upon this gem of a restaurant while staying at the Crown Plaza/Chandler Golf Resort which is across the street.
The server Joe was fantastic and the staff amazing. I also happened to be here, alone on my birthday. My darling other half, found out where I was dining and conspired with the staff to to surprise me with a birthday creme brûlée. Talk about going above and beyond! That is even before I can share my review of the food. I had an antipasti of prosciutto wrapped mozzarella baked under a crust of sautéed mushroom and Italian bread crumbs. Outstanding dish. I followed that with a bowl of pasta fagioli. Although the broth was thinner than the past fagiolis back in New England, the amount of flavor packed in each spoonful was delicious. My entree, Pollo a Marsalla, was great- the two butter tender chicken breasts where in a Marsala mushroom sauce that had a ton of mushrooms and absolutely spot on for flavor. The side of summer vegetables and potatoes were tender and I could have eaten just a bowl of those. The whole dish felt like something your Italian grandmother would serve. I hear their pizza is really good to... will definitely visit again while I am in town."}
{"text":"La Stalla has become my go-to Italian restaurant in the valley. Great entrees that are reasonably priced, excellent service, and the best tiramisu in the valley. You can't not have the tiramisu if you are in the neighborhood. They also have an excellent burrata and proscuitto appetizer and excellent selection of Italian wines. Last time in our very good waitress recommended a sweet red that was excellent (Adesso Emilia-Romagna???)."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry do not go here. This place is slow. The dining room was almost empty and the food took over 40 minutes.  The dining room was also very hot. The waitress did not being us bread. The food was ok but not worth the price or the long wait."}
{"text":"This may well be the best Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area, but there are a couple of others that I want to try (Tomaso's and Alessia's).

We started with the bruschetta (the waitress unfortunately pronounced it wrong, poor training by the management) and it was definitely the best I've had in a long time, actually, since Italy. Bravo!

I ordered the lasagne, and I know it is not a freshly made pasta dish, but I can make most of the other ones at home but I'm too lazy to do lasagne  -  anyway it was delicious. I can't say the same for my friend's meal, who ordered the penne ala norma. It tasted fishy, literally. The waitress asked if he wanted something else, he said no, but they comped it anyway. Now that's a classy place.

For dessert, I wanted the chocolate souffle, but was too full so I went with the tiramisu. It was great, as was the cappuccino. 

Overall a very good experience. Nice ambiance, attentive service, great food, and I can't wait to try the chocolate souffle next time. I also saw a couple eating the pizza margherita and it looks great also (and only $10). I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials. Everything I've had here has been great. I would give this 5 stars but most of the time it seems like the staff is slow and doesn't care a whole about giving good service. Maybe it's that we normally come in as a group of 6 or 8 people but that's still not an excuse to leave drinks sitting empty when we're the only ones in there. 

My favorite is getting the lunch special pizza and having prosciutto added to it. Very filling and only $6.50. That's pretty hard to beat. Especially in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"A pleasant find in Historic Downtown Chandler!   A lovely space with an interior stone wall, wooden beams and an inviting bar area.  While it took a little time for any server to appear, despite the fact that they were not very busy, the food definitely made up for any delays.  

We started with the Cozze e Vongole Saltate - tender sautéed clams and mussels in a delicious garlic broth.  (The female busser keep us well plied with bread to sop up the flavorful broth - but be careful not to fill up too much on bread!)  The salads (Insalata Mediterranea & Insalata Pugliese) were excellent due to the fresh mesclun greens, wonderful cheeses and high quality balsamic and olive oil.  We all had different variations of veal - Saltimbocca alla Romana (tender scallopine with prosciutto in a rich buttery sauce), Vitello alla Griglia (an expertly grilled marinated veal chop - basic but exquisite), and Involtini di Vitello (mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal with a rich sherry sauce with sautéed mushrooms).  The Involtini was especially terrific and our server's favorite recommendation as well.  The vegetables that come with the dinners are also quite good - a mélange of carrots, red potatoes, cabbage.  Even though we had finished our veal, we thought about bringing the extra vegetables home!  

I am always looking for places that are kid-friendly that are not chains.  They were very accommodating to the 10 month old we brought with us, too.  Save room (or take home) the tiramisu: it is unbelievable!  Cappuccino was even noteworthy.  Despite the typos in the menu (pet peeve of mine) and even PRINTED on the beautiful wall of the restaurant (i.e. \"receipes\") - (*gasp* - okay,  HUGE pet peeve of mine), La Stalla Cucina Rustica is a welcome star in a slew of mediocre Italian restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but I need to visit a second time to get something else.  I had the Involtini di Vitello, which sounded good in principle but was just sort of gross toward the end.  It's basically veal wrapped around a core of prosciutto and mozzarella and served in a sherry sauce.  It just wasn't a good choice.  The vegetables that accompanied the dish were fine, but I was a little put out to see \"baby carrots.\"  For one thing, they're not really baby carrots, they're just big carrots whittled down to little nubs and sold in bags.  And for another, I've had those in my lunch every day for the last two weeks, so you'll understand if I'm dismayed to see them make a cameo on my dinner plate at an not-inexpensive Italian restaurant.  My wife had the lasagne, which is usually a good bet.  It tasted fine and our super picky 8 year old had a bite when we got home and loved it.  I should have gone with my gut, which was to order the steak.  Or maybe the Tagliolini allo Scoglio.  The wine list has a reasonable, if small, number of wines available by the glass.  I tried a sangiovese, cab, merlot blend - it was just OK.  For desert, we had the lemon gelato swirled with limoncello.  This was very good.  Despite my so-so entree, I think this place deserves a second try."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted dinner, I was game for whatever, he wanted a nice restaurant. He mentioned this place and got us reservations. We were seated quickly, really no need for reservations when we went anyway. 

We ordered the bruschetta for appetizer. It was pretty awesome, I wish more for of that at least. I ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables. I was surprised at the portion of the salmon was pretty decent. It was well seasoned and flaked perfectly. The vegetables were quite seasoned i must say, I focused on my salmon more so. Overall I enjoyed my entrée.
As for my friend, he ordered the Penne alla Norma. First bite, he stops mid-bite and  says \"OMG, this is good!\" I had to laugh. I agreed, it was pretty tasty. 
Dessert was tiramasu, which was pretty nice as well. Although I wished the marscapone cheese was distributed throughout rather than be the first thing one digs into. I was had to shovel out the yummy lady fingers.

we debated at the end of dinner. I said it was pretty good, but not awesome. Not that I would go running back for more. I would definitely try again, but you won't see me running. The other menu items still look delectably pleasing."}
{"text":"Reasonbly priced Italian wines.  Fair dinner prices.  Wonderful food.  We really enjoyed our dinner at La Stalla.  The chicken marsala had massive amounts of mushrooms.  Salad green were fresh and tasty.  The carbinara was the best since Italy in 2006.  The service was FRIENDLY and PROMPT, steering my husband to a wine suited to his taste.  The atmosphere was pleasant but slightly warm.   We will be back. Wonderful Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Italian place! I can't believe we'd never been here before. The restaurant was clean, the ambiance was nice and relaxing, and the service was top notch. We ordered the Carbonara and the Sweet Potato Ravioli and both were amazing! It was a little pricier than some other italian places we have been, but the quality of service and food made it well worth it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here so many times and it's one of our favorite restaurants.  The ambiance is small and intimate, yet not stuffy.  The service is usually great and the food is awesome.  It can get a bit crowded on a weekend night.  The cavatelli with sausage and broccoli is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Starting off Yelp 2013 with a happy review from La Stalla. :)

Located in the ever growing \"Historic Chandler\" area, La Stalla may look upscale and snobby but its prices are definitely not. Their lunch menu in particular has affordable $6, $7 and $8 items which allow you to give the restaurant a try before you decide to go all out on a fancy date or family dinner. 

Our server was very friendly and gave us about 3 rounds of hot freshly baked break with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and freshly grated Parmesan. We devoured it so quickly that i felt like a cheap college student filling up on the freebies. I mean it didn't stop me from continue to eat them (of course), I just felt bad about it.

I ordered an eggplant sandwich with grilled veggies, mozzarella cheese, basil and a side of thin french fries. At $8 I thought the sandwich decently sized and fresh but I unfortunately found it waaay too oily. It had been sitting in a pool of olive oil which made it very hard to grab and eat (and it was too loose to eat with a knife and fork). I wiped my hands and mouth about a dozen times just to get rid of the oil. The fries were pretty normal and not out of this world. Would have loved to have the option of switching it for a salad or extra veggies since french fries isn't their forte. 

My coworkers enjoyed their food and their outside patio was pretty perfect for the weather that day. I would maybe return to try their dishes and get a bottle of wine if they continue to have their wine deals ($20 at lunch time). Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Our server, Hannah, was very friendly. We had an order of the mussels and a bowl of tortellini soup to start. Both were very delicious. My guest had the gnocchi and enjoyed them very much. I had the sweet potato ravioli and I can barely put into words what I felt.... something like love at first bite. Great dinner."}
{"text":"I love downtown Chandler and really wanted to love La Stalla, but my experience fell a little short in several ways. 

First, the decor is very cute, classy, and welcoming (although I don't like paper table cloths either). 

Our group of 4 came at 7pm on a Saturday night, and it was pretty slow. Disappointing, but it is Chandler..... 

Now I don't usually do pasta since I watch my figure, but I was looking forward to trying a new dish. The bread that comes out was good, but seemed bland with just the olive oil. We got one small basket for the 4 of us, and had to ask for more with our meals. I hate asking for more bread (does that make us seem like pigs?), and wish it would have been offered.....but I get it, it's free and the free shouldn't be abused. 

So my husband and I started with the caprese salad, which was just okay. We asked for a side of balsamic to flavor things up a bit, but it never arrived. I went with the Gnocchi, which was absolutely delicious and absolutely a very fattening dish. The gnocchi was stuffed with cheese, followed by a creamy tomato sauce and chunks of mozzarella. The men of the group had the lasagna, and raved. The pizza looked pretty tasty too. 

Overall, we just weren't all that impressed, especially for the price and the sophisticated vibe that came up short."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a local Italian spot with fresh food to remind us of our trip to Italy a few years ago and we found it at La Stalla.  Great location downtown Chandler, lovely decor, authentic menu with fresh quality ingredients served by attentive staff.  Highly recommend for a date night out."}
{"text":"For starters, the Lasagna is FANTASTIC!!!!!
My husband had the tenderloin tips with mushroom beer sauce, very very good.  My only criticism on that is it should be over mash potatoes or pasta. To end our meal we had Lemoncello flute, and that was perfect.  Refreshing, not too sweet and perfect size."}
{"text":"This is a pretty small Italian restaurant directly across from the Crown Plaza San Marcos Resort.  

The interior was nice.  It had stone walls and nice lighting.  I could have done without the obviously fake orange trees, but over all it was clean and cozy.

It took a little while for my server to come to my table.  Once he arrived he was friendly and helpful.  He recommended a few dishes.  He kept my drink refilled and check on me often.  Overall the service was good.

The meal had a great start with some fresh and hot rustic bread that was server with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  

I ordered the Bocconcini all Prosciutto appetizer which is baked fresh mozzarella cheese wrapped in prosciutto top with mushrooms and bread crumbs.  It sounds great, but was just okay.  I would try something else.

For my main dish ordered the Saltinbocca alla Romana which is veal medallions topped with mozzarella and prosciutto (I know too much like the appetizer).  The veal medallions were great and the vegetables were good.  I thought there was a little too much fresh parsley over the dish.

One of biggest complaints I have is about their menu.  I would have like to be able to order a pasta and main dish together since I was dining alone (being across from a Hotel I would assume they get a lot of parties of 1).    Instead all their pastas come alone and their entrées come with vegetables (which were good)."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant, best Italian food in Chandler. Nice setting with such a family atmosphere. Our whole family gets so excited when we dine there. The bread always comes out nice and hot. Great variety of salads and entrees. They always have a couple specials that are mouth watering. Save room for dessert and try their Lemon chello which is served in a cold champagne glass. Kami is far our favorite employee who always goes above and beyond to make your visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"We like trying new restaurants and had high hopes for a great dining experience.  The hostess was super nice and that's the only reason to give more than one star.  We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly.  The high back wooden chairs seemed appropriate for the decor, but the legs of my chair were uneven by at least 1/2\".  Once I found a spot for the legs on the floor that minimized the rocking back and forth, I forgot about the initial annoyance.

I found our server pretentious and lacking (Chris?).   I ordered the sweet potato ravioli with gorgonzola sauce and our server's response is, \"Do you like bleu cheese?\"  I answered I did as long as it wasn't too strong and then he responds with, \"Well, the gorgonzola is like bleu cheese so you won't like this dish.\"  Why assume I don't know what gorgonzola is?    I ordered something else.  He knows the menu better than I.  We also ordered bruschetta that had eggplant.   To this food request, he states, \"Now this has eggplant on it, you know what eggplant is, right?\"   I was irritated.   Why assume your tables have minimal idea of some basic foods?

The beef dish I ordered had a sauce that seemed to come straight from a stew can.  It was gelatinous and the meat was pale and fatty.   My dining partner liked her dish of the gnocchi but I'm puzzled why she wasn't queried on whether or not she knew what it was.

We were out of water several times and, thankfully, other servers remedied that.  Our server lacked basic serving skills by not filling drinks, bringing dishes out without first making sure the table has space enough for the plates.  Two times we were scrambling to move things out of the way of the incoming food.  He put dirty glasses from one table on the same tray as fresh drinks on their way to be delivered to another table.   Yeah, it's pretty clear I just didn't like him.

The best food item on the table was bread.  Great crust and soft on the inside.

I *might* be willing to try this place again. The restaurant wasn't overly crowded with people pounding their way in the door, but there were enough people there to make me think they were having a good experience and mine might have been an exception.  However, first impressions speak volumes and as long as I don't get the same server, I'd be willing to give it one more try."}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is amazing! The boy and I came here for dinner on a whim one Monday night and the place was poppin! We grabbed a seat at a little table near the bar (the game was on). We started off with a bottle of riesling and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was perfectly cooked and not too greasy and a crunchy crust. They have homemade lemon chello also amazing. I had the gnocchi for my entree. One of the best dishes I've ever had! It was perfect! Flavorful marinara and a sprig of basil. The boy had lasagna and I was a little concerned he was going to leave me for that dish! The entire experience was amazing. My new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were fortunate to dine at La Stalla last night while visiting my mom in Chandler, AZ.   The lasagna is to die for, as is the Tiramisu.  I ordered the sweet potato ravioli in gorgonzola sauce, and it was delicioso.  The bread was yummy too!  Ingredients were fresh and top notch - no canned veggies here.

Chef Ivan Ruiz is extremely dedicated to his craft, and puts together a wonderfully diverse menu.  Owner, Paul, is friendly and welcoming and creates a great atmosphere for his customers.  Service was great.

We'll be leaving AZ soon, and can't wait to return for another 5 star meal at La Stalla.  Try it . . . you'll like it:)"}
{"text":"Looking for Italian in Chandler? This is the place to go! We have been here more times than I can count. 

Highlights:
-Great for small groups or an intimate date night. 
-Calamari is a must. Lightly breaded with garlic marinara sauce
-Gnocchi, Ravioli & Margarita pizza are some favorites
-Reservations recommended on a Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"La Stalla is a great gem in Chandler. It's in the downtown square and the food is excellent. I'm used to homemade Italian food so I have high expectations. I've been there numerous times and have never had a bad meal. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Very, VERY good Italian! The decor is romantic, I would say it's a good date spot. My husband and I took my mom and sister there moments after we told her I was pregnant so again... so alcohol sampling for me, I promise to go back and update this at a later time. We had the calamari appetizer which was actually very good seeing as how AZ so rarely gets anything fresh. We all ordered and we all enjoyed so much that we had to share. The husband and I shared the Tirimisu for dessert while my sister ordered the Chocolate Souffle. Our Tirimisu was divine and the Souffle was just OK. Definitely recommend this place! It's even rather quiet and surprisingly not as busy as I would imagine with the quality of food."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Don't go! Walked in bad hostess with an attitude. When we told them we had a reservation (10 people) they were like well it won't be until that time (we were 30 minutes early...) then ever sat us and when we asked about our table they were like ummm well the other reservation (that was 30 minutes late) is here so we are going to sit them instead. And including that they had multiple tables open the whole time.... ever said I'm sorry.... let's say they lost hundreds of dollars tonight."}
{"text":"We stopped in after the Art Walk, and our first visit here.  I have no problem with the server, who was attentive during our 40-minute wait for food.  You know, where they are kind of embarrassed for the slowness when the restaurant is half-empty.  The complimentary bread basket was good - crispy exterior, soft interior.  Unfortunately, our entrees, which were the specials, were not.  Husband's osso buco was a little tough, and the sauce was definitely lacking something and was on the salty side.  As for my dish, it was plain awful.  I had the penne with salmon and asparagus.  I had exactly one asparagus tip.  If you put together all the slices, it may have equaled one stalk.  I have no proof, but I believe the salmon was from a can.  It was mixed into the cream sauce, had that strange canned texture, was extremely salty, and no piece was bigger than a pea.  The cream sauce was bland without any herb or seasoning, and was extremely salty.  In addition, some of the penne had that hard, rubbery texture like it had been sitting and dried out."}
{"text":"Chandlers own \"formal-ish\" italian.  We love this place.  The menu is good and the vibe says Italian.  Great place to bring the family or a big party for a night of Vino and Italian eats.  Make a reservation"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to La Stalla for her birthday dinner last night, and we had an excellent experience. 

The tasty complimentary bread was properly warm, good and crusty on the outside but soft inside. Olive oil's on the table, and you pour it yourself. I confess I prefer to have the server pour the oil, but maybe I am spoiled. 

I ordered a 2006 Sangiovese (#411 on the wine list) that our server bought out promptly. It was inexpensive at $40, but very decent for the price. 

The bruschetta was very good, with the right amount of oil. I despise bruschetta that is so crunchy that the tomatoes go flying about the room when you take a bite. La Stalla's was excellent. 

My girlfriend had the Gorgonzola and sweet potato ravioli in cream sauce. I sampled a bit, and it was delicious (and I don't even like sweet potatoes!). She enjoyed it a great deal. 

I had the tortelloni aurora, with cheese, veal and prosciutto in a pink sauce. It wasn't *quite* as fabulous as my girlfriend's entree, but was very, very good nonetheless. 

We finished by sharing a creme brulee, which was also very good, though not particularly distinguished from any good creme brulee. 

The atmosphere was excellent, with the room full of adults and no screaming kids underfoot. The music was at volume appropriate to conversation, and the goldfish in the little pond behind our table were very polite.  Most people were dressed casually but not sloppily.

The service was EXCELLENT. Our waitress was clearly intelligent and perceptive, and attentive without being obtrusive. For example, when she noticed the girlfriend and I having a fun conversation, she politely asked if we wanted out entrees to come out quickly, or if we wanted to linger over our appetizer and wine a bit. She was quick with recommendations, had a ready smile, and served everything very efficiently. 

In all, it was about $120 with (a fairly generous, based on the excellent service) tip. I think the experience was worth every penny."}
{"text":"I walked in the day of my rehearsal and asked if they could accommodate my rehearsal dinner. They said absolutely and I was very ecstatic. Mind you, there were only 14 of us, but I still appreciated their flexibility.

The food and service were great. Everyone seemed very happy with their choices. It has a very nice ambiance and it was an unexpected but very appreciated find in Chandler."}
{"text":"Made a reservation which was pushed back past our time due to another party showing up late. Manager avoided me knowing they were wrong only to blame the hostess even after a waitress was told specifically to bring the manager up front. Only after the party who showed up 25min late was sat we were told we would be next. Failure from the top level made a party of 10 walk out the door. Management that bad should have followed us out the door."}
{"text":"Was here for a date last Friday...as always, I'll run through the pros and cons:

Pros: great wine, bread, and service.

Cons: paper table cloths (what on Earth??), food needs attention (scallops in my pasta could have been seared), and someone should be there to welcome you as you walk in (a hostess, anyone?).

If I were to go back, it would be for the wine!"}
{"text":"Great light lunch at La Stalla's!  Love the relaxed atmosphere  & excellent service & food. Need to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Have been going here for 10 years and never disappoints. Great happy hour, great pizza and killer lasagne. Also reasonable prices, try it."}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite restaurant. Have only been twice so far, but have tried many items on the menu and everything has been delicious. Both times I went with a friend of the owner and he ordered a variety of items so we could sample a lot of things. 

The hi-lites include: the margherita pizza - I am probably forever ruined for any other pizza. The calamari - tender and tasty. The chicken marsala - would prefer it with pasta (came with veggies & potatoes) but absolutely delicious. The orechiette with eggplant, huge portion and so good. I don't eat proscuitto but my husband does and he absolutely loved it with the soft cheese appetizer (don't remember the name) - I did try the soft cheese and it was incredible.

First time we went the server gave us our bill without asking if we wanted dessert or coffee (which I was there with old world Italians so espresso at the end of the meal is a must) so that was a bit of a turnoff, but otherwise the service is good, ambience is great (live music on Friday night was lovely but a little loud).

They serve Illy coffee which is one of my favorites and always brings me back to my trip to Italy, and an Illy cappuccino is the perfect way to end the night IMO. Haven't tried the desserts yet but heard the tiramisu is amazing and will have that next time. Can't wait to go back again, and again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is easily one of the best kept secrets in Chandler. 

The problem I have is that I never know what entree to order, because they're all so delicious. They have a great wine selection, and delicious coffee and espresso. Regardless of what I end up ordering, I always have to finish my meal with Creme brûlée. Absolutely phenomenal. My sister claims the tiramisu is the best she's ever had, but I'm so hung up on my Creme brûlée I might never find out!

Some Sunday nights they have a guy named Matt playing guitar in there, we enjoy going in to see him. We usually go later in the night, around 7 or 8 and there is usually never a wait to get in. 

This place is an upgrade from your standard chain Italian restaurants, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am someone who is half Italian and this place is ok. Not like my grandmothers cooking but slightly above the rest by offering authentic dishes. I had the Involitini de Melanzane. Which is eggplant rolotini with prosciutto. It was very good but beyond temperature hot. Too hot to even eat. Eggplant was light and the cheese was plentiful. Highly recommend this dish but ask for it out of the crock. It never seemed to cool off. My husband had the Tagliatelle alla Toscana. Which is basically fettuccine with a meat sauce. The sauce lacked some flavor, just couldn't put my finger on which flavor. Glad we tried this place, would go back if asked but wouldn't say it's a fav place of mine."}
{"text":"Awesome. The server was also amazing! The dishes were unbelievable."}
{"text":"Squid ink pasta here is legit. Perfectly balanced and great quality shellfish. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I love the atmosphere and feel. The food and prices are excellent. I would have given it 5 stars but the service wasn't at that level."}
{"text":"I tried, I really did. I wanted this to be a decent go to spot in the neighborhood. But it's just not working for me. 

The staff is amateur hour at best, inconsistent, and sometimes outright strange. 

Music is completely inappropriate- Tonight's choices were comprised of bad 70's mustache rock songs. 

The cooks don't really know what they're doing either. Lasagna was a strange overly salty cheesy mess. Pizza was a salty disaster too- Salty sausage, salty olives, salty capers, and salty prosciutto? Are you kidding me? Why? Why would anyone do that? Why would you put all of that on the same pizza? And why the hell did I order it? I've tried a couple other rather unremarkable dishes too. That's enough for me. I'll try to find another Italian place in the area. 

Oh, the prices are absurd for the entrees as well."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say! Food was outstanding the service and ambience were great! We will be going back for sure!

Note: their marinara sauce and calamari are amazing!!"}
{"text":"The serive is great and the food is TO DIE FOR! It is a but pricey but it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Excellent service, fantastic food! I highly recommend this place for some of the best Italian in the valley"}
{"text":"We had a good experience for dinner here...no 5-star due to very average bread and side dish veggies that managed to be both overcooked and chewy (how do they do that???). We had a delicious rack of lamb and very fresh tasting grilled salmon...both cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was nice and our server was very friendly. Nothing earth shattering, just a nice meal."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day and although they were under-staffed and the employees seemed over-worked, I was impressed how each employee handled every aspect of service with grace and patience. The food was delicious...we didn't take home leftovers bc we all finished our meals...and then enjoyed 3 different desserts! Ugh, so yummy! The entree portions are perfect; not too much and not too little. It's a cute and quaint restaurant in the heart of old town chandler. Great date night location; but it's probably a good idea to make reservations if it's on the weekend. 
Hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!"}
{"text":"I've driven past La Stalla Cucina Rustica several times on my way to 98 South or El Zocalo but for some reason I'd never eaten there.  It might be the long, multi-syllabic name...places with names like that can be a little intimidating sometimes.  Still, I was in the mood for a different spot and Italian cuisine sounded good so I thought we'd give it a try.  I had the Penne alla Vodka.  Let's just say, my plate was clean at the end.  My experience with the service was really good. The only hiccup during our visit is that the glass of wine the person I was with ordered had little bits of cork in it.  I mentioned it to our server and they quickly apologized and replaced it.  No harm done!  We finished off having the tiramisu for dessert.   It had a really good flavor and the portion size was perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"My parent's live in Chandler and La Stalla is one of the reasons we visit them as often as we do...don't get me wrong, I love my parents - but if I'm going to drive from N. Phoenix, there better be some good food involved!

We started going to La Stalla a couple of years ago because everything else was so crowded...we were a little concerned that there might be a reason La Stalla wasn't crowded - but then again we were starving and so we chanced it. Thank goodness we did! It is one of the better Italian places in the valley...now the problem is if it gets too popular we won't be able to get in!

While I have ordered off the menu, I generally get the special...I have had exceptional Salmon - crispy on the outside, slightly pink, moist  and tender on the inside...Also, one night the special was wild boar, so you know I had to try it - it was fantastic. Also, the pizzas are really good if you like more down to earth eating. All in all, a great place - we need more like it in the Valley."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I found the calamari to be chewy and undercooked. Minestrone was bland. Chicken Marsala was lacking flavor as well. My boyfriend had the pasta & fagioli which was very tasty and pasta carbonera, which was also very tasty. The server was attentive and kept glasses and breadbaskets full. The hostess needs to go. We were seated facing her and she spent the entire time twirling her hair and picking at her split ends looking bored to death. Would I go back? Probably not, there are plenty of other restaurants to try."}
{"text":"Food was very good however I ordered a half/lunch portion of the gnocchi and literally got  about 8 gnocchi served on my plate. Too bad because it was so delish. For $11 I thought I'd get a little more food. My husband ordered a pizza, good size, and it was very good. Service good not great."}
{"text":"Great for a date night.  When I say date night it's because a bit pricey.  We've been coming here for gosh about a decade.  We've been here with groups of 2 to 20 people.  It's a smaller restaurant, so I give grace when there's a large crowd!  I would like to see more gluten friendly options.  It's a sweet place in the heart of Chandler.  I appreciate it's not a chain restaurant.  I would agree the hostesses do need a bit of coaching... the customer is always right!  The food has been really good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find such a classy old-world Italian eatery so close to home. La Stalla is in the heart of historic Downtown Chandler, kitty-corner to the San Marcos hotel. 

Here's my recommendation for the perfect dinner, ala a night in Venice, without leaving the Valley:

Start with the Bocconcini al Prosciutto, prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella topped with mushrooms and breadcrums. 

Contadino focaccia, with grilled eggplant, roasted peppers, with mozzarella, mesculine and tomatoes, drizzled with a balsamic olive oil dressing.

Penne alla Vodka, al dente penne pasta in a delicate vodka-cream sauce. 

Finish off with fresh fruit zabaione or (maybe and?) chocolatte souffle. You'll have to allow an extra 10-15 minutes for the souffle, but it comes straight out of the oven.

Delizioso!"}
{"text":"We started with the mozzarella, prosciutto and mushroom bake. It was fantastic. The Cavatelli, Broccoli and Sausage was very good.  The tagliatelle  with meat sauce was ok.  Portion sizes were huge - enough for lunch the next day.

A bit surprised they don't make their own pasta. 

Service was very friendly and we sat out on the patio. 

It was a while between visits but we'll be back again."}
{"text":"OMG!  I can't believe I forgot my review of this place.  My sis and I were have a sister day, and we picked this place for lunch on Martin Luther King day.  I am assuming that is why it was dead, the courts and offices in downtown Chandler were closed.  

The hostess/waitress was very friendly and helpful.  She let us taste a couple wines before deciding on ours, and the pours were generous.  We started with Brucchetta that was only 3 pieces to the order, so if you have a party of 4 you are screwed.  The tomato/basil topping was fresh and delish.

 I ordered Butternut Squash ravioli in a cream sauce.  It was soooo good, although there was too much cream sauce poured on top, my ravioli were buried.  But they tasted soooo good.  My sis had penne pasta with tomato sauce and zucchini.  It was very good, but HUGE portions!  She boxed it up so we could have dessert.  We chose the chocolate souffle that was served with vanilla ice cream.  It was so rich and decadent!  It went perfectly with our Illy coffee and cream!

I can't wait to take my husband here!  I want to go back for dinner because they have gnocchi!  They do have a great $5 weekday lunch menu with cold or hot sandwiches and pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely Exquisite. Perfect service. Every bite was delicious. We had sea bass and the sweet potato ravioli. Crazy good. Lovely atmosphere and right down to the bread and  vinegar everything was wonderful. Yum!! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"What's going on here? My uncle took eight of us here for my anniversary and we had to literally beg for butter, cheese, bread and water. Are we in jail??? Our waitress was a loon, Fredriko or something like that. Not sure she was in the moment. Appetizer was slapped on a plate. Silverware was missing. Stupid paper covering the tablecloth cut my son's finger. Really hard chairs. I was crippled by the end of the night. Good wine and bread, when you can get it. Come on, get on track. This was one weird meal."}
{"text":"This Is what a nice Italian restaurant is supposed to be.  We were so happy to find this gem is chandler!  Great food, though a little pricey, but well definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one place I'm really looking forward to going back to. We went on Sunday afternoon for lunch, the place wasn't busy but I could see how it would be slammed in the evening. 

The decor is warm, inviting, authentic and immaculately clean. Our server Valerie was just a doll and made great recommendations, and they have coke products to that was already a thumbs up.

My fiancé ordered the Calzone which he really liked, and I got chicken marsala, also very good my only one suggestion was that my chicken was overcooked but the flavor was great. 

We will definitely be back for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Better than Olive Garden, that's for sure! We enjoyed our late lunch here, we were seated right by he fountain and we enjoyed our food and the bread. Hostess was really nice, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. We ate here several times. Great food, ambience and location. Very polite staff."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!  The ambiance was good, especially since it was crowded on Valentines Day.  The reason why this review is a 3 star vs a 4 or 5 is because of the service.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the caliber that I would expect from a restaurant of this quality and that would be consistent with the prices (which are reasonable).  I would absolutely go back as the sweet potato ravioli I had was incredible.  The server might have been busy, had a bad day, etc. but she seemed dis-interested in taking the time to listen to what we were ordering (drinks and entrees mixed up), and in general did not provide great service.  Good experience, but could have been great..."}
{"text":"Pretty cool joint.  The pastas seem fresh and the sauces are tasty.  I like the atmosphere.  I'll be back !

Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"A small group went there for dinner yesterday.The place is cute, really well located and the food was really good.
 I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious. Foe dessert I had the chocolate souffle - one of the best I ever had.
I am not giving it a five star because the service could have been better. The waitress took her time to come and take our orders, I had to specifically ask her to take our bread basket and appetizer plates away when the main course arrived. My friend ordered half portion of gnocchi with her entree and she had a strange reaction - as if she \"disagreed\" with the order. Oh well...maybe next time she will be in a better mood."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!  I go here every year for my Birthday dinner.  Had the sweet potato gorgonzola ravioli last year, It was fan-freakin-tastic!  Can't wait to go again this year.  And their lunch specials are wonderful too."}
{"text":"The only place in the east valley that my Italian New Jersey grandmother approves as \"real Italian!\" I love the lasagna and pizza. The bread and salads are also tasty! The only negative is their hard wooden chairs for a long dinner. You can request cushions but they are still pretty hard."}
{"text":"1)  Authentic Italian food.
2) This place is amazing.
3) The service is among the best.
Grazie ,finalmente abbiamo mangiato come si deve.A prestissimo"}
{"text":"Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news ,but I had an awful experience here and it makes me hesitant to EVER go back despite the good reviews for dinner and dessert.

I went for lunch with my husband. I wanted to see the menu first but he wanted to just go for it.

It's very cute inside, I Loved the Mediterranean/Romantic feel with lighted orange trees and faux rock walls, wood beams and rustic chairs.

I HATE paper table cloths, as they are prone to giving paper cuts and always make me think of Macaroni Grille.

I was not feelin' the menu but decided to try one of their Focaccia Panini's with grilled chicken, tomato, avocado and spinach. My husband ordered pasta with Tuscan meat sauce.

First we were served flat diet coke and some day old bread.......sigh.....

Good rustic bread is sometimes chewy and maybe even tough, but never just crumbles the way this bread did...maybe it was more than day old?

My sandwich arrived and looked OK (notice no picture) After one bite I knew it wasn't good, but I took a few more just to make sure. 

The spinach looked to be from a can or frozen, it was really mushy and the green color was looking really more of a brownish.

My husband's pasta was piping  hot and he said it was OK also but had a weird taste to the meat..??

SO I didn't eat anymore of mine and when the waitress/manager/hostess came over I told her why (spinach and just overall not good) She insisted it was Fresh..............Honey Please! 

Maybe last week when they sauteed it but now it was a soggy mess.

I Love spinach and I assure you there is NO WAY that spinach was fresh at any time during the last week!

My Husband says I need to YELP on my own time!

2 stars for the decor"}

{"text":"Pretty good food, okay prices, and a nice dining atmosphere.  Service was decent also."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast (an hour from NYC) and from an Italian family and would defiantly eat here again. The only true Italian I have found in this area. I had the cavatilla and broccoli and it was just like my nuna used to make it with some yummy sausage pieces thrown in there as well. We made reservations for 6:30 on a Friday and glad we did. The place was packed! For sure will be coming back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"We dropped in last night for happy hour after checking out the farmer's market in Downtown Chandler. Happy hour goes until 6pm (half priced apps and pizzas!!), and since it was pretty close to that time, we were given menus and waited on right away. We decided on the margherita pizza and bocconcini al prosciutto (read mozzarella sticks wrapped in proscuitto topped with mushrooms and breadcrumbs, not fried). 

Soon after ordering, we were brought fresh slices of bread and some balsamic vinegar. After mixing the balsamic with the olive oil that was already at the table, we quickly devoured most of the bread.

It didn't take too long for the food to come. The \"cheese sticks\" came out first. Different from anything I've had before, but they were quite tasty...we fought over the mushrooms that topped the 3 cheese sticks. The pizza shortly followed, and it was big enough for 3 people to share (not bad for $5)! We agreed that the pizza was good, but nothing too special. It had a crushed tomato sauce with scattered fresh basil, smothered in mozzarella cheese on a thin crust and cooked in a brick oven. It was a great pizza for the price; if I go back, I'd like to try one of their other pizzas.

The bill was less than $20 for the pizza, appetizer, a glass of wine and a glass of beer. Not to mention we were pretty full. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic, with low lighting. The service was pretty good, although it took forever to get our check- I was quickly becoming inpatient. I'm not sure if I'd rush back there, but if you're in the area around happy hour time I'd suggest giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to this place on a dinner date. Its a cute little restaurant. I wasnt wowed by the food though. The calamari was too tender not as crispy or fried as i like it. 

They dont even give you bread to start, they did offer some during our meal though. The place was good, just not great, i would not go back again by choice."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to La Stalla.  The atmosphere is so appropriate for the menu.  Our waiter was so attentive.  And the food.....wow.  I had the sweet potato tortellini with Gorgonzola sauce.  Out of this world.  My husband had the salmon penne and loved it.  Our friends had two different sandwiches.  So big they took half home.  Thank you La Stalla, we will be back next year."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. Haven't had a bad item here. The pasta e fagioli is to die for. The gnocchi is delectable. The ambiance is lovely. Generally a quiet spot. The service is good. My boyfriend's food came out a little later than the rest, so they brought us a round of lemoncello shots on the house. It is clear these people take pride in what they do. I will come here time and time again. Brought my parents, and they loved it. Location is great; nestled in the heart of downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch time after someone recommend me this place. The service was really slow and the servers were not busy. We order a beer and a strawberry margarita to start and when the drink came it wasn't a strawberry margarita, was a regular one. When we asked the server he told us they didn't had anymore strawberry so they put some orange instead !?! Anyway, we start with a starter and then 3 main courses. The starter was tasty. The main courses: 
First was good size but too salty.
Second one small size but tasty.
Third one good size but no flavor.
So that's why 3, I'm kind of between two options about this place."}
{"text":"To write I have to select a star. Seems after years of not visiting and hoping for an awesome experience as it had been over the previous visits! Totally a zero experience- slow but enthusiastic server - just to be simple with my review and not waste a lot of words or time with this please read the reviews that are 3 stars or less. We were so disappointed that we skipped desert."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, it made me forget that I was in Arizona. Love the rustic wood chairs, iron chandeliers, and stone work on the walls. Stunning! Excellent bread and amazing olive oil. I had the spinach pasta with scallops, mushrooms and a cherry tomato sauce. It was good but I felt like it was missing something. I guess it just need a kick. My boyfriend had the lasagna and he said it was good but not amazing like the server described. We will be back since I would like to try some other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, the food was pretty good and I really had no complaints.  The second time - What the heck happened???  The name of the game that night was how much salt can you ingest in one meal before a stroke occurred?  Everything was a salt bomb.  Especially the seafood pasta where beside the gross, old mussels the only spice I could taste was salt.  The sad part is - I love salt!  I won't go back or recommend it to anyone who has hypertension."}
{"text":"Menu is extensive with lovely selections and nice wine offerings. Even though there were few diners,  service was sluggish. Our party of three waited more than 20 minutes after appetizer had long been finished. Food arrived warm but we were not up to complaining as we had waited so long. Servers were pleasant and we will give this Chandler establishment another chance. We live so close so would be great if we could could visit this restaurant weekly."}
{"text":"This was a terrible restaurant. I went by the reviews which looked so good. The Calamari was terrible, my quest ordered Gnocchi I believe she couldn't even eat it and it looked like an appetizer, I had a Pork Chop, the sauce was fine but the Chop was so over cooked I could hardly cut it with a steak knife.The waiter asked my guest for parmesan and didn't even use freshly grated parmesan? That's hardly Authentic Italian? My guest had two glasses of wine, I had tea, the bill was $100.00? Wow? The waiter very pleasant and the atmosphere was nice. It was the worst food I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. I did tip the waiter 20% because he was pleasant. $120.00 for food we couldn't even eat, that's bad."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants to dine in. I had calamari as an appetizer, the marinara sauce is freshly made and delicious with the calamari. Also I was craving chicken fettuccine alfredo. It was not on the menu but I did ask the server and he said he would ask the cooks in the back if they could whip some up. Sure enough, they were pleased to do that for me! It was beyond amazing! The alfredo sauce was made to order and the chicken was very tender, fettuccine was al dente, just how I like it! I will be coming here for my Italian cravings. Overall great experience with the service and everything!"}
{"text":"Can't help but feel let down after eating at La Stalla last Friday night, especially after all the positive reviews. I have to say that the best thing about this place was the location and drinks. Here's how I would break it down:

Location: 4 stars
Price: 2 stars
Food: 2 stars
Drinks: 4 stars
Service: 2.5 stars

First of all, we got here around 6pm on a Friday night and we were probably one of three couples and a large party. Basically, this place wasn't super busy.

 Our waitress was very friendly and kept checking back at the perfect times. But the waitress didn't make up for the near one hour wait time for a single plate of pasta, which even the waitress admitted was long.

After waiting that long for the pasta you would think the noodles would be done but they were still pretty chewy. In addition to the pasta we also got the antipasto, which was three types of meats and three types of cheeses and two olives. It wasn't served with any nuts/fruits/jams or breads, so we used the leftover bread we had from when we first walked in. 

I do have to say the drinks were absolutely fantastic - definitely one of the few positives. We had a mixture of cocktails and wine and they both were amazing.

Lastly, the thing that really made our mind up about La Stalla was the price. For two people we ordered a single plate of pasta, the antipasto, and two drinks for both of us and the bill was an astounding $95 after tip. Definitely not recommended when you compare the food for the price."}
{"text":"Do NOT get the calamari. It has no flavor and it is rubbery. I doubt I will come here again. I wasn't blown away by the food. The service was bad. We had to wait forever for our check because the server was too busy with the large obnoxious party sitting next to us. Our server did not seem to know how to multi task. If you want really good service and amazing food, go to Pestos pizza and wine bar."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here and was expecting to enjoy it. Unfortunately, the service was very disappointing. Maybe they were very understaffed, but my water was left empty and the server/ bartender rarely came to our table, brought us the wrong appetizer, etc... The food was decent, but not amazing. We had bruschetta, gnocchi, and the sweet potato ravioli. I had the ravioli and the sauce was very salty, however the ravioli tasted great.  Overall, it was okay, but if I want Italian food  I will be better off going somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"We dined on 9/22/12 which was my husband's birthday dinner, and we had a party of 4.  I must say the service was incredible!!!  We had made reservations and our table was waiting for us when we arrived.  My husband ordered the fettucine, which was by far the best dish at the table.  They make their own pasta at this place, so the fettucine noodles were purple and had the white sauce (awesome by the way) topped with pine nuts and sliced cherry tomatoes.  I had a dish, which was the special, and while it was cooked well, it wasn't as fantastic as the fettucine dish, just my preference, not digging on the dish itself.  The others at the table ordered the lasagna, which was a pretty big portion, and it was delicious as well.  We had wine and an italian beer called Moretti La Rossa.  The beer was so good, we went to Total Wine a few days later and got a couple of 6 packs.  We were there into the end of the evening (10 pm), so our server asked if we'd like some homemade almond liqueur, and we said yes.  It was fantastic!!  It came in a little shot glass and was so very wonderful.  We thought they were going to charge us for these, but they didn't.  It was a sort of pricey place, but so very worth the great food, and we were prepared to pay since it was a birthday celebration. A special place to dine for sure.  I'd been here on other occasions and the food was good, but they must have upped their game since then, as they went from 4 stars to 5 stars."}
{"text":"If the service wouldn't have so poor it would have been hilarious! Despite our server's arrival with great enthusiasm, it went down hill from there.He even wanted to let us know that was not your usual pasta place with regular spaghetti etc... How's that for an insult to your customers?  I like basic pasta places and I am capable of discerning between types of food. Our food arrived cold and we had to send all entrees back to the kitchen. Our server was nowhere to be found and we had to request another server to come to our table and take the food back. It appears there is no bus staff or management as well! Our server seemed overwhelmed! Our salad plates were not cleared before entrees came out and he had to set down our entrees on a table next to us to clear the dirty plates. Speaking of dirty plates my sisters appetizer plate was dirty when it arrived as was her fork with residual food.  I requested another glass of wine and he took my empty glass and went to attend to another table and set my dirty glass on their table while he took an order from them! My sister asked for decaf coffee and a dessert menu and she was told there was no decaf!  He said I can try and make you some if you want!!! Are you kidding me??? In a restaurant of this caliber no coffee made?? We asked to share two desserts for four people. Perhaps they were low on forks and spoons because we got two spoons for all of us to share. We are a close family but I want my own cutlery when dining out. At one point we thought we might have been a reality TV show because it was so ridiculous. We love fine dining and were so looking forward to going here!  
We came in from California for this!  My son and daughter have both been servers and we are great supporters of the service industry so I would encourage La Stalla to hire some bus boys so your servers can do the job they need to do."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  The manicotti is my favorite!  It has nice decor and a romantic setting.  Resonably priced.  It is popular so there is usually a wait on Friday and Saturday nights.  I recommend reservations for those evenings."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The food was delicious. Great place for a large group or a small intimate dinner. Love this place. Authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"our first time here! and omg the most delicious Italian dishes ive ever eaten! and great service too, thx to our waiter Jeff. we will def come back often!!"}
{"text":"My wife was given a great recommendation on this place, WOW were they ever wrong, as a Northeast person, raised in an Italian household this is NOT Great, Good or even mediocre Italian food. 1st the hostess would not wait on us because she doesn't like my daughters, had a waiter seat US. Then were we sat in a table pushed closer to other tables with a large area open in the middle, why??? I do not know!! As for the service it was OK, at least our waitress didn't screw up the orders! 
The food however never again, Calamari were huge, pre frozen rings (see Costco ) not fried well at all, chewy and bad flavor, marinara sauce was horrible. Dinners were ok, best was the sweet potato ravioli my daughter had, rest were 2 star at best, I had the grilled lamb chops bought from Costco, I know because I've bought them their too not worth the $28.00. Desserts were good, best was the limoncello  Flute. 
Worst was watching a couple try to get a table for at least an hour as the hostess said they were waiting for our table to leave? Excuse Me!! There were tables open, and when it was 1st told to this couple we were just getting our dinners! 
To write a review you need to place a star, if I had a choice it would be 0 stars. It I guess the Ravioli and dessert deserve 1 star!! 
If you are looking for a local great Italian restaurant do go here!!

UPDATE: 2/26/17, I was threatened by the stepdad of the hostess, he felt my comments were wrong,I asked him if he was threatening all the people who had an issue with her or just me?? No response! Moral here is there are crazy people out there so be careful, this is no joke and Rick the owner of LaStalla could care less that a customer has been threatened by an employees family!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful inside. Amazing food. Great service. The only thing wrong is a small menu and it takes time to make."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant and great food, good for business lunches as the ambient is private and quiet and you end being a very good host."}
{"text":"Can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for La Stalla Cucina Rustica.

If you're looking for delicious Italian food that doesn't resemble the corporate garbage that's strewn about the area, then look no further! 

Seriously, though, the food here reminds me of my Nana's cooking . . . And that's damn near impossible to compete with. 

A quaint little spot for a date night in Downtown Chandler, yet affordable. Very charming décor inside. Yes, the paper table coverings are annoying and scream \"MACARONI GRILL!\", but that's the least of your worries when you come to a place like this.  

Every time we go here, we always have the same server. Feeling like an idiot because I can't remember her name! She always recommends great wine for us, and is even generous enough to let us taste before committing to a bottle or glass. *Edit: Her name is Tina, and she is amazing!*

The last time I was in five or so months ago, found out that LSCR started making their own bread. Better than whatever they had before! Always comes out fresh, warm and fluffy. Have to get that thing out of sight after a piece it's that good. 

The few times we've been here we've tried the Ravioli Di Patate Dolci Giapponesi Al Gorgonzola, Risotto Agli Scampi and Costolette D'Agnello alla Griglia,  and a Manicotti that was on special. 

Everything was excellent; however, our absolute favorite was the first thing I listed: Japanese sweet potato ravioli in a Gorgonzola cheese cream sauce. WOW! 

Definitely need a nap after this rich dish. Still haven't gotten around to recreating it at home. The sweet potato blended surprisingly well with something as rich as Gorgonzola. 

If you want to do dessert, try the Chocolate Souffle. Hello, dark chocolate heaven! Make sure you give your server a heads up, as it takes 15 minutes for this one. Patience! 

Great selection of after dinner drinks too. Think grappa and homemade limoncello!

The almond flavored grappa was awesome.  Brought back memories of visiting family in Varrazze years ago and being introduced to it by my Nana's cousin after a ridiculously indulgent meal. Yeah, smooth move dude . . . extra potent alcohol for a bunch of 18-20 year old WILD college kids! 

Check it out. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, you're probably an Olive Garden fan. :)"}
{"text":"Professional service and great pasta with a great wine selection. Their pizza was good but not the best in valley."}
{"text":"I found this place via Yelp because we needed a place to meet some friends in downtown Chandler.  This was the winner.  Though a bit pricey for the average person, the food definitely made up and was delicious!

I ordered the lasagna.  it came out piping hot in a dish and was incredible. Probably the best Ive had outside of home made.  A buddy of mine ordered the pizza and it too was great.  

i wasn't a fan of their bread so much that they give out before hand.  But it's always nice to have something before the main course.

I will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary a party of 8. Everyone ordered different food items and everyone enjoyed their food. It was a wonderful evening for all.
Excellent service was provided by Cami."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ambiance of La Stalla. The service was great. Our waitress knew the menu very well and made us feel at home all evening. We got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly cooked and delicious. I got the gnocchi and it may have been the best gnocchi I have ever had. My wife got the chicken parmesan which was also very good. The only complaints we had were; it seemed to take a long time for our food to come out and it was a little on the pricey side. 4 entrees, an app, a salad, a dessert, 4 waters and no alcohol . Our bill was over $100, before the tip."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?  Amazing describes it pretty well.

There were eight of us for lunch.  We were seated promptly.  Our server was fantastic and the food delicious.  That just about describes our whole time.

We loved the location of this restaurant too.  It was right in the heart of Chandler.  Tablecloths were on all the tables, it was clean and inviting.

The menu was a little different than other Italian restaurants but staff was willing to make changes as we ordered.  Everything was perfect.  Food came out on time and we were left to talk with friends for as long as we wanted.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Went for dinner on Friday night. Group of gf celebrating a birthday. Our waiter was nice but was not willing to make one single change as in substitutions. My gf wanted asparagus instead of the vegetable side. Absolutely not!! He charged her 4.00 for three asparagus. Salads are not included with the meals, although the waiter acted as if they were when asking us if we wanted one. If you order the sea bass be sure to have bread near by...full of bones!  Usually a restaurant will do a little something for a bday, he gave us a menu for desert. 50.00 a piece, not impressed. Will not return."}
{"text":"I am VERY VERY picky about eating out at italian restaurants but La Stalla definitely made the grade.  The bread was very flavorful and satisfying and the sweet potato ravioli was magnificent.  Prices were very reasonable as well plus the service was great."}
{"text":"Not too bad!! Would go back!! 

First off this place is located in downtown Chandler, which I love the area and it fits right in. It's located on buffalo street right across from San Marcos hotel. It's a small little restaurant with a warm feel.  Right off the bat I was very surprised by the ambience. Staff was extremely friendly so no issues there.  

On to the food.  I ordered the Cavatelli Pasta with Sausage, broccoli, in a garlic sauce.  While the dish was decent it didn't blow me away.  It didn't meet the standards not the wow factor that the decor gave me.  It left me wanting for more.  Not more food as the serving was sufficient just  more flavor.  Prices wasn't bad as my meal was 10.00. But it was more on the bland side and the pasta itself was a little tough.  I left full but not entirely satisfied.  

Overall I would visit again and perhaps just order a different dish as my friend had the salmon and mentioned it was delicious."}
{"text":"5 stars - really? This Italian gem is a wonderful authentic masterpiece. Not your normal dishes which make it all the more excellent. The tortellini soup is amazing and the many pasta dishes are wonderful. Located in beautiful downtown Chandler, this is a gem. Did I metioned the outstanding service? Not the cheapest in town but the quality, service and Atmosphere are worth it."}
{"text":"Went here on a date and I was impressed with the intimate feel and ambiance the restaurant had. It was quite inside and the decor really made you feel like you were eating in a Tuscan restaurant. Service started off slightly slower through the beverage round but he was friendly and made suggestions based on what we may eat for dinner. We started off with some Caprese and it was delicious... The mozzarella was soooo good! We had the Lasagna and Tagliatelle alla Toscana pasta for our meals and they were both excellent and so full of flavor. Best I have had... REALLY. Overall really good fun experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for lunch on a saturday and had their margarita pizza, squid ink pasta with shellfish and japanese sweet potato ravioli. The pizza was pretty tasty and good portion for the lunch special price of $8. However, the japanese sweet potato ravioli, eventhough also tasty, but portion size was terribly disappointing for the price we paid--$14. There were exactly 5 small pieces of it! The good taste couldn't make up for the small amount of food. Lastly, the squid ink pasta was a good portion, taste was ok but plain, nothing exotic about it. Pretty disappointed with the experience. 

Bread was supposedly fresh baked daily but ours came cold, another disappointment. Did not taste like warm fresh baked bread to us at all. 

Service was ok, but could be better. Server left the wine list menu laying flat on our table the entire time and even place a plate of sliced lemons on it instead of removing it."}
{"text":"Given that my wife grew up in Chandler, I was surprised that we hadn't found this place earlier.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service by Tina! Food was so good - sweet potatoe ravioli and chicken parm. Her recommendations were spot on. And splurge and eat the bread...worth it!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would, had a reservation, and they failed to honor it. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Have to support Malone D. on this one. Food was only ok and was overpriced. Service - was *very* good - while we were the only ones in the restaurant. As soon as the usual Saturday night crowd arrived and the place started to fill-up, the quality of service and attention dropped off fast. No more refills on drinks and long wait to get check paid.
Antipasto plate was small and overpriced and of average quality. Pasta Fagouli soup was all shells, some beans and tasted like ti came from a can. Very disappointing,. Pasta + pancetta - the pancetta was tough and gristle-y and the pesto only so-so. Would not return."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here several times over the years and it has never disappointed. Most recently I came here with my sisters and friends after my baby shower on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately and service was great. The food was amazing as always. I love the salad with the pear and walnuts! I remembered how amazing it was years ago and I was so happy it is still on the menu. All 5 of us were very impressed with the food and service that night! I wish I could afford to eat here every night."}
{"text":"So yes...it was \"A-OK.\"  It wasn't great...I don't think it came even close to the hype.  It wasn't bad...it just wasn't great.

The table shared a couple of Caprese Salad's...there was one single leaf of basil in the center of the plate.  The tomato's were dark pink (if we can get bright red tomato's in Minneapolis in the winter, why can't they get ripe tomato's in Chandler?).  Again...it was ok, but I expected more.

I had a \"primevera\" salad that was comprised of mixed greens, apples, orange, and grapefruit with a creamy raspberry dressing, but it was saturated in blue cheese crumbles that completely overtook the salad.  

My entree was a broiled halibut and came with a generous portion of mixed vegetables that were overcooked.  The halibut was simple and tasty, but it was also tiny - probably the smallest portion of halibut I've ever been served.

I had a nice glass of Pinot Noir; the only one they served by the glass on the menu.

So, all in all...it was ok.  I wouldn't even think of driving out of my way to go there again though."}
{"text":"I came in there once on Valentine's day which happened to be Friday, the restaurant was packed, so I didn't get seated and decided to come back. 

The actual visit was such a disappointment. The bread was served cold, it wasn't even warm. The very sad lasagna was cold in the middle, seems like it was thawed before serving. The lasagna wasn't impressive, tomato sauce was too sweet, and not enough meat. Sweet potato ravioli in gorgonzola sauce were interesting, but not interesting enough to pay $21 for six raviolis: sweet potatoes were too sweet, the dish was lukewarm, not hot. Olive oil on the table tasted stale, their balsamic vinegar gave me a heartburn (I have better one at home).

The decor is outdated. 

The server, Dennis, tried to play a role of a server from a better restaurant than La Stalls is; I prefer more authentic and genuine attitude. But more importantly, I prefer my food served hot, especially on Monday evenings, when they have only few tables seated.

Three-star Buca di Beppo, being a chain, has more ambiance, more flavor in their Italian dishes than this downtown Chandler 'gem'. Needless to say, servers at Buca were always more delightful than \"I am going to act arrogant, so they'll think this is high-end restaurant\" attitude. It makes me really wonder how this place stays in business and get such high reviews!"}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed tonight.  Although we had good service, the food was just not of the quality we remember from a few years ago.  My steak tips were not tender and the beef was not flavorful or of good quality.  Not sure we will return."}
{"text":"Well first, the gentleman poured me an exquisite glass of chianti. The soup was made of beans and pasta. It was so well done it made me want to cry.  The bread was served with a tough pepper mill and balsamic and oil that was perfect. I ordered the ink and squid. Gotta say, Le mussels were perfect. The dyed pasta was al dente and delicious. I had a mug of Italian coffee. Perfect. I savoured a hazelnut liqueur and waited for the food to settle.  The bill wad affordable. While seeming a high end restaurant, the price and the flavor did not match. I expected it to be much more expensive. I would have paid more. I sat there a many while moments contiplating before getting a gin straight up and dirty. Great service to the end. The maestro had no problem sending me hone with extra bread. Well done. I will come back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there last night for the first time.  We live pretty close by and was hoping for a good experience so we could frequent this place often.  It was way above our expectations.  I am an italian food stob, so it better be good or I won't go back.  Our pasta dishes were outstanding and service very good.  The restaurant was very busy but the hostess got us a table at the bar.  Will definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed my experience here. 

It's a really nice little restaurant, great service, super nice \"date night\" atmosphere without breaking the bank.

I myself had a pasta dish and the pasta was cooked nicely, the sauce was light with some meat in it. The garlic bread on the side was delicious and fresh. No complaints on my food.

Our server was nice, attentive and was able to answer our questions about the menu easily and quickly. 

When you find a solid place to have good food, you know it and for me, this is it."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Everything taste so fresh and the tiramisu is the best I ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for a business dinner tonight.  There is a nice bar area you can relax in if you are not ready to eat. We were hungry so we decided to sit in the dining area and we ordered Mussels and Antipasto and drinks. We had a great waitress who really hustled to keep the drinks and food coming all night. La Stalla has a nice cozy atmosphere and the food is very good. I had the Filet with Asparagus and it was cooked perfectly. The Gnocchi is especially good here. We all enjoyed our food and the atmosphere and the service is excellent. We will come back in the future to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian in the East Valley. Everything on the menu is made in-house and the food is fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Omg this place!!!! The Japanese sweet potato ravioli was out of this world!! I will be back!! Try it, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant at least a dozen times. It is consistently delicious. The homemade pastas are amazing (try the carbonara and the sweet potato ravioli) and the burrata appetizer is delicious. Also try the eggplant mellanzane. Great for couples and families."}
{"text":"If this is authentic, true Italians will be ashamed. Even the iced tea taste poorly, I've had better marinara from a can. Service was mediocre. May be better for dinner. The wifey and I shall never return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Found it while searching for a place to eat outside the norm in Downtown Chandler. Already had appetizers elsewhere so cannot say how they are here. I took the recommendation and ordered the special of the day, couldn't be more pleased. Swordfish was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Not sure if it's on the menu, but it should be. Definitely worth  drive. Can't wait to come back and see what else is on the menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on March 17 I love the atmosphere and food .Tina was our waitress and the service was outstanding we did have a large group of people 15 or more the only reason the place didn't get five stars was the point-of-sale system which took 30 minutes to get the Individual checks."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant.  It's local and has a nice atmosphere (except for the paper on top of the table cloth....my 8 year old even said, \"this paper is unpleasant.\")  

It was my 72 year old mother-in-law's birthday.  I stopped in on my way to pick my son up from school to check out the restaurant and menu.  When I went in I wondered if they were open as nobody was around.  Finally I got the attention of the bar tender who gave me a paper menu to take along and talked up the owners and food as truly authentic Italian.

I arrived before my husband, who was bringing our son, mother-in-law and father-in-law (who is in a wheelchair).  The hostess was very nice and set up a table that was easy to access/room for the wheelchair.  The restaurant was busy which included at least two large parties of 8 plus in the dinning room.  We sat down and waited ....waters....waited...oh you need menus.....waited and waited....drink order...waited and waited...drinks came out hand carried one or two at a time...ugh.

The waitress was pleasant but seemed to be taking care of most of the tables even though there seemed to be plenty of other staff around.  Anyway, the special dinner item was kangaroo.  None of us felt like going there....is kangaroo an \"authentic Italian\" dish?  

We ordered the Anitpaso Italiano to start which was very good, but a really tiny plate for the price.  The bread basket was a complimentary thin, short little bread for our table of 5.  My husband also ordered a bowl of minestrone.  The soup was bland and overpowered by the taste of the overcooked broccoli in the soup.  Never had Minestrone with broccoli (and peas).

My father-in-law had the Costolette D'Agnello alla Griglia (lamb chops) accompanied by the \"fresh\" vegetable of the day.  He ate the lamb chops not the veggies.  The veggies were awful and strange.  It's like they were boiled and overcooked (cabbage, potato, zucchini & carrot) except the carrot was undercooked and hard.

My mother-in-law had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara.  She ate it.   Didn't complain about it, but it looked heavy (too thick) and beige.

I had the Pappardelle Marie Monti (spinach pasta, Scallops & porcini mushrooms in an \"imported\" light cherry tomato sauce).  Bland, oily and the scallops would have been nice with a sear on each side.

My husband and son split the Pollo al Marsala...which the menu says is pan seared.  The chicken was almost certainly boiled with like a mushroom, butter gravy added afterward.  No marsala flavor.  This also came with the awful and strange \"fresh\" vegetable of the day.

The service was painfully slow for everything even after the bigger parties had cleared out.  No offer for a second glass of wine, and refills on soft drinks was next to impossible as the waitress had no support (buss staff, etc.).   We had dirty dinner plates even while we ate our little cupcake I brought to put a candle in for grandma's birthday.  Good thing too, because we were not offered dessert.  I did manage to get a coffee, which was brought out black (no spoon or cream).  There was sugar on the table from earlier and when I asked for cream...\"oh, you need cream\"....stirred the cream in with one of the forks I didn't use from dinner.  

As an afterthought the waitress brought a couple of fresh plates and forks for our cupcakes, but it was too little too late.  The check was brought over and we never saw the waitress again.  Guess it was a good thing we paid cash and didn't need change.  We got up to leave (not a fast moving group) and there was not any staff waitress, hostess, bartender who said goodbye, thank you, have a good night.  In fact I thought this was so strange, I yelled back into the restaurant goodbye, your welcome....still not one staff member turned their head to acknowledge  me.

Not going back...what a shame...I REALLY wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Overall rating : I rated the restaurant three out of five stars because the food was not up to the standards I expect. 
ambience: The restaurant was clean and nicely appointed.  The flatware was of notably good quality. The weight and balance felt great in my hands. The tables were too close together to offer any privacy. I found it hard not to overhear my neighbors conversations.
Service : The service was good. I requested heavy cream for my coffee and was disappointed when the waiter told me they only had the milk without checking with the kitchen first.
Food: My friend and I both ordered chicken marsala. The chicken was tough. It was hard to cut with a knife. (Overcooked?) The marsala sauce was thin and without much flavor. The steamed broccoli and carrots we're very good. 
Overall I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't come here. We tried to eat here tonight but received absolutely terrible service before we were even sat. The hostess was extremely rude and treated us an inconvenience. She also provided us with numerous eye rolls and blatant avoidance. We were early for our reservation and saddled up to the bar ($8 for a vodka soda!). However, there were empty tables throughout the restaurant. At our reservation time, they still wouldn't seat us because another party was 25 minutes late for their reservation. How this correlates with our reservation is still a mystery to me. Our party of 9 ended up leaving and going to a locally owned restaurant right down the road. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time last night and loved it. So many great menu items, it was hard to choose from. I had the seafood dish that was fresh and delicious. Service was prompt and attentive and the atmosphere was adorable! When we first arived there was a two person band setting the mood for the evening. I would definitely come again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"First time was three years ago on our first date. Tonight was our last visit to La Scala. We had the two specials. Sea bass and osso buco. Both were slimy and salty. Worst osso buco in 40 years. It's a shame this place has gone so down hill."}
{"text":"Sweet potato ravioli !!!!! absolutely wonderful.
Also tried the spaghetti carbonara and they did not mind adding eggplant to it for me, and it was just delicious as well. 

Cute little place with an overall good food selection. They have an extensive wine list as well. 
only thing that bugged the shit out of me was they had that white construction paper covering the cloth table cover and it was just annoying. i mean really? you really cant afford to change the table cloths and wash them so you don't have to use that annoying tacky paper???yucky!

okay I'm done bitchin'

overall nice spot glad i finally checked it out."}
{"text":"It is now ten days later, and I want more of the pasta I ordered while I was at this restaurant. It was delicious and beyond my kitchen, some of the best pasta I've ever had. My friend ordered the eggplant orecchiette, which was pretty good. I got the squid in pasta and man, was it everything I wanted in pasta that night. The garlic wasn't overbearing and everything complemented the seafood so well. The seafood, besides the shrimp, were well prepared. And even though the shrimp was overcooked a little it was still delicious. 
I wish for the price you could have gotten a small house salad or something, but the pasta dishes weren't too unreasonable. And for how much pasta I got, I feel it was worth the 19 dollars I spent. I took half home and ate it two more meals. They have free bread too which is perfect. Soft and warm on the insides and crusty on the outside. 
My one real complaint is that even though it wasn't very busy, service took a while to get drinks on the table and such. Plus, we had three different people coming to our table so if I asked one person for something, or server would come back and not know we were waiting. 
All in all, I'd like to go this place again the next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"We had dinner here. The salads were excellent. I had some type of squash ravioli with Gorgonzola cheese. The Gorgonzola cream sauce was pretty heavy.  Next time I order that, I would ask for it on the side, so I could control the amount of sauce on my pasta. 

The service was a little slow but we still enjoyed ourselves.

My husband out of the squid ink pasta with tomato and garlic sauce. He absolutely loved it!  

I would definitely come back here again. We got there early so it wasn't as crowded and as we were leaving about 7 o'clock it was getting pretty full."}
{"text":"The service is one of the worst I've encountered.
The server ignores us and serves other people who came in later than us.
She dropped the menu on the table and walked away after I asked for the lunch specials. 
She served bread to the new table and didn't come to our table at all for about 15 mins. 
The pizza with artichokes, sausage and prosciutto was so-so. Not impressed.
Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give no stars I would. I can't comment on the food, but the service is to be lacking. We had a reservation for 8, we showed up early and they couldn't seat us. I get that, but there were 2 large open tables. They claimed they had other reservations, and it turns out the other reservations were late (30 min late). I was sitting at the bar the whole time and heard them talking crap about us and rolling their eyes. Also who has a plaque for a 'B' rating!? They do. Hope you have better luck than us."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a few years, but used to go to conventions at the hotel across the street pretty regularly, and the boccocini are something I crave to this day.  Everything we had there was just excellent, and the staff did quite well at accommodating big groups."}
{"text":"Definitely will come back to try more dishes or have the same ones again.  We have been coming to downtown Chandler for some time now but we somehow missed this gem.  The food is absolutely delicious and the ambiance is perfect.  Have gone with a group of people multiple times and it was a mixed order of veg and non veg dishes.  Everyone raved about their dish... so it seems like you can't go wrong with your pick.

Downside is that the wait time is long but the food is delicious, which is why I'll be going back.  We usually grab some vino and wait by the bar for our table."}
{"text":"A great date place. Atmosphere is nice and relaxed. The waiter we had was very helpful and knowledgeable. I had the lasagna which was very good but exactly what you would expect for lasagna. My girlffriend got the sweet potato ravoli which was amazing. We also got the tiramisu which was great. The only complaint I would have is that the bread wasn't very good. It just wasn't crispy or flavorful. Overall, La Stalla is excellent."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Fries were good. Waiter was rude. The others around the table liked what they had: spaghetti with meat balls, margarita pizza, and sub."}
{"text":"Perfecto! I had the chocolate soufflé and the cappuccino. They were both great and the service was awesome. The only thing that was off putting was the bathroom. I felt like I was in the bathroom of a Burger King. I would come back."}
{"text":"Ok...so I am one sided about this place! My husband and I consider ourselves \"regulars\". If you are looking for spaghetti and meatballs, this is not that type of Italian food! This restaurant is truely authentic Italian food....the \"soul food\" of Italy. I just love the boar, yes I said boar meat sauce over Pappardelle! Don't knock it 'til ya tried it!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what Italian food the other negative reviews have eaten but this food is the real deal! Lasagna was primo and the gnocchi was out of this world! Cami is the best too. Good hearts and great food. Can't go wrong here! Go here! Try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great Happy Hour at La Stalla!  My wife and I go quite a bit for an early dinner and can walk out for less than $20. 

Happy Hour is every evening from 4 - 6 an we usually get a beer or two a piece (at only $2) and great authentic Italian pizza (at only $5 a pie).  

When we've ate a full dinner - it's always been great as well. The desserts are fantastic ... Check out La Stalla!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was surprising. We are staying across the street and while checking in we notice this adorable place.  The service is impeccable, the food impeccable and extremely happy we spent our time here relaxing. Also their wine list has a good variety."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Good beer selection, half price gourmet pizza and a comfortable atmosphere! Happy hour is 4 to 6 except on Tuesdays when they are closed. Great homemade lemonchello! Service is OK, this is why they didn't get 5 stars. People are friendly, but not very speedy. They have my favorite local beer on tap! Half price Pie and good beer - you cant really go wrong! Check out La Stalla~"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food; some of the very best pizza anywhere. Attentive service and reasonable prices. Do yourself a favor, gents--don't show up here in your shorts and polo shirts. Put on something nice and take your date out to a terrific lunch or dinner at this cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. So delicious. But the service is AWFUL. Every time we come we wait forever for a waiter to even acknowledge us. There last Thursday and waited 20 minutes with no waiter. We left and went to DC steakhouse. HIRE MORE STAFF"}
{"text":"Decor and atmosphere are warm & inviting.  Service and food were very good.  Staff was extremely courteous

Location is great, in a plaza setting."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week and was in the mood for a calzone. Ordered mine to go and was all excited, but ended up being disappointed. The cheese inside was good, but there were no spices to be found. The cheese inside was layered in an odd way as such you didn't get the ricotta and mozzarella at the same time. Sure won't be getting this again, but might give a pie a go and see if that's any better. Meh..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, as it just would be so nice to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area, and it's close to home. But I was overall very disappointed in the food. The only thing I liked, honestly, was the bread and the wine. 

We had the prosciutto fresh mozzarella dish and it was greasy, bland, salty and just bad. Our main dishes were the spaghetti carbonara, and it was such an Americanized \"past with alfredo sauce\" version of it. Very cheesey and creamy and way overpowering smoked pancetta. It was truly awful.  And at $16 or $18 a plate, hardly worth it and far from what traditional pasta carbonara should be. I'm not sure why restaurants use a cheesy alfredo sauce for carbonara, when it should be egg used for the consistency, not gobs of cheesy sauce. Bleh!

The atmosphere, wine and bread were good, but I can get that at home. Was sorely disappointed and felt the regret of spending $80 on a totally mediocre to bad experience with the food.

I have yet to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area. The closest thing is the new Italian Restaurant by Chris Bianco. Meatballs to die for!"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but the night we  went here dinner service was very slow.  Our table hardly noticed because we were enjoying apps, drinks and conversation. The party of 8 next to us looked like they wanted murder us because our dinner came out before theirs!!! We were entertained by their anger.
Other than that, food was great! Lemon drop martinis...yum."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken parm and a veal dish.

Food was good but not great.  The chicken parm came out warm versus hot.  No real comments on the veal dish.

The veggies that came with both were pretty decent.

Not sure this place will make it into my rotation, but I haven't ruled out going back."}
{"text":"After reading what other yelpers were saying about this place, I am glad that it wasn't just me. Their service is absolutely horrible. I honestly don't know how they receive a 4 stars overall rating. 

Since I am a big supporter of the local restaurants, we figure we would give this place a try. Hostess was friendly to us, but our server was horrible. She is a older short blonde hair lady & another waitress was following her all night (possibly a trainee). When she came over twice to take our order for drinks and entrees, she made me repeat myself multiple times and gave me a puzzle look as though she didn't understand the word that was coming out of my mouth. I honestly felt discriminated. I began speaking much louder and I think she eventually got the point. We asked for more bread (only once) and she gave us an attitude & appeared to be annoyed. The whole experience made us feel horrible. 

For entree, we ordered a lasagna and a spaghetti. They were both average. We probably would have come here to try something else again if it wasn't for the attitude we received. 

If you want great service, don't come here. I personality will not ever come here again."}
{"text":"My aunt and I love this place!  The decor is great and the service did not let us down!  Both of our meals were wonderful and we left craving more.  We will definitely return here once I find time to visit AZ!

Random side note: during our dinner here, we sat in the back of the restaurant and I was bit about 20 or so times on my ankle by a spider or some type of bug.  The bites stuck around for months!  I called and asked if this happened to anyone else and the hostess said 'no'.  Just be careful if you're wearing open toed shoes!"}
