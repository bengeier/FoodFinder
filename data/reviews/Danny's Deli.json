{"text":"Ate here on a recent business trip to Cleveland. This is a hole-in-the-wall about 10 minutes walk from the business district.  I prefer these places to chains and shiny places because the food tends to be better.  Danny's Deli is that kind of place.  The pastrami and corned beef were excellent!  We got there early for the lunch crowd and were able to get a table; good thing we did because less than 10 minutes later the entire place was filled (mainly with local blue collar guys).  Behind the counter there was a guy who was literally doing nothing but slicing pastrami and corned beef --- they must sell mountains of that stuff every day!  The waitress was really friendly, even though it was crazy busy and it was clear we were just visiting. Service was FAST and the food was excellent.  I went back several times.  Colleagues came with me and we tried various things, all of which were good. However, there best thing on the menu is the pastrami and corned beef. Try it!  The only downside to this place is they are only open for breakfast and lunch. Close at 2pm or so.  I'd have gone there for dinner after my meetings if I could.  If I ever get back to Cleveland, this place is on my \"get back to\" list."}
{"text":"Had a great turkey sandwich for lunch today. Will definitely come back all the time. Friendly place and made me feel like I was at home."}
{"text":"My coworkers took me here for the first time today and I will definitely be coming back. Good food, good prices, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in the entire country!!  I travel alot . .  I grew up in  Akron Ohio and used to make the hour + drive to Cleveland just to eat at Danny's  Now I live in Phoenix Arizona and still go to Danny's as often as I can, . .  I might visit my Mom and Dad while I'm there,. . .  but I will never miss the Best Corned Beef Sandwiches I have ever had  ! . . .  My kids will also say if we go on vacation to Ohio . .  can we go to Danny's?? PLEASE!! . . . Not Cedar Point, or the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . . . Danny's!   This place is on the same par as New York Deli's like The Carnagie Deli or Katz Deli !! . . . I know I've been to all of them.   Say HI to George when you stop in at 17th and St. Clair in downtown Cleveland"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp,  we found this great breakfast spot. Simple, delicious and inexpensive. Super friendly staff. Family had the French Toast,  Western Omelet, Breakfast Wrap, and the Croissant Breakfast Sandwich.   If you are staying in Cleveland, Danny's is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Sigh.  Before yesterday, I'd been here about 4 times and relished each visit. Perhaps it was a one-time time thing but, yesterday's sandwich was a big disappointment.   I got there around 11:30a.m. and there was only one other guy in the dining room.   My waitress was eager and pleasant ... the corned beef was dry and tasteless.  Another Slymen's wannabe bites the dust!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 11 years and nothing has changed, the food is still wonderful and the people and customer service is wonderful. It's my favorite place to eat. I feel terrible when they go on vacation because I don't eat until they return lol . Please do yourself a favor and treat your taste buds to a treat."}
{"text":"i heard this place had a pretty good corned beef sandwich.  craving corned beef, i decided to give it a try.  i was hopeful as i walked in the door.  the place was desolate, only one other person in there.  i ordered my $9.25 sandwich and was excited as i watched the girl behind the counter grilling up a sandwich.  Till, i heard the sad sad beep of a microwave, to my dismay i watched the girl pull a pre-measured baggie of pre-sliced corned beef out of the microwave and assemble my sandwich.  a MICROWAVE??  really, this place has a huge grill and choose to reheat their corned beef in a plastic bag in a microwave.  my heart sunk a little.  i will say the beef was tasty, sliced really thin, and the bread was good.  It had semi warm spots and semi cold spots, it definitely wasn't a Hot Corned Beef and i don't think it was worth $9.25. I'll be sticking to Slyman's next time."}
{"text":"Was looking for lunch after a visit to the Rock 'n Toll Hall of Fame. Danny's came up on Yelp and was an easy walk. The place was hopping but seemed to be organized chaos. Our waitress was busy so Danny took care of us. Very attentive. Our hot pastrami sandwich was hot, piled high and tasty. Would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"A work friend convinced me to go today, and I have to say I was seriously impressed. I love Corky and Lenny's and Slyman's, but Danny's is seriously the best! I had a beef and turkey with american cheese. It was so delicious! The bread was that perfect balance between buttery and crispy, that I love in a deli sandwich.   Unfortunately, it's not in the best part of downtown Cleveland, but if you can make your way there it's truly worth the trip!"}
{"text":"In terms of Corned Beef, Danny's has my favorite!  Yea...  Strong words right? They do and I am sorry if you feel different.  Getting your CB to go in a brown bag adds to the nuance.  Even if Danny's is not your ultimate favorite for corned beef, or at least in the top 3; you don't know CB in CLE."}
{"text":"Danny's Deli is a classic greasy spoon joint downtown.  You will die of a heart attack if you eat there regularly, but if you like corned beef, they'll pile it on so tall you can't open your mouth big enough to bite it.  And you'll probably be full after just half of it."}
{"text":"After walking into Slyman's and hearing they were out of bacon, I hightailed it out of there and headed to Danny's.  BOOM.  Great call.  Efficient, friendly service and they get the order precisely right.  No pseudo-fake, \"Get out of my way I have 4 corned beef sandwiches to serve\" attitude like you get at Slyman's.  I think Danny's' has a better selection anyway.  Their onion rings are good (my #1 vote will always go to Johnny's Little Bar).  I got the Danny's club.  I wish I would have gotten it toasted.  Bummer...next time.  Hole-in-the-wall deli that should be in heavy rotation on everyone's lunchtime eats list."}
{"text":"Simply put just a great deli with wonderful owners (who work the kitchen) and staff.  Breakfast Wrap filled with eggs, bacon, cheese and hash browns is delicious.  You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches, reubens, turkey, roast beef, combos, burgers, steak fries, etc.  For breakfast or lunch, it is a winner."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST deli in Cleveland!!!  The nicest owners with an incredible staff.  They constantly go out of their way to make the customer feel like family.  Everything on the menu is delicious and fresh!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place truly made me homesick! A fantastic local diner with a true neighborhood feel! The owner new most people coming in for breakfast pickup orders and spoke to them personally. Good food, great staff and excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay, so I did a review for Katie's Clean and Green, a great laundromat in Lakewood across from St. Ed's. Well, this little gem is right next door, and I must say, I was really pleased.   The place looks simple and unadorned, but not all gems sparkle at first. The folks running it are really nice, and the food was great and pleasant surprise.   Danny's serves, from what I've seen, not only  a good Corned Beef and other standard deli fare, but a variety of breakfast (served till 11) items, and other hot, tasty treats.  The Philly Chicken Cheese Steak with coleslaw and rings I had; just great. AND, when you're doing laundry at Katie's, stop next door. I also told a friend that this place would be great for a \"laundry date\" with yer sweetie; clean up AND scarf down..some great food at Danny's:)"}
{"text":"I left New York a few years ago and I've been looking for a place that sells good corned beef and pastrami sandwiches. Of all the places I've been to around the country, Danny's Deli is one of the closest I've found to the experience I remember at places like Second Avenue Deli in New York City.  The staff was very friendly and it's not a far walk from my office downtown."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Danny's Deli since I was a kid.  As a visitor, back to the good ol city of Cleveland, it's a welcomed familiar taste!   Fresh, thin sliced corned beef on rye. The beef almost melts in your mouth. It's juicy and so happy we stopped by"}
{"text":"Danny's is dive deli/diner at its greatest. The food is good, it's cheap and it's quick. I've only had the breakfast and the corned beef so far but both were great. The decor here has a bunch of random pieces of Cleveland and Danny's history which was cool to look at. Both times I have been here the crowd consited of Police and other city/public employees that most likely were supposed to be doing something a little more productive then smashing food but I don't blame them, its good stuff."}
{"text":"One more time I shake my head and think I am singing in the wrong choir. Places I find impressive the rest of yelp either ignores or lambasts. This morning I had a breakfast sandwich of corned beef, Swiss cheese, and egg along with coffee at less than McDonald's or Dunkin prices yet far superior. Danny's is not cutesy, does serve those over fifty, has no beer--these must be causes for derision. Surely the food and prices cannot be reasons for the empty tables around me. Luckily another senior couple was there and we passed the time discussing how to keep hibiscus over the winter, the made in China products at Lehman's, and other topics we old folks ramble about."}
{"text":"This place took over Tina's, which had been fairly good but really fell drastically in quality in the end.  I wok nearby and was excited for a new place for lunch, but unfortunately, Danny's Deli food tasted almost exactly like Tina's in its \"OK\" days.  Nothing memorable about my sandwich (Philly Cheesesteak) at all.  Average bun, not a lot of flavor in the meat -- just sort of blah overall.  I will give them one more shot to see if things have improved.  We ate there the 2nd week they were open, but this isn't haute cuisine, so I didn't think they'd need time to settle in.  We'll see..."}
{"text":"Too many people have said to me, \"it's hard to screw up breakfast\". Well I have had some pretty sorry breakfasts in my travelling experiences from bland to burnt to blah. Some of these disasters on a plate have cost me $12 or more. Danny's Deli has a hot, fresh breakfast that won't empty your wallet, the most expensive plate is $6.50.      While staying at a hotel in Cleveland the bartender in the lobby lounge recommended a place nearby saying they had a good breakfast. It was much closer to Tower City and also inexpensive...AND, \"it's hard to screw up breakfast\".   They didn't screw it up, he was right, but the quality and speed of receiving my breakfast was not even close to what I got at Danny's Deli. i only wish I could have skipped the advice and had Danny's breakfast on our final day as well. I had already had the Danny's Deli corned beef hash and if you are an early bird who likes to beat the crowd it is worth the trip. My wife and I walked the 20 minutes and saved $10 on cabbing it form public square.    If you want an old school, hot, fresh diner joint breakfast...this is the spot. But get there early because it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"I will echo what all the other reviews say: great food, great service, great atmosphere. My major complaint is with the pricing. I live in DC, and this was *more* expensive than what I regularly see... in what is not a particularly nice part of downtown Cleveland.   Furthermore, I'm not exactly sure what I even paid for. I ordered the Classic Couple ($10.95) and was charged $12.75 plus tax. I guess cheese is 50c, which is noted on the menu, but is there an upcharge for sauerkraut as well? 1000 Island? What gives? When it was all said and done, with a tip I paid nearly $16 for just a sandwich and tap water. $16 for a sandwich... in Cleveland. Granted, it was a heaping pile of meat and deliciousness, but I can get a similar quality deli sandwich in much more expensive cities for the same price, if not cheaper.   Would have been 4.5-5 stars, but I weight value much higher for lunch spots like this. $16 for a sandwich in Cleveland is ludicrous."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I want to branch out and try somehting new, but the corned beef is just so good I can't! This is my favorite corned beef, and that includes between all of Cleveland, Cincinnati, and even I hate to say, Chicago. The key is that if you order the hot reuben, it is buttered and grilled, with fresh thousand island and mild sauerkraut. For people with more of a love for an intense kraut, this is not the place, but the size of the sandwich meets the price tag you pay.   They also have typical diner breakfasts and favorites.  The limitation s really mainly the hours, they are only open for breakfast and lunch, which is probably for the best, I would eat here all the time if I could!"}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know about Danny's Deli: -Good Breakfast - great rye toast -Best Turkey Reuben I've ever had -Excellent homemade chicken salad -The corned beef is some of, if not the best in the city -They close at 2:30pm :( and are not open on the weekends -Friendly and fast service, decent prices, and great food"}
{"text":"Just as good as Slyman's. Cramped inside, but not a long wait. Got the reuben and so mad at myself for leaving my leftovers there."}
{"text":"Got to the rock n roll HOF too early before it opened and walked 10 blocks or so to this spot for breakfast. I love going to old school diners/deli''s and this one is really good. Very friendly staff as it was fairly obvious we were not locals. I had the the bacon egg and cheese croissant($4) and my son pancakes, bacon and eggs ($6) Food was quick hot and tasty. Would love to go back for a big sandwich. Props to owner/staff made us feel very welcomed."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. I was looking for a good corned beef somewhere close to the Greyhound station. I need a place in walking distance. This restaurant is three blocks away. I wanted breakfast but I was too late. I had a BLT with extra bacon and fries. The sandwich its self was delicious. The bacon was crispy and crunchy without being over cooked. The firs were good but more than a few were under cooked. I also got a \"jaw breaker\" corned beef. Thats why I originally came here. It was very good and yes my jaws hurt"}
{"text":"I don't think you can miss here to be honest. I've gone here for breakfast several times and always got the breakfast burrito, which is really good. They put the hashbrowns inside which is never a bad idea. As much as I hate to admit it, I've had breakfast here and ordered sandwiches to take home for later. They're that good. I like the lunches better than breakfast. Corned beef, pastrami...you name it, they're all great. The New Yorker is my favorite because it's loaded with meat and cole slaw.   It's a small place, but great people and great service. You go there twice and they'll remember you for life. There are regulars EVERYWHERE which always says something."}
{"text":"Come in around 6:30 am, bring your A game. This place has it going on. Beet croissant sandwiches! $4 come on try it"}
{"text":"I'm on my way through Cleveland and headed back to the NYC in the next hour or so. However before even getting up from my chair I wanted to leave a review for the reason number 15 that I am smitten with Cleveland. Cleveland is a city that's won my heart in many ways as it is in a resurgence period that if I were to move somewhere and be apart of something wonderful this place might be it. But that's Cleveland and I should talk about Danny's.   I've been fortunate enough to travel a lot and usually I get a pastrami or pastrami rueben where ever I go. If your in Los Angeles it's The Hat. If your in New York City it's 99 Park Avenue Grill. But if I lived near or within 50 miles of Danny's I would happily drive over for their breakfast and definitely for their Pastrami Rueben. It is not a stingy bit of meat on stale bread. Instead it's a heaping pile of why I'm happy were still a free country and service from some of the sweetest people you'll see on the either side of the Mississippi. It's small, it's local and it will leave you spending $11 on the greatest food you'll find. So, I'm off soon, but me and my party of 5 picky people are all ecstatic and can only hope to visit Cleveland again some day and hope that Danny's is still as good.   If you live here or are driving close enough and wants food. Eat here. You're fortunate to have food this good thing close. Take advantage, if you ever move away you'll miss it here."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on foodnetwork.com and they did not disappoint. The pastrami mad corned beef combo was outstanding! The service was even better, friendly and courteous. I'm not often in Cleveland but when I return I will be going right back to Danny's Deli."}
{"text":"WOW. Just Wow!  After driving by this little joint the other day - I checked them out on Yelp. At the time - 11 reviews averaged out to 4.75 stars. That means I had better check this place out!  First, I stopped by for breakfast. I was intrigued by the thought of their breakfast wrap (really a Burrito). It was advertised as bacon, eggs, home fries, cheese and tomato. I asked if I could have it where they substituted their corned beef hash for the bacon? They told me no problem!  I got it to go - they made it fresh and hot to order! Man was that ever good! My only regret is that I wanted to add some black pepper and hot sauce to it - but it was still really damn good!  Next up - we got their \"Jaw Breaker\" corned beef sandwiches at lunch time, served with mustard and swiss cheese. The thing was huge - loaded with more corned beef than I've ever seen in a sandwich!! (see attached pix). But even better, was that it so damn lean and tender!  I could only eat half my Jaw Breaker this time around - but man was it good!  I will be back to visit again - and eat it next time!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you.  Looks like a little dive diner, the food was excellent.  We had corned beef hash- not out of a can- great flavor, not too salty.  Also the gyro breakfast.  Could have included some onions, but tasty."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in all of Cleveland. I've unfortunately only visited Cleveland twice but this place has been my dad's number one place to go for breakfast and lunch since he started working out of Cleveland a couple years ago. Danny's is a very welcoming environment where the staff greet you with smiles and treat you like Family. I would 100% recommend this place for anyone who just wants some good food. The corned beef and Georgie Burger are AMAZING!!! Can't wait to visit Cleveland again to go back to Danny's. I only wish they could deliver to Buffalo."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick reasonable breakfast, Danny's was the ticket! Fast clean and great food! It's a hole in the wall Place but don't let that turn you away what's inside is a great local dinner with friendly help and good food. The corn-beef was top notch, tender not fatty and melt in your mouth. The breakfasts were great my co-workers all felt the same good food at a great value. If on downtown skip the hotel restaurants in go visit Danny's."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for food and hospitality they make you feel at home right away"}
{"text":"Please stay away so it's not crowded for us regulars! Great old school diner! Cheap, quick, friendly staff, and the food is just good enough! Get the mile-high corned beef if you dig Slyman's. Small place, a bit hidden away...interesting mix of blue collar & white collar regulars, always a good sign. Classic joint!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in today on the suggestion of a friend. Very friendly staff; greeted us as soon as we walked in with big smiles and ready to answer any questions we had.   We decided to dine in. I got a Reuben and fries and he got the big corned beef (picture included) with fried mushrooms. Huge portions on both sandwiches. We both took half home in a to-go and they were delicious! Fries were fresh as were the mushrooms. I also likes that they had thousand island and horseradish at the table for easy access.   We will for sure be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I first visited in 1999, when I was intern at Plain Dealer and I make an effort to get a corned beef w/ American & mustard when I'm in town. Their breakfast corned beef hash is a great way to start a day.   Simply the best corned beef in Cleveland... I'd go as far as saying the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time and what a hoot!! I enjoy learning and watching a commercial kitchen at work. Danny's grill, sandwich and soup stations are right across the bar seating... so I grabbed a seat there.  Staffing was two people down due to sickness and the pace behind the counter was incredible.  Everyone kept their cool and sense of humor. I was served as quickly as I would want by a great waitress who helped me choose my sandwich and suggested the combo.  I got a few tips on grilling by watching Tony work the grill.  It was an enormous sandwich and the best tasting, lean reubin I have had. Being over 60 half had to go home with me for dinner tomorrow.  The fresh horseradish and thousand island added the one two punch.  You will mot be disappointed at Danny's. It has become my favorite lunch spot when downtown after just one visit."}
{"text":"What a find!   Driving around looking for a lunch spot, saw Danny's saw the undercover cop car parked outside and knew we had to go in.  Great corned beef on rye (lean) - had flashbacks of the \"Pepsi, Pepsi\" scenes from Saturday night live as we worked through the ordering process.  Know what you want, let them know, pay and get the hell out of the way.  Great sandwiches - every city needs a joint like this!  I travel all over the country and this is a CLASSIC!"}
{"text":"I love Danny's.  I have been visiting Danny's for years, not only is the food great but so is the staff.  I have tried many items over the years and you can't beat the corn beef but I think my favorite has to be tie between  the chicken club and the open roast beef sandwich.  They also have a terrific soups and chili."}
{"text":"The corned beef here is all I ever order. I had to try it for lunch after walking by the place and smelling corned beef every morning on the way to work. East 17th is a great place to check out some of the cool homeless of the city. They are always partying it up, drinking Wild Irish Rose from the corner store Grossmans. The corned beef is good. If you wish to avoid the fatty cuts off the brisket, you can opt for extra lean meat for an extra 50 cents. The sandwiches are expensive ($8 or $9) but it is a five inch thick mass of corned beef. It is a real authentic Cleveland deli. Just bare bones inside with a nice bar style row to watch the grill cooks get busy. My friends ordered the chicken philly and something else and said it was good."}
{"text":"Danny's is my favorite breakfast place now. The corned beef omelette is worth coming here for alone. They also have a corned beef, egg and swiss on rye that I keep getting. The service is great and everybody is really nice. The regular breakfast meals are good and cheap too."}
{"text":"Great diner food, great service, great prices. Best corned beef in Cleveland; Slymans doesn't hold a candle to these guys."}
{"text":"Solid little joint down the street from slymans. Delicious food. Closes early though."}
