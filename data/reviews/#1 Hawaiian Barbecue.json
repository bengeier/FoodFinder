{"text":"good customer service. food was okay. their 'fried saimin' was tasty, however, instead of saimin noodles, they used a thin chow mein type noodles. i hope they research more into hawaiian food because some of the desciptions in the menu of classic island food were wrong."}
{"text":"Their name is \"#1 Hawaiian food\" yet no one working there is Hawaiian. The food IS NOT Hawaiian. The girl upfront can't even answer your questions. My friend asked her if the chicken on the spicy chicken plate was breaded and she didn't know what we were talking about. The rice isn't sticky, it's hard, macaroni salad is bland, it's literally just Asian food trying to be Hawaiian. Ross J's is still #1 in town along with Aloha Specialties. This place is over priced and not authentic."}
{"text":"I was just passing buy and saw this place and thought i would give it a try.  I wish I kept walking.  I was looking at the menu and inquired about the \"garlic chicken\" that was listed and how it was prepared.  The person behind the counter stated it was fried chicken and cooked in their garlic sauce.  They even added \"its really good\".  I understand everyone has different opinions but when i got home to eat this was far from good.  it was fried chicken pieces which is fine but it looks like they just put some Thai sweet chili sauce over it and called it a day.  They didn't even try to mix it up, it was literally just sauced poured over the chicken pieces.  I've been off yelp for a while but this was sooo bad I felt I had to write a review.  Maybe their other items are great but DO NOT get the garlic chicken unless you really like the Thai style sweet chili sauce.  I'm afraid I will not be giving this place another chance.  Too many other good spots around!"}
{"text":"Very similar to any traditional Hawaiian BBQ plate Lunch like L&L. I had the loco moco (two beef patties covered in gravy, with two eggs on top of a bed of rice. I always order it with over easy eggs, but they were almost cooked all the way through, so no yolky goodness for me. And they were a bit stingy on the gravy. The next time I ordered a 1/2 & 1/2 (Chicken Katsu and Kalua Pork), the chicken was perfect (crisp and GBD) the sauce was a nice balance of sweet and savory, but the Kalua pork was kind of dry. Overall a good place for a cheap quick lunch. Show your airport ID for a free drink."}
{"text":"Typical copy cat Hawaiian food with similar menu of L&L but terrible greasy food and customer service. Save your good money and good stomach space for better food elsewhere. Still want HI food nearby, try L&L at Flamingo m Maryland."}
{"text":"Love the BBQ mix and the boba slushy they have. It's a good portion of food for what you pay. Very nice employees.."}
{"text":"I'm not really into Hawaiian food , but this placed changed that for me . So good, I love the rice. They also have healthy options on the menu for someone that's on any off again on again diets like myself."}
{"text":"It is an excellent restaurant, price is reasonable, the portion is big, friendly and fast service. I like the short rib, it taste delicious. Highly recommended this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken katsu. It was okay but I've had much better elsewhere. The rice was good and the customer service was friendly."}
{"text":"#1 Hawaiian Barbecue. That's the name of this place.  I read on their website they opened a 2nd location on my side of town a few weeks ago. So while we were shopping in the area, we decided to check it out even though we already ate.   It's located in front of the Ross store in the shopping center near the airport. On the corner of Eastern and Oquendo. You can see the \"grand opening\" flags from Eastern.  Fast casual place. Order and pay up front and seat yourself. The dining area sign says max capacity 50. There were about 2 other families dining in and I felt it was already cramped. The tables are too close together. Barely any walking space in between.  Cant imagine 50 persons in there. Place is clean though.  They serve the traditional favorites like bbq shortribs, kalua pork plate lunches with 2 scoop rice and 1 scoop mac salad. I thought it was cool I can skip the carbs and in place they include eggs. Great for those who want to boost their protein intake.   Taste wise though it's between 'meh' and alright. It's missing a bit of the local 808 flavor and vibe for me.  The bbq shortribs I had wasn't the best quality. Then again the price was right for what I got. Judging by the Styrofoam boxes that I just threw out when I cleared out the fridge, safe to say that even my haole honey didn't think much of his Portuguese saugage and fried rice.  He has that dish all the time at other Hawaiian restaurants and  he cleans his plate.   The Taro smoothie was not too bad and the malasada I tried was okay. It's affordable though. It's just that I've had much better food at other places near me.   Staff is nice but there was just a bit of a language barrier and ordering was a tad difficult.   The family that owns this place just opened a new Chinese restaurant next door though. Maybe I'll give that place a shot the next time I ever in the area. Cool points for having delivery service! Im just  not in no rush though for the dine in part."}
{"text":"Calling yourself #1 at anything just invites judgement, and makes the disappointment of dismal product even worse. I ordered a bento box to try several meats (pork, ribs, mahi) for a quick takeout lunch. Food took longer than expected to come out, and when I opened the box back at my desk, it was the wrong order. I had an overwhelming portion of chicken katsu. The chicken itself was fine, slightly dry but nicely crispy, tasty katsu sauce. But the mac salad was drowning in mayo, the rice was mushy, and oh yeah- it's totally not what I ordered. Didn't finish the portion, tossed the leftovers. I was one of two customers, not sure how the single front of house employee got so confused."}
{"text":"Just reminds me of Ohana or L&L. On a training and went here for my lunch break and got the combination plate. Half chicken and Half beef. Everything tastes the same as the other places except the beef. It wasn't as tender and was really tough but still had good flavor."}
{"text":"poke is too bomb so is seaweed salad!! plus it was cheap and fast :) they only had 1 type of poke which is regular or Hawaiin style but it's only because this is a Hawaiin place not strictly a poke place. i like to get poke seaweed salad and rice to eat as a cheap meal 12$ total and feeds 2"}
{"text":"I order my lunch here all the time. I call it then i pick it up. They already know what i love to order. Pretty simple but their service is great. I've only dine in once and kinda took a while to get food but it's because it's lunch time. So i started just doing a take out...."}
{"text":"So...real highs, and some mediocres here. I will say that the Kalua pig (Pulled pork) and cabbage was way above average for Las Vegas. The meat was tender, well-seasoned, and cooked well. Lately in Vegas, one can expect this dish from Hawaiian establishments to be to overly salty, with chunks of meat and bland flavoring. But here, you get a very flavorful dish that is a real stand-out. The rice was good (read not mushy) and the portion generous enough. A solid dish.  On the down side, you get thin slabs of pre-frozen Mahi Mahi that is under seasoned and not cooked very well. They had areas were the heat didn't get to them evenly. It would be no surprise if they just reheated them in a microwave. Couldn't tell that they weren't. And they had chewy bits to both the fish and the fry. If you were expecting big chunky flakes of dolphin fish- you won't find them here. And the free egg rolls were nothing special. Thanks for the free item though.  Overall, the seating is okay. The people were friendly. The seaweed salad is the same you get everywhere. And the drinks were the same ones you can get for less than half price at the International Market. I found the prices to be rather high for quick, simple food. But, all Hawaiian places in town have that same problem. If I come back- it would only be for the Kalua Pig."}
{"text":"I love going here for lunch. I always feel welcome and the food is delicious. For the price and portion it's a good deal. My favorite plate is the seafood combination. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I tried many others,  and this # 1 Hawaiian Barbecue is just what their name say. Excellent food and beverage,  friendly service."}
{"text":"I usually order the low carb plate meat and eggs and cabbage underneath good flavor and I'm sure lots of sodium I've had the macaroni salad lots of mayonnaise and yummy.  spam Musubi pretty basic but good and they changed there kimchi which is better now.  I have eaten here probably 40 or more times and have never felt bad the next day LOL"}
{"text":"Got the chicken mixed plate and it was awesome, son got the hamburger steak he said it was one of the best he has had in vegas.  We miss home but restaurants like this make it better when we can eat good food.  The Katsu chicken in the best in vegas.  The only down is I don't like to eat there they are cramped and hot better to take out"}
{"text":"Great place to go to for some local Hawaiian BBQ if you're in the area. The prices are very cheap compared to other locations, the food is decent but you get a lot for what you pay for."}
{"text":"New place opened by Smith's on windmill and rainbow. Hawaiian / chinese barbecue. They are very nice and for the grand opening offered some egg rolls with each order (thank you) Ordered BBQ short rib combo, chicken katsu combo and some misubi spam and misubi Portuguese sausage  All good, hawaiian is always good!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up my yelpers try their bbq here and you will love it too! The place is clean and spacious. The cashier lady is very friendly and nice. Food quality very good...I love eating here compare to other Hawaiian restaurant."}
{"text":"I real y hace to Day   I liven in Hawaii for over a decade moved to Jacksonville Florida on vacación here in Vegas   Food is amazing been here two day in a row I ate chicken katsu today ramen and spam musico  My wife ate bbq beef two days in a row   I must say food delicious and great price   Thanks"}
{"text":"Very nice service and it smells pretty awesome. They even have pineapple fried rice...I mean come on pineapple fried rice. Who can argue with pineapple fried rice. They have the full Hawaiian menu to include poki...if your into that."}
{"text":"Good service, but more of a \"Japanese flavor\" to their food. Want excellent Hawaiian food? Go to Ross J's on sunset and mtn vista"}
{"text":"Ordered fried mahimahi. Unfortunately made with another cheap white fish, probably basa. Not a good impression for grand opening. Either owners substituting for cheaper fish or fish monger selling to them is deceitful. They did offer a replacement order but i politely declined. With so many other food options in area, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Wanted some lau lau... cashier seemed confused, so I ordered a lau  lau and kalua pork combo with no rice and no mac salad. Paid far more ($10.32) for an over salted kalua and midiocre lau lau. Better at L&L (Centennial Hills). Probably won't return."}
{"text":"HAIR in our bento box. DRY Kalua pig and Lau lau. No flavor and no seasoning. Counter rep gave us another bento box. Gave me \"sauce\" for kalua pig. Im like what SAUCE ?  So get a refund thank goodness but tells me \"that's how it's COOKED ! I'm from Hawaii ... I'm NO THANK YOU  Probably why Restuarant empty with only one other group of 3 patrons."}
{"text":"When it comes to Hawaiian barbecue, typically it invokes memories of extraordinarily sweet meat paired with sticky rice and mac salad...and that's exactly what you should expect from Hawaiian Barbecue!  One difference is that the short ribs are not as sweet as you'd might expect from other Hawaiian barbecue spots, but it's actually a good thing; you get to enjoy all of the Hawaiian flavors without having your palette being overwhelmed with sweetness (unless you're into that).   The rice was perfect, the mac salad was good, this place didn't blow me away, but it's good food for a good price."}
{"text":"I ordered Hawaiian chicken and kahlua chicken for a military going away. The staff was very helpful and professional. The food was delicious! We had about 50 people and if I had $1 for every time I was asked who made the food...I'd be able to buy s full tank of gas! They loved it!!!! I wished I had cater a full menu instead of just meats. They confirmed my pre-order twice prior to the event and even delivered it to the AFB base. Oh and they threw in tableware and donuts because they did not offer a military discount. I would recommend this place to everyone! Thanks so much for helping us send off one of our BEST!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Hawaiian BBQ, this one is fairly good. I rate my Hawaiian food based on rice, 8 out 10, meat 9 out of 10, sauce for katsu 3 of 10 Mac salad 10 of 10. Lots of chicken and Mac was overboard. They need to work in late I sauce. Friendly staff and clean place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Felt welcomed, tried their bbq combo plate and it was great. Mac salad is amazing! Better than l&l."}
{"text":"The wait here is terrible. It should never take over 40 minutes to receive food. I'm glad I came here on my day off if I came here on my lunch break I would have no time to eat it.   I will not be coming back here or even bringing my co workers here. We don't have all day to wait for our lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered by phone the Family meal option 1 - $25. Delicious! Friendly and fast service too (: Fed 4 - 5 people"}
{"text":"big combo plate- beef and mahi fish overcooked, not much on portion size.  they expect you to fill up on rice.   i advised manager that the beef and fish were being overcooked, she said thank you and nothing more.   I would have appreciated an invite with discount on second meal, but maybe managers need more training on the customer willing to give feedback rather that just not come back."}
{"text":"I placed an order via yelp on 04/27/18 but i had to cancel it. Its been 4 days already and i still havent gotten my refund."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken katsu, lot meat smell very good extremely worth,the price i pay , grand opening should go check it out."}
{"text":"Don't really see why the score is so low.   This place is pretty darn good.  And the service is above expectations of your other franchises.  I come here for the grilled mahimahi.   It's so delicious!  I haven't had the chance to try anything else just yet since for Lent Jesse and I gave up meat.    Yes, similar to L&L, but a lot better.  You know how I judge, by the cooks. Lol...sorry, truth to it.  You get some quality tasting meals from Chinese cooks.  My hubs is my personal Chinese cook, Lol.  Only thing I have noticed, they never have Brown rice and I have been here a couple times, too. Glad they are near the airport because we did find this place after landing back to Sun City.  Open until 10pm."}
{"text":"Order 1/2 and 1/2 not bad at all price wise it's ok the place is new the people who run it thou if you are going to eat in the restaurant is a little bit loud one might think your in a flee market with the noise this two people are making it will be nice to order to go and eat at home."}
{"text":"Ordered Katsu and BBQ Chicken!! Such a large portion, but perfect so I can save some for later!! Great prices. I love Mac Salad and I base my opinion on a Hawaiian Restaurant by their Mac Salad. It was delicious! Just how I like it, simple, creamy, no chunks of onion pieces. This is my Hawaiian go to place!! I can't wait to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to get a wide range of Hawaiian eats. Food is well-prepared and service is good.  I forgot that the Hawaiians like their sauces on the sweet side so I simply used the Sriracha and soy sauce provided at the table to season my seafood and chicken.  There were some other goodies that I'll need to try in the future."}
{"text":"A new place by Wal Mart that just opened up, very clean and polite service. However despite being a new place their soda machine was broken, or perhaps they just haven't gotten it operational yet? Either way it's a rip off for the canned sodas they make you buy instead. Also the meat served here is mostly just fat tissue, not really any actually meat. Pretty good pricing and overall a nice junk food run if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Simply mainlander Hawaiian barbecue. Nothing crazy, nothing exceptional, but hits the spot the same way fast food satisfies the need for a burger in a pinch. Friendly service and delivery is a plus."}
{"text":"I ate their BBQ Mix today and it's the best Plate Lunch I've had.  Portions were huge and the staff are very friendly.  The dining room is spotless and there's a bottle of Sriracha sauce on every table!"}
{"text":"The delivery was on time. The food was very good. Macaroni Salad was one of a kind. The family pack fed 6 people and there were leftovers. Highly recommend. Great value!"}
{"text":"The place is okay, nothing out of the ordinary. I always tend to avoid beef plates here. Beef portion can be random from time to time; you can end up with a minuscule of beef and more bones or a nice large cut of it.  The chicken plates are good, nothing to exaggerate about, however, customer service is wonderful. They do take requests of certain kinds such as more meat or rice, etc. for more cost. I do LOVE their chicken noodle (dry). Always yummy."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some co-workers as it is close to our employer. I ordered the #1 combination plate which comes with fried shrimp, mahi mahi and your choice of one item.  I like that they allow you to substitute items, so instead of the mahi mahi I decided on bbq short ribs and chicken katsu.  Their plates come with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. I really enjoyed the chicken katsu and fried shrimp. The rice is really good and I am not normally a fan of white rice however when you mix the macaroni salad and the katsu sauce in, it was tasty!  The bbq short ribs left a lot to be desired as one was completely inedible as it was all tough grizzle, the other one was good.  The meal is generous and for 8.95 you can't go wrong. I think we will do lunch here again, I will just refrain from the bbq short ribs and try a different choice.  The macaroni salad is not so good stand alone, however mixed in with everything else it is ok.  It was not the best however not the worst. I am down to try it again."}
{"text":"So, I really want to give this place a better star rating because the guy behind the counter was super nice and eager to help us - but the food left something to be desired and unfortunately it wasn't more of their food.  We popped in on a Sunday and as always, I started my order with the Spam Musubi. It hardly had any sauce, the rice mushy, and the seaweed was tough to bite through. I ate it there while I waited for them to package up the rest of my food. My roommate was with me so we waited together. We got all kinds of things. Lumpia, which was more like an egg roll and so greasy that it was nearly impossible to eat, chicken katsu plate which lacked any flavor and their pork which I will say was the highlight.  Thankfully my roommate and I were waiting together because they also mixed our orders up and packaged some of mine into his, which they caught before we left but wouldn't have had we not been.  All that being said, I have had better, but I wouldn't completely count them out. They are trying and if I'm over that way again, I might swing in and give them another shot."}
