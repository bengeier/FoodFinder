{"text":"VERDICT: This spot beats out Smallman Galley, Whitfield, and Morcilla for best new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  FOOD: Inventive cocktails, and global bar food with a decidedly upscale French flair. We sampled the burger, the pork belly, the confit chicken wings, and the duck fat fried poutine. All excellent, both in quality of ingredients and in the attention paid to preparation. I've traveled through much of Canada, and this is still the best poutine I've had. We were too stuffed for dessert, but availed ourselves of the innovative \"kitchen coffee\" option, wherein the customers get to buy a round of beers for the kitchen staff - we were taken upstairs to deliver the glasses in person and briefly chat with the chef and staff to express our appreciation.  SERVICE: Despite being a Friday night in Southside, the service was on point. Our server, Sophia was delightfully enthusiastic, the manager, Lauren was gracious, and some of our food was personally delivered by the chef, Matt. Everyone seemed to be really committed to making this a success. Lauren was also kind enough to recover a lost item for us and hold on to it for a week until I made it back.   AMBIENCE: the decor is dominated by a graffiti-esque mural in the corner, and accented by other local artwork, giving it a streetlike feel. The newness of the space leaves it feeling a bit stark right now, but as time goes by, it'll develop a patina that will enhance the gritty urban feel they're going for.  BOTTOM LINE: Get to Streets on Carson asap before it becomes the next Meat and Potatoes and weekend reservations become well nigh impossible."}
{"text":"Streets on Carson might be the South Sides best kept secret. The food is exceptional and they have a number of specials that are always good. Parking can be difficult, but is well worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything we had was delicious, especially the wings. The poutine is done with real cheese curds as it should always be. Highly recommend going with a big group so you can try a bunch of things."}
{"text":"Very good food. Philly cheesesteak was fantastic and the truth. It was lit fam. The pepito was very good too! I've never been so impressed with good food. The Asian buns too!"}
{"text":"Tried this awesome new place for the first time last night. Shared a few dishes with friends along with a couple beers. Everything was AMAZING! Probably my favorite dish was the chorizo tapioca. So good! Service was excellent as well. Looking forward to going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I live up the street and was so excited to hear about a new restaurant opening. Streets on Carson blew away all of my expectations. The service was great and our waiter Nicholas was incredibly knowledgable about the entire menu. The food was incredible and I savored every bite. The restaurant concept is street food across the country which is so unique to Pittsburgh. This is a Southside must."}
{"text":"This. Place. Throws. Down! Its been one of my go to spots since they opened. Literally everything on the menu is great. Theres somethin for everyone, whether you want to play it safe or try something new. The chicharron and broccolli rabe are both one of the best sandwiches ive had. Good beer selection and good drinks. Really cool design concept as well, paying tribute to all the streets surrounding carson. If you eat here, you will not leave dissappointed"}
{"text":"Chef Matt Christie plays on a diverse culinary background to delight the palate and eye.   A refreshing take on the best street food from around the world with Traditional French components at the core of each dish.   What a fantastic addition to the Pittsburgh food scene!  A must dine experience for any Pittsburgh foodie."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Creative menu, good drinks, friendly wait staff. I had the Pan con Chicharron. Pork Belly, sweet potato paste, onion, cilantro chilies,on a roll with really good fries! Dish is from Cercadodelima, Lima. Had a bourbon cocktail special from the board which was spot on. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"We got the Huarache, Pan con Chicharon and pork spring roll. The Huarache was our favorite followed by the Chicharonn.  A great idea and we'll definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Menu is an array of \"street foods\" from around the world so it's perfect for friends wanting to share a variety of small plates. Staff is friendly and helpful. And bar is well stocked and generous pours. Only downside is on sports nights ... particularly Penguins ... crowd noise can over the top. Ask for the window seats and enjoy the people watching."}
{"text":"Wow. Finally, a place in the Southside that has great food AND isn't over priced. You could go to one of the stereotypical, yuppie establishments and pay $10 for buffalo chicken dip or $14 for a burrito or you could come here and pay that, if not less, for delicious and unique food!  When I came here my boyfriend got the special (a Cuban) and it was so flavorful. I ordered the Tapioca, inspired by the Laranieiras Market in Rio de Janeiro. It's basically like a taco but not with mexican flavor profile at all. You can pick what's in it. But that's the best way to describe the way it is served. The shell is made of tapioca flour so it's soft and slightly chewy. A very unique and welcome textural food experience. I ordered the one filled with duck confit, caramelized leeks, caramelized shallots, roasted garlic, smoked Gouda and drizzled with balsamic glaze. Wow. It was great.   We also split the bone marrow. I have only ever had it once in a very fancy restaurant. This tasted almost exactly the same and was only $7!!!!! and we paid an extra $1 for more toast. But honestly, it was so good we couldn't believe we only spent $8.   And the drinks and cocktails are on par as well.   All around a very, very, very welcome place for the Southside. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who are more adventurous eaters looking for something unique and fun that won't hurt your wallet.   We also found out that the restaurant is owned by a young couple who had this great idea for a food-truck concept that turned into an actual restaurant thanks to the opportunity of this location. Knowing it's a local, family-owned restaurant makes it all the better.   Take a break from the places in Southside all owned by the same group and give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the unique attributes of Streets is that they list the location (read: street) that inspired a particular menu item. Perhaps vague in some cases, the street that resonated with me was North 12 Street in Philadelphia. For those unfamiliar with Philly, North 12th is the street that historic Reading Terminal Station is located. In this amazing urban market you'll find a dynamite roast pork sandwich, among many other things, so I had to try Streets' rendition for comparative purposes and was very impressed!  The sandwich was well seasoned, the pork was tender and juicy and the rabe was cooked perfectly (not too bitter). The fries were also delicious. My wife had the brick chicken sandwich which was also a great choice.  The service here were excellent as well, with the bartender taking the award for most conscientious and affable I'd encountered in a long while. I would definitely recommend this place, especially during happy hour where the value for the quality is tough to beat."}
{"text":"The food is so incredible and it's such a great space. Best new spot in the city! Must try the steamed buns. Cocktail menu is spot on."}
{"text":"Put this place on your \"gotta try\" list.  Fresh new concept.  Great local beer selection and the menu is out of this world.  The food was absolutely amazing.  Awesome husband and wife team that owns it.  Very pleasant and welcoming. We'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Terrific waitress that really took care of us! Food was wonderful. Small plates are small but really good! Sandwiches were delicious and filling. Make a reservation. It was crowded on a Saturday at 8."}
{"text":"Please for the love of all that it is holy and awesome - order the broccoli rabe. THE BEST SANDWICH I've ever eaten really!"}
{"text":"Best damn chicken sandwich I've ever had. The brick chicken has a delicious grilled chicken breast on a chicken mousse. $6 whiskey cocktail special. Lots of variety, I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped here randomly for a late night bite to eat on Saturday. First of all, our waitress, Sophia was the best. She was super funny and made the experience enjoyable. I read Rachel C's review and I totally agree with her about the menu. The concept of it is neat (dishes from all around the world), however you don't know what are snacks and what are large plates. I was very hungry, so I wanted to make sure I got something with some substance. I chose the special of the day (forgive me, I forget the name of it), but it was a sandwich stuffed with ahi tuna, pickled carrots and radishes, cucumber, jalepe√±os, cilantro, and some kind of sauce. It came with fresh cut fries. The portion was good, I left feeling full. I would come back to this place again to try out the drinks and small plates next time. For only being open for 4 months, I think Streets on Carson is on the right track!"}
{"text":"Wonderful for  lunch. What a surprise. Modern space skillfully appointed. A staff that knows the menu, including sources of ingredients and preparation. Portions are generous with two to three selections being enough for two to three people. Hope it has a long prosperous presence on the Pittsburgh dining scene/"}
{"text":"Went here tonight in a whim with my boyfriend and we were beyond pleasantly surprised! From the moment you walked in the attentive, friendly staff greeted us immediately. We got two rounds of cocktails, one the bartender recommended that was not on the menu... all were great! We tried a small plate and a sandwich which were both absolutely perfect! No question we will be back, very soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner before the pens game, amazing sandwiches with DUCKFAT FRIES they are amazing. Potato salad that will remind you of old school picnics!"}
{"text":"Been here two times in the past two weeks and I'm already wondering when I can go back. Both times I had the same thing because they were so good the first time I couldn't part from them. I started with the lobster crepe (split with a friend). The texture of the crepe is not traditional french, but it's quite soft and almost has a sweet taste to it that lets the lobster stuffing melt in your mouth along with the crepe itself. The sauce they put on it.... I would be interested if the chef would allow me to buy it by the gallon... amazing. I then had the veggie version of the Philadelphia cheesesteak... I actually had to have my friend try it because I didn't believe it wasn't real meat. So delicious and juicy. As a vegetarian for almost 10 years I have tried my fair share of \"faux meat\" attempts in upscale restaurants. This is the best I've had. Drink prices are a little high for carson street but the cocktails are unique and DELICIOUS! Happy hour prices are great too. Do not miss dessert no matter how full you are. I hope I get the wherewithal to try a few more menu items next time I go back but I don't think i can part with my faves. Not to forget - excellent atmosphere and impeccable/consistent service both times. Can't get better."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday afternoon around lunch time. The place was empty. A few people trickled in after us. The decor was interesting but definitely looked better in photographs. We sat at the bar and the bartender greeted us promptly with menus.   My friend got the pepito and I got the confit wings. The pepito's bread-to-meat ratio was way off, it was mostly just bread.  The duck fat poutine fries were sooo underwhelming. Probably the worst part of the meal. They were cold, soggy and all of the ingredients that made them \"poutine\" were at the bottom of the bowl. Definitely not worth the upcharge (that we weren't informed of). The wings had a decent flavor but were falling apart. I get the appeal there in theory (\"the meat was so tender it fell off the bone!\"), but I don't want a wing to fall apart when I take a bite.   Overall, an OK experience, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails. The egg rolls are so good that they have ruined me for egg rolls at my local chinese place. In a different category really. Also loved the steamed pork buns. Service very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Based on all the great reviews, I've been wanting to try out this place for quite some time now. I finally stopped in on a Thursday night and I'm sad to say I was extremely disappointed with both my food and my service. Maybe I came here on an off night?  My first impression was that the place looked really cool. Each table is given a South Side street name, hence the \"Streets on Carson\" and they have a decent selection of beers and cocktails. The food menu also looked really awesome with dishes from \"all around the world\" such as muffuletta sandwich from New Orleans or ahi tuna banh mi from Vietnam. I think the concept is great.   However, execution was lacking the night of my visit. I ordered the shrimp po boy while my friends ordered pastor tacos and a Cuban sandwich. Of the three meals, only one was decent, which was the Cuban. My shrimp po boy was served on thick, cold, Italian bread. It was drenched in their remoulade and get this, my shrimp wasn't even cooked all the way. Really, it was like eating a mayo sandwich with cold chewy shrimp. Really appetizing, right? My friend's pastor tacos lacked flavor where even a sprinkling of salt didn't help.   Service also wasn't that great. Our waitress never once smiled at anyone and just altogether looked and acted miserable. We just didn't feel very welcomed here.   I don't think I will ever come back and if I do, I will just stick to drinks."}
{"text":"I would seriously give place a 5....still will  do but their brunch menu is just that on a Sunday limited menu...but  great offerings,  very good for the dishes we ordered, great food & great service.  Party of 3 for Sunday brunch.  Very, very pleased with the food, service. Cheers to Sofia: a super server who took very good care of us, answered all silly questions...about beer & food. Food- our experience- very, very good.Very well presented & delicious. The decor is very Pittsburgh. Not over the top, sports oriented.  For our experience, just a great place. My group not late night, are party people ( but the place has but does  seem to have many fans, after work crowd!)  For a lunch or a Sunday brunch I would suggest you go & enjoy.  Food good, well prepared & good service. Bottom line: good service, food well done, prices are great. This place  a silly, super restaurant that celebrates and supports the Pittsburgh spirit."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service....the only drawback is that when it's crowded, it's incredibly loud. All the decor is hard, no carpet or fabric. That's something that bothers me, but other than that it was awesome."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is excellent, atmosphere is dope, location is convenient.  No complaints, everything is perfect."}
{"text":"This was our first stop when coming into Pittsburg and we loved it!! We had a few apps and then split the pressed filet sandwich which was marvelous! We are in town for a few days so I am sure we will be back as they are opened until midnight each night!"}
{"text":"Stop down for a late lunch....the best food in the Southside. Chef Matt and Lauren have brought the world to Pittsburgh. My burger was fantastic. And my arancini was amazing. Finally the Southside has a restaurant to be proud of!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  Very reasonably priced and generous portions.  Good vegetarian/vegan menu. They take reservations, so it is definitely worth checking them out!   My favorite part is the Pittsburgh wedding cookie table dessert - brownie & three assorted cookies are the perfect way to end a meal!   All sandwiches come with fries, just be aware of that because the appetizer fries are very tempting, but you will also get lots of fries with your meal.   I love that the tables are named after the streets in the South Side."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time. Sophia was one of the best servers I've ever had in any restaurant & we eat out a lot. She was friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable about the restaurant & menu, checked on us multiple times to make sure we had what we needed and enjoyed everything we had.   The food selection was fantastic - a great representation of global street cuisine. We had several things that we shared. The lobster crepe with sherry cream sauce was my favorite. It melted in my mouth & the flavor was out of this world. Huarache was good. Didn't know it would come on something similar to flatbread. The barbacoa on it was very good. My husband loved his slow roasted pork sandwich with broccoli rabe. He said it was one of the best pork sandwiches he's had and he's obsessed with pork. My mom had the Murica filet mignon burger & loved it. Next time I'd try the duck fat poutine. Will definitely return and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Overall I will definitely come back ... The best part of the place is probably the diversity of their menu and the quality of food... our table consisted of one Korean tuna ban mi, one burger, and on philly cheese steak ,  all very good   A quality sandwich and fries will run you about $12-$13"}
{"text":"Food was incredible and service was fast and great! We got the bone marrow and putine. Both were incredible! The putine was incredible and super filling! Perfect thing to split among friends over some drinks. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly! Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Wow. Truly an amazing meal. Totally exceeded my expectations.   First of all our server was awesome. Great personality, really friendly and on top of everything. Normally I don't really care about outstanding quality of service unless it is noticeably bad but this guy really did a great job, and it made the experience memorable in a fun way. He fit the atmosphere perfectly.   We decided to share a few of the small plates and a sandwich. We had the arancini, duck fat poutine and the jerk chicken. All three were honestly amazing. The yogurt sauce that came with the jerk chicken was to die for and the rice and beans were perfectly flavored and moist -- I hate dried out rice! The chicken itself was perfectly zesty and a tad bit charred. The arancini was awesome. Prosciutto was noticeable but no big chunks. I dipped every bite in the creamy sauce. So good. The poutine was also amazing. Crispy fries, flavorful gravy and cheese curd that was just melted enough. We cleaned the bowl.   For the sandwich we shared the pork and broccoli rabe. It was awesome. The flavor of the pork almost reminded me of wedding soup..in a delicious way. It was also a HUGE portion.   We ALMOST didn't get dessert but I am so glad we did. Our waiter recommended the cinnamon panna cotta and grilled banana bread. It was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. I literally want to go back and get it again tonight. GET THIS DESSERT!!!   I will 100% be back."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to coming to Streets on Carson ever since it first opened. I always look at coming here for dinner on the weekend and it's always packed. On Sunday morning we were looking for a new brunch spot & chose Streets on Carson!   When we arrived there were only 2 other people eating at the bar who left shortly after we arrived. We were the only people in there for about 1 1/2 hours which was surprising to me. We were quickly greeted by our waitress who was super nice and attentive. The atmosphere inside is also super cool. They have graffiti on the walls and all of the tables are named after different South Side streets- super cute idea! I was getting ready for Sunday Funday- so started off with a mimosa and Chris ordered the spicy bloody mary. Both were great drinks!   My issue with brunch is I can never decide if I want the \"br\" or \"unch\" part of it. Lucky for me, Chris couldn't decide either so we chose to get both and split! Immediately, the Chiliquiles caught me eyes. The best way to describe this dish is breakfast nachos. It had homemade tortilla chips, scrambled eggs, chorizo, salsa, peppers & queso. It was delicious! We also split the All American Classic-merica burger. It had caramelized onions and bacon on it and was served with fries. This burger was pretty good but I have had better. After looking through Yelp reviews & pictures, I can't wait to come back for dinner and try their dinner options."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice place and a couple decent drafts on tap. Really it's all about the food but the atmosphere is fun and the bar is nice and long. Looks like a lot of attention to the details and the food really is worth it. Tapioca is great, and sandwiches are terrific."}
{"text":"The wings are like nothing I've ever had before. The meat literally falls off the bone."}
{"text":"Pressed filet... I say that first just in case this review is too long and you do not read on, that is the must have sandwich. Our waitress said it was her favorite and she wasn't just overselling it was fantastic!! We also tried the brocolli rabe sandwich which was good, especially the bread but still couldn't compare to the pressed filet. The sandwiches won't disappoint, and neither will the desserts (be sure to ask for a dessert menu) both the cheesecake and the grilled banana bread and panna cotta were delicious, particularly the grilled banana bread, what a concept. The only thing that disappointed were the appetizers, we tried the tostada and the yakitori trio. The tostada simply wasn't very good but was shareable, unlike the yakitori trio which has three meat skewers that are hardly enough for one, but tasty. Overall, the place is midway on the price range, apps $7-$10, sandwiches $11-$13 and desserts $3-$7, you'll be tempted to try several items so if you have to skip something pass on the apps, because the service is plenty fast enough to wait, another plus. Absolutely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Wow! Came in on a Wednesday night and it was sooo good. Great service from a very friendly staff and the food and drink was A+. The aracini is great and the tapioca with chorizo is a must get. Of course the duck fat fries are good (and good for you!)  All around good place and can't wait to recommend and go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, the menu is interesting and the prices are reasonable. I went here for happy hour. For $5.00 you could pick from a list of infusions and they will make a special drink based of your preferences. Our bartender (Alec) was really personable and recommended a couple of drinks based of our likes. The drinks were tasty but not too strong which is appropriate for a happy hour.   Food was excellent. I had the \"Turkey\" dish which was a piece of whitefish that was cooked to perfection. It wasn't the most interesting thing on the menu but I was on a special diet and needed something light/healthy and it fit the bill. My companion had the pulled pork sandwich which was the best tasting thing I've tried in awhile. The bread they used was phenomenal as was the other toppings and they also had really good, crispy french fries which is very rare.  Prices were spot on to the quality/portion of the food. It got a bit loud after the place started to fill up but seems like that is the norm of these one room establishments and there isn't much that can be done. The crowd was a good mix of younger and middle aged couples."}
{"text":"Streets on Carson is a spot just a quick walk down the street that my husband and I had on our short list of places to try. We popped in on a cold afternoon, so the joint wasn't too busy. The atmosphere is very modern and has a great Pittsburgh vibe with the tables sporting local street names. The staff was attentive and friendly and the beer and cocktail selections are impressive. My husband ordered a delicious stout, and I stuck with water due to my current 9 month commitment to sobriety.  The menu is fun, offering different small plates and sandwiches from different geographic regions. We settled on the poutine and the Korean BBQ bao buns. The buns...on point. The poutine, while very tasty, was a little too salty for us (we're salty enough). The sand which selections looked fantastic with a filet / cheese selection representing pittsburgh that I feel I definitely have to try. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really like this place.....very creative menu. A fun concept with excellent food. Arcacni balls, lobster crepe and tapioca choices were outstanding. Fries with duck fat were amazing.  Nutella banana crepe dessert was perfect. Highly recommend for a casual, fun meal."}
{"text":"Streets was an awesome experience. I loved Yo Rita and I am so glad Lauren and her fianc√© brought an amazing restaurant to that spot. They have a great menu that is such a cool concept. I got a Peruvian pork sandwich which was awesome but Erika got the Brazilian tapioca that stole the show. Drinks were awesome and very reasonably priced. I saw a review that was mad about $5 drinks for happy hour? Don't know what they are thinking but try this place!"}
{"text":"When I found out that another French restaurant had opened in Pittsburgh, I was pretty excited. Cafe du Jour still ranks as one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh so I was indeed looking forward to the opportunity to see what this place had to offer. I came in and was immediately greeted enthusiastically by the owner of the restaurant. Telling her that it was my first time in, she immediately asked and made a number of recommendations to accommodate my preferences. This has played out every time I've come in to try something new. In general, the menu is subject to time to time depending on freshness of ingredients and what's available. I'm glad the place hasn't gotten rid of my favorite sandwich here, which is probably the Roast Pork Broccoli Rabe. There's something just so wonderful about the roast pork and how it's prepared here. Incredibly juicy, fresh, and full of flavor. Oh and did I mention that all the sandwiches here come with fresh fries that also taste great to boot? The Pressed Fillet is a great second option, but really you can't go wrong with any choice you make. They have a wide selection of appetizers and sandwiches to fit basically any taste and I also really like how they tailor menu items to different cuisines that people might like. In general, this has always been a great place to go eat. Great food, friendly and enthusiastic owners/staff, and at reasonable prices. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I went here on a date with the Mrs. recently and thought was ok... but honestly was somewhat disappointed; and I don't think it was just a matter of high expectations, I think the food was in reality not that impressive (or at least not compatible with my palate). They had these confit chicken wings that I was super excited about but ended up being citrus flavored which was disappointing; had a sandwich that was ok, and something else not especially remarkable that I can't remember. Atmosphere was meh... there were a lot of bikers in the area flexing their motorcycles and periodically stopping in and being almost as loud with their yelling and obnoxious jokes. So, all in all not a good experience and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Southside. We went there for happy hour, and despite being empty the place was amazing. Our service, food and drinks were fantastic.  We enjoyed the happy hour menu which included $4 drafts and $6 specialty drinks. With the server's help we were able to pick out two dishes that we really loved. We asked for a little assistance and she was able to tell us about all the things on the menu and what her favorites were.  The huarache is a delicious flatbread with plenty of flavor. We also had the Arancini, rice balls with great tasting sauce and shredded parm. It looks like a small plate but fills you right up!  We looked at the desserts but were plenty full from the food....we hope to go back for desserts and drinks soon!  A great place for locals and tourists, since the tables are named after south side streets. We sat \"on Sarah Street\" and love the view to Carson while enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently got back from our honeymoon in Thailand and stopped in on a random Saturday night. I'd previously researched the restaurant and was interested in their street food concept. The atmosphere was unique with the Southside street signs posted around the restaurant. I ordered the Roast Pork Broccoli Rabe and my wife ordered the jerk chicken skewers. The roast pork was fantastic. It was perfectly seasoned along with the broccoli and it paired well with its crusty roll. My wife also enjoyed her jerk chicken along with her rice and peas. She agreed that it was quite comparable to authentic Jamaican food. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool concept and a fun vibe, + creative and delicious food and drinks. The menu offers street food from all over the globe (yes it took me 2 trips here to figure out what the streets theme was referring to.) You can go with either small plates or sandwiches, which r huge and come with fries. This time my husband and I split the bolinho, the chorizo tapioca, and the pork and broccoli rabe sandwich. The bolinho were little fried dough balls stuffed with black beans, pork and veggies and spices. I thought they had a great flavor - very smoky. The tapioca is a lot like a quesadilla but made with tapioca instead of tortilla. Also very good with the chorizo.    Finally the sandwich was pretty fabulous, the pork was super tender and very well seasoned. It was also H U G E and the fries were delicious - they come with fresh herbs and cheese. We went on a Tuesday so it wasn't very crowded. The service was great, our server was very attentive and responsive. This place is really fun and I'm excited it's opened up on Carson."}
{"text":"We went here for cocktails and a bite to eat before a concert at the Rex. We sat at the bar, so we did not have a server. We ordered the huarache, poutine, pork spring roll, arancini, and the pan con chicharron. I did find that some of the menu items were a little hard to decipher (sandwich vs. no sandwich, small vs. larger plate, etc.), but we ended up ordering more than enough for the three of us. All of the food was delicious and it arrived promptly. The real standout for me was the cocktails. I left totally raving about our drinks and raved about them to everyone in the concert. Alec was an incredible bartender and he made drinks with great flavors and balance. When I heard this place has only been open for a couple of months, I was totally shocked. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The quality of food you receive is definitely not worth the price. The chicken we had in the jerk chicken platter was rubbery and inedible; it hardly tasted like chicken. The chicken on the tostada was better than the jerk chicken but still tasted slightly off, probably due to the fact it was shredded chicken. The rest of the tapas we tried were okay but, as I said, not worth the price."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for brunch this morning. There weren't very many people when I arrived at noon, and I honestly wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong. I had the chilaquiles and a side of potatoes and they were spot on!"}
{"text":"Five opening night stars for Streets. Good food, good service, nice people. With plates of Street food from around the world there seemed to be good choices for everybody. From a good hamburger, to whitefish, to a Polish chicken with radishes and chicken liver pate, all were fresh and served quickly at the right temperatures. The French fries are great and the poutine even better. Washing down the food with Western Pennsylvania beers or an interesting craft  cocktail from the attentive staff smoothed out the evening. Good luck Streets. Keep your standards high. We need creativity and quality on Carson."}
{"text":"IT's a super cute and casual spot with stellar food and great service!The lobster crepe was fantastic and I was impressed that they didn't skimp on the lobster! The jerk chicken skewers, served over traditional coconut rice and red beans with a green goddess sauce were some of the best I've had. It's definitely a great spot nestled among the long strip of bars and greasy bar food in the Southside."}
{"text":"My favorite new restaurant and one of the few reasons to hit up east Carson. The pressed filet is amazing. I find myself frequently craving it. There's never a long wait and the staff is great. I will continue to request this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves an eclectic and innovative cuisine. Dining here made me feel as though I was somewhere in Europe instead of the Southside of Pittsburgh. The servicer was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. The staff gave the impression that they love working together and in a young and rather hip environment there is still a family feel that is both charming and sincere. Go here for the food, the staff and the decor."}
{"text":"Streets on Carson has an interesting and ambitious menu of small plates, sandwiches and desserts. Our table of five started with a varied selection of starters. Overall the prices are somewhat less than might be paid at a more formal restaurant. My top vote goes to the cheese plate with interesting accompaniments. The raspberries & blackberries were very sweet, the Pinot Grigio gel yummy, the candied walnuts welcome. The seeded crackers were perfect. While the honey was a good choice, the menu mentioned honeycomb and a small piece on the plate would have been nice. The bone marrow for $7 is a steal. The wings were fall-off-the-bone tender but a little heavy on the lime juie. Other dishes we had were the steamed buns, the rice balls (small plate of 3 which looks small but gave each of us a couple fork fills), and the pork egg roll. The pork with broccoli rabe sandwich was right on. The fries that accompanied were home made. My daughter enjoyed the Cuban. The only disappointment was the pastrami sandwich which was ordered by both of the gentlemen in our party. For $13, it was a far cry from a real deli sandwich. The soft rye was flavorless, and while the pastrami was smoky & tasty, it was a teeny layer of meat that didn't evencover the whole piece of bread. The mustard dressing was good. This one should be re- thought. We were so stuffed we couldn't indulge in dessert. If your Fido likes bones, be sure to ask for a container to take your marrow bone home. A nice touch was chilled waters placed on table in pretty wine and alcohol bottles, to serve yourself.  A good place to go if you have a group with varied tastes."}
{"text":"Joining Laura M. for some Happy Hour fun, we came to Streets on Carson on a Friday at 6:15.  The bartender was cute so that was a great way to start happy hour.  The restaurant and bar were fairly deserted, but this may just be because they are new.  I am completely a cocktail girl so I was so happy to see a nice list of $5 cocktails to choose from during Happy Hour!  Quite a few of the options looked good, but I settled on something grapefruit... I think it was vodka.  I am not always great at remembering what I order over a week later by name, but I really enjoyed the drink.  It was refreshing and perfect for a warm day.  Laura and I went halfsies on the HH small plates menu, and items were $4 or $5 from this menu.  We decided on the arancini balls and the poutine to share.  I love arancini more than most things, and this was one of my favorite versions.  The balls were quite large, and the small plate came with three.  There was a great amount of cheese inside, and the dipping sauce was perfectly delectable.  The poutine was decent but not something I would order again.  The portion was large, but it was super salty and the fries were a bit inconsistent in being overcooked or mushy.  I liked the vibe of this place, as it was casual and modern but still interesting.  This will quickly become one of the top Happy Hours so get here soon before the secret is out."}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've ever had!      I'd highly suggest the Steam Buns and Pan Con Chicharron.  Incredible!!"}
{"text":"Way too comfortable, way too early. My first time here was just annoying and really made me feel unwelcome. I ordered something and I didn't like it (mashed plantains that were merchandised as fried plantains GROSS. The bartender christian never asked if I wanted to try to something else. Just uncomfortable brushed past me as if I was \"suppose\" to pay him."}
{"text":"We stopped in today because I heard they had a good happy hour. To be honest I found the HH disappointing (for south side standards) . it seems that their entire HH policy and pricing changed just within the last month. The review of the great HH brought me in, & we left disappointed.  They have a happy hour drink menu which included a few signature drinks (maybe 5-6) that were $6. Our server informed us that they had no HH specials on food. While the menu had some interesting things, I was disappointed no specials were offered.... Mostly because recent reviews state both a  HH food menu & $5  cocktail list.  We ended up ordering two drinks (a drink each). Bobby ordered the Communist which was gin, orange juice & cherry brandy. The drink was actually delicious, although too sweet for him. I ordered another drink.. Can't remember the name. It had gin, vermouth & something else. Both drinks were strong, but very small. We left after one drink to find somewhere to eat.   In all honesty there are much better happy hours in the burgh and especially in south side. I intend on coming back to try the menu, but not for happy hour. Our server was nice. Kinda felt bad leaving after one drink."}
{"text":"This is a casual hip place, a bar with a few tables along the side. I've been here three times now, and every dish I've had here has been amazingly, over the top tasty. And almost every single cocktail on their list has been delicious. They sell small plates and international sandwiches, with an emphasis on street food. Their sandwich choices are ethnically  diverse, great experiences.  Last time I was there with my wife and two sons, I ordered the Beef on Weck, a roast top round beef sandwich that was absolutely sublime. One son got the Cuban sandwich, which he loved. I've had it in the past, and it was very authentic. My other son ordered the papas rellenas, which is a Cuban version of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef and spices and then deep-fried. He loved it!. We shared the duck fat French fries, and we all loved them. My first time, I had the roast pork sandwich topped with broccoli rabe and provolone, and that might be my favorite! This is a really fun place for casual, inexpensive, but upscale and really interesting food. They have a moderate selection of really well-chosen craft beers on draft. Try this place! I will be here again and again."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! The food, the service, the cocktails... everything was just SUPERB! My husband and I def. found our new go-to! The hours are perfect! Everything is just so aesthetic and nicely done! We are IN LOVE! From the menu to the decor.... just really a nice place! LOVEEEEEE"}
{"text":"I visited Streets on Carson last Fri. at 6pm for HH with fellow Yelper Amanda J.  I arrived first and grabbed a seat at the bar, and I was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender, Alec, with a handshake.  He provided me with a HH drink and food menu and told me to let him know if I had any questions.  Always a sucker for cocktails, my eyes immediately gravitated to the infused spirits on the HH menu ($5 each).  Per the recommendation of the woman sitting next to me, I decided to try the tarragon rum.  It wasn't overly sweet, and the flavor of tarragon was quite distinct but not overwhelming.  Though it packed a punch, it went down *real smooth.*  Next, I ordered the lemon gin.  I wasn't as much of a fan of this one.  To my surprise, it had a deep pink color, and the lemon flavor wasn't as distinct as I expected--even with my eyes closed, I'm not sure that I could have readily identified it as lemon.  For food, we ordered from the HH small plates menu, which contains miniature versions of several of their regular menu items ($4-$5 each).  We ordered the arancini balls and the poutine to share.  Though this was my first time trying arancini, I can call myself a fan.  They had a creamy interior and a crisp exterior, and the sauce accompanying them complemented them nicely.  The poutine impressed me less, though it wasn't bad.  Like many poutines, I found it on the salty side, but the flavor and consistency of the gravy was nice.  The cheese curds weren't as plentiful or large as those of some other poutines I've tried around town, but the heat of the gravy caused them to partially melt, creating the stringiness characteristic of a good poutine.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the decor of Streets is quite artistic and interesting, evoking a playful urban vibe.  In particular, I was a fan of the traffic lights in the front windows, and I thought the idea of naming the tables after PGH streets was creative and interesting.  I also really like the thematic concept of Streets, which is to serve street food from around the world.  Their HH was a great value, and I enjoyed the food and drinks, so I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"The concept is really interesting. While most of the items served are still somewhat bar food to an extent, having different cultural influences does give it a lot of variety that you can't find anywhere else. While I wouldn't call everything on the menu \"street food\" (particularly the two that we got, as they were huge), one can see that they are carefully designed and made. I am guessing that the prices inform the portion that you would expect to get.  For the roast pork, it came with a ton of seasoned meat on a flavorful and cheesy roll, with several pieces of perfectly grilled broccoli rabe. What was surprising was how well seasoned everything was, particularly with the herbs and spices embedded into the pork. and bread. Same story with the brick chicken, in which the chicken breast meat was actually quite tender, with a very flavorful layer of liver smeared on the roll underneath. The fries for both were also really well seasoned with herbs and topped with cheese pieces.   Environment is nice and casual with background music but not too loud. There's a bar area but it's definitely meant as more of a bar/restaurant hybrid. The wait for the food was a bit long but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Prob my new fav lunch spot for working in SS.  Awesome unique door for great prices! The chicken sandwich, filet tips, and burger are all really good!  Def worth a visit"}
{"text":"BLOWN AWAY!!... Stopped into Streets on Carson on a Sunday afternoon after receiving a recommendation. Completely blown away! From the decor, to the food, to the drinks, and dessert. The menu has small to medium plates with a few sandwiches. We ordered the Arancini to start - amazing! Highly recommend as you get 3 small rice balls that were great for sharing. We could have kept popping those in our mouths all day! I ordered a drink (forget the name - something with an L) made with tequila. I could have drank 10, so good. As our meals, we ordered the Pan con Chicharron (so tastey and served on such a soft roll) and the duck conflict tapioca (like nothing I've ever had before and I want to eat it again and again!). For dessert (we wanted to keep trying things!) we ordered the Stroopwafel - delicious!!!.... You can seriously tell the owners (Lauren & her husband) put a lot of hard work and love into this place. We will FOR SURE be going back!!"}
{"text":"I go here once a month. Try the wings, spring rolls, burger, any of their cocktails...I don't know, I haven't had anything bad there. Just go."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited Streets on Carson for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, but the atmosphere was still pretty loud. The menu consists of sandwiches and small plates that originate from all over the world.  We ordered a few small plates to share, and it was fun to pick from vastly different cuisines. We went with the artisan cheese plate, duck fat fried poutine, jerk chicken with rice and peas, and arancini. Each dish was tasty and well prepared. Our favorite out of the four was the arancini. While only three were provided on the dish, they were delicious and served atop a nice blush sauce. The jerk chicken was also excellent, and the accompanying green goddess sauce was awesome. The prices and portions seemed fair for the most part, and we definitely had enough to eat, however the cheese plate was not only fairly small, but also the most expensive of the four dishes.  Overall though, the food was great and decently priced. The service was fast and friendly, and our waitress was very accommodating to food allergies. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for one day and decided to skip my usual fast food run for a great local restaurant. Found Streets on Carson thanks to Yelp. Warm, friendly, welcoming staff and vibe. Had the samosa appetizer followed by Cuban sandwich.  Holy cow what great food!  The best Cuban sandwich I've had in years!"}
{"text":"Went here before a show at the Club Cafe and received delicious food and great service.   My friend and I shared the ahi tuna sandwich and the filet tips sandwich. The bread is fresh and the sauces and toppings meld well with the meats. The steak (filet) sandwich was phenomenal. The ahi tuna bahn mi was also really good, but the steak was the real star.  The fries were fresh, crisp, and had great flavor.    Paid and unpaid parking available on the main and side streets."}
{"text":"This place is so cute (in a hip kind of way). My husband and I came here before listening to music on Carson. The bartender was really cool. I ordered the \"south side\" beverage which was gin, lemon, simple syrup and mint. Delicious! I'm super excited! I'll have to come back when there's more people! The music is excellent here too! Very chill place. I'd come and bring my girlfriends here too.  Side note: I know very little about interior design but I really like what's going on here. From the hardwood floor to the graffiti wall art, to the spray painted metallic brick - I'm feeling it!"}
{"text":"After speaking outside with the Owner/Chef, Matt, on Friday night while waiting to enter Club Cafe, we decided to return for dinner the following night. We ate a delicious Tapioca dish (not the pudding) that contained confit duck along with other delicious things and a Seitan Cheesesteake with hand-cut fries. Matt gave us vegetarian Arancini and these were delicious also. We went there because of the sincerity and passion of Matt and also the Yelp reviews. It was a delicious experience at the end of Carson Street, where the good stuff lives. We will return soon. A really good neighborhood place for adults on the South Side!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  Came here with a bunch of friends and everything I ate was delicious!  I had the cheese plate, bone marrow, and ahi tuna.  All of it was just so good!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We loved Streets on Carson. Shared the pork and broccoli rabe sandwich (which was out of this world), the moroccan lamb meatballs and the alsatian tart. Everything was packed with flavor. For dessert, we had a delicious pannacota accompanied with grilled banana bread. The service was very attentive. Will have to come back with the rest of the family. There were quite a few menu items we would have loved to try."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place, food, staff, atmosphere- all top notch. The pressed filet sandwich was amazing, ai craved it for days after our visit. Went with a large group and we tried almost every appetizer, all great! I love this place!"}
{"text":"I met a friend at Streets the other day for dinner! I have been wanting to go for so long because two of my friends are regulars and have been telling me how much I would enjoy it. When I came in, it was pretty early and there weren't very many people there. My girlfriend was late so I ordered a cocktail and made some conversation with the bartender. She was super cool and the drinks were good.When my friend came, we decided to just eat at the bar. We split several appetizers, all of which were pretty spot on! The pork belly steamed buns were my favorite but I also enjoyed the arancini. My one comment would be in regards to the poutine. I really enjoy cheese/gravy/potatoes and salt. You really have to be insane to not love those things (sorry my vegan friends but y'all are kooked) but there was just way too much salt on the fries and it was intense. Overall a great experience, I might not get the poutine when I go back but I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday. The food was great + the staff was so friendly! If one hundred percent recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great ambience! Good drinks! Good service! Can't complain about anything."}
{"text":"Streets on Carson is such a cute concept. The space is amazing, and it's filled with a ton of graffiti like art, depicting South Side.  I'm a fan of the menu (especially the Brick Chicken Chlebicek, which is an open faced chicken sandwich with liver mousse on top), and I think that the concept of foods around the world is really amazing and a good way for people to try food without actually having to leave the zipcode.  The staff is always super friendly, and the drinks are always super strong. The wait can be a bit long, so make sure to call ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"Great place & the food is very delicious!! The place has an awesome environment. Definitely coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Wonderful spot! Food was amazing, service was great, drinks were on point and the music and overall ambiance exceeded our expectations! Highly recommend it!  The arinchini was fantastic and beyond what we expected, something new! But, then...we ordered the steak filet sandwich and it was unbelievable --- was the winner that pushed us over the edge to come back again.  Amazing spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered cocktails. They were both so sweet, they were almost undrinkable. Almost."}
{"text":"I have been here a bunch of times already and can't wait to go back again. They serve an incredible variety of dishes from all around the world juxtaposed against a funky graffiti decor  and tables named after Southside streets. Everytime I go I try to order something new, but on several occasions I just couldnt resist the roast pork broccoli rabe sandwich. It is honestly one of, if not the best sandwich I haver ever had. On top of the menu, which seems to get switched up every couple months, they have awesome cocktails. Everything is pretty inexpensive and the food portion sizes, especially the sandwiches, are crazy big for how little you pay."}
{"text":"Streets on Carson has only been open for a couple of weeks, but they have all the elements to be in this for the long haul. A combination of great service, beautiful restaurant, casual atmosphere, unique affordable menu = winner winner.   Love the concept: street food around the world, most you have never heard of, but they will be more than patient with all your inevitable questions lol. Although the dishes may seem small, they are deceptively filling. A combination of any 2 choices will satisfy even the hungriest of stomachs. Always great to see a menu with multiple items under $10  Talk about cool decor; The interior is modern meets urban, with hanging street lights and graffiti to drive home the point!   On to the food, for lunch I had   1) duck confit tapioca from Rio de Janeiro (leeks, shallots, Gouda, balsamic glaze)  2) pork spring rolls from Shanghai (cabbage, carrot, scallions, cilantro, sriracha aioli) 3)side of fries  Honestly it was alllll good, and way more than I should have ordered. This is not your America hot dog stand we're talking here, as these are some complex dishes executed very well.   Note to owner/manager: don't make too many changes! You have a great concept here."}
{"text":"Went here to check out their food shortly after they opened. We really enjoyed the idea that they serve street food from around the world. We tried the arancini and the tapioca, both of which were amazing. The tapioca was almost like a quesadilla but they used tapioca instead of a tortilla, a little more unique and definitely delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet for a small meeting, a meal with a friend, or casual date. My husband and I went for a lunch date. The women working were both very nice. I ordered the roasted pork sandwich with broccoli rabe. It came with a side of fries. There was so much meat that it was falling off the sandwich. I was only going to eat half but it was too good to save for later. The pork had been cooked slowly and with lots of seasonings. It was tender and moist. The bead was fluffy but held its own with the pork. The sharp provolone was a perfect match to this sandwich.  My husband ordered the grilled fish sandwich. The bread was too much for the fish so my husband put the bun to the side and just ate the fish. The fish was tender and flaky. It had a nice grilled flavor.  We definitely want to go back and try more dishes. This really is a place you want to check out."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my friend I've been wanting to go here for a while since their food looks so diverse and good. I ordered the honey bee to drink and my friend ordered a martini. I loved my drink it had black salt on the lime it was delicious. For food we ordered the duck fried poutines with cheese curds, the all American cheese burger with Sriracha aioli and the jerk chicken with rice. It was all delicious the burger was cooked perfect. The service was fast and friendly. The burger I ordered was huge so I cut it in half to take it home unfortunately I forgot my to go box when we made a pit stop at jacks and because the burger was so good I'm still sad about forgetting it at jacks but I'll just have to come back soon and try some more amazing food."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times. The food is great but the service is sometimes slower then I would like. I love the pork egg rolls and that's what keeps me coming back! It's also a good place to come and watch a sports game, if you're into that."}
{"text":"Had 3 small plates, and 3 cocktails. The plates we got were recommended by the amazing bartender. Mofongo, Wings, and Buns. Wow is all i can say. The wings are unlike any others I have ever tried, fall off the bone and so flavorful! The Mofongo, well, probably the most flavorful chicken ever! The bbq on the buns was spicy yet sweet. So, so, so good! The drinks were perfectly mixed. The bartender was very pleasant, knowledgeable and social. I cannot wait to eat (and drink) my way through the menu there!"}
{"text":"Everything I've gotten at Streets has been exceptional-- the broccoli rabe pork sandwich and the jerk chicken skewers are my favorite. Their fries have cheese shavings on top, which I love. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting and welcome addition to South Side's restaurants. It's small and casual and serves up some amazing food all around the concept of offering various street food from around the world. The best and most delicious surprise were the chicken confit wings, which were the best I've ever had. They're not Buffalo wings and they're not messy. They are big and tender, with the meat practically falling off the bone and a delicious taste that still has me craving them days later. The small plates all sound so good that we opted to share several rather than fill up on a sandwich and fries. The sandwiches sounded great as well and I'll surely be back to try some out -- as well as more small plates. I do wish that the sandwiches didn't come with fries so that more small plates could be devoured instead. We also tried the chicken samosas (delicious with their dill sauce), the lobster crepe (succulent!) and the tostada with lime chicken and avocados (the least impressive dish that we tried, but delicious nonetheless). Another standout starter was the artisan cheese, which paired three interesting cheeses that were all quite different from one another along with some other goodies including unique pinot grigio gellee cubes. The service is attentive yet appropriately casual. The decor and furnishings are somewhat minimalist yet comfortable. There is a table in each of two windows facing Carson Street, a bar on one side and tables on the other. In a bit of whimsy given the name and concept of the restaurant, the side of each table bears a street sign with the name of one of the neighborhood's streets, which have their own awesome backstory. My only gripe is that the wine and beer list could stand to be a bit more robust. I can understand keeping the wine options down with open bottles (for by-the-glass), but given the worldly nature of the food, more bottled beer options would be in order."}
{"text":"First time here. Fantastic people and great food. Charles our waiter was quick with great suggestions. The bone marrow was delicious and so were the pastrami and fillet tip sandwiches. The tostada was good and the pork eggs rolls tasted too fresh to be fried.  Lauren the owner/bartender is a good at making cocktails as she is friendly.  Everything was great except the amount of people here on a Wednesday night. This place should be packed, given the great food at these prices.  This place is what the Southside needs more of."}
{"text":"I've wanted try this place for awhile. It's in the mix of so many cool things to do in the South Side. I popped in and it's ordered takeout. The menu is fairly eclectic and focused on mostly small plates, fresh soup (new type daily), and sandwiches that serve as entrees. I ordered two small plates - pork spring rolls (think shredded pork, aioli, and vegetables) and jerk chicken skewers with coconut rice. The spring rolls were excellent and very big. Honestly it's way more filling than one would expect. The jerk chicken was surprisingly good as well. Good level of spice (about a 3 on a scale of 5), very tender, however less filling than the spring rolls. The coconut rice was less impressive. It was mushy and didn't really stand out. Then again, I'm not much of a coconut rice fan anyway. I would definitely return. I imagine the ambiance, particularly during a happy hour or weekend night is probably pretty cool."}
{"text":"I went with 3 friends and we ordered a few tapas to share. Some of them were good, others were okay. One thing I didnt like is that they brought everything in 3s (meaning 3 riceballs, 3 tacos, etc.). I understand they may have prespecified quantities but for a tapas restaurant it is not nice to serve quantities that are not divisible by the number of guests. Dessert is not their forte. Probably the best tapa we tried was the lobster crepe"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Streets on Carson! Being on 12th and Carson this place is usually a little quieter and I've always had my choice of tables when there. (fun fact, they name all the tables after Southside streets... how fun is that?)  There is a great selection of wine and local beers, with happy hour options. The menu is diverse and I've enjoyed everything I've tried. The main dish that will keep me coming back: arancini balls. They are so tasty and the sauce is delicious. The order can be shared, but why bother... order two for the table and have your own!"}
{"text":"The only negative I have, is that I didn't know about this place sooner. Arancini was delicious, the jerk chicken skewers were great. Even the rice and beans on the plate were done right. I often feel that chicken is dry and over cooked, more often than not. Not here, the sauce that it came with was a great addition. My friend had the filet tip sandwich. Tender, juicy steak. I even liked the fries, which rarely happens. Finally a restaurant in the southside I will look forward to going to."}
{"text":"We had A wonderful lunch the food was tasty, well prepared and well presented having said that... the four drinks 2 vodka and OJ 2 rum and coke $33.00. :(  ( we did not order top shelf or anything special) $9.00 for a screw driver and $7.50 for a  cuba libre  at lunch???                    Next time we will drink at Jacks."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The whole atmosphere is relaxed and refined I've sat at the bar and a table before and the service at both are great! Ive tried several menu items and have been exceptionally pleased with everything I've eaten. The menu is so diverse and includes street foods from around the world! Definitely recommend the steamed buns, a special they have now added to the menu. Also, Dan the bartender is awesome!"}
{"text":"I loved streets on Carson! My cocktail, 'cynar the great', was delicious. I ordered the huarache, which was like a shredded steak flatbread-ish pizza with chiles or salsa verde maybe. It was delicious! I wish I would have ordered more food, but I'll save it for my next visit. I'm so glad I came and can't wait to try everything else on the menu. The service, art, and ambience were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Drinks and service were great, and the place is very cute. We ordered the chicharron and it was superb. I would change the sauce it comes with for something a lil more sophisticated than cheese to keep with the vibe of the place but overall a great place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here this past Sunday for the first time. This place is phenomenal! Not only was the food absolutely delicious, the service was excellent, and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The bartender, Dan, is extremely knowledgeable about cocktails and knows all the details of the food menu. I strongly recommend the confit wings...they fall right off the bone and then melt in your mouth. We also had the spring rolls, arancini, and lobster crepe. Seriously, everything was truly distinctive and delectable. Last but not least, I think the prices are fair for the quality of the food you get. I can't wait to get back here!"}
{"text":"Streets On Carson is a great addition to the South Side. I came for a quick breakfast before a day of drinking on Carson because I've heard great reviews. Unfortunately, only the breakfast menu was available to us at the time. I ordered the chilaquiles, and it was my first time having his dish. You can't really go wrong with breakfast nachos. Good portion and lots of flavor. I can't wait to come back here and try some other teams on the menu. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch just as it opened after reading an article about it in today's newspaper. You can sit anywhere. The owner showed me the artist motif around the restaurant which is very catchy. Even the tables have the names of various streets on them.  My waitress came and reviewed the menu with me. She told me that most of the dishes are small plates but if I wanted more then order a sandwich. I settled with the brick chicken  chlebicek (aka open faced) sandwich. It comes with fries coated with cheese.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for my meal but my waitress was attentive and made sure I had enough to drink during that time. The chicken comes with the skin on It is topped with a chicken liver mousse spread along with pickled onion and radish. It is served on a thick baguette. The chicken was mouthwatering good. Only difficulty I had was cutting it through the whole piece. Would have been easier with a sharp knife but my waitress suggested I just eat it by hand which I did.  The fries were good too and with the cheese added on top, absolutely filling. She then showed me a dessert menu but I was way too stuffed to try any of it. Will save that for next visit. I learned they had just opened after St Patrick's day so they are relatively new to the area. Prices are reasonable too for a descent size lunch.  Just remember that good things come to those who wait. So be patient. Good food coming your way!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks here were great! Service was amazing as well. Love the different choices on the menu!"}
{"text":"I always want to tread delicately with reviews that are lower in the star rating. My intent is that hopefully the business will just get better and better, and I hope the same for Streets on Carson. Especially considering my fellow Elites had such stellar experiences.  The vibe is super cool, with graffiti art and street signs all around. It almost made me sad I wasn't enjoying a cocktail at the bar... but a lunch meeting called for just iced tea. The servers were both incredibly nice and explained the menu to us. Apparently most of the items are intended as small plates, but there are sandwiches in the mix.   I thought the menu was a little hard to read. I get that they're listing where things are locally sourced, but I think having a breakdown between categories like starters/small plates, sandwiches, larger dishes would have been helpful. Sandwiches were lumped in between small and larger plates and my eyes were darting all over the place trying to figure out what to order.   I ordered the Balik Ekmek, which was grilled white fish, salata, fresh lemon juice, on a roll, served with fresh cut fries. The fries seemed fresh cut and were good. The sandwich however was bland. There were no sauces on the sandwich, but it wouldn't have been needed if the fish was seasoned more.  Plus, it was toped by a non-ripe tomato and shredded lettuce. The roll was really good and might have been some sort of croissant type? It was a bummer the sandwich didn't turn out better.   I'd totally be down to check out the bar side and cocktails for another go-round. Maybe even a snack, but I'd definitely try something different next time."}
{"text":"Globe trot without leaving the 'burgh! Not only can you experience street eats from Vietnam to Canada to Italy...you experience the chaos that is the South Side itself, baby. While most of the \"little guys\" are indeed little, such as the chicken samoas from India or the arancini from Sicily, the Duck Fat Fried Poutine from Quebec is anything but. It's large and rather addictive! Even though all of the sammies come with a side o' fries, there's reason to believe they aren't duck fat fried! And the Taiwanese steamed buns are also worth checking out. The only mains are sammies, but there is obviously quite a variety to choose from. The roast pork + broccoli rabe doesn't quite rival Philly's own DiNic's, but it's a valiant effort. Wash it all down from a decent list of local drafts and unique cocktails. The small, intimate (yet casual) space allows for friendly, attentive service. And there's plenty on the menu to give this place another go -- with this killer concept, the sky's the limit."}
{"text":"J and I came here over the weekend for lunch. I was surprised at how empty it was (we were the second table). Nevertheless, we decided to eat here as we've heard good things about this place. The venue is really clean and nice. We loved the decor and the names of streets on each table was a great touch. Our waitress was really great and the chef accommodated my nut allergy really well, often coming out to ask me if certain foods and items were ok for me. J and I split the cheese plate which was good. The honey was amazing! J had a coke and the all American burger, and I had a sprite with the pepita sandwich. Everything was really good! We got a decent sized portion so we were able to take some home which was nice. We weren't too impressed with the dessert options, which is big for us, but we still had a great time."}
{"text":"Streets is a great place to go if you're looking for a diverse menu. I love all of the different styles of food and there seems to be something on the menu for everyone.   The prices for their dishes are very fair, the sandwiches are huge. I had the duck confit tapioca and it was delicious. The portion size was perfect for me and I shared some with my boyfriend as well. The special drinks were great, we had the gin basil smash and the Doberman, I would recommend both.   The staff was very friendly and helpful when explaining the menu items, I will definitely go back!"}
