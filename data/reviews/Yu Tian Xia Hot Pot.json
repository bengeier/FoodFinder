{"text":"the best hotpot i have ever had, our friends take us to here who was actually from chengdu, they said this is a grand opening hot pot and most tasty hot pot in Phoenix. When I first try it, it is spicy but really good! And the service is also good even they are pretty busy, they came to add the water anytime you need. Meat and vegetables are super fresh!  This is a wonderful place to have the hot pot.i think that people who complained about it clearly doesn't know good authentic Chinese food.

In general,tasty food and great service.  I have no reason for not coming back.    5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Very unique but too expensive, spicy and potentially not edible. $50 later we're (2 of us) still hungry. Not enough food. What ticked me off was they had a sauces bar, I got a couple which we didn't eat and there was a charge for it on the bill! Come one!! For the unique part - You cook your own food at your table which is cool. You pick the broth to cook in, the protein (no chicken), veggies, noodles or other carbs. Even the mild broth is ultra spicy!! All kinds of odd meats. We picked shrimp which came whole, crab sticks and mushrooms. Shrimp was good. Overall not so great. The waitress was very sweet and tried to help us. Apparently this is authentic Chinese from Chunking, it's probably good stuff, I'm ignorant."}
{"text":"First time Hot Pot goer and it's a very fun and unique experience the broth is delicious I recommend the spicy broth and the pork lion slices is super good!!! 

There isn't just spicy the mushroom and marrow broth is also delicious and really flavorful. 

They slice he meat thin and it cooks super fast, don't forget to grab a bowl and spoon to drink the broth! 

The waiter was very kind helpful and genuinely stoked to help us noobies in the hot pot world! Deffinetly a fun date or group outing! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Staff helpful.  Food was great.  Thin prime beef and shrimp the best.  Recommend to friends. Will be going again."}
{"text":"It is a bit more on the pricey side. Dish of meat is around $13 each for the large which didn't come with as much as I expected. So for 3 of us we ended up getting 5 meat dishes a long with veggies and many other sides. We chose the half & half, I love their bone & mushroom soup (very flavorsome), the other choice we got was their popular mild soup. Everything was fresh and the place was clean."}
{"text":"The hot pot here is really spicy goodness.  Me and my friend, we alway do Half and haft.  We do one spicy and one not for people who can't handle spicy.  I like their meal because it freshe and good.  This place is new so they don't have enough servers for the customer I think.  We wait so long for them to take our order.  By the time we order, the food come out ok because they got our order wrong.  They bring out extras meal that we didn't order and the noodle didn't come out when we order too.  We have to cancel the noodles because when we almost done with our dinner, the noodles hadn't come yet.  This place is really good when cold outside.  The hot pot is good here just the service need to improve a little but over all this good place to get spicy hot pot."}
{"text":"?????.  I've been looking for a legit hotpot place for ever in the east valley and finally there is one.  Great food, exceptional service, horrible lines on the weekends.  Note medium is extremely hot by most peoples standards and delicious."}
{"text":"The Hot Pot was delicious! Very unique experience and James was a very kind, helpful server! I we split the pot with one side spicy and the other traditional mushroom.  
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. After waiting 45 minutes we hot seated . No problem we understood that they were busy because it was valentine's day . After we got seated . We were looking at menu. It was hard to understand the menu for the first time customer. We waited for about 15 more minutes ... no one came to our table ... people who got seated after us had water in their table and server was on their table explaining something looking at the menu so i guess the server was helping them with menu however no one came to our table to even greet us . I was really pissed . Finally i had enough and had to call the host to explain the situation she called the manager ( i think) and she helped us with the order. It was hot pot but we only had chopstick . No spoon no bowl given to us . Just wat we order came to our table . We had to call someone again to ask for basic stuff to eat soup . I feel very neglected."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Hot Pot place in the Valley. The all-you-can-eat menu is the better option and the mushroom broth is the best! The spicy broth has a kicked to it and worth a try but the mushroom is better. We have been here quite a few times and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now so when they first opened I wasted no time go squad up and go try it. Walking in the restaurant it's pretty standard if I would to describe it. The menu is extensive of what you can add into your hot pot. You're going to first choose a base of soup, you can split it into two, or you can boss up and get 12 broths, that's right 12 broths to try cause you a real one.  I went with the split broth of non spicy and spicy. Keep I. Mind some of the menu items are in Cantonese, so if you can't read it please ask for help! We chose a variety of add one into the hot pot, it's a style where you dip the food into the pot. This is not a premade style of hot pot. The meats were expensive for what you get, small portion, big price. They also have a sauce station where you can customize your sauce to many traditional condiments and flavors. Keep in mind to not get lost in the sauce. When trying out the spicy broth, I gotta say I'm not gonna lie that I cough a little. We got the lowest spice level for the spicy broth and I never felt so defeated. I felt so weak that I couldn't handle it. So be careful. The spice levels range from volcano, to pure sun extract. I'm scared of what the highest spice level is because it will probably feel like getting fiery bicycle kicked straight to the throat from Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat.  Overall this place didn't really wow me from all the other hot pot places I've tried in the past."}
{"text":"Horrible! First,  the food is pricey.  There's no English menu.  It's our first time and last.  I love food and often try new food and try different ethnic food.  The restaurant appears that they only want to cater to chinese people.  I'm Thai but I don't speak chinese not can read chinese.  Majority of menu are in chinese.  There are no explanation of the soup.  They have several different type of soup.  If you grew up in szchewan you would know what soup to order but no explanation for foreigner.  The sauces bar doesn't have English word. Google translate didn't work because they wrote it in hand writing. 

When the food came out,  it's way too spicy,  it's burning hot.  My wife couldn't eat it.  The meat and add on were pricey. We didn't order much but our bill was $65. Way too expensive for the amount of food that we had.  It seems like most people end up spending $80-100 for 2 or 3 people.  

The waiter and waitress don't really speak English,  and had a hard time communicating to them.  I didn't get water refill for 20-30 min. Awful service. 

If you are chinese folks who grew up with these food, it might worth the money. But as a foreigner like me,  I'd say it's better you spend money with other restaurant.  I would stay away. Never again."}
{"text":"The service here is atrocious. They keep you waiting outside when I see tables available. The managers aka the daughters of this place can't even do the register. It hold up the entire restaurant. One of the manager even took a smoke break while customers are waiting for a table like what the heck. Finally it was our table, surprisingly the waiters were quick with our food. The hot pot here is really pricey compare to others. It was alright not very intriguing. Hoping for some improvements if I ever come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Meat was fresh and delicious, service was great, the spicy broth was scrumptious with all the szechuan peppercorns and peppers, bringing the authentic hot and numbing taste. You can choose the spicy level of the broth. There are also all the amazing sauces you can take and mix. I would suggest mixing garlic and sesame oil as the dipping sauce, which is the classical way you eat it in Szechuan. 

A little background information after reading other people's comments: Not all hot pots are the same. Szechuan hot pot is characterized by peppercorns and the numbing spicy taste--not everyone likes it, but it is what it is. Taiwanese/Japanese hot pot does not have that. The raw egg sauce is mainly offered in Japanese hot pot, and is not common elsewhere. Educating yourself about these little things and having some cultural sensitivity can help you choose the right food and avoid huge disappointment when you dine out."}
{"text":"Yu Tian Xia is first authentic Chongqing hot pot restaurant in AZ.
I went to there so many times, and also their LA store.
Every time I pass by the Phoenix to do my business I always invite my partner go there to have something to eat!
They had too many authentic hot pot food from Chongqing."}
{"text":"Decided to try this one out of the 4 new hot pot joints that recently opened in the east valley.  It definitely hit the spot.  Half numbing spicy and half reg broth were both superb. Meat was spectacular quality and didn't come out still frozen like some places. The premium lean beef was sooo good.  The partial fat beef was great too but more fat than \"partial.\"  Beef tongue good quality but $10 for like 5 slices.  Veges and Tofu skin good as well.  Overall, quality and taste are amazing BUT just too expensive.  My one friend and I racked up a $100 bill!!  I should preface that with the fact that we are gluttons and had leftovers but still.  They charge $10 just for the broth when I'm used to broth included.  Also $1/person for sauce bar which is usually also included.  No raw egg option for sauce which is usually the magic to the sauce for me.  They did say they are \"proposing\" all you can eat for lunch only.  Would come back more often if more affordable or AYCE offered."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly! Made our first hot pot experience a lot easier on us :). I'd give this place a strong 5 if it was all you can eat. We paid $60 for two small plates of meat and some veggies and noodles. Yikes! Def still hungry after I left. The meat was good quality, of course. Nice and thin. Otherwise, friendly atmosphere and the employees are super accommodating. We got the medium spicy broth - hot for me, because I'm weak when it comes to spices, but very flavorful at the same time. The instant noodles are awesome in it. We also got the classic mushroom broth and that was amazing - extremely flavorful and made everything taste a ton better. Decent sauce bar and really clean bathrooms, which is always a blessing. Overall, a fun experience and delicious food that's really just a little high priced."}
{"text":"First of all, be aware of the reviews for this restaurant since they were done by elite professional yelp reviewers. Let's find out about this restaurant. The below rehire is for two person dinner:
Service: the server doesn't speak English fluently so we have to order blindly. They messed up my order but it can be fixed so I'm ok.

Menu: it is way to confusing with a lot of Chinese characters and there is no description about the food nor the pictures for demonstration purposes. 

Pricing: EXPENSIVE... we order a veggie combo. We got 3 romance lettuce and 3 pieces of seaweed, 8 tiny slender bamboo shoot... anyway it is really expensive. They also charge you $10 for the broth only. Not include $1 charge Per person for Self Serve sauce. So they charged you abd made you to get your sauce by yourself.

Food: spicy spicy and spicy. There is little flavor to the broth itself. The portion is really small... we order noodle for $2.55 each person but after boil it shrinked to one to two spoons. 

WE WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AND SHARE MY EXPERIENCES..."}
{"text":"The foods pretty great, a decent selection of sauces at the bar. The selection is kind of confusing though. Meat and vegetables quality is pretty tasty with a good amount of choices. I didn't enjoy how the bean sprouts looked though. Oh, and the beef ossasum is beef tripe. I do love how spicy everything is though, if you're a fan of spiciness, I can wholeheartedly recommend the medium."}
{"text":"6 thin pieces of beef is $6.99. My boy friend and I barely ordered any meat and hardly got half full after spent over $70. I am very impressed that they are able to charge high-end price with mediocre quality! 

If they can make the business sustainable in this way, at least they show how inefficient the market is.  Can't wait to see"}
{"text":"This place a pretty neat hot pot restaurant! It's very trendy inside, and the customer service is excellent. Asian restaurants have a reputation for having minimal service, but this place knocks it right out of the park. They walked us through the entire process and consistently returned to our table, clearing it, and tending our needs/questions. Everyone was extremely friendly, fast, efficient. 

So how do you eat? They have this awesome menu that is self explanatory. It doesn't have directions on it, but one could deduce and the employees do explain it as well. You choose your items by marking the checkbox. You choose your base, the food, and any beverage you'd like to eat. They have many food options, starting from 1.98. It really just depends on which foods and how much food you want to eat. It can go as high as $41 per serving of Wagyu. The options are expansive, including pork blood and many other items that may not be a normal part of the American diet. They do have enough options, including prime beef and ribeye for people with that limited diets, so really, anyone can eat here. Once you order, they bring out the foods and you cook it yourself in the hotpot. The hotpot is divided into quadrants, making it easy to fish out the food and not mix it with other people's food. The items seemed pretty fresh, especially the veggies. Everything tasted good.I was with a party of 4 people and we ordered maybe 8-10 items. We were definitely stuffed by the conclusion of our dinner.

Just giving you a heads up, their Yutianxia Spicy Pot IS SPICY. The employees did a great job cautioning us the level of spice. They equate their \"mild\" it to a jalapeno. My friends, it is indeed a jalapeno with a KICK! Ha. They say to start with mild and then you can always make it spicier. This is important to know so you don't ruin your dinner!

They also have a large cart filled with many sauces. The sauce station is amazing, and you can customize it however you see fit.

My experience here was great and a lot of fun. It's located in the middle of a bunch of Asian-type stores and right next to the International Market. I would recommend highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere was fun. It was comfortable and the staff was amazing. Great place to visit and have an enjoyable and interactive eating experience."}
{"text":"Warning! Broth is too spicy! We ordered a mild and a medium broth and boy I was not able to hang and trust me, I can handle my spice. This place was way too expensive. I can make better hot pot at home for a cheaper price. What I did like about it was the free bun dessert you'd get when you check in. That was the best part of the meal. Other than that, it was too spicy and too expensive for my taste. Will I come back? If I become richer, sure."}
{"text":"This place is quite busy so you have to prepare to wait if you come in around the rush hours.  We have visited this place 3 times and each time was very good.  The food is pricy but the quality is good.  The spicy hot pot is very spicy which my GF likes a lot.   We highly recommended this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very fresh. I'm so full. The lunchtime all you can eat is perfect."}
{"text":"????? ?????? ????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????????? ???????????? ???????????????? ??????baby????????? ????????????????? ?????phx???? ????????????????????? ?????????? ?? ???????????? ?????"}
{"text":"Overall very worth it! Definitely recommend!

If you're unfamiliar with hot pot, basically you order uncooked food to cook in a broth at your table. And you eat the food with sauce that you make yourself. This place is pretty authentic Chongqing hot pot! And it's delicious!

I went with two other people for lunch on a Saturday. We did the all you can eat option.
For the first person who is eating hot pot, it's $30, and for every subsequent person it's $20.
The attached photo shows everything that we ordered, and I'll just comment here on the things that I recommend and the things that I would avoid. If I don't comment on them I'm this review, I would say it was good, but nothing to write home (yelp) about.

GET THESE:
Tianxia fried meat: fried pork strips, eat them while their hot, you won't be able to stop. This comes cooked from the kitchen; you don't need to cook it yourself.
The pork belly: the best meat they have for the hot pot! I could not get enough of it!
Bean curd sticks: thin pieces of bean curd, really soft and good for dipping into sauces.
Bone and mushroom broth: I'm sure there are other broth a that are tasty, but this one was great!

DO NOT GET THESE:
Australian Lamb: lamb has a certain taste to it; some people describe it as gamey. I think their lam is too gamey. I am not a fan.
Shrimp dumpling: I've bought better shrimp dumplings frozen from the super market than the ones I got here. No matter how long we cooked them, they were hard and not tasty.

Portions are pretty generous. For the meats we got about 10 thin slices per order. 

As for service, I feel like al the wait staff were very attentive; our food came quickly, and our waters and broth were refilled at regular intervals.

As with many AYCE places, they have a 2 hour time limit and charge you for not finishing your food. Two hours is definitely enough time to eat til you're full. And we had a few pieces of the lamb left, but they didn't charge us. 

Overall, good experience, good food. Will probably come back."}
{"text":"Hot like the Sun!

You want delicious authentic Hot Pot? Well, this is your spot. 

I'm loving this strip mall. 3 stellar restaurants in very close proximity. Givin' 'em 5 STARs, they astonished me. Friendly, patient, informative, and attentive service.

Big Homie B and I hit the new Hot Pot joint along Dobson's Little Asia and WOW! it did NOT disappoint. SO good! Speaking as heat affectionado... when these very kind folks tell your their spicy is more intense than other places.... believe them. Lordy, I was raining sweat, but loving it. Felt a bit self conscious about the number of head-swabbing napkins I requested.

To the food!

After some thought, Brian and I elected for the AYCE menu. We have agreed to order off the regular menu for our next visit.

But for this trip it was AYCE with the split pot, 1/2 Spicy Medium and 1/2 Bone Broth. Again, Dayum it was spicy. For clarification, I've spent the last 18 years among some of the craziest hot-food eating software developers on the planet. Whether Indian or pasty Caucasian white we're always ready to throw down to crush our hot food eatin' rivals. 

The folks at Yu Tian Xia Hot Pot recommended I go with \"Mild mild.\" Thinking I was down and experienced, I scoffed (inwardly so as not to be disrespectful) and ordered the medium (and that's only because the extremely hot is not served in the Yin & Yang split pot). 

The pot came angry red and had me sweating in 90 seconds. If you think you can handle heat, Yu Tian Xia Hot Pot can assist you with acceptance of your personal mediocrity. 

The AYCE menu is substantially reduced in comparison to the regular menu. For me, Shrimp was the most impactful absence between the two. I suggest you follow our lead and go with AYCE on your first visit. It will allow you to sample more items and tune your future expectations and interests.

Go. Have fun. B and I had a great time."}
{"text":"When you go to the hot pot, pay attention to the different prices they have on the menu. If you go to the restaurant for the first time, you will be cheated by them, which makes people feel uncomfortable! This may be our first and last time! we say why the price is more than $5 on the menu, no one will deal with it. Everyone walks away!"}
{"text":"Really good place to go for authentic hot pot! The food was fantastic and be careful with ordering the spicy pot it was way spicier than expected. 
That being said, the service was poor. We had to keep flagging down the wait staff just to get water, spoons or really anything. They didn't pay much attention to us. Even though there were maybe 3 other tables in there. It wasn't at all busy. Pretty slow for a lunch hour. 
And as for pricing goes, the meat and veggie prices are... fair, but they charge you $10 for the broth. Broth should b no more than $3 or $4 max. Or simply free because I don't see anyone coming in there just for the broth lol. 
I would have given this place a 4/5 if it wasn't for he service who acted like we weren't there. 
Also tip: go for the all you can eat since the total adds up the same depending on the number of people you have"}
{"text":"This place is new so it was clean and service was decent. Man though, our table can handle spicy but the mild was crazy hot. My friend tried medium before and that was unbearable. Sides are decent. Definitely recommend the udon noodles, spinach and other greens, and the meatballs might have been the highlight. Don't go here on a date and get the mild+ spicy soup then sleepover at their place. Not a good idea."}
{"text":"Really nice Chinese hot pot!!!
Delicious with fresh meat and vegetables!
Also the flavor for the pot is really traditional Chinese style. I really love it and definitely want to be a return customer ~"}
{"text":"This new hot pot place is where it's at. You know what else is amazing here? The FRIED RICE (yangzhou chaofan)!!!"}
{"text":"Big groups and peeps looking of a one of a kind dining experience, come here and smash food!  Our server was beyond accommodating and ensured that we understood the menu and translated nearly everything on it so that we could make an accurate selection.  My partner in crime and I went to town on everything from every category and if it was something that we didn't understand we got it anyway so we could figure it out later.  The Medium Hot \"Hot pot\" with Szechuan pepper corns is balls hot by the way so I'm going to have to come back and crush more food since I got to experience the cleansing sweat effect of this round.  We got Frog legs, assortment of mushrooms, squash, seaweed and all sorts of noodles that allowed us to definitely taste the restaurant.  James is the owner I believe and we were fortunate to know that in the upcoming future they'll be formulating some different recipes that will allow guests to have a different experience.  Fooooo sho this mo fo is going back!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance but I had 2 days of diarrhea after having the hotpot here. Had a fly flying around when I ate there. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"First time here, and they very helpful on deciding what to get.. but definetly recommend this place for hot pot!! So much flavor!!"}
{"text":"I don't like this hotpot place. I don't know why the rate went that high. It's pretty authentic, that's true. But the food quality can't match their price."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best hot pot experience I've had!! A friend of mine told me to check this place out and it is a very cool spot. The spicy hot pot here is actually spicy so it would be a great place for spicy lover but just be cautious when indicating your spice level. Mild is pretty good for people first visit here if you're a heat friend. There was a variety of soup bases to choose from. I recently tried the tomato broth and the king mushroom broth as well and they are both excellent. A variety of different meat were offerings on the menu and was pleasantly surprised overall. Food is in good quantity and quality. Also for only additional $0.98, you also have access to the sauces at the sauce bar. The interior was very pretty, clean and classy, the besutiful decor definitely made my experience more enjoyable. Service here were friendly and attentive. They were welcome and patient to walk through the menu with us. All in all, a great experience. I definitely come back here and bring more friends again. Btw, they have AYCE for lunch everyday and it is very worth to try."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Now that the weather is cooling down a bit here, we figured it was a good time to try out this new hot pot spot! We got here around 5 and it wasn't too busy but it got busier and tables filled up when we left. The interior is nicely designed with a contemporary flair, with tables that have a built in heating unit for your pot.

The menu is easy to navigate through. You check off what type of broth, meats and vegetables you want. You can either get one single type of broth, two different broths in the same pot separated by a divider, or a specially separated pot with several dividers so that each person can have their own broth. With the latter option you only have one choice of broth though. For us, our choice was a half/half of the mushroom bone and medium spicy broth. I found it a bit odd that there was no option for the spicy or extremely spicy broth with the half/half option but the medium ended up being plenty spicy for us. The fiery broth had a fair amount of red chiles and a generous portion of Sichuan peppercorns, along with chili oil.  I enjoyed the mushroom bone broth which had a well balanced savory flavor. With the spicy broth I feel like I did have to do a fair amount of siphoning and picking out chiles and peppercorns from my meat and vegetables but that's how it goes for those types of broths. The ladles they have here are nice in that one half of the spoon has a specially designed built in filter so that you can pour the broth back into the pot without your ladled hot pot item falling out.

There are also add on options for the sauce station and a plate of extra hot spice. Although the price isn't too bad (Less than a dollar per person) I did feel like I was being nickel and dimed a bit since I don't recall other hot pot places charging me to use their sauce station. I ended up getting the additional spicy plate which consisted of a ton of ground chili and ground peanuts. 2 people can easily share this plate. I enjoyed the added hit of texture from the peanuts with the hot pot items but since the spicy side of our pot was already hot enough for me I didn't use the spice mixture too much. Next time I'll opt for just the sauce station.

We ordered 3 meats (Lean beef, scallops, and pig liver), some dumplings, and a plethora of vegetables and tofu. Rice is also an extra charge, by the bowl. All the items were fresh and tasted great in both broths. My favorites were the beef, taro, pumpkin and lotus root. 

Service was hit or miss. Our drinks were filled quite frequently which I appreciated. When we mentioned the free dessert check in offer at the beginning of our meal to one of the servers, she said it was no problem we could redeem the offer. However, at the end of our meal we asked another server about getting our free dessert and he said there was a minimum purchase amount and that the deal wasn't valid anymore. Which is it, the offer's valid, there's a minimum purchase or there isn't a check in offer anymore? We decided not to pursue it further to risk more confusion and decided to go somewhere else for dessert. We also received the wrong check which was a LOT more pricey than our bill. 

Speaking of our bill, I thought our total was high for just 3 meats and mainly vegetables with no other drinks besides water. We ended up paying $28 per person for a table of 5 including tax and tip. Now it has been some time since I've had hot pot at a restaurant so I can't remember if this is par for the course for hot pot but for me there's a lot of other meals I could eat and be more than satisfied with for that amount of money.

Apparently they are starting an all you can eat option for lunch which is around $20 I think. Might be worth a try in the future if I'm in the mood for more hot pot!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out from seeing good reviews about the authenticity of the hotpot. Service was good (in contrary to most reviews I've seen), maybe because we went at night so it wasn't too busy. It was decent, but I've definitely had better/ more authentic hotpot! Would also like to add that it's on the pricier side though, and I wish they could do all you can eat buffets for dinner on weekends."}
{"text":"It's the worst restaurant. Don't go. You will regret it absolutely. The food was stale and chewy. The service was horrible. The bathrooms were dirty"}
{"text":"Little confusing if it your first time there. I been to hot pot restaurant before but still have to ask the waitress to explain it. Going there with 2 person and the bill come out to 60 something so warning, is can be a little pricey. 
When I was there, the table next to us it finishing up and leave. They clean up really fast but in the middle of the cleaning, cashier lady from the front come in, get a clean plate put the half eating vegetable (lotus root, more pricey vegetable) and bring it to the back of the kitchen. I dont know why she did that when there a trash can right there on the cleaning card. If i have to guess, feel like they reuse it. Anyway the food it ok, dont think i come back because of that."}
{"text":"Let me preface with the fact that I am a Southern California native.. It's not that I think the food out there is better, they just have more options. That being said, since moving here I have searched high and low for tastes of home (cliche I know) so a random yelp search turned up Yu Tian  Xia, as soon as I walked in I was very excited because it had everything I was looking for! Incredibly authentic and delicious.. The only negative I can really say is that it does get expensive fast when loading up on your favorites. I spent roughly 80-90 for two people (not including alcohol) however being that I was excited to find a place of this caliber, I probably over ordered"}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and soups are good. They are not joking when they say there medium has some heat to it. I like how they have a sauce bar. Service here eas great."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try hot pot and I am so glad this was my first experience. 
James was such a great help with explaining how hot pot works. 
I am looking forward to coming again and bringing some more newbies!!"}
{"text":"TIP: Mild is SUPER spicy!! 

We came to this place for the first time on a Friday night. The restaurant itself is very easy to find, it's in the same shopping plaza as AZ international market. 

The staff here are very slow, and by slow I mean you have to wave them down to come and take your order. Aside from being slow, our waiter, who did not mention her name, she was ok, she came by a couple times to fill up our water, they do not really ask if you need anything, be ready to ask for what you need. 

Now to the real business, the food. You order from a pamphlet. You choose your broth and then they have vegetables, meats, seafood and rice and noodles also. BE CAREFUL of the broth. We choose mild for our spice level and we were burning up to the point where it was hard for us to enjoy our meal. The meat is good, the clear noodles has a weird chewy texture to it. They have a sauce bar it's an extra $.98 cents charge per person, but be careful of cross contamination of the sauces, it isn't very clean. 

Overall, it was my first hot pot experience, I can't say I was crazy about it."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????
????????????*???????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Expensive and disgusting. The service was terrible as well. We ordered meat and vegetables for our half and half hotpot and ended up waiting over twenty minutes for our food to come. When it finally came, they only brought out the vegetables without giving us any bowls or utensils. We then had to wait another twenty minutes for our meat to come out. The self-serve sauce bar is 90% disgusting and all labeled in Chinese so you are taking a risk when taste testing a sauce. Avoid the green/blackish sauce at all cost. It tasted like death. I think the Chinese label for it translates to \"Dog Shit\" cause it was horrendous. 

As for the quality of the hotpot - not good. We got half of the spicy broth and half of the mushroom broth. The spicy broth (their supposedly number one broth) got very tiring to eat and is an acquired taste. It had way too much peppercorn and schezwan peppers. The mushroom broth was just way too bland. Overall, Taiwanese hotpot or even shabu hotpot destroys this place. 

The meat quality was not fresh but expect to pay lots of money for everything. I ended up not eating much and left unsatisfied. Be aware of all the people hanging out and smoking outside as well. 

Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Super fresh high quality food, especially the meats, attentive and friendly service, and all around a good experience."}
{"text":"I love hot pots and I think this place serves nice food and definitely had nice service. However, just like a lot of existing reviews (which I did not read clearly enough before I went...) said, we spent $60 for only the 2 of us for dinner. I read Chinese so the menu wasn't unclear to me. However, while I clearly marked the smallest portion for my orders (\"on a stick\" which should cost $1), they sent those to us in \"plates\". I didn't notice they were wrong until I see the bill - each plate cost $5-$7 which was way more than we had budgeted for. The server kindly gave us a 5% off for her mis-reading of our order. Well, that only brought down $2......
good food, nice experience, clean restaurant; but too overpriced for sure (especially it was because they read my order wrong!) and I probably won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here. A previous Yelpers advice was helpful to start with the medium. I hope to have the stones to try \"Spicy\" next time. I'm definitely coming back. The bone mushroom broth went great with pork belly, chopped mutton and cucumbers, our medium spicy broth made more sense with the shrimp dumplings and udon. I think you can pass on the Prime Beef. 

Bone Mushroom Broth: (Sip after Hot Broth to soothe)
Chopped Mutton-Small (for flavor)
Pork Belly-Large (Main Protein)
Cucumber, Udon Noodle, Fried Dough Sticks (Dipping)

Medium Spicy Broth: (I found best to keep simple)
Shrimp Dumplings
Prime Beef.....ehh if you like it get the partial fat one
Seaweed, Udon Noodle....possibly Garlic"}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food in town.  Have to try their Fried Pork and spicy hot pot."}
{"text":"I was craving a delicious authentic hot pot experience while traveling through Phoenix on business. Stumbled upon this place.  When I approached the place at noon thete was only one other table which should have been my 1st warning sign to stay away. I continued with ordering my food choices. The food was fresh yet when I received my bill I noticed they had the audacity to charge me for every little thing that us typically part of the overall price at hot pots restaurants. They charged me $3 for the causes like I wasn't going to eat my hot pot without any sause. My advice unless you want to be iveeky charged for your hot pot experience stay away from this place. I'm sure there are other area hot pot places that are more reasonably priced. Bon appetit"}
{"text":"I love this place so much, the best taste and best service. The most important thing is they have AYCE for lunch!!! 29.99 for the first person and the second is 20.99. I have tried the AYCE this time, the food and quality have no differences. That's really affordable! I highly recommend people came and have a try this place! 

Yu Tian Xia! Good Time!"}
{"text":"First time to a hot pot place in AZ - had a pretty good experience here - the food was good, but a bit pricey for what you get.  The sauce station was amazing - had oyster sauce , pure sesame oil, an X.O. type condiment along with green onions,  cilantro, minced garlic, and some hot chili paste. The meats were great quality, seafood was ok, and he extra noodles livened up the broth at the end.  I prefer Korean bbq, but I would come back if I'm ever in the mood for shabu shabu"}
{"text":"Clearly, the hubs and I do not know how to eat hot pot like we thought we did.  Everything here is a la carte and between the 2 of us, our meal was upwards to $80.  The food was mediocre and unless we didn't know how to order or how to mesh our hot pot to make a delicious bowl, I don't think we will be back here again."}
{"text":"Be careful. The \"medium\" spicy here is a Chinese medium spicy. 

It's nice to have a self serve sauce bar for hot pot. Everything seems fairly fresh and good quality. 

It's good, but nothing amazing. A weak 4 stars."}
