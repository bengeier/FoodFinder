{"text":"Other Indian is pedestrian once you have debu's food. His use spices is very percise and flavours are perfectly designed."}
{"text":"This will change the way you think about Indian food. We shared 3 of the \"3-ways\" dishes (halibut, chicken and veggies) along with some spinach and garlic nan. Without a doubt, the best Indian food I have ever had (and I've traveled India) and some of the best food in general that I have had in a long time. The service was great and the complimentary mango cheesecake that arrived for dessert was superb. You owe it to yourself to check out Debu's."}
{"text":"Debu must mean \"divine\" in Indian or something because the dinner I just had was amazing!  I live near little India and so I'm used to naan, pakoras, dahl but not like this.

The spices were perfect, complex and layered with such skill we had to literally count the chews to make sure we didn't gulp it all down.

We had pakoras, vegetable platter (not sure what else to call it), mango lassi, dahl, chicken (done three different ways), papadum all beautifully presented with exquisite service.

The menu changes all the time and there is a new menu coming out next week.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Last night was a cold rainy night and my co-worker and I were starving and we came across Debu's.  The space is a beautiful, intimate 30 seat restaurant, we were instantly seated by the chef and we selected a mix of seasonal vegetables and halibut prepared three ways.  

We were blown away with the complex flavours and presentation.  Everything was so fresh and delicious - we are coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously under reviewed on Yelp. Everybody go to Debu's STAT!

I am pretty stingy with doling out stars, but this place is worth every star. Why can't it be downtown, closer home so I can go every week?

The place is not very spacious, so I made reservations and we were promptly seated by a pleasant hostess. The menu is well picked, the flavors are huuuge,and the food presentation is great! The hostess doubles up as a server so at times the service can be a tad slow but totally worth the wait.

We started off with fritters, and boy was I surprised! The fritters came in casings made of pappadoms and were garnished with a smattering of sauces and salts. The complimentary mango salsa is a take home worthy product! So good!

My dining partner ordered the vegetarian sampler which had a grilled cauliflower, a cheese dumpling aka kofta and delicious lentils! I ordered the non vegetarian platter which had jumbo shrimp cooked three different ways: grilled, in coconut sauce and in mustard. Each prep was so different from the other and so, so good. The combination of traditional spices in non traditional ways resulted in uniformly great flavors.

We weren't sure about ordering dessert cuz we were stuffed at this point, but the server gave us a complementary dessert platter which had cheese cake made out of cottage cheese(very decadent and I've never had this before); blueberries, and gelato ( I think). The ensuing food coma was one of the best I've ever had.

Dinner for two came to $80 with tip and tax (but sans alcohol and with complimentary dessert). Worth every penny."}
