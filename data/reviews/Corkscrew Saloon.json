{"text":"I am so disappointed to read so few reviews for this Medina establishment that has excellent food and atmosphere. I think people have been eating chain food for too long and have lost their tastebuds. We were there in July, my hubby had the ribeye and said it was possibly the best steak he ever had. And we are great home cooks and we get out a lot and have been to upscale steakhouses. I had the house made lobster stuffed ravioli. It was generously filled with seafood, the sauce was perfect, and it was absolute home made. The service on that Saturday night was friendly and attentive. The outdoor patio is gorgeous an overlooks a clean pond inhabited by waterfowl and should be more crowded than it is! We had the scallops Rockefeller appetizer and the scallops were cooked perfectly and they were incredible, bacon accented, sweet saucy treats! Give this local place a try of you haven't been!"}
{"text":"Great food. Creative and tasty menu.  Service is friendly and prompt.  Ryan Marino certainly one of the top chefs in the area. A favorite destination for me and my friends."}
{"text":"Great steaks, seriously can't beat them in Medina. Great portion sizes for your money, and excellent service. Meat was prepared perfectly, and light whiskey peppercorn sauce added a great amount of flavor. Also try their ribs, delicious. :-)"}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. I ordered the mushroom ravioli, which I was told was fresh. It was tough to chew, had very little taste and was covered in canned peppers and frozen spinach. There are no fresh ingredients. Severely over priced for the food you are served."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Jenna was fantastic as our server.  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. It is one of the best for food and drinks in Medina. Their martini's are great. I especially love their carmel apple martini. The food is always delicious! We go there often and have tried everything on the menu. My favorite is their salmon burger with beer battered french fries. Their french fries are by far the best in town! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"They can fill up an oversized plate with a lot of mashed potatoes, but that does not disquise that they are serving an abreviated main item.  YThey can squeeze 5-6 glasses out of a single (cheap) bottle of wine just to make more profits, but people who know aren't fooled.  Re-cooking and then reserving an item they didn't get right the first time may make them feel like a smart business people, but that's their idea of quality, they don't have a clue.  Charging white table cloth prices in a bar quality environment...I'm not buying it.  A couple of main dishes with shorted main items and a couple of glasses of wine does not equate to an $80 meal.   What a disappointment.  I'll drive the extra mile to get quality in Akron and Fairlawn.  Better than being taken....or corkscrewed!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely go back. Nice small bar area where they have a great selection of beer and cider on tap. Loved the Boursin stuffed mushrooms, veal stuffed hungarian pepper appetizers. The Bison steak was good too! They also have a large outdoor patio with a landscaped pond."}
{"text":"Never had bad service or a bad meal....  Fresh, quality, delicous.  We'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"I had been in this place before but it's been a couple yrs.  Stopped in on a Friday in the prime of dinner rush. We did not have to wait for a table. We opted to sit indoors as opposed to their patio. Hostess sat us in a quaint dining room. The server was a true professional! He was so very polite and most importantly \"spot on\" with every aspect of the night. I watched serve all the other tables in his section and he did not miss a beat and every customer seemed as pleased as we were. Drinks from the bar were very good. The have a full bar as well as tons of wine and martinis. I order the tuna and it was sooo good. Very generous portions! It's sushi grade tuna, so it's top notch! Every other aspect of dining exp was great and we will go back again.  So I highly recommend the corkscrew saloon in medina. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent service (Stephanie) My wife had surf and turf. I had pork chop. One of the best I've ever had. Great atmosphere. You can go casual or dressed up and be comfortable. There are plenty of things on the menu for every taste."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome setting. The Boursin Stuffed Mushrooms have been our go to app. We would love to hit the patio some summer evening without the kids."}
{"text":"I would definitely give The Corkscrew Saloon a solid 4 stars if it weren't for the prices.    As a vegan, I greatly appreciated that the creation of this menu was really well thought out to serve many types of dietary needs and palates.  There is a lot of heavy meat dishes (mussels, duck, liver....good lord).  But hey, there are some tasty options for us veggie folks too, Yay!!  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli, which is sauteed with tomatoes, peppers, spinach, vegan soy chicken, and a balsamic sauce.  It was a heavier dish than I was really in the mood for, but I wanted to give it a try.  I thought this was really delicious, and had lots of flavors complimenting one another.  My issue was that I feel this is about a $14 entree, not a $22 entree.  That's a bit much.  My husband ordered the Potato Gnocchi with vegan sausage.  He described the dish as \"okay\", but I'll tell you it looked pretty good.  I was busy with my own so I didn't give it a taste.  Again, the issue here would be cost.  The entree is listed as $18, and with the vegan sausage, comes to a whopping $24.  Ouch!    We are not opposed to paying more for some good vegan options, and again, I appreciate the effort of these offerings.  I'm just not sure that we will return."}
{"text":"While the patio is lovely i was less than impressed with the wait staff. We were greeted with a very unfriendly waitress (black hair/high pony) who seemed annoyed that we were visiting on a very slow sunday afternoon. She then rushed us to decide if we wanted to sit inside or out, and made rude comments as she showed us to our table. We should have left then. Our food was average and our waitress was thankfully more friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for a romantic evening dinner. The restaurant is inside a beautiful old brick Victorian. Good friendly wait service. The food was excellent with fresh ingredients local and in season. I recommend the walleye or other fish specials ."}
{"text":"Patio is awesome...  Great atmosphere .  Nice lake with a white duck!  Just had app n drinks... Fun! Nice waiter, tom.  Recommend the spring rolls.... They were the best I ever had... Need to go back just for them!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 5. I had the Asian Chicken which was delicious.  Hubby had the Short Ribs, which he enjoyed.  Service was friendly,  but very slow.  I was here for lunch yesterday and service was extremely slow then as well.  Good food,  just need to hire more help I guess"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. We have never had a bad meal there before. My husband is rather picky about his steaks. He usually orders the large fillet. Said it is the best he has had. I love seafood. Talapia and other dishes are fantastic. We have always had great servie, nice wine choices at resonalbe prices, and a fun and different environment to dine in. The chef has our appreciation for the individual attention that goes into each dish."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice dinner by sampling three appetizers. We had the Duck Bacon Wontons, BLT Margherita Flatbread and Scallops. The food was tasty and cooked properly. We were seated in one of the main rooms, while charming as an old house it wasn't as intimate as one may think. This was a nice upscale bistro menu with food to match, the ambiance didn't quite mesh but we would happily return. Wait staff was pleasant and service was prompt. If you are weighing trying Corkscrew for the first time - I'd say it's worthwhile."}
{"text":"I pride myself in having a well rounded appreciation for great food. Fifteen years of frequenting the finest \"Chicagoland\" restaurants has given my Bride and I some wonderful memories. \"Bob Chins\" and \"The Signature Room\" top the list, so the choice to move closer to family here in Ohio meant the end of great food, so we thought.  Having recently been to France for commemorative D-Day observances also gave us some experience with great sauces and architecture. Corkscrew had a lot to live up to when we walked in last Sunday with some good friends. We all expressed our approval of the old house conversion. The woodwork was impressive.  We all had the filet and it was world class, but the rest of the meal did not make an impression good or bad."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Corkscrew Saloon because it's located in a cool old house, but I had a great salad for lunch.  I ordered the filet mignon fajita salad with olive oil for dressing, and it was outstanding... ingredients were fresh and well prepared.  We had good service from our server for lunch and she was very attentive.    Since I was visiting the area, I'm not sure if I will have the chance to visit Corkscrew Saloon again, but if I ever do, I'd like to check out the rest of the restaurant: patio and bar.  I believe they have some good wine choices as well."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place due to a detour and what a welcome surprise from the strip mall wasteland that I otherwise associate Medina with. I shop here on occasion ( at the strip malls!) but needed to have lunch today and was glad to find this place. Nice atmosphere in an old Victorian building (train station?). I had a Greek salad which was pretty good. Very vegetarian friendly. They have some meat substitutes which isn't something I'm usually too interested in, but at least they have put some thought into it."}
{"text":"The Bison burger is absolutely delicious and the pasta dishes here have never disappointed my family. We come here as often as possible. The outdoor patio is nice, weather permitting, and the service has always been spectacular!"}
{"text":"One for the (great) wine!!!! As out of towners visiting Medina, we made reservations having read past yelp reviews. This review receives one stars because the bottle of the wine was surprisingly decent. Upon being seated our waiter took his sweet time coming to the table promptly informing us how busy he was.  We ordered simple gnocchi dishes without anything ese only to be served about 10 gnocchis with what appeared to be tofu patties on top. The food and service were subpar. If you're visiting there are many other places to eat at."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening.  We sat inside but will sit outside next.   Everyone had one thing different.  My brother had tuna and said he didn't remember anything overhe year tasting that good.  My sister had halibut and found it to be way too dry.  The walleye was great, flat iron steak cooked just right and the scrod was great as well.  The spring vegetables was great and some kind of scallop potatoes that were to die or."}
{"text":"Best food in Medina, hands-down. I have been here a few times, the most recent time was for a fundraising event. Every time I'm there the food is absolutely incredible. Come with an appetite because the BLT flatbread pizza is a must, along with the coconut breaded chicken and crispy asparagus. The only thing I wish I could change about this place is its location, it's a 30 minute drive from me but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile..... little disappointed. Did not realize where you eat is in an old house and you are eating in a space of a bedroom, assumed eating areas would be open. First, we were sat next to a screaming baby on our date night, dropping our own kids off so we asked to be moved. It's just very uncomfortable eating with others in such small rooms, very awkward and not what we expected. We just ordered appetizers and they were good but nothing memorable to make me want to go back. Maybe we'll check out the patio in the summer but not interested in going back to the restaurant area."}
{"text":"Besides the unique location-a historic mansion-this was the best meal I've had in a long time. Service was great, drinks from the bar were $6, and perfectly mixed. My sons had 'kids meals' which were gigantic adult portions - they could have shared one! The burger was fresh and the fries, perfectly crisp. The pasta and meatballs were delicious - sauce was fresh with real tomatoes and the meatballs were better than mine and I'm an Italian from Jersey who KNOWS how to make a meatball! We shared the meat and cheese platter - the hubby was happy, unique meats and different cheeses - the fresh herb crusted was our favorite. MIL had halibut special with risotto- cooked to perfection. I had the seafood trio over risotto - scallops and risotto literally melted in my mouth. My husband had chicken with applewood bacon & scalloped potatoes  - portions were huge, he ate only 1/2 & happily took the left overs home to make slammin chicken slider sandwiches. Of all the restaurants in Medina - this is my new must go to when we visit family!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Victorian charmer revamped as a great stop for sandwiches and drinks. Staff takes great care of repeat customers and with two floors of dining, there are many private spaces to be had. The Bousin cheese stuffed mushrooms are a great starter and the Bloody Mary's go down nicely. Good salads with interesting specials that change often... skip the chains and try this place."}
{"text":"Very nice cosy rustic place.Enjoyed the atmosphere and the great selections of wines and italian cuisines. Very friendly people and a great atmosphere. Special thanks to Rose for making it very nice. Will highly recommend this place.  Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, so when we had a baby free night it was #1 on our list!   The old house this restaurant is in is fabulous. We were a little underdressed, in just t-shirts. We had a real lit candle on our table. Impressive. I loved the hardwood floors and looking at all the details and designs.   The drink menu was awesome. He had a Moscow mule (pretty little, but very adorable) and I had a cranberry blush cidergeist, it was SO good.   Wait times were normal. We ordered scallops for an appetizer. They were TINY but good. I think there were 5, but each one was bite-sized. We also had salads,  their house dressing was a Gorgonzola dressing and it was awesome!  For entrees, he got the Ohio raised Bison steak. I got the shrimp and lobster ravioli. I loved mine. His was also very good. His was $35 and I believe mine was about the same.   We also had dessert! He got some kind of creme brûlée and I got the black and white ganache cake.   I highly recommend this place. Everything was fabulous and the setting was AWESOME. The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price to portion ratio. I feel like the portions could have been a bit bigger for the price."}
{"text":"1st visit Flat iron steak done perfect Trio of seafood good but too much for 1 person Risotto was too creamy and asparagus was over cooked  Great atmosphere  Attentive server Will def return again"}
{"text":"Nice people here.  This looks like a converted Victorian house made into a restaurant.  There are a few rooms to sit in.  Well decorated.  Food is good.  However, the $$ is wrong.  This is more like a $$$ to $$$$."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. The kitchen really ruined it for me. Terrible food. Undercooked stuffed peppers and steak. Two pretty easy things to get right."}
{"text":"Very nice old mansion house turned pub style dining with nice semi formal dining rooms.  Food was excellent (meat and cheese board, prime rib dinner, and perch dinner).  The wine list was very reasonable.  The staff was attentive, courteous, and efficient.  We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Been coming to Corkscrew Saloon for a couple years now and I've never been disappointed so when it was time to pick a place for dinner for a 28 year wedding anniversary with friends coming in from Illinois and New York, the decision was easy. Just as in past experiences, we weren't disappointed. Our party of six ordered a variety of entrees to include the filet minion, ahi tuna steak, bbq ribs, and the prime rib & shrimp dinner special. Our guests thoroughly their meals and the service from our server, Jenny, was nothing short of top notch. Although we were all full from dinner, the dessert selection looked too good to pass up. We enjoyed the tropical cake & chocolate peanut butter cake and our gluten free guest enjoyed a slice of the flourless chocolate cake. Needless to say, I will continue to visit this restaurant and would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for a while as this is another great option in Medina. It is a bit outside of town, to the West, but well worth the two to three minute drive from the Medina Town Square. The building has a rich history and has been renovated tastefully. They have outdoor seating in warmer weather and a variety of intimate to larger rooms to dine in. I eat here fairly often and find their burgers (\"Angus Steak\"....the best!!!) to be very good. They also have an open faced steak sandwich that is yummy, and a good selection of soups and lunch salads. Dinner is a little bit more formal, but you can also have more casual items outside and in the bar area. For dinner, I love the \"Veal Aurora\" (not sure if it's named after the city or the car?). The rack of lamb is very tasty, (it's a 1/2 rack), and the \"Flat Iron Steak\" is just the right size for me, coming in around 8 oz. They have a good wine by the glass selection and the service is excellent. They also do catering."}
{"text":"Love Corkscrew! We have been here several times and I have never had a bad meal! The servers are always timely and very good all around!"}
{"text":"This is my first time for dinner. Previously I was here for appetizers only, and they were so good that I came back for more. The Margarita flatbed appetizer was wonderful and the baked potato soup was as good as I have ever had. I had the grouper. Mary had the pasta Newburg, and both were excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. We sat on the patio, which was huge and beautiful!! The lunch menu only had sandwiches and salads to choose from which is why I am giving it four stars. More options besides sandwiches would be lovely! (I think they had 3 different versions of a steak sandwich.)I didn't get an opportunity to look at dinner menu. The food was amazing. We had the stuffed peppers, corkscrew trio, and open face steak sandwich. Everything was tasty, but beware the corkscrew trio was all fried food, and the menu didn't specify that. Service was a little slow, but we were enjoying the sunshine and didn't mind. Overall experience was good! Good food and atmosphere, just lacking choices on menu items."}
{"text":"The Corkscrew definitely is a great place to visit, there was a charm to the establishment that made it feel different when we arrived. The service tram was always at the table at the right moments providing a great experience, the the food made the dining experience an evening to remember. BTW try the bread pudding, it was very good. We will be back often."}
{"text":"After years of being intrigued with the look of the Corkscrew Saloon, my husband & I finally planned a date night; made reservations & went!  All I can say is this place is amazing from the time you walk through the door!!  Very unique atmosphere.  Gorgeous woodwork- and the meals and service is beyond amazing!!  Great food!!  Wonderful staff!!  Great experience!!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Corkscrew Saloon many times and never have I had anything but a wonderful experience.   The outdoor patio is beautiful in nice weather and the indoor seating is a treat inside an old century home.  I've had both steak and sea food from Corkscrew and each time it was been thoughtfully prepared.  I personally enjoy their salmon.  Their stuffed peppers are my favorite for appetizers.  They can get busy, especial around holidays or special occasions so it's always best to make reservations.  Watch for St. Patty, Valentine, ect day specials as well."}
{"text":"My husband & I went out for dinner to celebrate our Anniversary this evening.  After considering many places in the  Medina area as well as out of the area. We made reservations and had dinner at the Corkscrew Saloon.   Delicious Food, Impressive portions, very nice menu selection, outstanding friendly service & a Beautiful patio.   We both enjoyed an adult beverage, shared appetizer, dinner (Full rack of ribs for my husband & I had the Grouper) and a shared  dessert.  Our bill came, and we were pleasantly surprised and very satisfied.  Couldn't ask for anything more!  Looking forward to enjoying a future date night once again at the Corkscrew Saloon."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed in the Screw! I had the chance to meet the owner as I am doing my rehearsal dinner here. It was so easy to plan and they were very friendly. While we planned everything we sat outside and enjoyed the super nice patio. Best in medina for sure. I had the lunch menu's salmon burger and was very impressed. The rueban was great too. I love the German chocolate cake too. It is a must try. Give the screw a try if you are a Medinian!"}
{"text":"I do not know how I have lived in this area for the better part of a decade and I've never, ever seen this place. It's huge! It's an old Victorian mansion, complete with fireplaces. Super cool atmosphere, reminded me of a spot in Little Italy.   We went there on a whim, I hadn't looked at the menu in months, and we had our daughter with us. I was NOT expecting the prices to be as high as they were, especially since it's high for the area, but hey, I won't let that deter me. They weren't crazy, insane prices, just not what I expect for a mid-week, non-date-night dinner. Soooo not the restaurant's fault, totally mine, but I think it should have more than 2 dollar signs!  I ordered a Greek Salad with chicken, my daughter got the pierogy app, and my husband ordered Chicken Parm. We had no alcohol or dessert. We did order French Onion soup x2. Our bill was $60 (before tip).  The food itself was enjoyable. Not the best I've ever had, but good. THe soup was a bit salty and tasted like maybe it had too much worchestershire OR may have been made with anchovy? Pierogies were from Ohio City Pasta, and I'm normally a huge fan, but these had a VERY odd taste. THey were just red potato and cheddar... I thought my daughter was just being picky, but I did not like them either.  Our server was very nice, I could overhear her playing consultant to the other tables in our little nook - she was very knowledgeable on the food and the drink menu.   Here is where I start to get nitpicky. My husband and I both worked as servers over the years, and maybe we spot things more than most, so take it with a grain of salt. :)  1. When we were seated, in a super cute little front room, the hostess did not ask if we'd like a kid's menu. Neither did the server. I was going to ask, but my daughter already saw pierogies on the app menu. But, I mean, my kid is 10. Yes, I could've asked, but frankly I shouldn't have to. That bugged me.  2. If I am paying nearly $75 for dinner, including tip - basically for 2 adults - I don't think I should have empty plates left on my table or glasses of water that need to be filled.   3. I noticed awards for 'fine dining', and the prices were kind of high for Medina...but the staff were wearing polo shirts. That confused me a bit.  Overall, it was a good twist to visit this spot. I do want to try again, but we'll go back on a date night when we are, you know....more prepared to shell out over $100 for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"I have been here many of times. Great place in the city of Medina. I have ate outside by the pond area in the summer and have eaten inside. The menu items are upscale but traditional. Something for everyone. I have not ordered anything that I was unhappy with. They have a great selection of wines. Service is very good. I have never had to complain here or would I even think of it. Come here for date night, celebrate a special occasion, or just treat someone to a nice meal."}
{"text":"Two words here...Bourbon & Bartender!! Orphan barrel bourbons available here & \"R\" is the sweetest. She recognizes and greets everyone, polite and prompt and informative...I could go on and on.  Only sampled a few menu items...they are very good, some carry a heavier price tag."}
{"text":"Had a nice quiet lunch here today. I was the only patron in the bar. I tried a glass of the Ohio Brewing Scotch Ale. It was a little rich at first, with strong notes of caramel, but it grew on me as the glass slowly disappeared. The bartender was very friendly, and she let me sample a batch of her homemade sangria which was quite smooth. For my lunch I went with the BLT flatbread. It was very tasty with plenty of bacon chunks; however, my only complaint was that it was a bit chewy. There was only one small TV in the bar, and nothing was on worth watching. There was no music either, so the ambiance was a bit quiet for my taste. That said, it seemed like a nice place with good food, so I'd like to go back again and try something else."}
{"text":"Took my brother-inlaw there for his Birthday. Food was good but a little pricey for the quality and portion."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Corkscrew Saloon and we were pleasantly surprised. Our server was friendly and helpful without being overly so. She suggested several of the specials- the red snapper and the monkfish which two of us tried and enjoyed. I had the grouper which was excellent. The setting is pretty cool- an old Victorian house, which adds to the charm."}
{"text":"This is a very unique and festive location. My husband and I went here for our first post baby date. We sat in a nice quiet room, a welcome change from the newborn and 2 year old at Home. Service was excellent. I do wish they had more wines by the glass. Prices were reasonable for cocktails. Entrees came with salads and sides which was nice. Husband had the ribs which he raves about. I had orange roughy special. It was great. Service was very quick, so we told the waiter to slow down. He was great. We'd go back, and we wouldn't bring kids under 8.  It's a quiet relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"Great experience! We had Brie appetizer which was very good.  I had the Halibot which was a special... it turned out to be SPECIAL!  My wife had the butternut squash ravioli (Gluten free).  It was good but had more chicken than it did ravioli.  This was under the heading pasta.  Thought it would have more ravioli... hence the 4 star rating.  Service was excellent!!  Recommend to all.  Hard to choose from numerous choices."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, especially for special occasions.  Took my brother here who is visiting from California to celebrate my birthday.  Wonderful server and the hostess even took us for a tour of the restaurant and gave us a little history behind the building."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant!   It's a lot nice than I expected, especially with saloon in the name.   We ate upstairs and had Brandon as our server. He was FANTASTIC! My husband travels on business and said Brandon is the best waiter he's seen in a long time. He was very attentive, nice and willing to provide his opinion when we asked   The dinner rolls were so good - they were like a pastry!! Mmmmmmmm  We got the Baked Brie appetizer - very good.   We both ordered the Ribeye dinner. The steaks were done perfectly, as was the asparagus. The potatoes were really good too.   My husband got carrot cake for dessert - he said it was the best carrot cake he's ever had I ordered the Oreo torte. They ended up being out of the regular Oreo torte, but had a mint Oreo torte and it was so good! We both had coffee - we are coffee snobs - and it was delicious!!  This place is really good - good for a special occasion too!!"}
{"text":"Saloon isn't quite the right word or description for this place. Great atmosphere in the old civil war brick building. Good service. And the Bison burger was delicious."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch today.   I ordered their pierogis and it was a great choice!!!   Our server was very attentive to us.   Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and very friendly people.  Quickly becoming one of our favorites.  The atmosphere is so inviting!  Looking forward to summers on the patio!"}
{"text":"All of our food was delicious and the service was superb.  We ordered two appetizers, one being mussels and they did not come out when the chef had originally wanted them to be served, so he did not charge us.  We were not unhappy, but the chef was...They were DELICIOUS!  The best we have had in years.  All of our food was wonderful and reasonably priced.  We are returning tomorrow to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We can hardly wait!"}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite places to eat,  the menu always has a variety of things to choose from and I've never had anything that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Ordered a shrimp and scallops dish.  The scallops were good but the shrimps smelled fishy which is not what you expect for 30 bucks.  Should have sent it back. Service was friendly and pleasant but too long between visits.  Dinner dragged out for longer than desired."}
{"text":"The pecan crusted grouper is absolutely awesome, but make sure you get it with the risotto (you have to ask).  Really nice patio when weather cooperates."}
{"text":"This is a staple in my husband and I's  repertoire. The food is always delicious. My favorite is the veal gnocci. BLT flatbread is also wonderful. Definitely try Corkscrew if you're in the area for high-quality, fresh food. It has a casual atmosphere, but upscale food."}
{"text":"It's an okay restaurant. The food was good, but not excellent. I love the building and the look aesthetically but the rooms do not work for a restaurant.  I was on a date and we were seated in a smaller room with a large party that was quite noisy - not their fault, but I might as well have been sitting in a bar with live music - my date and I couldn't hear each other talk."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Fantastic experience! Highly recommend a visit to Corkscrew!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a beautiful Saturday, and sat on the back patio near the pond. The menu here is great - nice variety of dishes without overkill. The prices here are a little higher for dinner, but you get a large quantity of food. I had the 8oz flatiron steak, which came with a side salad, potatoes, asparagus, and rolls. Everything was delicious, and I was STUFFED. The house gorgonzola dressing is different but great - rich and tangy but also light at the same time. Not a massive draft list, but enough options for everyone's tastes. Our server was friendly and attentive without hovering.  Cool old house, fantastic food, and great service!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and everything was superb. Went with a group of 3 couples for lunch. The sandwich soup and salad selection was great and food and service was top notch. Raspberry cheesecake was a wonderful finale to my lunch. A very historic building, very impressive restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and the food is consistently incredible.  Service is quick and friendly.  They make wonderful iced tea and have a full bar.  We really like it here"}
{"text":"Once again Chef Ryan knocks it out of the park.  I had the grouper with risotto and very fresh vegetables.  The Brie as a starter was excellent.  Always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Date night with the wife, it was EXCELLENT. I had the duck, it was cooked perfectly, and the cherry compote complimented the duck perfectly, even my wife snuck a bite or two, but I couldn't get her to leave my risotto alone, it was that good. She had the lobster dominico, lobster stuffed ravioli with tomatoes, spinach and feta, it was amazing we we're definitely sharing meals all night long. Great drinks, great service, and a great atmosphere make this place a must, you'll be regulars after your first visit."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, awesome old house. My wife and i had been looking forward to trying this place out and were very excited once we saw the menu but were disappointed in the food and price! service was pretty good other than when the server came to the table and smelled like an ashtray. that was the first turn off. For starters the $15 corkscrew flight appetizer is all deep fried blah but the description gives a different picture, plus for the small qty you get it should be $7.99. max If they are known for best seafood in Medina then Red Lobster must be the premier seafood in the area. I had the Costa Rican King fish( $25) and you could tell it was frozen because of the texture- water logged and flavor was off. My wife had the flat iron steak, it was Ok other than the the peppercorn gravy that tastes like from a package. we had one appetizer, two dinners, water to drink and was $65.00 before tip. I hate spending that much money for mediocre food.   the next night we went to our favorite Mexican restaurant and split fajitas, with extra  no plans to go back!"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is talking about. I mean, this place isn't my absolute favorite, but it certainly isn't terrible.  My family and I came here the other day for my birthday dinner and let me tell you, the house is beautiful. I love old houses turned into restaurants.   Our server was friendly, yet seemed a little nervous like it may have been her first week. I started with a sangria and man was it good! Exactly how sangria should taste. For my entree, I ordered the lobster dominica. Which is lobster ravioli with shrimp scampi in a creamy sauce. I hate to break it to all the 1-3 star reviewers out there, but it was awesome! That awesome is to be said in a drawn out, high pitched tone...in case anyone was wondering. Everyone at the table ordered something different but the response was all the same. Great food!  Since it was my birthday, I got to choose a dessert off of the fancy table to enjoy after my dinner. Here's where it gets tricky...the chocolate cake was in fact good, however, a little on the dry side if you ask me. My parents ordered a coconut cake and fought over every bite. So take that for what it's worth!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Medina Ohio! This is my favorite restaurant, period! I always have my birthday dinner here every year. It's an old Victorian house type building and it's beautiful. The patio is amazing over viewing a cute little pond. The food is out of this world. The Georgia chicken will change your life! Everything we've had here has been A+! Love love love!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food, however they are now rushing the service. In the last two weeks, we have had the same experience twice:  Salads arrive and is followed by dinner ten minutes later.  Way too fast for a restaurant of this price range."}
{"text":"Great food. Got the ribeye. Done perfectly. Fantastic atmosphere. Sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather. Good drink menu, nice selection of wines and foods. Everything was delicious and our waitress was perfect. Stephanie was our server and she was delightful...very nice, good memory, and came to check on us just the right amount of times. Highly recommend visiting here even just for drinks. Ask for Stephanie, very pleasant cordial young lady. Good service is half the experience!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, we are always trying new places and the Corkscrew seemed like a good bet.  Our seat was next to the kitchen and was extremely busy/noisy.  In fact the whole experience was \"chaotic\" as the wait staff did their best to avoid each other all night and we had a baby at the table next to us.  If we would have closed our eyes, we would have sworn we were at Applebee's.  I agree with others that their service is fast, but our meal felt rushed.  We weren't even done with our salads when our entrees arrived.  The food itself was not par for the pricing.  The steaks were bland and very fatty, even the Filet.  For a $92 dinner for two before tip, we were extremely disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Heard this place was previously a brothel so naturally had to go scope the place out. Made a reservation for 5:30 and was instantly seated so pleased 10/10. Food came out very quickly with a delightful flower presentation. Waitress advised that the flower was edible! Ordered the steak off the specials and was pleased with the cook of the steak as well as the house special potatoes. Salsa on the mahi mahi could have been more plentiful."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for Corkscrew, but sadly it did not turn out to be an enjoyable experience. In town visiting friends and chose Corkscrew based on Yelp.  Our waitress was clearly distracted and a bit aggravated. Ordered an app that never came. Ordered veal schnitzel but they were out. Ordered the duck with risotto and it came to the table surprisingly fast. Too fast. The duck didn't cook long enough to render all the fat and make it crispy. Any crispiness was lost in the cherry sauce. Duck as a result was chewy. Risotto was VERY undercooked. Not just a little under or al dente - grossly, almost raw rice undercooked.   I wanted to tell the waitress but didn't want to wait for another order while my company ate theirs.  My wife's scalloped potatoes were bland and under-seasoned. Don't these chefs taste their food before serving?  So while the location is lovely, the food was not good at all. We'll likely not be back when we visit again."}
{"text":"The Corkscrew Saloon is an experiment in duplicity. On the one hand, it is situated in a beautiful Victorian setting with quaint rooms leading to an intimate dining experience. On the other hand, it also has the look of a creepy haunted house with a little bit of dive bar grunge. Confused?  Intrigued?  I wasn't sure either.  The menu was concise with some daily specials and about 10 to 15 main dishes to choose from. I ordered the rack of lamb with couscous off the regular menu and my date ordered the prime rib with mashers from the specials.   Started with a glass of pinot noir from the wine menu. Got the house, which was just OK and not worth 6 bucks a glass. The bread came out next. Warmed straight out of the nearest giant eagle freezer bag. And the butter came in those individual packets. Does this annoy anyone else when you are presented butter in this fashion at a white tablecloth restaurant. With these markups, can't you pay some high school kid to scrape it into a serving dish. But I digress.  We ordered the Boursin stuffed mushrooms for the app with a side of horseradish sauce. How do you deep fry mushrooms and manage to keep them cold and wet inside the boring and unseasoned breading?   The main course arrived and my date's prime rib was just OK. Not served with au jus or horseradish. Just adequately cooked meat with uninspired mashers. My rack of lamb arrived with about six bones. Though I ordered medium rare, each bone was cooked to it's own level of doneness ranging from raw to medium well. No excuse for this lack of quality. The couscous tasted pretty good but was a bit stiff. Still, it was the best thing on the plate.   I will continue to be single as long as I continue taking my date to places like this."}
{"text":"Was not a pleasant experience. I went there for Valentines Day. I ordered a regular salad which was an okay price. The waitress asked me if I wanted just the salad or if I wanted to add chicken to it as well. She didn't mention any change in price when she asked this. When I got the check, the few pieces of chicken I did get added up to an additional $10 which was more than the actual salad itself. The chicken was also dried out and plain. I didn't even finish it because the salad was just not good after that. The total for my course alone was roughly $18 for regular lettuce and dried out chicken. Would not recommend and will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out for an anniversary dinner. We sat upstairs and Tiffany was our server. Immediately we felt as if our server was overwhelmed as she didn't even acknowledge us for about 10 minutes. She wasn't over the top friendly and her presence felt very rehearsed and rushed.   We ordered the scallops Rockefeller which were delightful. We then proceeded to share a salad before entrees.....when the salads arrived the dressing appeared to be a balsamic. We questioned our server because the menu described the salad coming with a Gorgonzola dressing...she noted it was balsamic....we then brought to her attention what the menu described and she immediately blamed the kitchen.  Overall, we felt the entrees weren't well thought out.....for example; serving Hawaiian  tuna with scalloped potatoes?  At any rate, we weren't blown away with the food and the service wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Medina.  I always order the lobster ravioli which is usually so light and delicious. The last time we went for my daughter's birthday, the ravioli were not the same. I pasta used for the ravioli was different. Maybe a squash and it didn't pair well with the lobster stuffing. It was too heavy with the lobster and the blush sauce. Otherwise, everything else was delicious as we all shared tastes!"}
{"text":"Really great food!  I've never gotten to eaten upstairs yet (normally with company who can't do stairs well) but downstairs is very nice.  I've found the lunch menu is reasonably priced, but the dinner menu, although more expensive, has many more delicious choices!  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  The house itself is an amazing structural masterpiece and has a very interesting history."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing and the atmosphere was pretty fun. We were a party of 4 and each of us loved our meals.  Pricey but everything was fresh. Made a great date night location.  Not really ideal for young children."}
