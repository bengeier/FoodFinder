{"text":"The hot dogs were large and tasty. The disappointing part is the generic milk shakes. They have nothing special about them in anyway. For a place that advertises shakes I expected more for the outrageous price for what seemed like shakes from a bag. I was amazed it was cheaper to get real shakes at Mitchell's."}
{"text":"First things first, this place tries to be a \"gourmet\" (if you want to call it that) five guys burger and fries. When I went I had a burger and fry, I took it to go, and by the time I got home the bottom of the bag was practically ripping from grease. Once you start eating it, the grease practically poured from the sandwich. The fries were pretty good and the burger wasn't to bad either. Would I go back? Probably not. And for once reason (other than the greasiness) the prices are just a bit high. I'd rather go to five guys any day of the week compared to this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Double Double w cheese I had in my opinion this is way better than Five Guys. My only minor complaint is that the meat is a little over seasoned but other than that the burger and fries were good I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not too good, but the food is decent... The customer service is what mainly sucks about this place... I ordered online and when I went to pick up my order it was completely empty inside but nobody even greeted me or asked if I needed help ordering... I mean u have nothing to do but this girl just stared at me for a solid like 5 minutes while i stood at the pick up counter. I mean come on you can do better than that MOOYAH... The food was okay, a little messy and greasy but what can u do its a burger and fries. Might come back again but hopefully the customer service is better Next time.."}
{"text":"Went there with my family on a sunday night around 7pm.  we waited at least 15 minutes for our food after ordering -- the wait was really ridiculous.  do not go here if you are in a rush.  they do have good burgers, they are thin and unusual - excellently seasoned.  there are a lot of extras you can add, I added bleu cheese and bacon and French fried onions to my burger.  the fries were OK, not very crispy but OK."}
{"text":"Wow what a horrible experience.  Here are the highlights  Staff poorly trained and unmotivated to work...standing around, picks stray fries up off counter and throws on food trays, socializing while many people waiting.  No hustle.  The food was expensive.  I spent $15 on a salad with turkey burger and a shake.  Turkey burger should be renamed salt burger.  I ate the rest of the salad though and it was fine, but not worth the price.  I was even charged 70 cents more for cheese on my $9 salad.   The decor was nice.  The milkshake was fine, but the huge straw was weird.  Not worth $5 though."}
{"text":"Good burger with your choice of an artisan bun or whole wheat. Yummy shakes in many flavors we ordered three mint choc chip, chocolate and strawberry banana all good. Served with big fat straws whipped cream and a cherry. Fries with some extra seasoning added.  How about some tater tots? Onion straws for your burger plus about 17 other toppings. Choice of American, Cheddar, Blue Cheese plus one other I don't remember can be added for $.70. 2 single burgers, 3 little moos/small shakes and one small fry....$25.74. Friendly manager working the line answering menu questions. Five Guys better watch out with their one bun and one cheese. No peanuts at Mooyah but sheets to color and crayons are on the tables. Good luck and welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and perhaps the most fantastic fries anywhere! Bit pricey, and inconsistent customer service though.  The food at Mooyahs has hit the spot every time! I have always ordered one of their signature/featured burger selections and loved every one. They also have a large assortment of toppings so you can have your burger made your way. Signature items like their potato roll buns, amazing Mooyah sauce, and fantastic fries set them apart from the average burger joint. They have good looking salads too, but I'm sure I will never try them since if I'm at a burger joint I'm surely getting a burger!  It is a bit more expensive than similar burger joints. They do have a great rewards app to compensate a bit. I got a free burger for downloading app and have received various offers to earn bonus points or freebies.  Dining room is a bright, clean, casual atmosphere. The customer service I've experienced has been inconsistent. Most visits the staff was very friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and fast. One visit though the entire staff was quite the opposite, seeming quite unhappy to be there and taking nearly twice as long to process my order. Overall my positive experiences far outweigh the sub-par one.  Definitely worth stopping in anytime your burger cravings are calling."}
{"text":"I gave this place a chance to adjust, and wanted to try something different to make up for my last experience, and hope Mooyah could redeem itself. Well, it didn't do any good.  The burgers are so damn greasy it's almost criminal. You can expect your tray to be covered in grease. You can also taste it. I would bet the beef they use is more fatty, and I would think all the new employees (who seem like just kids) really have no concept of cooking skills and just ignorantly think \"the more oil the better!\". No. Just no.  I ordered, and made it very clear to them to not put ANY seasoning on ANYTHING. The dude cashing me out was very confused on that simple request and had a bit of apprehension as to how to do it. Not that hard, you make a note, or you turn around and tell them. Whatever.  I got the mint chocolate chip ice cream. I was really put off seeing this green clear liquid on the outside of my lid. Doesn't seem to be legit MCC ice cream if your using either green food coloring, or some kind of liquid mint. Either way it's really lame and completely ruined any credibility Mooyah has about offering quality milkshakes.  My food arrived, an item was missing, and my cheese just tasted off. Whatever. I couldn't taste very much with all that damn grease! Hoping to fix the over seasoning issue myself, it didn't help with the whole mess of a burger being either too fatty, too greasy, or a combination of both.  My stomach didn't feel good after, and not happy i spent 13$ for shit AGAIN, but, I'm sleeping better at night knowing that I am never returning to mooyah. I approached it differently and gave it another chance, and it just doesn't work."}
{"text":"Just go to five guys down the street. If you really want a milkshake, go to chick-fil-a. Milkshakes are overpriced, burgers are eh."}
{"text":"Burgers are huge but the flavor is just average - better than fast food mega joints but not as good as Five Guys. Also, very expensive. The fries were so-so. The milkshakes were very good. I'll go back one more time to see if it's any better once they've settled into this new store, but they are  not very impressive right now."}
{"text":"I like this place i go once a week and they make me feel like family, Manager Zach is awesome very helpful and nice. Burgers are juicy love the bouble mooyah burger."}
{"text":"just ate at mooyah and I'm very irritated at we were treated when we came in to order. The food was fabulous by the way I enjoyed my burger and fries very much my wife enjoyed her Shake. The guys who brought our food we're very polite. But (Katelynn) who took our order seem to be bothered by life as she knows it her hand in her face the whole time we are taking our order it took everything in me and my wife did not walk out of the place at that point but we really wanted a burger so we stuck it out. it's really interesting that in today's day and age customer service seems to be so lackluster everywhere you go.  Forgot to add the fact that the floor is so greasy my wife and were slipping all over like it was a freaking skating rink.... I need to put down a sacrificial wipe mat for the cook's as a walk from the line."}
{"text":"Went to Mooyah this afternoon and I would say my star rating of \"Meh ... I've experienced better\" holds true.  Two of us each had a single burger, split a medium fry and each had a shake.  $26 total which I felt was a bit expensive.  A reviewers point is very true - they tend to \"nickel and dime\" you for some add-ons which could make your burger in the end quite expensive.    An interesting point that I caught as soon as I was ordering - the gentleman who was loading the raw dough onto the cookie sheets for baking was not wearing gloves.  If your operation is going to be in clean view of the customers I would recommend your operating procedures being crisp and clear.  Mooyah has a numbering system where you get a number upon ordering and they bring the products to your table.  As reviewers indicated, the shakes come out well in advance of your food.  I had a large vanilla and my daughter a small chocolate.  My shake was incredibly bland - I will go on record as saying it was the worst vanilla shake that I have ever had.  A sip of my daughter's chocolate was much better.  She loved the texture of the shake - note a reviewer indicated that is like a McFlurry.  The cashier who was exceptional gave us 2 small water cups.  Again, just as a reviewer commented there was NO ice coming out of the drink machine.  The burgers were ok but I would agree with all the other comments - greasy and overly salty.  I had the Mooyah sauce on mine and I honestly could not tell what it tastes like - it wasn't evident.  I will say the fresh baked buns were probably the hit.  Fries were good - fresh hand cut.  I liked them possibly better than 5 Guys.  By looking at the unprofessionalism of the staff (constantly messing around in plain view of the customers), I'd gather this place pays their employees next to nothing and provides no training.  Final verdict - I'd go to 5 Guys next time.  Will I ever go here again?  Probably ... it's a once a year type place.  I am very surprised that they have so many stores overall.  I am surprised by that as the experience was mediocre.  I'm guessing stores in other states must be much better."}
{"text":"I usually like to leave a nice, thorough review of establishments I visit highlighting the pros and cons like I did with my previous review, but this place...There isn't a single compliment I can spare.   There has been zero improvement since the last time I was here. The food is awful and the management is even worse. If you like your burger dripping in grease and tasting like it was marinating in a vat of salt before hitting the stovetop, this place is for you. Eating one half of a burger would give you hypertension.   I know it's a newer establishment, but come on, management needs to learn how to treat its patrons better.  The managers need to take a lesson in kindness and hospitality.   This place needs some help fast. Will be avoiding Mooyah like the plague."}
{"text":"Burger and shakes are tasty. A bit too greasy for me, but still good. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  If you like pancakes for burger patties be my guest!  The food was not only horrible, the service was too! The workers seemed miserable, like they didn't want to be there!  I'll stay with brown bag burgers or five guys!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Thursday night. Line wasn't long but its apparent that the cashier is still learning the system.  As for the food, it was OK. I had a double cheese burger with grilled onions, regular fries, and an oreo shake. The burger was very greasy and I think it was due to the grilled onions. I was pretty disappointed with the taste as it was pretty bland. The fries were pretty good, comparable to five guys. The shake was good. Consistency more if a mcflurry, thick at first but softens.  Prices are on par with other burger joints but the burgers were disappointing. I'll make the extra 2 min drive to 5 guys and stop on they way back for a shake."}
{"text":"Most overly priced burger place I've experienced, My total came to $17 due to me ordering a double cheeseburger, fries, and a drink. When I received my Burger the meat was falling apart, plus extremely bland and greasy (poor quality meat, something you'd receive from save-a-lot) the best thing about this place are their multicolored straw selection. Definitely not recommending."}
{"text":"This place does what it promises. It provides you with a unique burger with choice of toppings, cheeses, condiments, etc. They also have black bean burgers and turkey burgers, which I will come back to try. They have a variety of milkshake flavors (banana was delicious). And fries, sweet potato fries, and loaded fries. They also have salads and other choices. I really like this concept, and I'm sad to see so many negative reviews because it was delicious, the service was very friendly and prompt, and the whole atmosphere just made me smile.   Sure, it's messy, but messy can be good...right? ;)"}
{"text":"Very good burgers! Fries are okay. Service if average and prices are soft of high. Recommend their shakes!"}
{"text":"The environment is clean the staff is friendly, though a bit unprofessional (you get the impression that someone started hiring all there friends.)  the food is pretty tasty and there are so many options but the burgers are too greasy and the shakes a bit too frothy ( not thick enough for the half inch wide straw )  I'm giving it four stars but a burger small fry and a shake shouldn't run almost twenty bucks, and forget s healthy salad option at 9 bucks !!  ... Hopefully they drop their prices so I can eat here more often!!"}
{"text":"Mooyah has been hit or miss for me. I will start off by saying that the service has always been excellent, especially for a fast food place. They are polite and helpful at the ordering counter, and they even come out to check on you while you're eating.  I've been to this location 3 times now.  First time, I wasn't pleased with the food. The burger was way too greasy and I found the metal trays the food was served on to be dirty like they hadn't washed them between customers. However on my most recent two trips, I noticed everything was cleaner and the burger was even better as well.  Also, their strawberry milkshake -- yum."}
{"text":"Seriously not good at all. And to top it off, the customer service was horrible. I'm not sure how this place is still in business. Save your money."}
{"text":"Not great. I was craving something sweet and got a shake but it was just meh. Burger was nothing to write home about.   Staff is nice.  However if you want a nice quick burger you are better off going somewhere else for cheaper likely."}
{"text":"So Mooyah is a Texas based chain and I read online that they want to open 5-8 of these places across Cleveland in the next 5 years, but I really hope they don't do this.  I stopped by this new fast-food joint on a laid-back Sunday evening and when I walked in I was greeted 3 times \"Welcome to Mooyah!\". A bit of an overkill, but thanks for the welcome. The interior was clean with plenty of tables and a get your own soda dispenser. The staff was comprised of 7 teenagers and 2 adult managers. I can only assume it was a training day for them all to be there because there were only a couple customers. I placed my order and was given a plastic card with a number on it for when they call my to-go order up.   I started off with a plain single burger on an \"Artisan\" white bun at $5.69 then added blue cheese .70¢, bacon .99¢, and lettuce. That's a total of $7.38 for a single bacon cheeseburger. So the burger, I'd actually call this a meat pancake because it was pressed out so thin and was bigger than the bun. Also, the meat was salty and way over cooked. One side of the burger had a hardened crust from being on the grill so long and the meat was completely dried out, which is weird seeing as how there was a ton of grease on the packaging. Not a lot of blue cheese - only tasted it in the center of the burger,  and for that .99¢ I got one strip of bacon broken into a couple pieces. The good here was the lettuce - they didn't skimp on it and it was fresh and crisp.   The small fries come in at $2.49 but actually seem like a large amount that you could share. However I shared mine with the garbage can as they were over seasoned and over cooked. I'm not talking golden and crispy here, I'm talking brown and dried out. Very disappointing. I ate about 1/4 then threw the rest away. The spicy ranch sauce I used to dip a few fries in was good though.   Small oreo milkshake $3.49. It was good with whip cream and a cherry on top, I liked that it was not as sweet as the oreo shake at Burger King. My complaints here are that they immediately make your milkshake so it's done and melting while the rest of your food cooks even though you asked for it to-go. So no lid and several times I had to wipe up dipping milkshake from my hands and from wherever I set down the cup. Also if you want to substitute crushed oreo's instead of the chocolate chips in the mint milkshake that will cost you .70¢ more.   I'm sorry but I just can't support this place, the food was not that good and to me it's overpriced for the quality they serve. Usually I try to give places a second shot, but I have no desire to come back to Mooyah. Just go to Five Guys or Bearden's or pay more and get a \"gourmet\" burger from Flip Side. *Side note: I noticed a lot of 5 star reviews from people who have no picture, no friends, and haven't reviewed other businesses... Now 7 of these reviews have been hidden by Yelp so far, but it still makes me really weary that something shady is going on. If you sell a good product you won't have to write fake glowing reviews."}
{"text":"This was my daughter's and myself first time here, and it will not be our last. I had the Mooyah Burger and added toppings my daughter had the Black Bean on Iceburg Veggie Burger. We also had the Sweet Potato Fries,  I've had sweet potato fries before but theirs were different it has this season that makes it extra yummy. Even though my daughter wanted avacado on hers they couldn't because the avacados were black, the service was a bit slow thats because they just opened,  Im pretty sure it will be faster once they get a hang of things."}
{"text":"Well I guess let me ruin the trend of bashing. I've been here multiple times as my parents live close. This place is fast....it's good and pretty inexpensive.  Greasy?  Hell yes it's greasy and it's delicious.  Complaining about greasy burgers at a burger chain makes as much sense as nutritional ingredients on bottled water. These burgers aren't healthy but they taste great. Most places charge for stuff they add for free. Cheese and bacon are extra. Place is clean and people are friendly.  It's fast food without the drive through window. I think they offer salads but this is a burger chain. Bring me more Moo Yah"}
{"text":"Really very disappointed. Tried it today for lunch and honestly, I would rather go to Five Guys. Burger had no flavor other than greasy. The french fries were not done all the way and again greasy. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Saw the sign and clever name and wanted to try for a few weeks. Was not disappointed. More bang for your buck than Five Guys. More options, including a really tasty turkey burger. Also gives the option of sweet potato fries and milkshakes. And did I add that the burgers are really big too. A great places to stop in if you wanna scarf some grimace proportions and not spend a small fortune."}
{"text":"Im not a huge burger guy but during the last blizzard my daughter and I decided to stop and have lunch and take a break from the parking lot on I-90.  Place reminds me 5 Guys.  The Ohio, local thing has been beaten to death and I want to strangle myself though.  If stuff is coming from such a local place why does it cost more?  Guess its makes yuppies feel good.  We had a burger, sweet potato fries and mint chocolate kids shake.  All were awesome and came out fairly quick.  Big chalkboard wall thingy for kids to draw on.  We don't drink sodas but if that's your thing you can show your American gluttonous side and drink from the unlimited troth of sodas.  Don't know why people hating on this place.  Its fast, can be healthier (if you choose) and kid friendly.  Go have a 12 dollar bowl of lunch pho or some 9.00 Heady Topper battered cheese curds and leave the burgers and shakes to me then..."}
{"text":"Most reviewers are spot on about this place but either management hasn't looked at these reviews or doesn't care. It's a wanna-be Five Guys that has a slapped-together, cliche vibe. This is clearly not someone's passion business.   The \"Artisan\" buns are on par with a Grocery store bakery; nothing special. Greasy, flat, charred burgers. I ordered the Mooyah special (Big Mac copycat) and they DID NOT put sauce on it! Fries were cold and overcooked. The salt/spice mixture on the table was rock solid and barely came out of the shaker. They also forgot my nephew's chocolate milk. The staff seemed apathetic and lazy. One kid actually sat down to wipe tables. One star for the banana shake.   Way too pricey for the lack of quality. I'll stick with Five Guys."}
{"text":"I have never felt compelled to write a yelp review... HOWEVER. I just got back from Mooyah, I would love to tell you how my burger and fries tasted however I never got them. After 20 minutes of waiting for my food I finally went up to a manager today to ask if they had forgotten about my order. He said no, we are dealing with an online order. No apology, just kind of looked me in the face like \"deal with it\". I explained that I had to get back to work to which the manager told me to go to the register and ask for my money back at the front register then. I asked him if he was serious and was actually stunned that instead of fixing the problem he basically told me to F off and eat somewhere else. Another manager or owner guy saw i was upset and offered me a free burger on my way out. I literally have never been treated like this at a fast casual place before. I give a lot of grace to new restaurants but when its the manager acting like that then you have a problem from the top down.   Can't say I am even going to use this coupon, there is no way the burgers are that good. I am not eating lunch today now and was late back to work."}
{"text":"Uncomfortable truth #1- \"fast casual\" restaurants are just fast food for people who shop Target instead of Walmart.  Uncomfortable truth #2- we are very close to critical mass and market fragmentation in the fast casual segment.  That being said, Mooyah isn't bad. I had a double burger and fries. The burger patties were thin and well-done. They didn't look the best, but weren't the worst. The toppings were given geneously, and of decent quality.  The fries were crispy and had a good potato taste to them. Plus, malt vinegar.  Things were a bit salty, but not bad.  Mooyah is emblematic of the fact that the fast casual segment is running out of ideas. Don't expect it to set the world on fire, but it's still a decent meal."}
{"text":"First time having lunch there the other day, I will say, it is a really nice place! Cold as all get out in there but it is what it is! Food was great! Burgers were spot on!  Staff, well.....does anyone smile there or say hello or have a nice day, thank you, anything? The 4 people working looked absolutely miserable! It was not busy at all, we got up to leave after eating and said to the girl, have a good day and thanks (because she offered to take our trays) and the reply was, yep! Um, yep? How about \"Have a good day also\", or \"you also\"! Yep! Really! Customer service is huge and travels!  In this day in age, things can be much worse, put a smile on that face as if you are lucky enough to have a job and living a good life, no matter the circumstance!"}
{"text":"Tried Mooyah tonight for dinner with my hubby. He ordered a single burger with cheese, I ordered a veggie burger with cheese, and we split a milkshake and fries. It was $23 - that seemed a little pricey to me. You can put any veggies/sauce on the burger for free, so it's nice to load up.  My husband really liked his burger. He tried the Mooyah sauce which was similar to a thousand island and he really liked it.   I liked my veggie burger too. I added cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, fried onions and mayo. It had good flavor, but was a bit messy.   Our fries were pretty good. We had some with vinegar and some with some sort of salt/pepper combo spice they had on the table. We ordered a medium which said it was for 1-2 people and it was a lot, we didn't even finish them.  The cookie dough milk shake left a bit to be desired as it appeared to just be vanilla. Once we finished it, we found an over abundance of cookie dough at the bottom. I wish it would have been blended a little better.  Overall a good place for a quick bite to eat and less greasy than fast food places."}
{"text":"Very unorganized, no ice for soft drinks, very messy. 2 stars because the staff was very nice however, undertrained. Looks like an accident waiting to happen.  Hopefully will improve very soon."}
{"text":"I can't believe how bad a burger can get. Very greasy and that was the only thing I could taste. Not at all worth $8.00"}
{"text":"Despite poor reviews, I figured i'd give it a try anyways.  This place just isn't that good, everything tastes chemically engineered. Fake food. I feel bad for all the investors/franchisees that have obviously spent a lot of money on a place that won't last long.  *Update 12/8/16 - Gave this place a 2nd chance and it was much better"}
