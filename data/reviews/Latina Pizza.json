{"text":"Good pizza at a great price. The unique crust that's both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody, but our whole group liked it. The sauce is good too, light but with a good tomato flavor. 

The best thing about this place is the management. They went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast. And the prices: we fed everybody in under $40, with plenty of leftovers taken home."}
{"text":"I have eaten here my whole life. Great people and great food. I highly recommend their Italian hoagies. It's the only place I will eat one from.  All the food is delicious though."}
{"text":"Underated and ignored!  if you see this ol time pizzaria near Kennywood stop on by good crust nice and buttery in the sicilian style!  Better then DiSallas  the only thing I can say that is better then Latinas is Mineo's !  they say the best pizzarias are the little holes in the wall type places and this is one of those enviroments!  Small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon!  To just enjoy with yourself and a friend!"}
{"text":"I have been eating Latina's pizza since Al opened in around 1968. I ate pizza at his Mom and Dad's shop in Duquesne before that.  Al got their recipes and opened his shop after they closed.  I live in Jefferson Hills and there are plenty of pizza shops near my home but when I want pizza I make the 14 mile round trip to Latina's I have to agree with all the other reviewers. Great pizza, great price,wonderful friendly management,cozy atmosphere.  And the Italian hoagies are also outstanding.  You can't go wrong with any of their food and the prices are very reasonable. It's a shame more families visiting Kennywood Park don't realize it's there.  They could avoid the ridiculously overpriced food served at the park and enjoy much better food."}
{"text":"It's right by Kennywood; go here instead of eating the overpriced amusement park food. The capicola hoagie was"}
{"text":"My friend Kevin recently recommended this place to us.  He said it has \"the best pizza in the world.\"  We stopped here after a day at Kennywood and absolutely LOVED the pizza!  The edge crust is crunchy yet airy...absolutely fantastic.  The homemade sauce tastes fresh and tomatoey, and the cheese was rich and gooey.  My one daughter said \"It's so good...I can't stop eating it!\". 
     In addition to the excellent food, the service was outstanding.  The owner and his daughter were friendly and accommodating, and the fresh pizzas arrived at our table in a very timely manner.  To top it off, the two pizzas and 5 drinks were only around $25 and we had leftovers to take home.  
     We definitely plan on stopping here again the next time we are in Pittsburgh.  If you have not been here yet please do stop and enjoy some of their fabulous pizza! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent family owned pizza spot. The owners are so nice and always accommodating. The food is great and always what we expect. My daughter loves that they have tv in the dining area. The outside patio is decorated very well and its nice to sit outside for a few after you fill up on pizza. Great staff great food would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome product, family owned since 1967. Hand made pizza and a pizza sauce to die for. The Italian hoagies, sausage and meatball sandwiches all on hand mad rolls. Everything from scratch! You got to come and get you some , it is so good."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the first time I hate here, I absolutely hated the pizza. And I think it was because I was expecting something completely different than I got. Latina Pizza is very different from most pizza shops. Instead if a round thin crust pizza, this pizza is square, thick, and doughy. The crust is not really that good, but that is not why you get a pizza here. It's the homemade sauce. And that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive. 

The other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to Kennywood. So usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks. No lines, no waiting for tables, no outrageous prices. It's a time to recharge, and sometimes we feel like going back to the park,  other times we decide to go home."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, and all home made daily (the pizza shells, the hoagie rolls, and the sauce, that is.) 
It is a light, thin, crispy square Sicilian-style pizza, very different from most pizza shops, so it might not be what you're expecting, but it is very good!
The prices are great.
The owners are wonderful, warm and welcoming and friendly while they are working hard at making such a great product.
You know, Kennywood lets you leave and get your hand stamped to come back...It's a short walk to leave the park and come to Latina Pizza for a relaxing break and a money-saving option for a better pizza."}
