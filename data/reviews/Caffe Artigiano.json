{"text":"Just simply walking by this unassuming storefront, I would have no idea, that this place would slowly become my go-to spot for breakfast coffees and lunch. Opening for only a couple weeks, I've already been a repeated customer! 

Cafe Artigiano offers a selection of fresh local bakery pastries, and custom made beverages. With an open beverage bar area. I don't generally drink coffee, but the Spanish Latte (Condensed milk + espresso) was almost life changing. Fragrant, not too sweet, and not too strong.

In terms of food, the cafe has a selection of freshly made salads and sandwiches. Brie and Grilled Chicken is my favourite so far, but I am extremely biased towards anything with brie. All their meat is roasted inhouse, and their sandwiches are grilled nice and crispy.

The price tag is a bit steep, but highly recommended as a treat once in a while! :)"}
{"text":"Finally, a great coffee house in the financial district.  Forget the starbucks up the road.  It cannot compare when you try artigiano coffee.  I go out of my way and sometimes brave cold and wet just to get a decent latte.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming as well."}
{"text":"Amazing place for downtown business meetings. Very spacious and comfortable (and somewhat not discovered yet).

Love the cappuccino :)"}
{"text":"They lured me in with their offer of a free latte as a Grand Opening special.  I'll likely return and pay!  Priced similarly to Starbucks.

The latte I had was very nicely made, and the service was very friendly and welcoming.  This is their first Toronto location (apparently 14 others in Western Canada).  

Nice big space with ample seating.  

A decent spread of food is also available (croissants, sandwiches, fruit salads, desserts/pastries)."}
{"text":"I first visited Caffe Artigiano in Vancouver 3 years ago. That was my first foray foray into \"specialty\" (for lack of a better word) coffee and I've been hooked ever since. I was super excited to see them open here in Toronto and I was eager to see if it was as good as I remembered.

(1) The coffee: The espresso is strong and well balanced. The milk is steamed to the perfect temperature and the ratios of espress-milk-microfoam in the espresso-based drinks are spot on. Their Spanish latte is a must try.

(2) The ambiance: I love that it is bright, spacious, and there is plenty of seating. In addition to standard 2 - 4 person tables, there are large tables for communal gatherings and comfortable armchairs for relaxing. There is free WiFi and because it IS so spacious, you will never feel self-conscious for settling in for awhile.

(3) The people: Friendly. Unpretentious. Decent human beings (unlike some other cafes where the staff act like they're gods and you're just a plebe).

There are definitely places in and around downtown Toronto that serve more unique and interesting espresso roasts, but Caffe Artigiano offers coffee at a price comparable to Second Cup/Starbucks but at a higher level of consistency and quality. If you're downtown and looking for a good cup of coffee, Caffe Artigiano should definitely be on your radar."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee shop Downtown near King subway station. Very roomy inside and pleasant atmosphere. The coffee quality is excellent and they have organic milk as an option! The traditional cappuccino taste is pretty strong, but delicious. For those who prefer more milky drinks their Spanish Latte seems to be a good choice. Very fast WiFi connection and great seats too. The service is top-notch. One of my favorite spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Having experienced the the magic they pour in Vancouver this place is a welcome sight in this otherwise dead (java wise) stretch of downtown. I was caught by surprise when I saw the signs go up here for the Caffe as I hadn't heard anything on the foodie forum that they were opening a branch in TO. 
For starters the place is humongous. I did go at an off peak hour so they didn't seem that busy but from the looks of it they are are geared towards the downtown rush (with early closing hours to match). The desserts looked decent so will try those on the next visit. Now for the main attraction Cappuccino
Here is the verdict for the cappuccino
Espresso: Slightly burnt flavor (I enjoy that taste profile but there is something a miss here) 
Crema': Good
Milk: Frothed well
Latte Art: Good 
I would say 3 stars for the Cappuccino and depending on the taste profiles I mentioned I think one would like it better than the Dineen nearby. 
3.5 Stars all said and done."}
{"text":"I work just next door so I thought I'd check this new place out.  Had the regular brewed coffee a few times and I have to say it was actually pretty good.  Still have yet to try a latte though which looks like something they would be good at.  However, the price is a bit steep though to be honest.  I still cross the street to pick up a coffee at the usual place in the path which I will not name here to be fair to them =).

My main concern is that the pastries are just out in the open on display and there are quite a few flies around...the croissant I bought at 1030am was a bit dry already from being in the open all morning.  I think it'd be an extra star rated if they simply covered the pastries.

Space is a bit big but because they are still rather new, it looks a bit empty at times.  The renovation also wasn't complete when they opened.  I think that was a bit of a bummer because they could have finished up and made it really nice before opening.

Maybe I'll reassess in the near future as they are likely still making improvements..."}
{"text":"Everyone kept raving about Caffe Arigiano, so I finally decided to try it out on my way to work one day.  I'm so glad I did.  I walked in and everything had accents of red.  There was a huge line up and as I waited in line, I saw the Spanish Latte that sounded very appealing.  I asked the young lady that was taking my order, what the Spanish Latte was and she described it was two shots of expresso with condensed milk and I was instantly sold!  On top of that, she was so polite, knowledgeable and helpful. The Latte came up to $4 something but I can't express enough that it was the best latte I've ever tried and I definitely recommend it.  They even do coffee designs making it much more fancy and luxurious.  I've also had their dail soup special which was a butternut squash soup as well as their cheddar and chive scone, which were also very delicious.  Definitely check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Looking for an alternative to Starbucks?  Look no further than these guys from Vancouver, BC.  Inside, it looks like your typical Starbucks but 1-larger space, more tables, more elbow/leg room 2-painted red instead of green 3-lower prices 4-staff very laid-back, customers don't feel rushed to place orders.   Spanish Latte is their signature drink and it was delicious; they use condensed milk so it is already perfectly sweetened as served.  Also their espresso beans are not roasted nearly as dark as Starbucks so if you don't like the \"burnt\" taste of the Green Monster's espressos, Artigiano will be a pleasant experience for you. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Randomly happened upon this place while walking by looking for a non-Starbucks coffee alternative. Had a Spanish Latte (for the first time) and it was incredible. Highly recommended. Knowledgable \"Im a coffee guy\" staff also."}
{"text":"This is a great place at Toronto downtown if you want to sit down, unwind and have a coffee. I personally like this place as I can have work meetings as it is less noisy and there is a lot of room (space). The coffee is great. It's one of the best kept secrets of Downtown Toronto and a place that is so unlike a Starbucks. If you are a tourist and want to sit down and relax, do give it a shot and if you are a biz executive, have your next coffee meeting here!"}
{"text":"was confused by traditional and house cappuccino was told the thickness of the foam varies . It's always exciting to have a artisan coffee shop In financial district . They established in Vancouver and fairly new to Toronto . But interesting they choose downtown financial district to branch out .  Not sure how many artisan coffee shops open its door last year but I'd say there are many !!!! Very happy to see this as for a coffee snob sort of .  I don't even bother to make coffee at home any more.  

It's a Italian artisan caffe which is interesting , other than illy haven't had chances to try Italian coffee shop. Their house cappuccino is reasonable priced. Italian as it is the espresso in my cappuccino is strong and powerful .   A good amount variety of pastries and lots of seating area with a sleek Italian flair . But different than those funky coffee shops it's more of a corporate feel to it ."}
{"text":"Best Coffee Shop in the downtown Toronto Financial District, hands down! 

But it has been closed for unknown reasons without warning!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the coffee shops near young and King! I love their lounge music in the back ground along with hazelnut Rooibus Tea which is the best in town!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite cafes downtown. Really great place to meet with people or to do some work. There is a lot of space; however, it does get busy during the afternoon when people need their second cup of coffee. The staff there is very welcoming and helpful. They will introduce you to all of their special blends and provide recommendations. 

The pricing is comparable to that of Starbucks; however, I like the coffees here a lot more. Highly recommended to all the coffee drinkers in the financial district!"}
{"text":"it's here!!!!! it's here!!!!!!

finally, after years of waiting, caffe artigiano has come to toronto!!!! all hail the spanish latte!!!!!

worthy of an all-caps review!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim for afternoon coffee one day and I was very pleased! Had the Spanish latte and it was on the sweeter side, but I liked it that way. The baristas were very helpful (and talented at latte art!!) and recommended a coffee drink for my non-coffee-drinking (because she doesn't like how coffee tastes) friend. They successfully converted her with a hazelnut latte. This place would be 5/5 if they had cozier furniture and were PATH accessible. Coffee is on point, will definitely be back! Especially when it gets warmer!"}
{"text":"Recently went to Caffe Artigiano on a Saturday afternoon. I had heard about this coffee chain from Vancouver and was curious to try the Spanish Latte (latte made with condensed milk). The cafe is beside the Shoppers Drug Mart on Yonge (by King). It was moderately busy when I went with many tables available. 

My boyfriend and I both got Spanish lattes and I got a chocolate banana muffin. The Spanish lattes were sweet enough and the beans they used were decent so I didn't need to add any more sugar. The muffin was not moist (maybe perhaps because it was sitting out on the counter?). One problem I had was that the baked goods were out in the open on display. Although I understand that this may look good, I also saw flies flying around the food (is unsanitary). 

I would go back for the Spanish latte only."}
