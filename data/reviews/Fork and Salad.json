{"text":"I wrote a review when this restaurant first opened, saying it was fairly expensive and I probably wouldn't be back. But...it's just so good. I've back back an embarrassing amount of times since then, so I'll rewrite my review. 

This place is still expensive, but it's delicious and you get huge portions. However, it seems SO dependent on who makes your salad. I'll go in one day and get a perfectly portioned, well made salad, and then I'll go in the next day and get a giant bowl of lettuce with a couple onions in it. Half the time they forget to add at least one of the ingredients and I always feel a bit bad asking for it (even though it's written on the menu as being part of the salad.) 

I wish it were a bit cheaper, although I understand why it isn't, but I just wish all the employees would be on the same page about how to make the salads and ensure that all the ingredients are making their way in. I'm sure I'll keep coming in though because I'm hooked at this point."}
{"text":"Employees are passionate about what they do, great food, and large portions! Had the Thai One On salad but switched shrimp for tofu. It was spicy and amazing!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here because it's close to my work and the salads look great online. However:

1. The salads are massive, but that's not a good thing. It's mostly lettuce and it throws the vegetable/dressing ratio off so badly that if you get light dressing it doesn't taste like anything. Just a giant bowl of plain lettuce.

2. The dressings taste very watered down and the toppings are sparse and overpriced

If you are going to try it out, go for heavy or medium dressing."}
{"text":"Came here after a day at the spa and got the trout and kale salad with sesame seeds and ginger soy dressing. The salad was big but not much taste. It was 16 dolllars and feel.like more could have been  added. There are more salad places that I would goto before trying this one again."}
{"text":"Everyone likes their salads differently. I will say although pricey these salads are massive, as such I had to spread it over lunch and dinner. Secondly, also very dependant on how you like your salad, ask for half dressing or on the side because I feel like I ate half a bottle of ranch and it wasn't pleasant. I had the \"Home on the Range\" salad, the Jicama is really funky not sure if I would let them put it in next time and definitely half the ranch. The girl in front of me got the Avacobbo, she said it was her fav and I think I will try that next time."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. I bought a breakfast bowl as well as a salad for later. The price is a little higher, but it's totally worth it for something quick and healthy! Gonna be coming here a lot more frequently!"}
{"text":"OUTRAGEOUS PRICES. Not only was my salad $16+, a small bag of chips was $4?  I paid for my friend who wasn't aware of the price. $8 on 2 small bags of chips?  Sorry, that's a rip off. I should have returned them. My fault. But Comon now.  Good thing I got two ice waters!  Total price for 2 salads, no drinks, and two small bags of chips?  $41.00.  What a joke. Salad wasn't good either. Warm turkey on a salad?  Should be cold. 

Not a great experience."}
{"text":"I got the weekend escape drink and little miss sunshine yogurt and I have to say - it was a disappointment. This place is very pricey and not very good. The drink was chunky like it wasn't blended all the way and the yogurt was all mashed up and not very appetizing in appearance. Both items tasted about average, so I gave this place 2 stars"}
{"text":"I'll start of with staying I really WANTED to like Fork and Salad. There aren't enough healthy food options in Calgary. However, to my dismay - I completely agree with the first two reviews. It is expensive and the salads are bland and underwhelming. Although it seems like you get good value as they are huge ... sadly, the lack of toppings, seasoning and lack of dressing make it hugely disappointing - you may as well buy a bag of spinach and kale from Safeway and eat it straight. 

I know they opened only recently, but I hope they make some quick corrections otherwise I don't see it lasting."}
{"text":"I like a lot about Fork and Salad and feel it has great potential. The salads are massive- I've been there several times now and have yet to be able to finish one.The \"house made ice tea\" aguas frescas are delicious and something Calgary needs to see more of. But this is the thing: I got a make-your-own-salad last time and something seemed...missing. Ingredients were fresh and lovely but there was till a dullness to it. Then it hit me: SALT. This salad, to which I had added a hard boiled egg and avocado - two ingredients that really need salt- was underseasoned. So I went to the counter and asked the manager if I could get some salt. He informed me that \"we have no salt in this restaurant.\" NO SALT!

Look, folks, I just had a fantastic lunch at Coup and we noted that there were indeed those shakers of pepper and poisonous salt on the table. We didn't die. Salt isn't a demon and in the same way you allow customers to decide their level of dressing, you should at least allow them the OPTION of a few grains of salt.

Salt, please. Just a little salt."}
{"text":"Great fresh healthy food! I love how they gave all the nutritional information and ingredients listed. The prices might seem a bit high until you see the giant portions"}
{"text":"I continue to try to support this place and am disappointed time and time again. The salads are good, however very expensive. So it's a treat when we do decide to grab a few for lunch or dinner. 
What kills me is the consistently poor service. For an often quiet spot, the staff are regularly rude and rushing you through. 
Sorry, I've had my last Fork and Salad."}
{"text":"$2.00 for adding olives to a salad because they are considered seasonal....seriously? Opening a can is considered seasonal? Still shaking my head. This place used to be good but it's gone downhill and the prices have gone up. Bread is now an additional charge and the salad I got had merely the bases of romaine lettuce (no leafs). Quite disappointed as I used to be a regular customer given Good Life is right there."}
{"text":"Haha I'm sorry, but NO.
$15 for a SALAD?? I thought I was seeing things, but as I didn't have time to go anywhere else I bit the bullet and ordered, expecting the most amazing salad I have ever encountered.
I ordered the Home on the Range, took it and left for work. When I got to the office, starving, and opened this thing up, I was so disappointed. Mostly iceberg lettuce and mostly....LETTUCE. Looked like pressed chicken breast, no char or flavor whatsoever. The vinaigrette was tasteless.
These salads are worth $5 max. You can go almost anywhere on 17th Ave and get a sit down, full plated meal for $15-$20.
Fork and Salad....who do you think you are? lol.
Please, go somewhere else. Do not spend your hard earned cash here. They must be laughing as we walk out the door with our head of iceberg and empty wallets."}
