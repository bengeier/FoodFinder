{"text":"Had this place as a bookmark for some time and was in the area recently so decided to try it out. Walked in for an order and decided on pizza and wings. Must say the wings are massive and decent. Only problem I would say is that the wings were a bit dry. The pizza also wasn't nothing to write home about. Considering the price which in my opinion was on the high side, this place is not worth it. Must say the wait time for a walk in order was about 25 minutes not that bad. Ordered chicken on the pizza and I must admit the pieces of chicken were good size and they didn't skimp on the toppings.  Maybe I'll give them another try"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a \"great\" pizza and finally found one!  Needed to buy pizza for my daughter's birthday party and took a chance on Yelp and found JP's.  And I'm glad I did.  The crust is a great balance of chewy/crunchy and they are VERY liberal with the amount of toppings.  What makes this place all the better is the owner, JP, was working hard taking care of his customers!  Friendly, courteous and genuine.  A great combo.  Will be ordering all my pizza from here from now on."}
{"text":"Way overpriced! $25 for a medium half meat lover half Mediterranean pizza that was overdone and tasted average at best."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Mississauga by far.  I am a serious pizza lover and best pizza I've ever had was in Boston Massachusetts.  this is the only place that I order from Mississauga."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The crust was nice and thin, and it was loaded with an amalgamation of fresh toppings . The owner even called me to ask how I liked the pizza, and thanked me for being nice to the driver. An around great experience."}
{"text":"This is simply the best pizza in the Mississauga area! The chicken wings are similar to Chaps wing! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Really like the pizzas here.  Even the simple cheese pizza is excellent.  They also do delivery.  We definitely prefer it over other chain restaurants.  They also offer halal meat options."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered JP`s the pizza was pretty good. However, I ordered it a few weeks ago and was quite disappointed. The pizza tasted very bland and there was nothing special about it what so ever. considering this was $26 for a large pizza, I certainly expected a lot more. Definitely inconsistent in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Fast service. I wish they had better deals but I don't mind paying that much for a good pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! Why 1 star?  Let me tell you.    I had previously been coming here and ordering off their menu, always ordering their specials with multiple items.  One day I walk in and the owner tells me that they no longer have specials, meaning the price is higher! And quite a bit higher too!  I could tell from the look on his face he expected me to just take it up the a§§ and order anyway, but I told him no thanks! I mean I have to think of my family and the value I need in the food I buy.  The owner was surprised when I walked out.  This is one place off my 'go to' list of places."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, drove from Milton as we have nothing close to a pizza place, Crust was perfect, slight crunch, toppings fresh as well as sauce, nothing frozen,"}
{"text":"Food was decent however a little pricey $70 for 2 large and 14 wings."}
{"text":"We visited this place a few weeks back after reading the reviews on Yelp.  The pizza was good, but not the best I've ever had as the owner promised.  Nothing extra special and the price is higher than other places.  This place isn't in my neighbourhood so I don't think I will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Heard like the hype, was looking forward to a good pizza. Disappointed, nothing special, will not try again."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent piece of pepperoni pizza at JP's pizzeria. Great value great food and the staff are really friendly"}
{"text":"Not bad for a neighbourhood shop.  The staff was friendly. The order was ready on time as promised. I was honestly hoping to be pleasantly surprised by a high quality pizza given some of the reviews but I feel it was just a typical average Ontario pizza. If they can improve on the crust and toppings they may have a repeat customer. Remember quality and consistency are what bring the customers back."}
{"text":"We don't order Pizza that often, but when we do it's always @jppizzeria  Absolutely the best!!!  Order one of his signature pizzas, you won't be disappointed. Jp's favourite, it's awesomeness at its best."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery here for the first time today and when i called i guess they were busy because i felt rushed ordering and gave me a bit of attitude when i wanted to pay cash. I just wanted to make sure the driver had change jeez.   Anyways we ordered the large JP favorite pizza and it was good but not like amazing. It felt tasteless so i had to eat 3 slices to feel full. It cost us $35 including tip. Pretty pricey i would have hoped it was amazing.   We'll probably try again in the future but order something different to really see if it has flavour."}
{"text":"The pizza had no sauce and hardly any ham on it.  I would not recommend this place. Blah"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Best in mississauga! Owner was awesome! Eating the meat lovers right now for Noche Buena! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Today was my first experience at JP Pizzeria. We received excellent service! The cashier gave us free dipping sauce when he realized it was our first time at the restaurant.. Although the service is great, it's definitely the quality of the ingredients sets this place apart. We're definitely coming back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The pizza is about as great as cancer (and probably gave it to me too). I went in after hearing great things and was I greatly misinformed. I found that the pizza was not well made and did not seem all that fresh, the toppings were sparse at best, and the whole thing just seemed undercooked. What made the whole experience even worse is the POS owner/staff who was working and just a complete dick to me and the other person that was in there as well. Not sure how this place is still open if this is the experience that people are getting. I would rather go to the Middle East with nothing but a bible and cross to negotiate a peace treaty with ISIS than ever eat here again."}
{"text":"A descent pizza, i like the thin, flaky crust.. it's just the right thickness. The guy is friendly and accommodating. The place may be hard to find since it is tucked in a corner plaza in a residential area.. but it's worth a try"}
{"text":"First time ordering and the owner upgraded out medium to large for no charge just because! Great customer service! Bruschetta pizza was so flavourful and I suggest adding feta as we did. the vegetarian pizza had large pieces of onion peppers mushrooms and tomatoes and was tasty. I will order again but was a little taken aback by the $50 bill when I paid for the two mediums. worth it for a little extra authenticity"}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza place. I can honestly say they have probably the friendliest staff I have ever interacted with, which probably has a bit of an impact on the review I leave, but that is part of the whole experience. They make pretty good pizza, but I have ordered 3 pizzas from them and they made a few mistakes regarding topics on 2 of the occasions. That's why I've taken one star off. The pizza itself is good quality though and if you are nearby, it's worth stopping in and giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Love this pizzeria! Small place, not a chain, and full of personality.   Their pizza is really fantastic, the dough is nice and crispy at the bottom, and the sauce is made with good-quails to tomatoes. They definitely take the time to make the pizza sauce, because it tastes different than any other pizza place.   Very good stuff. Please give this place a chance, they are worth it."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend just moved to the neighborhood and decided to check out the best pizza in Mississauga, and thanks to the many reviews we tried JP's Pizzeria. I am a huge pizza lover, and I do have to say this is one of THE BEST pizzas I've ever had! The Large pepperoni is the one we had and it was amazing; not too hard or soggy, TONS of pepperoni, and the large was bigger than expected! We would definitely recommend the pizza to everyone."}
{"text":"Still hands down the best pizza I've ever had. John paolo aka JP is always very hospitable, offering us free drinks and smiles everytime we visit. Ordered a Medium which seemed like the normal large. An honest hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza I have had in a long long time if not ever. My five year old ate three slices for the first time to my surprise. You truly do get what you pay for in life. Sure I pay a bit more but I get ten times the value with fresh ingredients as close to home made as you're going to get. Looks like I found my new Pizza place for Pizza Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time on Wednesday and ate there again on Saturday! And I'm not normally a big fan of pizza!  Our family will be ordering here from now on, because it's the only pizzeria we can all agree on.  :)"}
{"text":"Well i gotta give this a 5.  The owner is friendly and made our pizza, but the quality ingredients speak for itself.  The pie was done right and not just good stuff on top but quality stuff on top.  Thats how you rock a pizza.  Now the wings.  I wasnt sure what to expect, but when these gigantic wings hit my mouth i knew i was going to have a very happy evening gnawing on these and watching the game.  Big time fan!  I will be back for sure.  That meat lovers pizza does not disappoint."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas around town! We ordered an XL 'The Super' pizza. It came with pepperoni, ham, mushroom, onions, green pepper, and bacon. The crust isn't very oily, which is much appreciated and the toppings are VERY generously spread over all the pizza.  We had also ordered buffalo style wings, and the wings were quite large and well dressed. There was just enough sauce and spicy enough to be called BUFFALO wings! Others at the table had tried their honey BBQ wings before and they commented that the buffalo flavour was significantly better than their honey BBQ. The honey BBQ was said to be way to sweet and overly saucy.  Although JP's isn't cheap, it's definitely well worth the cost if you're looking for good quality pizza. Definitely a returning type of restaurant!"}
{"text":"Man if only I didn't live in toronto, I would be here all the time! We happened to stop by JP Pizza because we were in the area one weekend for errands. Little family own shop with JP as the main pizza man. The Pizza here are a little bit on the pricier side but definitely worth it. They have a couple of specials.. we've tried their small 3 topping pizza and 2.25 pound wings for 29.99 and we also did their large 1 topping pizza, 2.25 pound wings, dipping sauce and two pop for 39.99. Both were on the pricier side but the pizza is so good. Crispy and done well done with the pepperoni super crunchy! They also use little pepperoni here (which i can't find at any other local pizza joints!) very flavourful from their sauce to the crust of their pizza. Their chicken wings are HUGE and sooo tasty. Deep fried to perfecting and their sauces are also so good. Hubby got the suicide and was dying cause it was so hot but so good.   JP you need to open a pizzeria closer to Toronto! Dine in is very very small.. maybe 4-5 bar stools so definitely meant to get take out (unless you are like us and live far and want to eat it super fresh!)"}
{"text":"Located in west Mississauga, this place serves an average pizza when made to its potential - but personally, it wasn't the best we've had, and we did find certain faults (that, to be fair, may have been anomalies to our order).  So we called ahead on a Saturday evening and ordered a Medium JP's Favourite for pickup (we asked to replace the sausage with chicken instead). They were totally accommodating with whatever we wanted to order, and agreed to any customization we wanted on our pizza - \"I can make whatever you want!\" he exclaimed excitedly over the phone.   However, the pizza itself had some strange issues. When we began eating the pizza, the first half was perfectly fine. But, the crust and bottom portion of the other side of the pizza was completely soaked - I'm not sure if the pizza was plonked on a wet surface prior to getting packaged into our box (but the pizza box was dry?), but regardless, half our pizza ended up being really and strangely soggy (which doesn't taste that great, let me tell you!). Also, I wasn't a fan of the chicken on the pizza - it tasted really rubbery to me (I had to douse it in srriacha to get rid of the taste). Not sure if the soggy and wet crusts were experienced by others, or if this was just an anomaly and a mistake made with our order, but regardless, it didn't taste great. Sadness - it's always a sad day when you're not happy with your pizza!   For a Medium JP's Favourite, we paid around $24.00. Pizza - 2 stars. Service - 3 stars (would have been a 4 if it weren't for our sad, soggy pizzas!)."}
{"text":"Foolishly went to JP again - result of having a bad memory.  I ordered a jumbo pepperoni pizza. They cheated.  The pizza had spots on the edges not covered with cheese, and where it was covered was rather sparsely covered.  The pepperoni was cut thinned, whereas when I went first time, it was delicious bc it was cut thick, not to mentioned plenty of cheese topping.  This place has really gone down. Another good establishment that lost its luster from complacency and taking customers for granted.   My three family members agreed that this tasted no better than $15 dollar pizza from franchise pizzeria.   I will never be back to this place again. ----------------- Went to JP Pizzeria over the weekend for my second visit.  I asked for the pizza by the slice.  They charged me $6.80 for a slice of meat lovers pizza.   What a disappointment.  The pepperoni was thinly sliced unlike the pizza I had here a week ago when I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and sausage.   Also on my meat lover's pizza slice, there were not any sausages.  I brought this to the attention of the owner who was working near the counter. He turned to me and nonchalantly says - on pizza by the slice there are no sausage.    This is very disappointing as there was clearly a picture of a meat lover's pizza on the menu display board with 4 toppings including sausage. And below the picture, they spelled out what the 4 toppings were.  Then I order the pizza by the slice, with the same name - The MEAT LOVER's Pizza.  And BAM, I get slapped on the face.  It is like being invited to a blind double date, and meeting the ugly sister right after you were shown a picture of glam model gal you were suppose to be meeting.   Boy was I fooled.    This is clearly a case of misleading advertisement.   JP Pizzeria - Another business that tries to get away with bait and switch tactic.    If the ingredients are different for SAME NAME item, they should clarify on menu.  Otherwise, they are engaging in a deceptive practice designed to predictably deceive customers.    I lost respect for this place.   I loved the pizza I ordered the previous week, and felt terrible about how they pulled a fast one on me today.   Especially bc I conversed with an owner about this experience, and he did not even pause for a second to express regret or apologetic for a very blatant deceptive practice.  He stated matter of factly that ingredients for pizza with same name is different, depending on whether you order by slice or whole pizza.  Besides, they skimmed on pepperoni and sauce as well on the pizza by the slice.  I will never order a pizza by the slice from here ever again.  I will come back for their regular pizza, but I lost my love for this place, even though I still have respect for their regular pizza.  I will try ordering another pizza from this place and see how that goes, and report back. -------Update on 08/21/2017:  I ordered a meat lover's pizza that was jumbo size, or what ever they called the largest pizza that was square shape.  It was about $37 dollars.  The pizza was burnt on the edges, and the meat they put on were very thinly sliced, unlike thick meats a year ago. The pizza was good for something that I would have paid less, like 20 bucks, but for almost 40 dollars, it was a disappointment.  This was truly my last time at JP.  Their quality has gone down over time, in terms of ingredients, skimming on ingredients, and how the pizza was made - burnt pizza.             22"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall pizza joint located in a strip mall on Mississauga's outskirts, just west of Tenth Line on Eglinton.  We ordered the medium special (1 topping 14\" pizza with 15 wings (2.25 lbs). This totaled to just under $40 tax-in. This seems a little pricy for a 1-topping medium pizza combo, but the wings were nice and substantial to compensate.  The pizza tasted pretty good fresh out of the oven. I particularly enjoyed their use of smaller pepperonis as they turned out extra crispy, to near bacon-like levels.  Overall I liked their food but I'm unlikely to return anytime soon as they're quite far from me. Those living in surrounding neighbourhoods should consider themselves fortunate. Next time, I think I'll try one of their numerous Italian-style sandwiches."}
{"text":"Another great Pepperoni Pizza from JP's. I ordered a special so it came with 15 Chicken Wings. Honey Hot. Crispy Pep Pizza with 15 delicious Monster Sized Chicken Wings. Another Slam Dunk by JP."}
{"text":"Their pizza is surprisingly good.  My husband passes by this pizza place enroute home almost everyday and finally decided to pop in and bring home a pie.  It turned out to be good.  The crust is nice and thin.  It is not greasy and there is a good amount of toppings.  Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Had the Jumbo meat lovers and a medium \"make your own\" vegetarian. Each was really good. Seems they use real cured meats unlike some places that have that tasteless shit. Also had an order of wings. These things were huge. I can't begin to tell you how big they were. More like drum sticks. They were very good tho so don't be afraid to order them. Will most definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Gotta say I was quite impressed with this little shop. The owner JP was there and was the friendliest guy! The pizza was great and my friend really enjoyed the wings. I would recommend this as a fantastic alternative to your chain pizza shops. Go for it!"}
{"text":"JP's Pizzeria is a high quality pizza. This place isn't as cheap as Dominos or other chain places, but you get what you pay for.  My typical order is a large \"The Super\", normally when I get pizza I can only manage to eat about 2 slices, but JP's is so good that I often find myself going for a 3rd or sometimes 4th slice, with no regrets!  The pizza focuses on toppings and I feel like you get all toppings in every bite you take, no searching for a piece of pepperoni here. The crust is tasty too,  nice and chewy and barely there in comparison to the rest of the pizza.  A definite treat!"}
{"text":"JP's has been a family favourite since its opening, i grew up in the neighborhood and i'd always order JP's when i had a craving for pizza.   My usual order is a large hawaiin with pepperoni. The pizza is thin crust and comes with a generous amount of toppings."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since it changed from city line to Jp's! love the place, pizza is great and the place is really clean. The customer service isn't all that, but whenever JP is around then its bound to be a good time! he's awesome, taught me a lot when I was younger, great guy."}
{"text":"Husband is doing a 10k run tomorrow hence why he ordered a party size Hawaiian pizza as he needs tons of crabs for tomorrow.   He found out a out this place from insauga. It was rated as top 5 pizza places in Mississauga.   The owner was very friendly. When my hubby arrived there he opened the box and showed the pizza and told him he only uses the best ingredients and he does not go cheap with the toppings. The owner also said he knew it was his first time there and if he wasnt happy with it he could come back for a refund.   Hubby brought home this pizza. Omggggg it did look so different from other franchises we had tried before. You could tell the owner didnt go cheap with the toppings indeed he was pretty generous. I could wait I quickly took a piece hmmmmmmm~~~~~ it was yummy // delicious// so flavourful and the thin crust was crispy. We both loveeeeeeee it. Hubby said this will be our togo pizza place from now on."}
{"text":"Best home delivered pizza! Ever ! Very friendly customer service! The owner makes the pizza himself !! Yummy!"}
{"text":"They charge too much for their \"pizza pizza\" quality pizza...the crust thin enough but some slices taste salty. And honestly some pizza pizza locations make greater pizzas. Service is not satisfactory, no smiles, no greeting and there was this lady looking at us like we were freaks. Yes it's family owned but they do treat it like a business,while I know there is another pizza place that makes super delicious pizza and they treat their customers like friends.( Sad they are on family holiday and will not be open until March 8, or I will never go trying the JP's)."}
{"text":"Pizza is literally my favourite food in the world.  If I could have one thing for the rest of my life, it would be pizza.  So read no further, I am the man to ask about good and bad pizza.  JP's Pizzeria is definitely one of the best, if not the best pizza I've ever had.  I am still looking for a place that tastes better than JP's, but I am having a hard time.  Everything from the crust, to the cheese and cant forget their pepperoni.   The only downside to JP's is the price. Quite expensive, no deals but well worth it.  Always remember folks....QUALITY OVER QUANTITY"}
{"text":"This local pizza joint is owned by the cartoon of his boxes - that's right, JP himself! His pizzas toppings are portioned well for the price you pay ($3 a topping) and then the base price for whatever size pizza you get.  The other difference that makes this pizza place good apart from the fact that it is local but that it is not oily. Often times I order from the chain brand pizzas and their pepperoni as an example has a small puddle of oil in it. After you grab a slice from JP pizza, hands do not feel oily at all.   I recommend ordering the Super even though a large pizza comes out to be around 30 bucks, it's a great combination and like said, all around taste very good.  The chicken wings are also a little bit more on the expensive side but it's very meaty as well. I think you could do without the wings and the pizza makes up good for it's own."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place back when it was city line pizza and the pizza is still amazing. It is that small one location place that just knows how to make a pizza. They don't rush making your pizza just to get it out the door. They put love and care into every slice/ pizza they make. Their wings are also top notch as they give it generous amount of sauce. This time I had the Canadian pizza with 10 hot wings and as usual I wasn't disappointed. The pizza was covered with topping and the wings were cooked just right.   My one recommendation is to call and place your order ahead of time as it can take 30 minutes for your order and there isn't a seating area."}
{"text":"Guy guarantees it's the best pizza you'll have, and I can't say I'm quite on board with that claim but it is pretty darn good and I'll be making many repeat visits. Quite pricy -- but this is to be expected for a small independent pizza chain. Staff is very talkative and remembers you. They have good intentions but it can be overwhelming while you're waiting.. at least for an introvert like me ;) Wings are pretty good too, but I prefer St. Louis. Better wings than most pizza places though."}
{"text":"Had a couple of slices for lunch, they were delicious! JP was awesome. This is a gem in the neighborhood. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I stumbled upon this neighbourhood gem. This is truly some of the best pizza I've had in the GTA. I went with \"JP's Favourite\" (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and onions). The crust was just thick enough to hold everything together and the sauce had a nice fresh taste...all in all, a delicious pie! If you find yourself up this way, pop in, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped off on a whim to try it out.  I think the potential is there.  But SO MUCH SALT.  Crust was super-duper salty.  2 medium 3 topping pizzas + 10 chix wings = $58 CAD.  So that was a bit of an ouch as well."}
{"text":"JPs has been the go to Pizza place for my family for years now.  The pizza there is perfect.  Ingredients are fresh and the crust is crispy and chewy.  I would never turn back and go anywhere else now.  Delicious and JP is a stand up guy.  He stands behind his product and makes sure that the customers are happy.  He's a leaf fan too!  Great place, great food.  You won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"This place is usually very good. My last order, the pizza and wing special, my pizza was partially burnt near the edges and the toppings. This has never happened before, but I notice that that owner has been away my last couple of orders. I will wait for him to come back before I order again, since he does not tolerate this nonsense. JP's is good, but the boss needs to be at the premise. The pizza I got should never been boxed, it was over cooked, and they should have made a new pizza. I was not a happy customer."}
{"text":"I find this place to be hit and miss. It is true they use excellent ingredients and when they take the time to prepare and bake the pizza well the result is an amazing tasting pizza.  Then there are the times that you end up with over cooked / burnt pizza.  No amount of quality ingredients can salvage these situations."}
{"text":"Jp's was great pizza for Canadian pizza. This isn't New York pizza or Italian pizza. It's Canadian pizza that's better than all the chain places. The crust is great and everything else is good. Pizza is greasy but I kind of liked that. $5 a slice"}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles here on business. I tried this spot based on Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. Everything about this pie was amazing, crispy crust, fresh toppings and amazing California tomatoes for the sauce from Modesto, Ca. The owner JP is a really cool and hospitable guy. For those of you whining about price, you get what you pay for. This place is no comparison to any chain pizza. I will he be back next time in town. Thanks JP!!"}
{"text":"JPs pizza is REALLY good. All ingredients are fresh and pizzas are big. A regular medium anywhere else is like a large here. The crust is thin and crispy. Everyone at the shop is nice and friendly. We have had the pep, the bruschetta and JPs favourite pizzas - all very good. Only thing is this place is pricey. It's a good treat to have once in a while if you're really craving some good pizza."}
