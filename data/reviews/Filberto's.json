{"text":"Worst service I've ever gotten from a Filibertos! I waited 10 minutes in the drive through to order food. (I was the only person in line) I honked and yelled and got frustrated so eventually pulled up to the window and waited. No one came up to the window so I eventually had to get out of my truck and knock on the window. Took the guy a few minutes to come to the window and I ordered my food. I ordered carne asada fries and the fries were over cooked and the cheese wasn't even melted. Will never be going there again."}
{"text":"I love filbertos, and this is by far the best looking and most up-to-date looking one! Drive through and plenty of seating. Thanks guys keep up makin awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"Living in AZ for years I got to know Mexican food. I mean I really got to know it! Filbreto's stands as one of my favorite Mexican spots on PLANET earth. Yea, I saw the news reports where they made the workers open the fridge and they found the 40oz bottles of Corona that only makes this place more AWESOME! Yea! Filberto's Rocks."}
{"text":"Huge burritos! Good, with one exception! Got my husband a chorizo burro, and by the time I got home with it, red grease was dripping out of the bag! That was gross!"}
{"text":"Nachos come with unmelted cheese and even though I asked for no Pico or tomatoes,... Guess what. Still got pico..  all in all it was pretty gross."}
{"text":"Come on no one has ranked Filberto's yet. THAT'S A DAM SHAME! I used to rock Filberto's BACK in the day on trips to see friends in Arizona. This PLACE WAS BOMB DUDE! You got some BOMB ASS BREAKFAST BURRITOS. Anytime in the day. You got a lot of burrito for your money too. Even living in LA and having been to Mexico a number of times Filbetos is TOP NOTCH Mexican food!"}
