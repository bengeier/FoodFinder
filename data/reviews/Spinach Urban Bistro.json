{"text":"I was walking the neighborhood and happened upon this sweet little bistro. I sat on the patio.  Ordered pot of Darjeeling and the Eden salad--loved the fig vinaigrette! I appreciate that they have gluten-free options.  The service was so friendly, and I chatted with the cook, who is also the owner.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"have eaten here twice.  A lovely little space in Shadyside.  Feels European. A nice space for sitting outside.  Don't be scared off by the vegan/vegetarian.  There are other options as well.  Food is well prepared, presented well and very fresh and delicious.  We had a tartine (open face sandwich-- delicious) and a caprese salad which was also delicious and very fresh.  Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place even more, especially since it's so close to my home, but it's just really pricey for what you are getting.  The fruit/vegetable juices are delicious but come in half a glass runs about $7.  I've eaten here for both dinner and brunch, I really do enjoy their salmon and vegetable omelet, but again wish it were a bit more in my budget and I'd be able to frequent this location more often. The decor is quaint, comfy, and inviting. I think this place is on to be the next hip place in shady side!"}
{"text":"Really delicious healthy lunch spot with outdoor seating. The Eden salad with chicken is incredible"}
{"text":"I stopped in Spinach this morning for a low key brunch with my girlfriend. It's is tucked away on a little street right off Walnut which gives it the perfect vibe for a fun weekend go-to. All of the food is vegan, vegetarian, organic, gluten free, etc. 

the menu is not terribly extensive, but I must say, the spinach omelet I ordered was INCREDIBLE. all the veggies were saut√©ed and it gave it the sweetest flavor. My friend loved her eden salad as well. As to be expected for a specialty place like this, the prices were pretty expensive for what you got. However, I would be back, especially if I needed to go somewhere that was accommodating to certain diets!"}
{"text":"Brunch was delicious! It's nice to have a great vegetarian and vegan friendly restaurant in Pittsburgh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant after receiving a recommendation from a friend that has dined here in the past. Unfortunately, we were both quite disappointed with the overall experience.

We arrived to an empty dining room and weren't immediately greeted. There was only one person working the front-of-the-house, which I presume was the owner. Our interaction was pleasant and professional; however, I felt like the passion was absent. 

Overall, the food was mediocre. In my opinion, the quality/freshness, portion sizes, and taste were not commensurate with the menu prices. We tried a few dishes - the best being the shiitake flatbread with goat cheese. The bread was fresh and tasty, as well as the cheese. 

I was let down by the avocado toast, as the avocado spread was bland and drenched in lemon. I'm not sure if that's their recipe or an attempt to preserve the spread for a few days, but it certainly did not taste fresh. This was also evident with the pasta dish. The sauce was underwhelming and bland, while the pasta itself was fresh and cooked well.

I genuinely feel like with some more passion and pride, this restaurant has the potential of being great. I wouldn't be opposed to giving them another chance in the future."}
{"text":"I went to spinach in the company of a vegan and two omnivores, and we all had meals.  I was delighted to get one of my favorite juices from the restaurant's previous incarnation.  My vegan friend was amazed especially by the dessert with the best vegan whipped cream substitute ever, and the rest of us had terrific pasta and chicken dishes - really creative menu items and beautiful presentation.  It's especially great to find a restaurant where vegan, gluten-free, and carnivorous friends can eat well together."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I got the cacao tartine and my boyfriend got the Alaskan tartine. Neither included all of the listed toppings on the menu. We also got a pot of tea and a cup of coffee.

OUR BILL WAS 35.00 
Let me break this down....
2 pieces of toast with a few toppings (couldn't even include all of them )
Tea
Coffee
35.00

Insane."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and had brioche French toast and the mushroom pesto tartine. The ingredients were fresh and the portions were pretty big. All of the food was delicious! We sat out on the patio, which is a great space on a nice day. It is a very cute little neighborhood restaurant. The service was also very good. Two servers helped us.it was the one woman's first day, but she was still very nice and attentive. The other server was very knowledgeable and attentive."}
{"text":"Great to see a delicious cafe in Walnut St! This is the old Cafe Eden with a new owner, still with gluten free and vegan options but a broader menu. 
We stopped off for brunch on Sunday - the French toast with gluten free bread was loaded with berries and yummy agave syrup. My husband enjoyed a spinach omlette with a delicious side salad. 
Service is friendly and attentive. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friend after an event nearby. I was hoping for something healthy and was in dire need of veggies. Spinach worked well.

I came in there are two other  tables, both very into what they were eating and their conversations. It isn't a large space and the groups were quite vociferous, making the vibe interesting. I took a spot and looked at the menu. The salmon caught my eye and I placed more order. The food comes out relatively quickly. The salmon is cooked well and I love the mixture of greens and asparagus. While generally not a fan of capers, it worked well in the dish. 

There was one waiter and he was a bit busy with the other groups, or he figured that I wasn't going to need much, so wasn't checked on much. No bigs, I get it."}
{"text":"Loved this! Has a European feel and is very delicious. A friend and I went for late lunch on Saturday Afternoon and there weren't very many people, (crazy!), go there!! Reasonably priced and open face huge sandwiches are delicious. We did not get gluten free/vegan options, although they do have them. Can't say more but loved loved loved it. 

Update: 5+ Stars
The only thing that is changed, is they are busy! The patio gets packed as soon as the weather is nice. & today, not a seat outside! My new favorite thing is the Omelette Parisienne. I literally have never eaten mushrooms before this omelette- I just wasn't a fan. I'm obsessed with this- it's delicious!! Love their breakfast so much I order it for lunch"}
{"text":"Nice place. Great vegan options. Very reasonable prices. I had their garden salad which is really good and is quite big, plus I had the shiitake tartine with tofu which was really tasty. A short walk away from UPMC Shadyside in a nice neighborhood with shops."}
{"text":"Presentation was beautiful, but flavors just okay.  The \"drizzle\" overwhelmed the flavors of the other ingredients. The service was horrible. Our server didn't come to the table to see if anyone had questions about the menu or wanted an appetizer while we waited for the last two members of our group. I had a bottle of wine on the table, but there was no offer to open it or bring wine glasses. Once we received our food, our server sat in a chair by the kitchen looking at his phone. Did not come to the table to see if everything was okay, to clear plates or offer dessert (which I had planned to order). We even had to go to him to get our check. (The restaurant was nearly empty other than our group.)"}
{"text":"Soooo good. This cute little bistro is tucked away under a store off of the busy walnut street. There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options to choose from for brunch. I ordered the Alaskan which is sourdough toast with a cheese spread and smoked salmon on top. I added a side of organic eggs which also tasted good when adding on top of the toast and salmon. The atmosphere is a nice and relaxing with inside and outside seating to choose from. Perfect for a relaxing Sunday brunch and convo."}
{"text":"As we shared the French Toast and a wonderful pasta dish and my wife who's is no foodie turned to me and said \"this is the best meal I have ever eaten.\" I agreed!"}
{"text":"I went to Spinach with my vegan daughter and carnivore dad. I had the vegan French toast with hazelnut chocolate spread and berries, my daughter had the \"cheezy\" pasta, and my dad had a ham, gruyere and mushroom omelette. We ALL loved it and cleaned our plates! The place itself was small/cozy and when we arrived there were just two other parties. If I had not looked up vegan friendly places before heading into the area, I would have walked right by it. We were all glad to find this delicious spot, and we will be back when we visit the area again."}
{"text":"Spinach Urban Bistro is now on our list of restaurants in Pittsburgh to re-patronize. The menu is short but diverse, and all four of the dishes my group tried today were well done. The Eden salad with shrimp was delicious. The brioche French toast tends to the very sweet side and comes with fresh berries. The Madame tartine has excellent ham, and the bread soaks up the egg yolk well. The shredded asparagus and avocado tartine needed a little extra punch, either from some more red pepper flakes or else a drizzled bed of balsamic. If you and a dining partner each order the Madam and the asparagus tartine, you can swap one open-faced sandwich each and get both your protein and your veggies. -1 star for the server whose tableside manner left something to be desired. I've met surgeons who had a more conversational bedside manner."}
{"text":"Food was delicious would never know my french toast was gluten free and vegan. Fruit was so fresh and tasty.
Very easy to work with on dietary needs. 

Need to advertise more and have menu available online. Social site hours are not matched up yet.
Part of new business growing pains.

Will go back."}
{"text":"This cute restaurant is a wonderful destination if you are looking for delicious, healthy fare. It feels fun and trendy going down the stairs to the below-street entrance. There is outdoor seating available, though I was there in the winter so it was too cold to dine al fresco.

The spiralized zucchini and avocado salad was unique and refreshing with a fun presentation. The tea was delicious and stayed warm throughout the meal because it was served from a cast iron teapot.

The tartines were crisp and comforting. I tried the shiitake tartine with balsamic, walnut and goat cheese. The shiitake provided a meaty, savory bite, while the tart creaminess of the goat cheese and balsamic contrasted beautifully. My mom ordered the shaved asparagus and avocado tartine. This tasted like a citrusy springtime.

For desert we had a date and banana cake. It had the consistency of a chocolate fudge pie, yet the dates provided a delicious and surprising taste.

This is definitely a place I will frequent"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while visiting friends in Pittsburgh, and it was delicious!! Perfect little serene spot, with and incredibly sandwich to match that left me feeling guilt free after eating it thanks to their vegan ingredients. I am excited to come back on my next visit to Pitt, hopefully in warm weather so I can try out their outdoor seating"}
{"text":"For what you pay: worth every. dang. penny.
Ambiance: small, shotgun style restaurant and 
Service: good
Taste: my gracious. Get ready for it.


Spinach is impeccable. Just absolutely awestruck leaving here. Coming from San Francisco California, hopes were not high for highly specialized vegan dishes. It is located on the corner of Copeland and Walnut, tucked sub-street into a tiny nook that can easily be missed if your not looking for it. We entered and the waiter, a burly foreign dude, helped us order vegan friendly food. For entrees we split the cheesy zucchini penne pasta and tofu scramble tartine. It was just amazing. The cheesy penne is made with cashew cheese, broccoli and zucchini. It was a perfect combination with the crunchy tartine topped with tofu, mushroom and hints of pesto and balsamic . So much flavor!!

Lastly, for desert we indulged in one of the most impressive vegan confections we have ever tasted - the Cacao tartine. It was a delightful presentation of strawberries, blackberries and blueberries drizzled with chocolate syrup all resting on a tuft of crunchy tartine. Not only does it look beautiful, it tastes so too. 

Coffee is espresso. Water served in jugs. Park in the free parking behind Master galleries."}
{"text":"Just ate dinner here. Had the avocado toast, Capri salad and chicken paillard. Well, the lettuce included some old rotten pieces and there were definitely some fruit flies lingering around. Should have gotten up and left after the salad and have to give up on this social niceity- this was gross food, and I'm sad to say that we paid for it."}
{"text":"This place is cute for lunch. The outdoor seating is a nice change and the people are very friendly. We asked for hot sauce. Unfortunately, they were out of hot sauce, but quickly went to get more before we had finished our meal. I ordered the \"epic\" tartine, which was quite refreshing and surprisingly large. I am a big fan of artichoke and it was well prepared. My friend had the spinach omelette and was underwhelmed, hence the hot sauce. The veggies were undercooked and cheese not melted completely. All in all, a nice place for a quick meal and not bad for the price."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch!! My spinach omelette was out of this world.. my friend ordered a smoothie which turned out to be not what she wanted and they graciously made her the Alaskan tartine. Very delicious. Would haven easily given 5 stars for the food but service very slow. One chef that makes meals to order one at a time.... but really well!!"}
{"text":"I'll be frank- even though I'm a vegetarian, I could never make the transition to being vegan because I love cheese way too dang much. So, I'm always skeptical of dishes that try and replicate cheese with non-dairy ingredients because they can never truly capture the original taste and texture of cheese. However, this longstanding opinion finally changed after eating at Spinach. I hesitantly ordered the cheesy penne, which was actually a vegan entree with penne in a cashew+coconut sauce and zucchini, spinach, and broccoli. However, one bite of the dish and I fell in love! The vegan \"cheesy\" sauce had the perfect thick texture and flavor reminiscent of real cheese. If I hadn't know beforehand, I probably would have mistaken this sauce for real cheese. The vegetables were also well seasoned and complemented the pasta well. I can't wait to go back and see what other ways Spinach can open my eyes to new dishes!"}
{"text":"Giving a 5 star based on our experience with takeout & quality of food. Super super flavorful & cooked perfect."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of my son and his girlfriend. Spinach is located in the same complex that houses Salud juicery and a chocolate shop. You need to walk down a short flight of steps to enter.

The place is small and there was only one person working there. I looked over the menu and was glad to see that during the week they offer brunch offerings in addition to weekends. There is a sign that says \"Farm, fresh, and organic.\" I do want to note that not everything here is vegan or vegetarian, however, they do an excellent job on the menu indicating precisely what is and what isn't.

I decided to go with the tofu scramble with shiitake mushrooms, avocado, and a side salad. Since this was a vegan choice no eggs were used in this entree.

I got the food rather quickly and was amazed at the portion size. The salad had what appeared to be a fig balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was very good. The tofu scramble was indeed delicious and quite filling. Loved the avocado! It even came with a panini style toast to round it out.

I did not order any beverages since I was content with the bottle of water I was given. They do have desserts but they are fairly pricey with them starting at $10.00. My bill for my brunch alone was slightly over $12.00. Keep in mind as I had said, they serve organic food so expect to pay more.

This small restaurant is located right at the corner of Walnut St and in the heart of Shadyside's business district. Parking definitely can be a problem when you visit this area. Best times to go are late morning during the week and you might be able to snag some off street parking. There is a metered lot and a metered garage nearby."}
{"text":"I was skeptical after the new owner purchased it, since Eden was one of my favorite restaurants...but holy cow, the food was amazing. I had the vegan French toast (best French toast I've ever had--vegan or not) and my partner had the tofu scramble. So fresh, so delicious. Service was fast (the owner was our server). Prices are reasonable for the quality and location. Only thing was the music choice was a little odd and pretty loud. We're going back next weekend, though, so it wasn't that bad. ;)"}
{"text":"Get over here and get some avocado toast!  Finally, a healthy and delicious  replacement for Eden and a great addition to Shadyside.  Space looks great and a little brightened up.  Service was prompt and the vibe was mellow. I'm definitely a fan.1"}
{"text":"Great for vegan and gluten free eats while in Shadyside. Fresh ingredients. 

Pasta portions are huge, salmon was slender. 

Service was fine but slow. Not good for a fast bite. Outdoor seating is great."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it! Great, healthy, homemade foods! Excellent service. The salads,pasta, and open-faced sandwiches are excellent! BYOB AND NO cork fee! I repeat- NO cork fee."}
