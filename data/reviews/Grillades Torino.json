{"text":"Lately the waiters behind the counter just enjoys bothering and making mockeries and bad jokes on costumers, the jokes are really  disrespectful.  I'm not going back there , and a lot of people i know felt the same way... disgusting  thuggish behaviour  ."}
{"text":"Torino is a very good restaurant if you are looking for an affordable Mediterranean food. You can choose from a good variety of side dishes. The staff is very friendly and the food is always fresh with the meet been grilled as you order.   The chicken is delicious and so is their potatoes. Their fattoush salad is also very tasty.   After visiting 3 different locations I came to the conclusion that the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff varies greatly from place to place. I find that the experiences I had In Laval (carrefour Laval shopping centre) is significantly inferior to the ones downtown Montreal (square Victoria).  They also have deliveries through just-eat."}
{"text":"I come to the mall fairly often, even though I'm from way out of town.  This is my go-to place in the mall.  I've tried others, and found them less satisfying, but love this little place. The quality, portion, and selection are great. I usually get the grilled chicken, the grilled steak, the hummus, the garlic spread, the grilled veggies. All delicious!"}
{"text":"This used to truly feature some of the highest-quality food and best values you could find in a food court in all of Montreal.  The staff were friendly, got to know you, and served generous helpings of grilled chicken, beef and sides that potentially even sourced you leftovers, depending on your appetite, for under $10.  Alas, there seems to have been an ownership change a little over a year or so ago (the original staff is all gone, at any rate), and the quality has now slipped a fair bit on all of the sides (salads feature cheaper ingredients, sauces are blander than they used to be), while the volume of food they give you has been curtailed dramatically - the full grilled chicken breast was cut back to thinner cross-sections of a full chicken breast, or worse, strips of even smaller \"tenders\" depending on the day, big scoops of hummus were reduced to measured tablespoons, etc.  Also, the new staff seems to constantly be \"hustling,\" which is annoying - shouting at passers-by to try a sample of chicken while effectively ignoring you once you're already in line, pushing \"specials\" that are regular plates with a drink added and priced accordingly, distractedly reminding you about \"three choices!\" you need to make for your plate without so much as a hello or nice to see you again, and so on - look, I appreciate this isn't fine dining, but small things that used to make a difference are no longer there, which is too bad.  ALL THAT SAID, the \"stars\" of the plates here - those being the grilled proteins - are all really quite good, and remain a notch above much of the competition.  It's just too bad you get less of it than you used to, for about 30% more than you used to pay, served like you're in the Riverdale High cafeteria."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype around Portuguese chicken, as though piri piri sauce elevates chicken to nirvana. Relax with the piri piri hype, ok? Torino's started the whole grilled chicken boom in Montreal, and they are the best in the downtown core. If I'm catching a movie upstairs, this is the only place I care to eat. It's definitely the best place in the food court."}
{"text":"If you're one of those lost souls who work downtown and wander around haplessly on their lunch breaks through the underground maze of generic food court options, save yourself some grief and head over to Torino. They're one of the only food court joints that don't make my soul feel empty. Their chicken is juicy and full of flavour, portions are large and as for sides, you can choose from one of their many salads and/or rice and potatos!  Just make sure to chew gum after 'cause you definitely don't want to show up at that one o'clock meeting smelling like their deliciously potent garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"If youre hungry and want to eat fast, do not come here. Services are terrible, they made us wait for 30 minutes because they were too busy serving plates and plates of food for the manager. Letting our food cool down on the counters. Paying was also a hassle since they were too busy bickering. Worst experience at a torino."}
{"text":"We sometimes order Torino at work. They specialize in \"Meditareean\" cuisine but don't really copy the Amir/Bashar model.  Pros:  Great value, most plates are $10-13 Portions are pretty big, especially sides Large selection of items and 3 sides Most plates come with a sogt drink.  Cons Not the best cuts of meat and taste is a bit lacking  Slow delivery,  waited 50 minutes last time  Food gets cold very fast,  should switch to other types to preserve heat. (they seem to wait for multiple deliveries in same area and then send the driver).  When in person at the food court, it's obviously going to be much better and probably top 5 in this mall."}
{"text":"Great service loved the food. Very genuine customer care and the quality of the service was top notch, from the greeting to the cooking to the serving. Will stop by many more times"}
{"text":"First time rating a food court joint. Why? Simply because it's delicioosoo!   If you ever passed by this place then you know that those guys are handing out samples of their delicious grilled chicken 24/7. And believe it or not those chicken are soo tender and juicy.  One day I decidee to give it a try. I took the special of the day with 2 slices of grilled chicken and the grilled beef brochette. It came with 3 options of sides so I took backed potatos, salade and some rice.  The medium beef was grilled on the spot and on point and it was a pleasure eating it. The rice and salade was good. Special shoutout to the potato that was both crunchy and soft.  The food came in a pretty big portion within a reasonable price.   Highly recommand this place!"}
{"text":"Pendant que je regardais le menu de cette place ouverte dans la foire alimentaire de Place Dupuis (Ouvert depuis environ Février 2013) on me propose de gouter un morceau de poulet méditérannéen. Wow - Super bon. J'ai pris un club sandwich avec ce poulet et ce fut un vrai délice. Choix de 2 accompagnements: Je conseille les légumes grillés! Le tout pour moins de 11$ avec un breuvage très abordable et rapide si vous êtes sur votre heure de lunch. Un service très personnalisé et amical. Celle qui a préparé mon repas, m'a dit qu'elle l'a fait avec Amour, ce qui est un ingrédient indispensable! Je retire 1 étoile, car la personne qui a pris son repas avec moi avait du du poulet pas asser cuit, mais ils l'ont échangé sur le champs et se sont excusés à plusieurs reprises."}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" is great if you like burnt food!!! I ordered a demi-club sandwich that took 20minutes??? Then the server asked me twice what I ordered I told him I wanted salad instead of fries and he didn't really pay attention, which showed in the sandwich which wasn't a demi order and the bottom-- which he tried to hide was totally burnt. Got two bites down and then decided to not eat it at all, kinda sad when you consider you can go to fast food place downtown that has better quality standards and are faster and friendlier. -- Too bad first time trying this place and it was a Epic FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"Portions small for the price , fries were cold , grilled was poorly grilled. Waiting was way too long."}
{"text":"When you want a resto with quality BBQ food at affordable prices, you cannot go wrong with Grillades Torino. The quality of the food is clearly a notch higher than you'll get at most places of the Cote-Vertu food court.  I've probably ordered most thing off their menu and have rarely been disappointed by the quality of the food. For speed purposes they start cooking early and when the meat is almost done they put it aside (leaving it warm) until clients come and order to avoid waiting for 20+ minutes for our food.  The spread of sides are impressive with a lot of healthy options.  The meat is very good though the portions can be a bit small but you can't complain when most meals range $11 to $13."}
{"text":"Carrefour Laval doesn't have the best food court out there but Grillades Torino is a solid option to have some Mediterranean style food. The meats are freshly grilled in front of you but what I dislike about them, being a meat snob, is the fact they are being grilled from cold to the grill. It's normal practice to leave your meat out for 30 minutes at room temp and then grill it but I understand that this isn't exactly grilling on my own personal BBQ, it is after all fast food.  Plates are pretty generous with certain meal combos have 2 or 3 different side options that come in a variety of rices, salads and potatoes. There's also the option of hummus or garlic sauce and I like their garlic sauce. Personally, if it were stronger it'll be better but this is a public fast food places, can't have it too strong... need to make it more accessible for all cultures!  All in all, it's a solid food court lunch option."}
{"text":"For mall food, I guess it's okay.  I'll start by saying I'm an English speaking American.  So please take my judgement based on that.  I don't truly know the standards of Montreal food.  But compared to some of the other Middle Eastern/Mediterranean establishments I've even at, this one is really middle of the road.  The beef I ate was good.  Tasty.  Rice was dry though.  The wrap didn't taste particularly good.  Overall, middle of the road.  In that mall, though, it looked like the best choice.  It was well populated at lunchtime though."}
{"text":"Best food ever great service always fresh and price is reasonable not to mention the portion size is huge!"}
{"text":"Staff is very, very friendly and let me taste some chicken all the little sauces I didn't recognize. Had an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Great place. chicken is amazing well grilled and juicy, so is the 3 meat plate. love the 3 bean salad as well.The quality, portions, and selections are great."}
{"text":"For a food court, this is some of the best food you can get, forget that, this is just great food. Portuguese style BBQ, the chicken is succulent, juicy, and perfect every time.   This is in the food court below simons, and the scotia bank cinema."}
{"text":"Good food for a food court! Juicy chicken and good salads what more could you ask for if your trying to be a bit healthy and eat cheap"}
{"text":"This place has great food with amazing service. Just step up to the counter and they will be glad to let you sample their chicken. I usually go for the mixed plate that includes a filet mignon kebab and a chicken kebab with your choice of 3 sides. Top that off with hummus and garlic sauce and your good to go. Fairly priced for the quality you get. The downtown location is very fast and accurate considering the crazy lunch line ups. The Brossard location has an amazing staff that is always smiling and super welcoming."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I got the chicken plate, the chicken was juicy and the garlic potatoes were some of the best I've ever had! The combo came out to aboht 13$ which is decent and the portions were very generous!"}
{"text":"Fell in love with Mediterranean food recently. In spite of  the quantity of food courts in downtown, good places for quick lunch are still limited. Cost-quality is fairly reasonable. A good choice for people working in downtown. Have a try!"}
{"text":"Bien pour le prix. Les grillades sont bien succulente et il pourra vous faire goûter avant de commander. Cela reste un food court donc ne penser pas avoir de la haute cuisine ou une nourriture qui vous renversera, Mais cela reste mieux que beaucoup d'autre choix dans l'endroit."}
