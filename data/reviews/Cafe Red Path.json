{"text":"Went during lunch with a coworker. Had a soup and sandwich freshly made in front of me. Soup was yummy and sandwich was full of flavor. Nice quiet terrace right by the Lachine canal. Free wifi and great cappuccino and excellent service.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with the plan of getting some coffee and sitting down to do a little work on my laptop. When I asked them for the wifi password I was told that they don't have public wifi. A coffee shop without wifi? No wonder there wasn't anyone else in there. Getting two stars because the americano was actually pretty good. They had sandwiches as well, looked good, but I didn't stick around to try them."}
{"text":"In my quest of café experiences, I found this little quaint place on the internets! I was intrigued by their terrasse, and the fact that I haven't gone to many places in Point St-Charles.  Things I liked: FREE WIFI! Decent Latte, comfortable seating!  It was quiet, with a bit of music in the background, and a lot of natural light. My friend got a soup and sandwich combo, and said it was really fresh, and the soup was great too. I had a yogurt parfait and a latte, and both were good, lots of fresh strawberries in the parfait, with a bit of granola. Prices were reasonable, and the café was very clean.   We stayed for a few hours, and didn't feel rushed by the owners, and the owners seemed cordial and likeable. It had air conditioning, nothing blew my socks off, and everything was good.  Historical Fun Fact: This building was once the Redpath Sugar Refinery, hence the name!  So final assessment: socks are on, place was nice, and I'd go back for sure."}
