{"text":"After reading a description of this restaurant in the newspaper, I was very excited to take my mother, daughters, and sister for brunch. We were all very disappointed in both the food and the service. It took an hour to get our food.  My sister and I both ordered a medium rare cheeseburger that came out well done and dry. The burgers had no sauce, and were mediocre. My mother ordered pancakes, and they were rather dense and tasteless.  We agreed that none of us will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town!! the Dutch oven pancake is a must try, best one I've had so far!! 
Yummmyyyy"}
{"text":"Was stunned / completely caught off guard when I just ordered a small coffee to go = 4.35... I have a son that will be dropped off @ Brophy 400+ times over the next 4 years - which would have been followed by a cup of coffee and a possible breakfast mtg somewhere on camelback between the 7's during this time period - it's highly unlikely that Elle's is an option going forward. AJ's is right next door = 65% less..."}
{"text":"First the waiter did the best he could. But for some reason they won't allow any substitutions. So when one of our party asked for a low carb option other than the hash browns he was told he could not substitute. He asked if he could just have some fruit (still healthier than hash browns. And was told no, unless he wanted to pay the extra few bucks for a side of fruit. Usually a restaurant will let you substitute and if the alternate item is more expensive you pay the difference, not flat out refuse. So finally he said just leave the hash browns off the plate and he left it at that. When the food arrived, the plate was more than half covered with hash browns. The Waiter said the manager would not let them leave them off. We were there when they weren't' that busy and that kind of management policy is unbelievable. Honestly we all left realizing the food was sub-par, and not that good. Several left hungry and we simply will not return. We love trying new restaurateurs in the neighborhood and like to give our money to good independent places. This one however will soon fade to oblivion and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I came here for my mothers birthday, and they made it perfect. Everyone from the hostess, to the server, to the manager were amazingly kind! They went above and beyond to help and make our lunch perfect and memorable! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with quality yummy food and wonderful service. Very welcoming, peaceful environment.  The coffee was good, the food was even yummier.  Would recommend this place as a place to go when you want to take your time, enjoy your meal, sit outside & enjoy the fresh air."}
{"text":"Very good service, friendly and helpful with suggestions. Food was delicious. Tried it at breakfast and lunch and was not disappointed with either. Had Elly's egg Benedict & the burger with bacon and egg and fries."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. The service was great and food was delicious. Next time I'll have to stop by for breakfast, the menu looks amazing. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, no. My friend and I tried this on our lunch hour. We love breakfast  at any time of day. Jesse was our server, nice enough guy but honestly felt like he was just filling in for the day. No typical server banter, Just Hi I'm Jesse, what can I get you?  My friend ordered the stuffed avocado and I ordered the Ole omelette. What she received was a sliced avocado with giant chunks of chicken slathered in mayonnaise. No seasoning, nothing crunchy in there, nothing. Chicken and mayo. Not appetizing at all. My omelette - not good. It looked like the aftermath of an omelette, a scramble maybe but this was no omelette. Looks aside it didn't taste good either. I did have some crispy hash browns. I ate those after a dosing of salt and pepper that was lacking. And the side of bacon we ordered, tasty. But its bacon, even at it's worst, it's still ok. 
I so wanted to love this, it just disappointed on so many levels."}
{"text":"Not a good one today. Went in to have a quick Breakfast and no one came over to help. Normally pretty good service but today was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I really love the food here and the atmosphere, especially the pancakes  .... We decided to make reservations for 20 on Saturday and ended up having 30 people in our party last minute  .  The owner Penelope was very friendly and willing to add more tables for our large brunch party. The service was phenomenal and everyone was attended to in our party , coffee was never low on our table . We had an outstanding waitress Jennifer who was polite and an excellent server.  The prices are really good for the amount of food you get and the location is spectacular .... I would highly recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"First time visitor to this industrially decorated restaurant this morning (Sun. 5.28.17). There were more wait staff than customers, and because of this the service was very attentive and the food came out quickly.  Our server John was great!  The issue is not with the service but the food.  I ordered Stuffed Berry Mascarpone Crepes, I received 3 large crepes with strawberries and blueberries sprinkled on top, the problem with the crepes is the mascarpone never made it into one of the crepes, the second had approximately 1 Tablespoon in the middle of the crepe, and the last one of the three had approximately 1 teaspoon again stuck in the middle.  My husband had a Morning Sunrise Omelet that was huge, the avocado was put into the egg mixture as a guacamole rather than as chunks.  While waiting for our check I saw one of the cooks (since the customers have a view of the kitchen it is open) playing with his orange hat and running his hands through his hair,  he then went back to cooking, without a break to wash his hands.  Now he may have had a sink in front of him, I just couldn't see it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  We have a group that does Bfast and are looking for neighborhood spot.  Couple of us came in to test it out.  Service was fine.   Our food was pretty good.  Will I ever be back ?  No.  Why:  Pricing was Ridic.   Biggest example:   I ordered an ice tea.   The Price was $4.   That is very high.  Seems over priced.  That's the same as the Ritz or Biltmore Hotels.  But ok.   Got our check and they charged me $1 each for two refills.   Small glasses with lots of ice.  And Didn't even tell us they were charging us for the refills.  You kidding ?   Doing that in AZ ?  So my ice tea bill alone was $6.    I can't do that anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent service from a very cordial confident staff who all seemed to know what they were doing.  Have tried three different breakfast meals and all were great.    Eggs Benedict one of the best in Phoenix - perfect light lemon in the hollansaise sauce.   Also tried the Huevos Rancheros which was delicious.  Lastly tried their very large bacon avocado omellette.  All meals were generous in size.  The restaurant is relatively quiet and the floor to ceiling glass makes it nice and bright.  Predicting Elly's will become one of the most popular breakfast dining spots around.  Prices are reasonable and it is very comfortable."}
{"text":"I am glad I gave Elly's another try today. They have a very large menu with many great choices.  I had the steak and mushroom skillet and it was very good. The service was also very friendly. The first time we went there was a problem with being understaffed but they have done a great job getting back to 5 star status. The coffee is great!"}
{"text":"There isn't much that would bring me back here.  Ordered a benedict and a short stack of pancakes and both items were average, coffee nothing to rave about either.  Prices are ridiculous for a breakfast/brunch location.  $4 for iced tea and $6 for a short stack of pancakes is insane.  Total for two of us before tip was $44, that's never going to grab a breakfast regular.   The parking has always been a challenge in this center and it wasn't any better today.  Bathrooms were also unavailable due to a \"sewer backup\".  I know it's only two weeks in and would have been forgiving for food mistakes, etc. but the pricing, vibe and other options in the area have nothing to do with \"working out the initial kinks\"."}
{"text":"Really want to love this place! It's close to everything great. The atmosphere is great- modern and clean. 

The food is not good. The menu is almost too large to maintain quality. It's reasonable price wise but it looks and tastes bland. I had the eggs Benedict providence and it made me ill. 
Our food sat on the heating to be ran area for over ten minutes before is came out. 

The service was poor. Slow and unclean.

I would rather go almost anywhere else to spend money on brunch."}
{"text":"Our breakfast was really good!  Generous portions with gluten free toast and pancake options.  Hubs had southwest omelet, very tasty.  Coffee was delicious. And my three year old loved the hash browns.  Great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on Sunday late morning and it was packed and noise level was high. Our wait was less than what they had told us and service throughout meal was attentive.  I love corned beef hash so I ordered that with pancakes.  Honestly, disappointed with the hash.  Visually it would have been more appealing if the plate was garnished with some chopped chives and/or a slice of orange. The hash was crispier (edges were almost black like it was burned) and a little greasier than I like, but I was surprised that it didn't have a strong corned beef flavor.  I could see bits of meat in there but it didn't have the distinct flavor I have had in other corned beef hashes.  The eggs on top were poached  nicely but were small in size.  The pancakes were good. The server said the syrup that accompanied the pancakes was maple syrup - it tasted good but was very thin.  My friend had an omelet which he said was \"\"OK\"  and commented on the plain plating. Overall, value for portion sizes was just average.
I will give the place a second chance but won't be ordering the hash again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the service is always excellent. John needs a special mention!
My daughter loved her pancakes and my Florentine was delicious. The coffee is worth a visit alone, try the frappe."}
{"text":"It's been added on my go-to breakfast spots! Good food, variety and many options/alternatives and good location. I've had a lot of their breakfast options and all have been yummy. Great spot for out of towners-"}
{"text":"Elly's is great.  Food and service are very good.  They have a small outdoor eating area too."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Elly's in two weeks.  There selection is great.  My cousin stated this is the best breakfast she has had in Phoenix. And she drives from the westside to dine here.  I most second her opinion."}
{"text":"Adorable, excellent service, delicious breakfast! Our server was so sweet and gave us a chocolate croissant on our way out."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing. The atmosphere, people and food. Love the coffee and it's variety. Perfect place to enjoy down to earth company and amazing food."}
{"text":"This is my third visit, in three days. Ordered the same thing all three times - original eggs Benedict with turkey instead of ham. On day three I was told there was no turkey. I order an iced tea each time and not once did I ever receive a refill. This restaurant does not believe if offering them. First two visits it took 10 minutes just to get my drink.  Today was much quicker. A lot of inconsistencies in service and pricing, each time my check was slightly different.  Not sure if I'll be back for the fourth time, despite of living up the street.  More training would certainly benefit staff and the business."}
{"text":"Nice location and plenty of seating- had the cheese burger which was good and the bacon was perfect. The hand cut French fries were very good and I'd come back for those. One of my fellow diners got the cheese burger with bacon and added a fried egg and he loved it. The salad was good and filling plus the omelet and hash browns were very good. The selection of iced teas is great and the peach tea I had was very good. The chocolate pancake was delicious and the maple syrup was very delicious. I plan on returning for the eggs Benedict as they looked delectable. I'm thinking that the breakfast options are the main draw here. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time it was the best breakfast I have had in a while. I got the steak & wild mushroom skillet and pancakes. The skirt steak was tender, potatoes cooked well and the whole dish very flavorful. The pancakes might be the best I've had and came with real butter and maple syrup.  Thirteen bucks plus tax for that was quite reasonable too. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Been to Elly's many times now.  Food is really good!  This is one of our go-to brunch places now.  

Pro Tip: Add Cheese and Onions to your hashbrowns!!

For a place as big as it is, they really could use more servers.  Service is slow because there are so many tables and only a few servers.  However, it's still worth it!"}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast place 
Nice atmosphere, and excellent food. You can tell the classic breakfast is made with fresh quality ingredients. And the orange juice /vodka screwdriver is very good as well."}
{"text":"I've been mulling about how I feel about this place. Its definitely a grade A brunch spot comparable to all the other new brunch areas that have been opening up recently. Which I suppose is part of why I had to think of it so long. The place is cute and menu expansive but definitely not something new.

My Spartan omelet was jam packed and delcious. Pretty much all the food came with sides. My omelette came with hash browns AND toast. 

They were doing a donation drive where if you donated money you get a pumpkin to decorate, which in turn they would put around the restaurant. I love that concept!! So neat and a nice touch seeing the unique pumpkins on everyone's tables.

I have to deduct a star because the service was extremely slow throughout the entire experience. There was a point where one person in our party had finished their drink before someone else could get their drink. They also had some condiments that were not available - for example barbecue sauce even though they serve burgers.

I can see Elly's being included in my brunch circuit - but definitely just when I have enough time and not to hungry to accommodate the slow service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Today was the first day I didn't sit down and have the full restaurant experience (which has always been top notch). Instead, my daughter and I walked in and ordered from the 'bar'. I got the Freddo (if you like iced coffee, you'll like this). She got a lemonade and an oatmeal raisin cookie. We also got a ham/cheese croissant. She said the cookie was the best she ever had - 'squishy on the inside and a little crispy on the outside'. The croissant was amazing. It was great to walk into a cute, comfortable brunch place and enjoy a bite to eat and a coffee without having someone wait on you. Instead we just seated ourselves outside with the food/drinks we got from the bar, and then left when we were done. It's the kind of place you could have a big hearty meal with the family, a quick snack, or bring your laptop and get some work done over coffee and a pastry. Oh, and while I was taking a picture of my Freddo (it was so pretty!), two tables inside were taking pictures of their food. That's always a good sign."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and the food was great. This is not a five star review because of the unfriendly, dirty blonde hostess. She crossed us off the waiting list without calling our name and was very unapologetic when we asked about it.
Other than her unpleasant attitude, the experience was good. Crystal was our waitress and she was on top of it."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to have breakfast or brunch with a friend. The bakery items are delicious and the speciality coffees will start your morning right. Fresh made preserves are a treat. The service is always inviting and kind. Great light inside and in the cooler months, the patio is the perfect spot for people watching in the courtyard."}
{"text":"Checked out this place for the first time. They are located in the Uptown Plaza at Central and Camelback, tucked away in the corner near West Elm and Creamistry. The patio and interior are decorated nicely and the staff was friendly. As I waited at the coffee center, more than once I was asked if I had been helped. I appreciate the attentiveness. I asked if they had any coffee drinks that could be made iced and was told that any of them can be made iced. I ordered the Mint White Chocolate in the 12 oz size along with a pastry for their grab and go special. The barista allowed me to sample the drink that is usually made hot to see if it was to my liking. It was creamy and minty and a nice spring green color. I agreed that it was great and got my pastry and left.

It wasnt until I arrived at work and was reviewing their to-go menu that what I ordered and what was on the menu listed an 12 oz or 16 oz drink. What I received was more like an 8 oz cup that was 1/2 to 3/4 of the way full. Other than the sip I had taken in the restaurant to taste, I had not consumed any more of the beverage.

I dont know if this size was for the grab and go special as it didnt indicate a size on the sign that I noticed.

I enjoyed the drink, althought I would have liked more of it. The pastry, an almond covered croissant, was generous in size and was fresh and flavorful.

Outside of the drink mishap, I think I will return to try lunch."}
{"text":"Not only was this a fun trendy place to get brunch but there were so many incredible vegetarian options! The prices were extremely reasonable if not cheap! I got the avocado wrap and it came with hash browns that were cooked perfectly! The portions were great! Our waitress Tawni was so attentive and sweet! She made sure we had everything we could have needed! There were also so many juice/smoothie options! I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a cute brunch place! I've heard of Elly's Brunch and Café before, they have like 84 locations. I was expecting a crowd today and boy was I right. A really sweet hostess greeted us upon arrival and despite being really busy they sat our large party of 24. Our waitress was attentive and the food was delish. Great staff and excellent food!  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went on July 4th around 9 and it wasn't busy at all. The service was good and fast.  

I had the classic waffle and my boyfriend got the classic breakfast with pancakes. The food in my opinion was good, the eggs were soft and not dry, the chicken sausage was good but not outstanding but that's the issue with chicken sausage. My waffle was very good, so good I ate the first half embarrassingly fast. The pancakes were ok. 

The prices really are not too bad except most plates don't come with sides and that's where they get ya. Looked like they had a wide selection of drinks on the menu.  Definitely going back to try one of their specialty beverages. 

So happy to have this right around the corner!"}
{"text":"This rating is for their service during brunch hours on a weekend. Literally waited for our food (pancakes, omelette) for 30 minutes. 30 minutes. So for 30 minutes after they've taken your order you just sit there unproductive getting hangrier by the minute. I would've appreciated if they weren't so quick to seat you but make sure you get quick service as soon as you're seated. This place is huge that I think their kitchen is too small to spit out food fast enough or a reasonable amount of time for a restaurant this big. Either that or they don't have enough kitchen staff. I don't know but something's broken here. A step in the process needs to be crashed in order to get food served a little faster. By the time our food came out it's already lunch, so yeah nope not coming back. The poached egg came out like a soft boiled egg. I didn't care how the food tasted because their shitty service already left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is fabulous. My omelet had very fresh ingredients and the coffee was some of the best I've had. Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! Went here for the first time with family from out of town. They loved it so much they wanted to come back the next day! I felt the same way.
There are just so many options that all sound delicious and for a decent price I must add!
We went at 10am on a Sunday with a group of 5 and it only took 20 minutes to get sat even though it was packed in there!
Overall, extremely impressed and happy.

P.S. I did get a mimosa and it was pretty skimpy so only downside was the mimosa size"}
{"text":"Yes it is Mothers day, yes it was extremely busy, yes we waited for a whole 27 minutes but the food was spot on. Good quality, huge portions, friendly caring staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Ellys while on vacation. We arrived early, about 8am on a weekday and were seated immediately at our choice of table outside. The wait staff was friendly and outgoing. They offered helpful suggestions for ordering according to preference. The toast was made from a local bakery's bread and the jelly was locally made as well. Both were delicious. I wish we had an this restaurant closer to home!"}
{"text":"This beautifully hot summer Sunday my boyfriend and I went to Elly's looking for a new brunch place we hadn't been to before. After reading some yelp reviews we decided to go. When we got to Elly's it was packed and had some couples in front of us, the hostess said there would be a 20 minute wait for a table, but we got in less than 5 minutes from walking in. When we sat down we looked over the menu and were greeted by our server who brought water and a smile. 

My boyfriend ordered a coffee and I ordered a hot nutella latte. There was a bit of a mix up between the runners and our server who placed a cold nutella latte in front of me but our server corrected it and apologized saying it was for the next table down. We then ordered our meal I got the Sticky Bun and my boyfriend ordered the Chilequiles, which was by far the star of the meal. The buns were good but by the end they were getting a bit too sweet even for my sweet tooth. 

I did see that between the staff there were some mix up in food orders and that there were runners and servers trying to find where dishes were suppose to go. But that all comes with new staff and a new restaurant system. 

All in all it was a great place for brunch. There were lots of families and couples so it's a wonderful place for all ages. The food was excellent and fresh, the staff smiling and apologetic if anything went wrong. It's also within the hub of north central Phoenix."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the breakfast- nothing real special but it was all good. Service was also very good. Nice ambience. We'd come back"}
{"text":"I had the BEST version of eggs benedict ever.  Ashley our server was just awesome.  The moment you walk you feel invited.  I live in Seattle WA, and only get to visit Phoenix AZ a couple times a year, this will be a place I revisit every time."}
{"text":"Little hidden brunch place. Very good classic breakfast and yum berry smoothie! Definitely coming back to try the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Elly's, and liked it quite a bit for brunch. Our service was excellent.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious except for the bacon. The first portion was almost charred, and I asked for another serving that was not as well-done. Unfortunately, the send try was also overdone. :( However, the waffle was tasty and eggs perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant for breakfast.  I have to say the food is outstanding, the place is very clean, and the staff is super friendly.  I especially loved the service provided by our waitress.  Also, the manager was very accommodating to our needs and diet restrictions.  This is my go to breakfast and brunch place now.  Hands down the best breakfast I have had in a long time. I highly recommend to at least try it, you will enjoy good food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I didn't know there was a news story on this place this week, I just happened to see it was new and wanted to try it. Let me just say first the food is solid, very good and can tell it's good quality. But I think they still need to work some things out, half the restaurant was empty, there was a line out the door of people waiting and they still weren't seating people. I understand if you are still a little under staffed but heck at least sit them, allow a drink and just say we are a little behind...which I think would have been understood, but don't tell people 10 minutes, ends up being an hour with half the tables being empty. Also saw some of the wait staff not being so clean conscious, like touching food on the line, refilling water bottles with half gone water from other bottles that were at people's tables, and having gone to culinary school and having a food/safety manager certification I might have cringed a few times. Ultimately I will probably try it again, but will probably wait a few more weeks until I do."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place isn't more popular with the lunch/ brunch crowd during the week, the food here is sooo gooood, the crepes are right amount of delicious  with the differnt fillings and they don't just serve breakfast,  the choices on the menu would fit any appetite, the coffee,tea and chocolate drink bar are to die for,and they serve alcohol drinks now too. PLEASE visit this place, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Ate here today - food was very good but the service was not. The drinks were watered down (presumably because they sat at the bar for a little while before they were delivered to the table), our server forgot our toast and two sets of pancakes. The check was dropped at the table before the pancakes even came. The pancakes were given to us without any of the things that were supposed to come with it (the Dutch pancake was supposed to come with butter and lemon). There was no sign of a manager to talk to us or remorse from the server for his forgetfulness. There are plenty of great breakfast spots in Phoenix, and unfortunately this will not be a place we will revisit due to the poor experience."}
{"text":"This was a first and I loved it so much. First, our server Jesse was beyond great. He asked if we had been there before and made recommendations. Food was delicious and so reasonably priced! we finished our food, but were not ready to leave (catching up with a close friend). Jesse offered coffee a couple times. We declined and then finally said yes. He said as he poured our coffee \"It's always nice to have coffee when you're talking...\"
So sweet, because it's so true.  
Nice people and good food.  We had chilaquiles, pancakes, and avocado wrap. 
thank you Jesse!"}
{"text":"Took my father and family here for Father's Day. It was busy which resulted in our food coming out slowly, which I understand. My dad got an omelet with a side of pancakes, I ordered the chicken and waffles, rest of the family also got pancakes and some form of eggs. We put in the order and about 10 minutes later, the waiter came back and told me they were out of chicken and waffles. Mind you, it is 9:30am, no more than a few hours after opening. So I instead ordered the french toast with a side of chicken sausage. The french toast was bland and dry, the chicken sausage was amazing! Whatever the brand, probably the best I have had. Everybody said the eggs were okay, but the pancakes were super dry and had too much vanilla. Do not know if we will return"}
{"text":"We went to Elly's Cafe with 7 adults and two 1.5 year olds.  We didn't have to wait and sat down right away, the service was perfect.  They had Mickey Mouse pancakes for the kids, which was a nice touch.  I ordered a meat lovers scramble and would order that again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.   Had the Chilaquiles.  Amazing.   Busy but spacious.  Staff wonderful and attentive.   Gotta try this spot."}
{"text":"I unfortunately didn't love this place! The location is so amazing and the atmosphere is awesome, however the food was just not that good. I had a veggie skillet that lacked in flavor and didn't really have that many veggies in it. My boyfriend had a sandwich that he said was nothing special either. The coffee and smoothies were fine but nothing to write home about. Maybe if I tried something else on the menu I would feel differently, some of the pancakes and crepes sounded really good. Overall, I would say there's a lot of other breakfast places I will go to before this but I would potentially give it one more shot."}
{"text":"Met here with old friends for Sunday brunch. It was amazing. We sat outside on the patio and it was so perfect (4/9/18). I ordered the corned beef hash with over easy eggs. Delicious! My 3 year toddler twins surprisingly loved it. I ordered for them the berries and marscapone cream crepes but I loved those more than them. I got a hot and iced latte, perfect strong but milky consistency. My friends got a veggie omelette and an eggs Benedict, they thought it was pretty good. It was one of our friends birthday that day and they gave her a choice of two items from their bakery stand inside. It was just a lovely day at Elly's! Thanks to the wait staff!"}
{"text":"You guys, I want to love this place so terribly! I took a picture of my food because it looked amazing. I ordered the Original Eggs Benedict. The eggs were overcooked, so there was no yoke to overflow into the ham and muffin, the English muffin was odd-it was almost as if it was stale (extremely hard, not easy to chew). Ideally I would have loved more sauce. 

I plan on giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"For our first time:

We came in on Sunday around 1:00 pm and were expecting a wait. We were pleasantly surprised to see how big it was on the inside and we didn't have to wait to get a booth. 

The menu is great. It has great a nice variety of skillets, omelets, and breakfast sandwiches. 

I ordered the homemade corn-beef hash and eggs with a side of pancakes. For this particular dish they pair it with a poached egg. I always tend to go with the recommendations of the kitchen and gave it a shot. When my dish came out I cut into the poached egg to see the golden liquid flow out on the white light pillow. The pancakes came out, they were two stacks, and extremely fluffy!! Everything was exactly what I wanted. Yumm factor: very high. 

My dining companion had the meat skillet. It was big, cheesy, crispy hasbrown, and full of meat. Everything you would want in a skillet. He decided to get the pancakes as well which were just as fluffy. 

As far as the logistics goes: 

The restaurant was clean. The staff was very friendly. The owner came by and made us laugh. The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food we ate. The staff worked together to make sure our drinks were filled and our plates were cleared. The services was very satisfactory. 

The only one draw back was the kitchen needs to fine tune exactly what to fire. Our food which was extremely delicious, came out to our table at different times. 

Will we go back?: HECK YES! This restaurant is  close (check), has great staff (check), has great food (check), and great prices (check).

VERDICT: Go and check it out for sure!

BTW: The only reason it is a 4 and not 5 star is the lack of liquor license. I would have loved a Bloody Mary with my breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast! The OJ is fresh squeezed and the coffee ground just prior brewing. All the servings are generous and tasty. The Chilliqueles are fabulous as are the chicken and waffles, pancakes and bacon. The menu is extensive with a little something for everyone. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great vibe
The BEST service - we were served by a lovely short-haired blonde with blue lips, who 1000% went above & beyond
Will def be back. 12/10 recommend"}
{"text":"The first time I visited Elly's I thought it was pretty good. We had friendly service and the food was decent. I ordered the Benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side and I will say, the hollandaise sauce had a nice lemony flavor. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles which he ate, but wasn't overly impressed with. The chicken was a little dry and lacked seasoning.

I returned with my daughter this past Saturday and the service was lacking. I was quickly greeted and my coffee with almond milk was served right away, which was nice. After that, it just went down hill. Our server didn't come around for a while, the door was left open so it was cold and I just felt like we were forgotten about. When our server did approach the table, she seemed rush and she didn't take the order down correctly. I caught the first mistake, but she didn't offer different sides or to bring me water and then I never saw her again. Another person brought our food, which was delivered quickly, but he didn't introduce himself and I don't think we were his table. I ordered the avocado wrap with bacon, but it didn't come with bacon. In addition, the wrap just wasn't that good. It lacked salt and pepper and it came with hasbrowns, which were too greasy to eat plus it wasn't the side I wanted when ordering a whole wheat wrap.

This place is super close to my house and I want to like it so I'll be back again. Hopefully, it was a bad day and it will wow me the next time."}
{"text":"I really like Elly's, the food is great and I've generally always had a good experience here. My one thing is that they should have a text system to let you know when your table is ready. They often have a wait, and it would be nice to wander around all the surrounding shops while waiting for your table."}
{"text":"Great breakfast lots to choose from. Great fast friendly service. The food is exactly why you want. The pancakes are awesome and i normally do not eat pancakes"}
{"text":"Loved Loved Loved Elly's!
From the customer service to the expansive coffee menu to the cute outside patio, brunch was phenomenal.
I tried the omelete with the Cherrywood bacon - Yum!! Tawni, our server was fantastic. She recommended that I try the iced cappuccino with coconut milk and Hazelnut syrup. I honestly do not think I could ever look back. It was a beauty - taste wise and visually. Portion sizes were pretty generous and prices lined up as well. This is an awesome place in a great location. Cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Place is packed for breakfast but the food is good, portions are decent size and the service is outstanding. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I want here for breakfast the other day with some friends. O, my! I just found my favorite breakfast place in town.  Everything is make in real butter and the Benedict was out of this world. I'm thinking about it has I'm writing this.  It is a new restaurant at Central and Camelback. 

Let's just say if you really love breakfast you should go here first before you try any other place out.  It is easy to find and parking is not bad either. 

See you next time Elly's."}
{"text":"Came here this morning to try a new spot, we asked to be seated outside where we waited almost 15 minutes for anyone to even come out. There were servers standing around talking to each other and we made eye contact with more than one of them and still received no service so we left. Decided on Zooks down the lot and it was great. I was excited to try this place but was really disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"This is a new brunch spot located on the corner of central and camelback. It's slightly tucked away behind AJs fine foods. When you walk in the interior decor is very intriguing. My friend and I were immediately seated. The menu has plenty of options to choose from, almost makes it hard to narrow down. I chose the Ole omelet and a classic waffle. My friend chose the corn beef hash with eggs and potatoes. Our server was prompt and efficient and always made sure we were okay. Overall, great new place to come check out if you're in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Went to this little gem on a Sunday. Was in town for some spring training baseball. The place was crowded and the energy was good. I had The Cristo and my girlfriend had the number 5. It was delicious and served fast. Will definitely be back when in Phoenix again. The jelly that comes with the Cristo is a game changer. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time visit, their Corned Beef Hash and Poached Eggs...AWESOME. Service by John was superb.

Stop in, they're not crowded yet, once the word gets out, they'll be PACKED. Located across from Lou Malnati's.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"The P and I enjoy brunch, especially on a holiday weekend when we usually have a little more time and will venture out of North Phoenix to CenPho and explore a new, (and hopefully) favorite place.

Our first choice was closed so Yelp led us here, Elly's.  Located at the corner of Camelback and Central, this area has really turned the corner on hipness. Lou Malnaties is here, a spruced up AJ's, and other boutique stores.

Started off with a cocktail, duh! I've never been into Bloody Marys but decided to change it up today and really was glad I did.  Had the Diablo, extra spicy, two large olives and Ghost Pepper vodka.  The P kept telling me to slow down until breakfast was served, it was a challenge.  Note to Elly, I understand the need to prep the celery and olives to expedite the drinks but my celery was completely wilted and brown, inedible and took away from the experience-but the drink was excellent. P had mimosas and was content as always.

I had the migas frittata; spicy chorizo, avocado, jalapeño, cilantro, etc.  Sounded great on paper, on the plate, just kind of average-a little too commercial, not enough soul for me.  Spicy chorizo and jalapeño screams hot and this little doll was a lukewarm poser.  Completely edible and enjoyable but certainly will never be reordered.  

Elly's menu is incredibly large and I may go back to indulge in some carbs like crepes, pancakes, or waffles. I'd definitely recommend Elly's. She has a great vibe, interesting décor and solid food & cocktails.  The service was excellent and inviting.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good overall. I ordered the meat lovers skillet with a side of berry mascarpone pancakes. The meat lovers skillet came with ham which I was not a fan of but the bacon and the sausage along with the wisconsin cheese were decent. The pancakes were delicious; they weren't the best pancakes in the valley but they were still fluffy and tasty especially with the mascarpone. The coffee was strong the way I like it. The place itself is cute, especially the outside patio overlooking central and camelaback. The servers were wonderful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Kids review \"The kids French toast was really good! I liked the powered sugar and the 2 pieces of French toast were just enough to make me full\" 
There was a mix up as as to if we could call head for a reservation (you can't) but manager Michael and host Justin helped us get it figured out and we were able to sit exactly at our \"reservation \" time. That aside the food way GREAT! I had the veggie omelet and the portion was awesome and the goat cheese was THE BEST! I will definitely be coming back. Tip: get here early to put your name in. Very busy place and for good reason !"}
{"text":"The only thing negative I'd say about the food at Elly's is regarding to the the first time my lady friend and I went there. I got the eggs benny and the English muffin was over toasted to where it was too hard to cut or chew. Aside from that one experience, I've decided to give this place another shot. I've been back 3-4 times since (all spanning in a single month). Having found my new favorite dish, I extremely recommend the Southwest Frittata, side of hash browns and pancakes. Probably the best breakfast in town and at a great price."}
{"text":"Ruined my Mother's Day brunch with my husband and boys. I tried to chalk it up that this is a new place, and it was Mother's Day and very busy. But there was just too much wrong to be able to write it off to those things.  It was chaos and disorganized, every step of the way.  The wait was much longer than the 20 minutes we were told, and when we went to check on how much longer, seemed they had forgotten us, so sat us right away.  Once we had ordered, we waited. And waited. And waited.  Meanwhile, tables that had been sat and ordered after us were getting their orders.  FINALLY our orders came, minus mine.  Everyone else had finished before mine came - after I reminded 2 wait staff I was still waiting on my order.  The manager did come by to say breakfast was on them today - that was nice.  However, when my breakfast finally came, it was NOTHING like the menu described - chilaquiles.  An avocado crudely cut into 3 large parts, and eggs over old mushy corn chips with cheese.  No veggies, salsa, chilies or sour cream.  On corn chips, not wheat chips. Like I said, just too much not to write this review.  The coffee was delicious - they do have that right."}
{"text":"Love this place -- It's now my fave breakfast restaurant.The Buttermilk pancakes were amazing -- perfect in every way and bite. The side of sausage was delish. Our server was spot on -- Love everything about this place. I look forward to trying other entrees on the menu. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations after a recommendation from a friend...it was just okay. Great menu options, but the frittata has way too many hash browns, my friend ordered an egg white omelette and got a regular omelette and they charged me twice for my entire bill - then told me they messed up. Service was just okay. They do have an amazing raspberry sorbet mimosa though, that was the highlight."}
{"text":"Elly's is our favorite neighborhood breakfast place. The portions are generous, the food is outstanding and the service is amazing, especially when Jennifer is your server. Definitely the best place for breakfast or lunch in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"The sweet potato bowl (sweet potato, kale, brown rice, vegan coconut curry and a packed egg) were phenomenal. My husband really enjoyed his avocado wrap(avocado, eggs, pico de gallo and queso fresco). The menu is huge so we will have to come back to try their delicious looking breakfast items."}
{"text":"Elly's is an AMAZING place for breakfast or lunch! It's spacious and inviting on the inside and when weather permits, the outdoor breakfast area is in a really cool, green courtyard. This restaurant really feels like a \"neighborhood hang-out\". The best part of Elly's is that they have an expansive breakfast menu with food that tastes home-cooked. Manager Michael and Wait-Staf Jen make the place feel like you're personal friends with the owner. The other employees seem to genuinely enjoy it there as well. I'd highly recommend this place. It's a little hidden in the Courtyard area of Uptown Plaza on the corner of Camelback and Central (next to AJ's) but well worth the find!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious. I had the  chilaquiles verdes with over medium eggs. Great choice! I will definitely come back. The food is great,the service is excellent,the restaurant looks so cool. And  one of the best cups of coffee I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch so we knew it might be a wait but the 20-25 minute wait was only about 15. The food tasted great and the service was awesome. We received some free pastries just for giving the table next to us some chalula sauce! It was GREAT! I would definitely come back to try more menu options."}
{"text":"I love this place for numerous reasons... the place is empty when ever we go probably because I go later in the day after the rush...the menu has sooo many options but I always try to call an hour before and order the Dutch pancake it's HUGE!! You will definitely want to share it my favorite is the apple... the coffee is delicious it has that donut shop/diner taste which I love ... I always ask for my hash browns extra crispy and they give them to me crispppppy yum! All in all great choices great menu and even more amazing staff!!!"}
{"text":"I like the food and location of this Chicago based breakfast/lunch cafe, but we need a little more Phoenix and a little less Chicago in their approach to beverages.  Here in the parched desert we want our beverages served quickly and refills need to keep coming with large \"to go\" cups when requested (Breakfast Club has this figured out to their customers ' delight). This can be a deal breaker here in metro Phx. Step it up, Elly's and you'll have 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a great trendy place with lots of options. I came for breakfast and the food was decent. I found the atmosphere to be ok a bit on the loud side.  I think the service could be a bit better however it could have been the individual rather than the kitchen. I may return perhaps for lunch see if it's any better"}
{"text":"I was super excited for Elly's to open, but I must admit I was a little disappointed.  

Pros:
No wait on a Sunday morning...think that will change quickly once the word gets out
Bright and airy space...inside and out
Friendly service
Delicious hibiscus herbal tea

Cons:
My egg white veggie omelette with hashbrowns and toast with strawberry jelly was disappointing!  The hashbrowns had no flavor, the mushrooms in my omelette were extremely chewy, the toast was overdone and the omelette really had no flavor at all to it.  

If I come back, I'll definitely try another item in hopes that I just ordered wrong!"}
{"text":"First time at Elly's, what a fab new find for Cenpho breakfast / lunch !!!   Service was extremely excellent .  Nick our server brought the delicious food promptly and kept our coffee hot and refilled.   The spartan eggwhite omelet consists of tomatoes , spinach, shiitakes and feta with hash browns and buttermilk pancakes !   Everything tasted so fresh and homemade.   The European breakfast 
Is Greek yogurt with berries and granola and was beautifully presented and delicious.   The patio is dog friendly.   The space is airy and modern without the pretentious attitude some Cenpho places have ( ahem)

Will be back as a regular !"}
{"text":"Completely Amazing service and food! My waiter was John and he was outstanding. I ordered cornbread hash and it was the best I have ever had. My hat is off to the chef! I hope to return for more next Spring Training. Thanks John..."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is friendly. The wait is sometimes long but it is worth it because the food is so yummy.  I also love the ambiance and location. :)"}
{"text":"This is my third time at this establishment; so obviously I like it, except for today! I ordered the Cristo, which while I had an idea it wasn't a Monte Cristo, I didn't think it would be bad. It was very eggy tasting and the ham was not tender. The waitress was very nice and asked me if I wanted something else. I asked for an almond croissant. She later came back to tell me the croissants are still baking!  It's 7:45AM! Shouldn't they already be baked before the restaurant opens??? I was very disappointed today, not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Our first time here and the experience was fantastic! The place is much bigger than I thought it would be. Bright inside although the chairs aren't super comfy. The servers were friendly and attentive - I never ran out of coffee and I drink decaf. I had the sunrise omelette and it was delicious. We had my grandson with us and he can make a bit of a mess. Our server was patient and pleasant even though the baby spilled the creamer on the floor. Definitely making this a new favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"Our family had a lovely breakfast across the street from our home in Medlock at Elly's and we loved it! What a refreshing break from the 'take a tray and get your own meal' trend!
There is an army of competent servers and managers vigilantly doing their job to serve you. My daughter dropped her napkin and as I raised my hand- the there was a gentleman already handing her a new napkin. Bravo! Thank you for your friendly attention. The food was yum and the atmosphere very warm. We will be back."}
{"text":"Inability to be served due to long wait time ruined my FIRST Mother's Day. On my first Mother's Day myself, my husband, my 3 month old, and one of my best friends decided to try this Chicago transplant out for brunch. I'd seen it on the news that they just opened this location and wanted to give this new location a try. Since I'm a Midwest girl, and Love Chicago, I picked this place to have brunch with my family. I'd visited Elly's in Chicago for brunch and loved it there, so I was expecting the same here---- not so.

Big disappointment. We were on their waiting list for over 40 minutes, when initially told there was a 20 minute wait. When our names weren't called after 40 minutes we went in to check and was told that they are now putting the list of names for people waiting \"on hold\" because their kitchen is backed up on orders, and priority is being given to those with reservations. Now I'm hungry, my infant son is cranky, and we have to find someplace else for brunch. We are  VERY disappointed in the way service was handled."}
{"text":"Delicious food with excellent service. Portions are generous and it is a nice kid friendly environment. We were seated outside which I'm sure helped but the inside looked spacious. We will definitely return next time we are in the neighborhood around breakfast/brunch time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service. Food was amazing. Ordered mom a cappuccino and she said\"Best fu***** cappuccino ever\"...... ."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious! I had French toast and my husband had the Southwest omelette and they were both scrumptious! Lots of seating and quick service."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place based on reviews. Ordered the Eggs Benedict this morning. The two eggs were poached perfectly--but cold. They were sitting on top of a melange of unseasoned mushrooms and chopped tomatoes which was on top of something simply unidentifiable.It looked like a piece of soggy cardboard. It was literally unchewable .I spit it out and I called the waitress over to ask her to identify it and she said it was half a croissant. No way. This did not resemble or taste like anything in the bread group. The Hollandaise sauce was watery and had way too much lemon. Not anything like Hollandaise, it was not as good as  the instant Hollandaise in an envelope you get from the grocery  The hash browns were frozen from a box and also cold.

 I left  the entire mess on my plate and the waitress picked it up with my check without comment. My companion had two pancakes with maple syrup. He said they were o.k. but not any better than Denny's. Also not a fan of the mile high industrial chic ceiling which makes it impossible to carry on a conversation because of the noise. I can't remember when I had a meal so bad I left almost  all  of it on the plate."}
{"text":"Oin a Sunday, there was a 40 min wait. But oh nom noms!!! Their menu is amazing and abundant! Was so hard to choose from so many good choices! I was stuck between the migas frittata and SW frittata. I ended up getting the SW Frittata which consisted of hash browns, tomatoes, bacon, and jalapenos (minus the onions) topped with cheese. It also came with a side of fluffy pancakes or toast. I opted for pancakes. Lord it was so good! I'm craving those pancakes again!!! 
I came with some friends and everyone loved what they ordered. 
They got a salmon bagel, biscuits and gravy, an eggs Benedict, miga frittata, and juevo rancheros.
We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Really great breakfast joint.  Efficient and friendly service.  Huge dining area so there's never a wait to sit down, even on a holiday weekend.

Their extensive menu has something for everyone.  Omelettes are HUGE.  Crepes are also very generous.  If you can wait 30 minutes, there's a dutch baby oven pancake on the menu.  Generous portions for all.

The only thing we didn't care for was the espresso.  It was sour tasting, almost like vinegar. We wouldn't order any espresso drink there again.  Otherwise, we loved Elly's and would come here again."}
{"text":"Went in on a recommendation from a friend. So glad we did! Excellent service and excellent food! Even the baby loved the pancakes!! Can't wait to go back. The menu is large enough we can try new things every time we come!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Elly's since moving to this area, and we finally had a chance to go a few weeks ago! One of my favorite aspects was the atmosphere and the way it looks inside. It kind of reminded me of some of the popular breakfast places in Ocean Beach, which automatically put me in a good mood :) We sat out on the patio, which was decorated in a very cute way as well. It seems like a very family- and pet-friendly place - it was great! The service was also excellent; our waiter was super nice and competent, especially considering it was pretty busy while we were there, too. 

For breakfast I had the Brioche French Toast (plain, no fruit) and it was the best French toast I've had in a while. Simple, but delicious. Their maple syrup was really good, too. My boyfriend had the Southwest Omelette, which he really enjoyed, though he ended up having to pick the avocados out lol. 

They have so much to choose from on the menu here; I can't wait to go back and try something else! The prices are really reasonable, too."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast place. Service could be a tad shaky cuz still new, but the food very worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to reflect the professionalism and courtesy of Michael, the GM of Elly's for reaching out to me regarding my first review regarding the long wait times. I appreciate his consideration in wanting to make things right. I think it's great that the GM of this establishment is so involved in the Yelp community and really appreciates the feedback, that hopefully we'll be able to come in another day to see the progress Elly's has made. Starting/Grand openings can be tricky to staff, while everyone is still adjusting to the flow, but my first impression is that Elly's could really become something special. While we didn't have the ability to eat due to long wait times, we will be back. I encourage everyone to go check out this eclectic yet modern eatery in Phoenix if you're looking for something new. The menu looked nice and the patrons seemed to be enjoying their food. Looking forward to brunch another weekend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new places in Phoenix. I go in at least once a week to enjoy the ole skillet with over medium eggs. So delicious! Must try!"}
{"text":"I waited until my second visit before reviewing because my first trip was opening weekend and I thought they would be working out the kinks. Getting a table is a nightmare. I expect a wait; it's Phoenix and that's just how it goes. What I don't expect is an hour and counting wait on a 20 - 25 estimate. There is also the issue of no real waiting area so people tend to wander and when they do call names it's right in front, so walk away at your own peril. They need to text or have pagers to cut down on the insanity. It's loud. When you have a place packed to the gills do you really need to play loud music in the background?  This just adds to the chaos. A breakfast/brunch spot should be relaxing, not blood pressure raising. It's open and bright as seems to be the trendy thing. The food is good but not nirvanic. The servers are pleasant but the service is awful. There shouldn't be 15 to 20 plates on the pass waiting to go out. The Cook's push food out and it just sits there while the expectant diners are forced to watch it from afar.  Then when the food finally does move of the pass, it shouldn't repeatedly be delivered to tables and then taken back because it's not the right order.  This place should be so much more but it feels like the owner has little to no restaurant management experience based on the processes and doesn't seem to know what to do to improve things. Go somewhere else until they get their act together. The are too many other places out there to put yourself through Elly's."}
{"text":"I stopped in to the restaurant around 2:20 was seated quickly. The women at the front wasn't very warming . ( in fact when a women walked in at 245 she had the look of annoyance on her face.)   - closes at 3:00

My waitress came over quickly and was friendly and seemed in a great mood. She explained the food selection well . 

I ordered everything hard ( well done) as i don't like undercooked, soggy or any chance to get sick. 

Food came and it was fresh and hot. Omelette was well proportioned , potatoes were done correctly. Pancakes were soft ( not hard).. 

AND my sausage was pink..undercooked..PORK !!!! ( That ended my happy thoughts right there. )

Overall.. If the sausage was cooked correctly, i would have given the place a 2 or 3. Its a great location, open spaced, staff ( except the lady at the front) was welcoming..but the food was basic, like your moms cooking.) It has no signature style, no twist or \"elly\" to the food,  the pancakes had no flavor, the syrup was thin.. 

Sorry."}
{"text":"It was OK.  We went at 12:00Pm i had the chicken salad wrap and my friend had the sausage and eggs.  We both had bloody mary's .   It was OK.  SO LOUD.  SO NOISY.  I wouldn't go back. It was Sunday, maybe try it during the week.  They are fixing the parking lot.  Hard to find parking."}
{"text":"Elly's is alright. It's pretty much a paint-by-numbers 'hip brunch chain' but, at least when we visited, they're on their game. They have a large menu that includes skillets, omelettes, french toast/waffles/pancakes, and breakfast sandwiches as well as a few eggs benedict plates. We ordered the steak and mushroom skillet and a morning sunrise omelette. I liked that you can get pancakes instead of toast (we did) and all the food was really up to par."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is clean and organized. The wait staff is friendly and on top of everything. Food was delicious and fresh. Good coffee."}
{"text":"New joint in Uptown Plaza, direct from Chicago. Coffee was strong, which is exactly how it is supposed to be. My server, Nick, was cool and attentive at just the right frequency  (And he laughed at my jokes. A+). The food was great, especially the pancakes. I've had many a flapjack in my life and these rank at the top,  neck and neck with Dupar's in LA. These babies might be better because they are tasty and the right size , not hubcap-sized like Dupar's.  Elly's pancakes are slightly crispy  outside and so fluffy inside. Yum! Oh, and check out the chicken sausage. You will be surprised at the deliciousness. My new favorite spot? Might be."}
{"text":"I have to admit that this might be one of our new favorite breakfast places.  The service was fast and our server John took good care of us.  We had the Denver omelet and the veggie omelet which had wild mushrooms, tomato, onion and goat cheese.  Both were delicious!  The stringy hash browns were awesome too.  The sourdough artisan toast was amazing!!!   The portion size was huge and a great value for a breakfast meal.  Try this place, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Omelette, crepes, avocado wrap, 3/3. Starting to believe there isn't one thing I won't like here, always pretty open restaurant when I've visited, been sat promptly and our service has been quick as well as our food preparation time. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I went for Sunday morning breakfast and we were very pleased with our experience. The service was excellent, food great, coffee (both regular and decaf) were very good and nice and hot. My husband had an olé omelet with hash browns and whole wheat toast. I am vegan and ordered the sweet potato bowl (it had diced sweet potatoes, brown rice with kale mixed in and vegan coconut curry). It also came with a poached egg which I ordered to be placed on the side. Portions were more than adequate. I'm glad we got there early (about 9) as the place filled up quickly. We'll definitely go back to Elly's again!"}
{"text":"So today was my 3rd time here. I have tried 3 different entrees and eaten bites of other items including the big apple pancake. Have yet to find anything I did not like. Possibly because I don't go to breakfast later than 7 I have never had poor service and of course at that hour no wait time. I did notice we had no trouble conversing over the music this time. Only one little gripe, by the time the toast gets to the table it won't melt the somewhat soft butter. That is something that many restaurants have a problem with. It is a restaurant I have recommended to others and I'm sure my friends and I will return again."}
{"text":"First time here and it's a must try. The venue is bigger than I thought and not visible from the street but its the busiest business around. The place was packed and had quite a line but managed to get everyone in and out quickly; We waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated (party of 2). The waitress , whose name we never got, was excellent. She attended us quickly, answered our questions and we had our food on our table just half an hour after arriving. My brother ordered French toast w/ hash browns which he seemed to love very much, along with a freshly squeezed orange juice. I ordered a (northwest or southwest) omelette w/ hash browns and some pancakes along with a beetilicious smoothie . The pancakes,smoothie and hash brown were great but the omelette was the only thing that wasnt satisfying, The eggs texture was more foam than it was a solid. And that's why they get a four star."}
{"text":"My party of 7 went there on Monday, which was memorial day. I had called ahead and to our surprise they had our table ready when we arrived. My husband and I both ordered Matcha Lattes, and after about 12 minutes of waiting our waiter informed us they were out, that was a big disappointment! I decided to get a mimosa instead of another hot drink. The mimosa was tasty but came in a very small glass, literally about 3 sips. Our waiter didn't get couple of our orders right and took some time to fix. Food was good, nice ambiance, but service wasn't great & took almost 2 hours to be done with our brunch."}
{"text":"I saw that this place recently opened near my apartment so my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. The menu has so many yummy sounding things it was tough to pick out what to order! I eventually decided on a nutella banana crepe with an iced nutella latte and my boyfriend got eggs benedict on biscuits and a mint white hot chocolate. We both loved our food and our drinks. The service was great. The restaurant is very spacious with a nice outdoor seating area. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. This may just be our new go-to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Re-rate from original two stars. Gave this place a second chance for brunch recently and service was stellar. Appears elly's has fixed their hostess and communications issues we experienced before.  We will most likely continue to visit.  Amazing pancakes! Good food."}
{"text":"Really good brunch spot. I got the classic breakfast with ham off the bone and pancakes, everything tasted great! My friend got a Latina omelette and she loved it, my boyfriend got the verde chilequilas and was a little overwhelmed by the taste, just ordered the wrong thing but the ingredients all looked very fresh. Their cold brew is REALLY good. Loved their hash browns and they even ask if you want them extra crispy! (This isn't Denny's, their normal cooked hash is good enough to me). The vibe, location, and dining layout was great. They have a tight patio area but it's really nice. SERVICE WAS GREAT, THANK YOU RALF! We'll be returning :)"}
{"text":"This is an adorable small chain that is just nice enough to be bougie while still retaining a bit of Waffle House diner charm.  The pancakes are amazing, they have real maple syrup instead of Breakfast Syrup and the fluffy pancakes absorb it all without falling apart.  The mushrooms in my steak and shrooms skillet were cooked PERFECTLY.  I will seek this place out the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Got right in..lots of seating(thank you). Good food. Very tasty breakfast which came out unbelievably fast. Got my medium poached eggs right. Service was excellent and friendly. Looking forward to trying more menu items in the future."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Phoenix! I've been there twice now and they have amazing egg dishes and great pancakes topped w bananas and strawberries (option). I like that you can get a crepe as an option vs toast or pancakes. 

Hopefully they will expand locations and open near the 51 and Shea in the newly renovated plaza! Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"So much to chose from; great breakfast place. Generous portions."}
{"text":"I love this cute little brunch spot.  I've had breakfast here a few times.  It's bright and cheery with lots of room for those busy days.  The service has always been spot on and very attentive.  I've had the crepes and mostly stuck with them since they are so delicious.  I've also had the avocado wrap.  So good!  I love finding spots were I can get delicious food and coffees for a leisurely morning of hanging with friends or being able to hang out and write and read.  This will definitely be on breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Service is amazing!!! We always feel so welcomed when we arrive. Food is wonderful and ambience is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I briefly lost my faith in pancakes at Elly's. Rubbery. Devoid of flavor. I left shaken."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite breakfast locations now! I ordered the tropical chia and I was on the edge because I had never tried ginger in a smoothie and it was delicious! Then I had the breakfast sandwich and I did not leave a single bite left. My friend ordered an omelet, pancakes, and a coffee and her plate was perfect as well. They have so many options for breakfast and I look forward to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The service is great as is the food.  The portions are large and delicious.  They make every effort to make your food however you want it.  We have eaten there now 5 times and will be back."}
{"text":"Tucked back in shopping center took a bit to find. Coffee was delicious and the staff attentive. Ate  there about a week ago.  Breakfast was really good and came with pancakes. Had to get a doggie bag.  Plenty of room so you don't feel like people are on top of you when you eat. Also open and airy. Great spot for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Elly's more than 5 stars! My boyfriend and I have come to agree that this brunch cafe is our favorite breakfast spot. We almost always try a different dish with each visit and are consistently satisfied. They have a very broad menu that - anyone could find something they like easily, both breakfast or lunch! They also have a delicious juice/espresso bar at the front of the restaurant for walk-up service or to order from during a sit-down meal. The service has always been fantastic! The staff of this place clearly work as a team and are happy at their jobs. Always happy to start my day at Elly's :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic fast service! Came in to try this place on a Saturday morning around 11 expecting to wait for a table but we were immediately seated and our food came out quickly. Great food for decent prices. Will definitely be returning. Cappuccino was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here....  I must say all the pictures on yelp do not do it justice, this place has great 90's music playing and a fun atmosphere. Our waitress Debbie was Amazing!!!  She has such a great positive attitude and provided great service, she was on point.  We came here to celebrate our cousins 1st wedding Anniversary and I was worried that this place was going to be a bust.  BUT I was greatly Impressed, the food was delicious and on point on how we ordered it.  When we come back into town again, we will visit again."}
{"text":"We've been to Elly's twice. First, we brought our kids (9 & 3) on a weekend morning and the second time, I came by myself on a weekday morning.

Major plusses-
- the place is huge so the likelihood that you'll have to wait a half an hour or more to get a table is really small. 
- location is terrific.
- each of the times we were here the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming.

Elly's doesn't read hipster to me at all. It reads as a classic breakfast joint, kid friendly, straightforward.

Unlike a lot of our breakfast places around town, which I also love by the way, Elly's is really classic (not in the French way) in terms of menu. You won't find any wild and crazy concoctions here.

Yes, the menu is extensive, but it is comprised of just a handful of essential ingredients changed up for different menu items.

Skillets and scrambles
Benedicts
Pancakes, crepes, and waffles
A couple different kinds of bread
And a variety of veggies, meats, and cheeses to satisfy any palette

We really liked the food. My kids loved their crepes and pancakes. My over medium eggs were cooked perfectly, which is typically not the case elsewhere. 

If you keep your expectations simple, Elly's is easy to enjoy and perfect for a close-by family breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was warm and welcoming. Service was great and our server was friendly and checked on us multiple times. 

I ordered the \"Elly's health club 9\" and the meal in itself was good, and tasty, what surprised me is that the fruit was a slice of melon, slice of honeydew and slice of watermelon. Would have been great if it was a a large bowl with assorted fruit. 

I ordered a Bloody Mary and that also was not up to regular Bloody Mary standards, event the server said she'll put more spice in it and with that it wasn't spicy at all, and tasted a bit watery and bland. 

I'll give it another try and order another menus item and a drink. Hopefully it'll be better."}
{"text":"We LOVE Elly's!!!!! Their skillet breakfasts are fantastic and the staff are super perso"}
{"text":"Was disappointed. I didn't find what I was hoping to have on the menu. It was breakfast and had to wait for coffee.  Finally ordered oatmeal.  Paid $4 ($2 for each item ordered) extra for pecans and berries.  I can honestly say that TOTAL there was not 1/4 cup of berries and pecans.  The strawberry was sliced up and there could not have been two whole strawberries.  I counted 2 pecans and a couple of pieces of pecans.  Seriously!  
The oats were mushy, overcooked and watery.  I was very disappointed.  The place was clean and tidy, attractive.  Music too loud.  
Sorry, I'll probably not return.  Flower Child down the parking lot has AMAZING avocado toast with perfectly cooked poached (my choice) eggs.  First watch down the street has one of the best breakfast menus in all of Phx.  Check them out."}
{"text":"So good!! I had the Ole Omelet with pancakes and it was amazing! You can tell everything is made from scratch especially the bread, jelly, and syrup! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"With no shortage of breakfast locations along Camelback, any new place has to really be impressive.

Well, Elly's is!

Elly's is tucked back in the corner of the Uptown Plaza on Central and Camelback (near Lou Malnatis & Creamistry). Don't let the size fool you, there is actually a lot of space inside and we have never waited more than 15 minutes for a table.

The menu is fairly extensive and includes pancakes, waffles, omelettes, frittatas, sandwiches and salads. There is also a coffee/tea bar with lots of delish options.

I've had the morning omelette (pictured) and the corned beef hash, both of which were phenomenal! I would say the corned beef hash was the best thing I have had. They have gluten free options as well, the pancakes were great! Someone else at our table had a frittata (also pictured) and said it was really good as well. 

What's even better, Elly's is one of the cheaper breakfast spots in the neighborhood and the staff is terrific! Definitely would recommend Elly's."}
{"text":"I love Chicago anything and this place being from Chicago I really wanted to try.
It was very disappointing.
I ordered classic buttermilk pancakes and that's it, nothing fancy which is very rare for me but they didn't even cook them, the outside was over cooked and separating from the center and the center was cake batter. I sent it back, they offered to give me something free from the baked goods but I declined. my cousin ordered some dish without bacon and it showed up with bacon and his pancake was under cooked in the middle also, wont be back."}
{"text":"Great food and hospitality.  I would recommend this place. Got the Ole Omelet, and the hash browns where cooked perfectly. I was greeted right when I walked into the door, and was greeted while sitting down by several people aside from the waitress."}
{"text":"Spontaneous breakfast, found this place. Staff were super nice, food was delicious, big menu with lots of options. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Never go back no taste at all on the food put a little salt goes a long way this restaurant is not gonna last more likely to go out business in the next couple months if they keep up with this"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this place. We were seated quickly and our server was friendly and personable but the food was just not good. My husband ordered a simple breakfast with eggs, sausage, hash browns and pancakes. The hash browns were undercooked and everything else was just fair. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and I get some people would say how simple that is and how expectations should be low but living in Central Phoenix I have had some mind blowing breakfast sandwiches. The eggs seemed mass produced and were not at all seasoned. The bread was completely dry and when I asked for an aioli or sauce they had nothing, offered mayo. Who doesn't have aioli?? After attempting to create my own \"sauce\" I ate the bacon off and called it good. I don't care for hash browns so the server offered fries and I accepted. Again, no seasoning and even after adding salt and pepper (which I never do to fries) they were still not good. Most places I would be willing to come back to try something different but if you can't even get the basics right I doubt you can do better. Very sad because the location is awesome."}
{"text":"Walked in at 8:45 am on a Sunday knowing we may before the church rush. We were. Elly's was much bigger than we expected. We were greeted at least three times by the host and several others engaged about our morning. Very nice. Noticed a German pancake on the menu, but the prep time is 45 minutes. Hmmmm. We ordered that to go as we ordered other food for the table. BTW orange juice was fresh squeezed and SWEET! Get what you are craving. It's all prepared well. Will be back as a staple when we visit our college student. Ten minutes from GCU. German pancake was crispier than expected based on a traditional Pancake House, but very good. Don't know that I would wait 45 minutes to be served. Perhaps call ahead?"}
{"text":"Let me be clear...the 2 stars is for the service..not the food. The food is delicious!!! We had the classic breakfast, classic waffles, and the corned beef hash and they were phenomenal! However, the service made the experience not that great. The host was the most helpful person there! He sat us quickly, got us our drinks and when we had been waiting for 20 minutes for our waiter to come he took it upon himself to get our order because he noticed we had been waiting a long time. When our waiter finally showed up there was no greeting, no apology for taking forever, just dropped off our food and walked away. Didn't check back with us if we needed anything and then magically appeared later on with the check and wasted no time taking our bill. I understand being very busy as the restaurant certainly was but a little courtesy to your customers when you make them wait goes a long way. If it weren't for the host taking care of us while doing his very busy job of seating the large number of people coming in, we would have gotten up and walked out."}
{"text":"Great little place for brunch!! Mimosas are a tad overpriced for the size but that won't stop me from coming back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after a workout.  It was terrific, had the chicken sausage - yum."}
{"text":"I recently visited Elly's for my first time and enjoyed my breakfast, coffee and excellent service. I have been back two additional times with friends for brunch and I plan on coming back for more delicious food, coffee and great service."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a new restaurant in my neighborhood with an early opening, but I made two huge mistakes on my first visit.

One mistake was coming alone, and the other was walking on a summer morning. The staff seated me but apparently decided my sweaty, single self wasn't a legit customer, as with the restaurant 80% empty, they simply didn't serve me. No water, no coffee, no \"be just a minute,\" no \"any questions about the menu?\" -- every staffer acted as if I were invisible. Clear intent was to get me to leave, so I did.

If you feel your look and pedi can pass the Elly's Test, be warned that the place is LOUD and feels like a hipster cafeteria. Intimate conversation? Not gonna happen. Working on your laptop or tablet? Good luck with that! 

(My pedicure actually has reached the state of being kind of gross, but I'm putting my feet UNDER the table, not on it, and I'm expecting to be brought coffee, not have my toes sucked.)

The menu is basic chi-chi upscale farm-raised stuff, so if you sleep in, just go to Flower Child at the front of the same plaza."}
{"text":"Elly's hit the spot. Came here with a group of 8 and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. The little piggy in me loves that you can get a pancake on the side instead of toast. My omelet was basic (egg white veggie) but good. The iced coffee I ordered was superb. Our server was patient and attentive, quick to explain items on the menu and quick to bring the check.

I can see this in my brunch rotation once they get a liquor license."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The avocado wrap was delicious and the salsa way great. My nephew's pancakes were light and fluffy, he loved them. 
Only issue was the noise. Busy restaurants are loud,  but this was a little much."}
{"text":"Great food and service.   Really happy they decided to come to Phoenix.   Reluctant to give this 5-star review because I don't want this place to get super crowded....  but it will"}
{"text":"Love the music and vibe at this brunch spot. Been a couple times and both times have been delicious. The staff is very friendly and the food is reasonably priced. Like the casual environment. Lots of seating."}
{"text":"Meh. The food was mediocre at best. The French toast was merely bread barely dipped in egg with a scoop of cold mascarpone in the center. The avocado bene looked like my 7 yr old niece made it for me. The poached eggs were cooked with a hard yolk and the mushrooms had a chewy as if they weren't cooked all the way texture. The hash browns were bland. My bf order a vanilla latte that looked like straight vanilla milk. The service was great but I need good food too to make me want to come back again. Snooze is way better and worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is definitely a solid place for breakfast/brunch. It is spacious and airy, the service was top notch and the menu is extensive. I ordered the Provance Benedict and my dad got the Chilaquilles and we were both impressed and satisfied with the meal. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"First time to try this place. They are busy this Sunday morning, the staff was very welcoming and attentive, and there were a lot of cooks which ensured the orders were coming out fast. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and ordered the eggs over medium as opposed to the suggested scrambled on the menu. The hash browns came out nice and crispy, the huevos rancheros were arranged in an orderly fashion, stacked like pancakes. The salsa was not the usual fresh tomato salsa version but a roasted chile like chipotle style. The stack consisted of layers of eggs, wheat tortillas, black beans, queso fresco and avocado. The taste was good but the reason for the 3 star is the food was cold in the middle."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best breakfast/brunch places I have had in some time. The place is very clean and very friendly. The food is amazing!!!! The waffles and pancakes are so good they just melt in your mouth. We will definitely be coming back to try out more plates. Top service and food. Great job!"}
{"text":"Came back here with co-workers and family 3 separate times and each time I was disappointed. Meals weren't the same, the wait was horrible only to get inside and see half the restaurant empty and our waiter seemed to not want to be there, unfortunately we got the same waiter 2 out of the 3 visits back.

Would I come back? Sure, are they my top choice for recommendations? Not so much..and I raved about them initially."}
{"text":"Ok ... tried it again.  It's still 2 stars.  The food just isn't good.  Toast served cold along with cold butter.  Sorry Elly I won't be back."}
{"text":"Miga frittatas were amazing. Pancakes tastes like waffle cones (delicious). Service was okay, they forgot one of our drinks, but the food was really spectacular. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place was so good! The service was amazing, our server was so nice. I got the steak and mushroom scramble and it was what dreams were made of. The perfect marriage of tastes. I also got a side of pancakes. I am bariatric so I can't eat very much and the portions were huge so I had food for days! My friend got the veggie scramble and that was also amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today ordered Gravalax which turned out to be  bagel cream cheese and lox.It was done nicely came with hash browns...only 9.00 which is a great price..very deserving of the 5 stars"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this Phoenix Uptown/Midtown breakfast & lunch place but I really can't. Been there a total of 4 times since they've opened and have experienced nothing but subpar service and meal quality. I'm 100% convinced they cannot cook an egg other than scrambled. Other than the hosts and hostesses, I'm also convinced the waitstaff is huffing ether in the back of house. As somebody who frequently visits independent restaurants, it's clear that this place will not last. I give them another 18 months tops before having to shut their doors... unless they come to reality and deliver what Phoenix wants. This isn't Chicago, people... sorry."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect brunch place! If your just visiting Phoenix like me and just wanna have some good breakfast this is the place to go! The Oj is fresh and the coffee! The food is amazing, I highly recommend to go to this place and the scenery is beautiful! Love it"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place as THE place to get shredded (not cubed) hash browns that are nice and crispy (my favorite!) and so I hurried on over and ordered a basic two egg over medium (perfectly cooked) with bacon (delicious!), hashbrowns and an English Muffin. It was all perfect! The hashbrowns were incredibly good, the bacon is really thick and perfectly cooked, and everything just tasted like a real breakfast. The waiter was so enthusiastic about my simple order, and the atmosphere, although in a large space, felt really nice to me. I highly recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great lil brunch place!! The skillets and the omelletes are delicious! The dutch oven pancake is a must try too!"}
{"text":"I saw this recommended somewhere, so I went on a whim. I am so glad I did. I had huevos rancheros and it's an excellent treatment of an old standard. There are so many menu choices I will have to return. My server, Carlos, was attentive and lots of help."}
{"text":"Great hostess, juice Coffey girl is always so helpful and knowledgeable. Food on point so much food. John waiter very attentive"}
{"text":"I'm new to town so I am exploring many restaurants in the area. Elly's was a nice place for brunch. I did not wait for a table and everyone was very friendly throughout the entire experience. The breakfast sandwich and hash browns were excellent! I also got the banana Nutella crepes, those were a disappointment. There was not even Nutella on them and the weren't very flavorful. So overall a good experience. I would recommend sticking with the savory items and not the sweet."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great food, ambience, and service. Prices are very affordable for what you get. This is easily one of my new favorite brunch spots."}
{"text":"I found this place because a friend tagged it on fb.  My friend and I tried it today with our 5 children.   I had the banana nutella crepes with a side of bacon.  The bacon was perfect and the crepes were amazing even my kids enjoyed finishing them for me!  My friend had the chilaquiles verde and said they were very good he didnt even leave any for me to try!  All the kids ordered the mickey/minnie mouse pancakes.  Those came with whipped cream and pineapples and strawberries.  Very big serving so the kids didnt finish them.  I would have given 5 stars but the kids food was served after our food.  My recommendation would be to ensure all kids food is brought out first.  The kids were grabbing at our food while they waited for theirs.  Then when their food came out we had 5 plates of pancakes to cut up so our food was getting cold in the meantime.  Otherwise loved the place!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed about the food quality the service was good, but I was sad to see that there wasn't as much a crowd on a Sunday after church. Our French toast was dry and the pancakes ware less than flavorful.   My eggs on the Benedict were a bit over done.   We will try to come again  and hope everything has improved."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our brunch here last week. We came at an off time (2 pm) on a Saturday so we were seated right away. There were still plenty of patrons in the restaurant at that time.

The cold brew was smooth and delicious - no cream or sugar needed. My other half got the Wild Mushroom & Steak Skillet - the meat was moist, tender, flavorful and juicy. (Umm, can I have a plate of that only please?). I ordered the Benedict on the croissant with Portabella mushrooms and veggies. This was light and tasty, the hollandaise had a nice tang to it.

Will be back to try other menu items. Perhaps the Mascarpone crepes, but definitely another one of the Wild Mushroom & Steak Skillets (hold the hash).

Service was friendly and quick without making us feel rushed."}
{"text":"First time at the Arizona location. The restaurant is huge, modernish looking. Host was very welcoming, the restaurant was nearly empty on a Tuesday morning around 730. The food was good. I got the waffle and eggs, my boyfriend got the egg sandwich which comes with a huge portion of hash browns. He said the sandwich was really good, he also got a side of the brioche French toast. He said my waffle tasted better then the French toast, nothing to write home about. We will be back when we have more time to try the German pancake (takes 30 min to bake). Our server was very attentive, great service.




Gave this restaurant another try. We tried the Dutch baby, the country benedict and the regular Benedict. The server seemed to forgot about out Dutch baby (I know they take awhile to cook) but we ordered the Dutch baby as soon as we sat down. Then once he came back to take our order we ordered the bene's. The server cleaned up our plates and asked if we needed anything else and we said our Dutch baby. He looked like he had that \"oh crap look.\" Not saying he forgot to put the order in because he brought us syrup at the beginning, but we did have to wait about 20-25 more minutes after finishing our food for the Dutch baby to come out. Country bene was good, my boyfriend thought the gravy could be better. He said the Dutch baby was cooked perfect tho. We came Saturday about 9 and it was very busy, no wait quite yet but almost full."}
{"text":"I was very excited for a new brunch option near us so I am very sad to write this.  The location is great as we visit flower child once or twice a week.  They were very busy on a Sunday and the waitress was working hard but she didn't ask us how the food was.  I could tell she was a good and seasoned waitress so I assume others have had my experience and she didn't want to deal with it.  We were in a rush so we did not voice our food issues with management.

We all left sizeable portions of our meals uneaten because it was just bad.  My wife's eggs benedict was overpoweringly lemon flavored, eggs were cooked all the way through and hash browns were tasteless.  My 4 & 6 year old's eggs tasted like they had no salt or butter and were runny.  Pancakes were also overdone and crispy.  They also didn't like their hash browns.  I had chicken and waffles and the waffle was good but the chicken was so fatty I couldn't believe it.  They might have been the fattiest chicken legs I have ever eaten.  

I can't remember the last time that none of my family had a good meal.  The restaurant was very busy and we waited a while so I was hopeful to get quality food.  Maybe I'll give it another try in the future and see if they've worked out their issues but for now I cannot recommend :("}
{"text":"Breakfast was wonderful! Amazing portions ! The staff was friendly and welcoming. Coming back for sure ! Cornbeef & hash amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on New Years Eve and first thing worth noting is how fast i was seated. I requested a table for two and although very full, i was seated within 5 minutes. 

The location is very open and family friendly.  Moderate noise is very accurate. The large open seating helps drown out the noise though. The menu isn't too big which is a good thing sand made it easy to order. I got the Latina omelette and a Bloody Mary while a friend got a mimosa. 

Drinks were a little pricy for the size, but the dishes were very filling. The pancakes on the side were decent. The dish was filling but mediocre in general. The waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We got the check in a timely fashion and were out of there.

In conclusion, i would come back but i would definitely get something else and hold off on the special drinks."}
{"text":"Tried it for breakfast yesterday.  Their breakfast items are extensive and fairly priced.  Their coffee is their own blend and good.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I'll be returning when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome food and relatively inexpensive. We had the pancakes and country benedict. I would definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"Wow. We were pleased with everything. Chessa was our server and she is prompt, friendly and funny. Gave great recommendations to us. She said the hollandaise was excellent   I ordered it and she is right. My Provence Benedict was awesome. 
Hubby got the Meat Lover's Skillet and loved it. Chessa said the make the best pancakes so my hubby had them instead of toast. They are amazing. Light fluffy and easy to overeat. 
It will be our breakfast joint from now on."}
{"text":"We went for the first time on Father's Day.  My first thumbs down is they should have dedicated wheel chair tables in the front of the restaurant, so you don't have to navigate the entire place on four wheels. The food was ok, not much flavor except for the salt and pepper I added. And last I know it is seems to be the trend now, but the noise level is way to loud.  You should not have to yell across the table to have a conversation with you fellow guests."}
{"text":"My GF and I were super excited to try a new brunch place in the valley after we watched a show about pancakes. We found this place as a possible restaurant to satisfy our taste buds but it was a great let down. The service was horrible. We got sat immediately and waited another 10 minutes to get our water and another 5-10 for our server to take our orders. After our waitress took our order, it was another 30-40 mins to wait for our order...I understand if I were at an steak house or super fancy establishment that has several courses but its unreasonable to wait this long for breakfast food. The host tried to mitigate the long wait with a piece of pastry that we did not even ask for when our food arrived. What's the point of that? Why not offer something in between? Even though this happened yesterday, I'm still slightly irritated. Please make your service more efficient or give proper updates, so your future patrons can order accordingly."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place just opened and it crowded!! 

I ordered the vegetarian omelette with hash brown on the side. I hardly touched it. my omelette was way too cheesy and the hash brown was so greasy and runny. 
I also ordered the French toast. It was really good, we enjoyed it with the fresh fruits on top. 

I would like to give his place another chance."}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat for brunch for sure. Just know the chicken and waffles come with all drumsticks."}
{"text":"Arrived when restaurant and patio were not full, but it took fifteen minutes to get a glass of water.  The wait person was either confused or stoned.  We had four conversations about me getting a cup of tea, which finally arrived halfway through breakfast and was an unidentifed brown bilge.  Food was mediocre.  Best I can say is the patio is nice and shaded."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. I came here with two friends. The hostess seemed to be having a private conversation on the phone so couldn't greet me. A waitress standing behind her greeted me but she seemed a little odd. I asked to sit outside and she rudely told me that my party was too large to sit on the patio. Ok. So we sat inside. Even though no one was in the restaurant in took her an insanely long time to bring waters and coffee. 

When the food arrived I immediately noticed a hair in my hashbrowns. I had the hair on the fork and I was holding it up to show her at which time the waitress rudely and loudly shouted \"well, don't eat it!\". Ok, why would I eat  a hair? Clearly she was just being a jerk.

Then the bill came and it appeared I was being charged for my meal but not my coffee. Ok, I thought, usually restaurants comp your meal if a hair was in it but maybe she just comped my coffee? Wrong. She didn't comp anything. When she noticed she didn't charge my coffee she took the bill back and re- did it! You've got to be kidding me! Won't be coming back.."}
{"text":"Wow! Fairly new restaurant. We stopped in with family for Sunday morning breakfast and found it delicious, quick, great wait staff, no waiting for a table (we got here at 9 am). Portions are generous and tasty! We really enjoyed it. Outdoor seating available too."}
{"text":"Located in Windsor square. Great food options! The smell as you walk in make you hungry! Had a good overall experience and the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the neighborhood. The food is delicious and the service is always on point. There's just a certain happy vibe you get when dining here. We always leave with a smile. Oh and if you are looking to get in the Christmas spirit, come soon! The decorations and music are so fun!!"}
{"text":"You know how I love brunch, and this place does it right. The husband and I ate at Elly's shortly after they opened. We were impressed with their service and their food. Our waiter had great suggestions on what to order. On his recommendation, I got the ole skillet and oh em gee it was tasty! The chorizo was spicy, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the portion was huge.... and, on top of all that, it came with a freakin pancake! For real. The prices are average for brunch (we spent around 30$ for the two of us after everything).  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good. The service was decent and the menu has everything from sweet to savory. I think they are applying for a liquor license so a mimosa will be a nice addition next time."}
{"text":"This one hurts. I really wanted to love this place...I'll just get to it.

Provence Benedict...basically avocado and croissant. I love croissants but it was not balanced well. They should cut it down or make them smaller so it doesn't dominant the whole dish.

$7 mimosas??? Umm ok..I guess. But when it's 5oz glasses 40% juice...come on now.

Our server was nice but seemed to be disinterested and bored. A matter of fact everyone looked miserable to be working. It was ok. Nothing to get really excited about."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast the other day and was pleasantly surprised at how many delicious brunch items to choose from. I started off w a raspberry cooler which is a mimosa but w raspberry juice and a raspberry sorbet scoop plopped into it! What a change from the standard mimosa! And sooo good!! The sorbet added a new taste to the mimosa! Definitely hooked.

My husband got the mushroom omelet in egg whites and I got the Santa Fe omelet which comes w avocado and bacon and you get a choice of toast or pancakes! How awesome is this? W no extra charge, I got the pancakes. Everything was very tasty! Service was impeccable and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town! We are big time foodies and I have been looking for the best French toast in town, after years of searching I found it!  My husband got the meat skillet and loved it.  We can't wait to go back to try everything on the menu which is rare with us!  Ashley our server was great, helpful and so friendly!"}
{"text":"I think Elly's is great for visitors and wait times that aren't too bad. I like that they have a wide ranging breakfast menu. I went here for the first time for lunch and had a Reuben sandwich that was just OK. My mom had the healthy protein plate with cottage cheese, eggs, etc. That was simple and plain. I went back a second time last week for brunch. I had been eating a lot of eggs and potatoes in recent days. So I didn't want that if I could help it. But I didn't want oatmeal either. I was pleasantly surprised to find a healthy breakfast bowl of brown rice, sweet potatoes, kale and coconut curry. It was actually tasty and I liked the taste of cumin.

Their patio is a little cramped, especially if you have a dog. But I like that they have one at all. The entire restaurant is pretty big so I think that helps with the wait time not being too bad on weekends. I didn't see groups waiting for too long. Of course, if this place becomes like another Snooze AM, that could change.

The service is decent. When I was there last, almost an hour had passed and we still didn't have our food. Luckily, took me a while to notice because I was engrossed in conversation with my friend. Well, it turns out their printer ran out of paper and so our order never got printed out. Our female server could not have been more contrite. She said \"of course there will be a discount.\" We got 50 percent off our bill. I think that was fair. 

Basically, I could see going here with a group or a couple visitors. But the food isn't anything that will knock the socks off."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super friendly staff, fresh baked pastries great coffee bar and now they serve alcohol.  Oh and the food is fabulous.  The eggs benedict is great and the ham and egg crescent sandwich. Oh and the crepes......"}
{"text":"Great customer service. The first time we visited we didn't have the greatest experience, but the manager made up for it and we decided to try it again.

Went for breakfast and couldn't be happier! Amazing pancakes, great turkey sandwich, and the chicken noodle soup was great!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area over the Christmas break and was looking for a brunch spot before heading home. The reviews did not disappoint. 

They catered to every modification on our orders without any push back. When we asked for a change the response was always, \"sure, no problem\". I really love this attitude! 

The food was tasty. The omelettes were cheesy and well prepared. Tastes fresh and there wasn't an overload of grease as some places tend to have. The pancakes were light fluffy and tasty. The one drawback was the Nutella was not Nutella, but watered down and perhaps even caramelised a bit, tasty nevertheless buy not what I wanted. 

Overall top notch place. Great service, great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"So happy so see more neighborhood alternatives to lgoNo! Much better pkg & worth drive! Glad to see more Chicago based cos out here too..."}
{"text":"Incredible brunch, all we've ordered is breakfast, but the breakfast is excellent. Large portions, reasonable prices, from omelets to pancakes to French toast, it's very tasty."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it open and have not stop. The chilaquiles are my favorite and then the egg Benedict's a close second and the avocado wrap as well. The waffles are amazing and the americanos are great as well. Get there early or expect long waits."}
{"text":"It was a very good breakfast. Confusing when you first walk in if the hostess is is not at the front door. Very nicely decorated. Lots of room in the dining room with comfortable chairs and tables. I love the classic buttermilk pancakes. I had the southwest omelet which was very good. The service is excellent. I will be back here again for pancakes, omelet and cofffe"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! The service is great, the restaurant is really clean and cute, and the food is delish -- AND a great price. I'd definitely come here again. When it's a bit cooler, I'll sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"I love this place !!!! Awesome place to eat and the staff is so sweet. Also not pricy at all. Clean and very welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped in for Sunday brunch to take my parents somewhere local and I must say we were blown away! The service was beyond exceptional and the food was also delicious. Prompt service with surprisingly no wait. Our waiter John, was one of the best waiters I have had for breakfast/brunch. I will definitely be back, this is a perfect spot to impress out of town guests or and brunch cocktails with friends."}
{"text":"Have you ever tried to make an omelet only to have it turn into scrambled eggs during the flip? That is exactly how this place feels, and also how my \"omelet\" was presented. Came to check out the new place with husband and new baby for brunch and was underwhelmed. Thankfully there was no wait, they sat us at a bigger table to accommodate for our infant carrier and the cold brew was yummy! Unfortunately, my omelet was essentially scrambled eggs arranged in a log and the hash browns were overcooked on the outside and almost raw in the middle. My breakfast came with a side of pancakes which were decent, nothing to write home about. The restaurant is huge inside, but felt awkward only being about a third full. The service was a little slow, I think the staff was still trying to figure things out. Ultimately, I would say skip the visit here and stick with a tried and true."}
{"text":"I am all about service, and places that understand this concept. This is one of those places with a manager who truly understand this principle. 

Our experience started out great then kept going the wrong direction on service. Once I brought up our declining situation to their attention they took complete responsibility right away. They apologized immediately and explained what the situation and issue was that caused the shift in our service. The recovery from the Staff and Manager completely exceeded my expectations, they went way beyond what they needed to do to correct our situation. You have to respect a Restauranteur who handled this situation the way he did, he certainly earned my respect and continued support.    

The food is excellent, as well as the ambiance and vibe which is spot on. This establishment is a must to try, if you are reading this review go give this place a shot, they will not let you have a bad dinning experience."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to give them 3 stars. Would be 3.5 but that's not an option here. 
Went there for breakfast today, June 24. We sat outside under the misters. The host and our waitress were super nice.  Inside it was jam packed. And the food tasted and looked good. The really bad part: we waited easily over 30 minutes for our 3 entrees. As nice as our waitress was she only came by once to refill water glasses, which is when I asked if they were catching the chickens to get the eggs. That's when she mentioned the issue with the kitchen.  
The manager came to our table when we were almost done with our meals to apologise. He mentioned something about how hard it is to deal with sitting a group of 20 people while getting two or three other 4-tops at same time. Hmmmm.... usually not an issue for restaurants I've been to. Specially for breakfast.  We were also discounted some off the check. 
Oh, the only issue with food: my friend ordered his eggs over medium. They came scrambled. 
I'll come back, and I'll expect much quicker service."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Loved the pancakes, awesome taste and the orange juice 
Definitely need to come back to try some other things in the menu"}
{"text":"This is the best brunch place ever! You must try! I enjoyed my Denver omelett with their homemade salsa, not spicy but very tasty. I ordered it with sour dough bread which was delightfully soft on the inside and crispy crust edges. I put their whipped butter n homemade jam on and enjoyed. They also serve their water in a glass carafe which is sooooo delicious!!!! I know water is pretty basic but the way it tastes here seems like it came straight from a natural spring-where unicorns and fairies life. I'm definitely going back to try their homemade corned beef hash."}

Looks small from outside but is a good size restaurant inside with outside patio seating.

This was our first time here, so I asked our server Ashley what was her recommendations. She was very thorough going through the menu and gave us her favorites. 

We had the Ole Omelette with pancakes and hash browns. Chorizo Omelette was prepared very well not to spicy with the jalapeños on the side, hash browns crispy but a little on the cold side. The pancakes were good but pretty simple. 

Corn Beef Hash with Sourdough toast was pretty good, the corn beef hash was mixed together with fried onions and hash browns topped with eggs.

As we arrived,  we were given the choice to eat inside or outside. With the temperature forecasted at 105 degrees that was an easy decision. Dined on a Wednesday afternoon around 1:30 and there were a hand full of tables being used so we chose a booth and enjoyed our meal and took our time.

We liked our meal and look to come back another time"}
