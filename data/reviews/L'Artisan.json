{"text":"This patisserie is now milk-free, which I don't think was the case when I went last time.  Yesterday, I bought a chocolatine and a cinnamon danish.  Both were inedible.  

We literally took one bite of each, threw them away and went to Tim Horton's.  They were extremely dry.  The chocolatine had only one very small piece of chocolate that didn't even go all the way through.  The latte might have been good...if it was actually made with \"lait.\"  But it was not.   I had a choice of soy and almond, so I chose soy b/c I don't like almond milk, but it was really not good.  I threw that away also.  

I paid $12 for two awful pastries and a bad small coffee.  It's too bad b/c last time I went there, several months ago, it was actually good.  At that time, it was packed at lunchtime, but yesterday at noon, it was deserted--for good reason."}
{"text":"Délicieux ! Ici aucun produit ne contient ni gluten ni produit laitier (attention aux vegans qui seraient intéressés, certains produits contiennent des oeufs).

Le pain est assez bon, je conseille le Mega 3 et le Noisetier qui sont pour moi les meilleurs. Les patisseries sont dingues, j'y ai goûté le Saint-Honoré à la fraise et la tarte au chocolat, un vrai régal. J'ai hâte d'essayer les autres.

Cette boulangerie propose également un choix de produits traiteur type quiche, feuilletés.

Le personnel est très aimable. Je recommande vivement !"}
{"text":"As a gluten free eater I miss a lot of good things and I get excited when I find good places. This bakery has awesome eclairs and cakes of all kinds.
The croissants are drier than regular ones but when you can never ever eat regular ones, u still get very excited.
You can eat in but it is not so big so I would take pastries to go."}
{"text":"Ahhh this place is too good to be true! This small pastry shop next to my hair salon is a hidden gem. Everything we got here were top quality and quite cheap actually. We got 4 things and total came to be around $15, which is pretty good.

So many delicious looking treats, it was hard to choose. I'm sorry to report I don't know the names of any of the things we got except for the eclair aha.. We got some kind of almond bread, the inside was super moist and soft. We also got some kind of almond-chocolatey tart thingy, SO GOOD. The eclair was good too, the best thing about it was the maple topping ahhh.

Overall a big 10/10!"}
{"text":"We have frequented quite a few gluten-free bakeries in Montreal since the gluten-free craze has become something that me and my family have taken an interest in. This is by far the best gluten-free bakery we have been to! The croissants aux amandes/les amandines are amazing! As are all of the individual gluten-free pastries in the showcase. Every time that we think that we have tried them all, another appears. Great variety of pastries, it is hard to believe that they are all gluten-free! But in a class all by itself are their baguettes! WE LOVE THEM! This is the closest thing you will ever find that resembles the classic French baguette! A glass of wine, an assortment of cheese and a few baguettes from L'Artisan and you are all set for a gluten-free apero. We feel fortunate that this delightful gluten-free bakery is close to where we live."}
{"text":"Coin Gilford.selection française classique,qualite intéressante,prix compétitifs.on peut consommer sur place.j'ai un faible pour les millefeuilles -un peu lourds.."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE... is all I can say about this bakery. They have a lot to choose from and all of it is gluten free. I wish they had a bakery like this in the United States."}
{"text":"generous portion of one of my favourites: apricot croissant and almond croissant, a bit on the sweet side, i will most certainly go back for the Pari Brest. On my first visit the owner gave me a croissant on the house, reminds me of the one at Kouin Amann but maybe it's because it was from the morning it was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Good selection of patisserie. Yummy croque monsieur. Beautiful breads. All made in house. Really lovely folks. Glad to have stumbled by this place.

Haven't tried the coffee yet."}
