{"text":"Stumbled into this little bakery and lunch place by accident and happy I did so.  I was looking for a simple but good place to eat, and this place was perfect for a quick lunch of Salad and sandwich.  After work or in between tourist stops, this is a simple and healthy solution."}
{"text":"Had some extra time so we stopped in here for a quick snack and coffee. Quaint little cafe with friendly and courteous staff. Latte and blueberry chocolate chip muffin were delicious."}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich place in Old Montreal.  The green pea soup was delicious (the best I've ever had) and my panini sandwich with pesto, mozzarella and tomato was very flavourful.  You can get a 1/2 sandwich with soup for $8.  Everything seems house made as well.  The staff were very sweet and I got to practise my French."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful little lunch here the other day...perhaps the meal was enhanced by the company I was with and the news I received?  Nevertheless, I like this place a lot.  First off the ambiance is reminiscent of a cafe in France (minus the outdoor seating), very european and an intimate setting.  This place will seat no more than 20 people, and that is on the high end.  Secondly, the menu is full of great sandwiches, salads and pastas.  I specifically started with the carrot soup, it was very tasty and very homemade.  Accompanying the soup are some slices of baguette.  I then had a sandwich, the Terra, which consisted of eggplant, egg, avocado, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on a nice panini styled sandwich.  Each sandwich comes with a carrot salad, with a balsamic vinaigrette.  In the end it was about $12.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"3.5*  We chanced upon this little cafe when we were in Old Montreal.  Nothing amazing about it but it was warm, friendly, and it looked like a weekday-locals lunch place.    had the pea soup and fusili pasta with rose parmesean sauce which was yummy.  resonable prices too"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Small Italian cafe serving sandwiches / soup / salads and pasta's in Old Montreal. Service is super friendly & portions are generous. Sandwiches are tasty and the salads are huge and filling. The pasta here is great. Al dente and really tasty sauce. My only complaint is they don't have any meat pasta's. Also the place is super small. They hardly have 7 tables. So it gets crowded during lunch. Cards accepted   Food : Good Service :Fast Ambiance : Casual Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Quel endroit charmant au coeur du Vieux-Montréal! Le Luna d'Oro est un minuscule café, peint d'un jaune chaleureux et organisé autour d'une petite cuisine où l'on peut voir l'unique employée s'affairer pendant que l'adorable propriétaire prend les commandes et assure un service efficace & énergique. J'y suis venue à quelques reprises & n'avais jamais, avant hier, commandé autre chose que la salade Luna! C'est dire comme elle est bonne... Mais leurs paninis se sont avérés tout aussi délicieux. Mon amie & moi avons chacune été comblée avec le Jupiter, composé de pesto, tomates & mozarella dans un pain croustillant & tiède. Dans un ordre d'idée plus pratique, il est bon de savoir qu'on ne prend pas les cartes de crédit ici. Argent comptant ou débit seulement.  Finalement, une dernière note qui, je crois, résume bien la qualité du service: mon amie & moi avons dû attendre à peine plus longtemps qu'à l'habitude avant de recevoir nos plats, & pour se faire pardonner & rendre l'attente plus agréable, nous nous sommes vues offrir un potage aux frais de la maison - sans s'être plaint ou avoir demandé quoi que ce soit. Décidémment, cette femme est un ange."}
