{"text":"Burgers are the best. Visited a few times with different friends and they also love the burgers. Highly recommended.   Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. The menu is expansive, if you can't find something you like, you're too picky!  The prices are very affordable and the portions are very generous. Get here early or plan on waiting in line for a table!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere is very cool and fun. The food isn't so great. My husband ordered sea food which was clearly Frozen. The pulled pork I ordered was ok. Huge portion sizes and reasonable prices. Not sure I would go back though."}
{"text":"Classic college town restaurant. Come for the eccentricity, stay for the food."}
{"text":"What a fun looking place. I was here three years ago so I wanted to try it again.   I wish I would have gone somewhere else.   Sausage and eggs.  Meager serving of hash browns. Eggs were fine   Since I live near Portland, OR, I thought I'd get a wonderful Midwest sausage patty. J  Hahahaha!   Two little over-cooked mini hockey pucks. Really???  I could have eaten a better sausage patty at McDonalds.   So, if you're in Vancouver, WA, go to Valerie's for Breakfast and eat what a Midwest sausage patty ought to look and taste like.   But don't look for a decent sausage patty at Mike's."}
{"text":"Staff is pleasant the owner is a delight, Food however does need some work on but their cheese sticks are the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place not only go there for family meals but also had parties there - wedding rehearsal in the former castle room, retirement party and 40th bday parties in the bar a few times. Great place! The staff was easy to work with and definitely a great experience and love their fun and quirkiness. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This used to be THE place to go for breakfast. Now, it's A place to go. Food not good. Wait staff is WAIT staff. Gone down hill. There are plenty of places to eat in Kent and Mike's Place isn't it anymore."}
{"text":"Yes Only 2 stars. Here's why..... Mike's place is quite a unique place - various themed booths, funky menu, crazy names, huge plate sizes, and that X-wing fighter (or whatever it is) up front. Its one of those places that does really well to recreate the nostalgia and the people do keep coming back.   Its a good place to meet friends especially when they are back in town. Its also great for large parties since they can seat 8-10 folks in those large tables/booths. So it certainly has it ups. Ups also include the huge menu and the large portions, parking, and the cheap breakfast/lunch specials.   But the food there is not really that good. Actually at times, the food has been less than average; generic with just those funky names to distract you. I have been there a few times and can't remember one time that I was like 'Man that was good'. The waits are long (realllly long at times) and since you have already driven there (usually with a group), you end up waiting. The food usually takes a long time too and has rarely come out hot from the kitchen. The service is hit-or-miss (mostly miss). Nothing against the servers, I just think the kitchen is unable to handle 2 armies of hungry folks.   So if you want that unique experience, Mike's Place will do. But if want some real home cooking, stay the long line away from this nostalgia trap."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, great food, definitely a one off restaurant! Huge menu, really interesting building, with its own Tie Fighter and castle!"}
{"text":"Jammed in like sardines but there is a HUGE MENU!!!!! There is something for everybody here! The atmosphere is awesome and the service is good as well. Be aware of some greasy meals. I have been here multiple times and it is a hit or miss on how I feel afterward."}
{"text":"Great food and huge portions. Service was average, but the atmosphere was fantastic. #hangoversatisfied"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! I eat here often. I always bring friends and family here from out of town. Everybody always loves it! The food is regular diner fare. Lots of salt, lots of grease, lots of sugar. But it's so good! Great bar, too."}
{"text":"Mike's Place is pretty cool, especially for that hangover breakfast when you're able to move enough to drive the car but not enough to actually cook your own food. There are some good pile-up breakfasts on the menu that work perfectly to nip that hangover right in the bud. If you're not going for breakfast, they also have good things, but I can't remember any of them because I really only went for breakfast.  I did have a couple of blah experiences where food was cooked wrong, or I got the wrong item, hence the 3/5 stars. It's nothing too fancy, really, but it's good for the price and the atmosphere is fun. Usually the servers are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on 7/29. The host seated us without a problem. I was surprised by the restaurant's appearance.  It was so many twist and turns and seating areas I can't wait to bring my family! Our order didn't take long and we were very pleased with our results! A must to come back with my family!!"}
{"text":"Mike's Place is a very average, if slightly underwhelming, college bar/restaurant in Kent. It is located on 43 at 261. The bar is easy to find as it stands alone and is covered by memorabilia on the outside. The walls inside are also blanketed with memorabilia. We were seated in the bar area, which we figured would be a lot more exciting...and we were one of the few people sitting in the area. As a side note, there are a few areas in which you can sit in, one of them being in an old train car. One thing I have to say was that service was slow and the place wasn't even that crowded. The menu is hilarious as there is tons of humor incorporated into the menu. It's the first time I've laughed reading through my menu. The menu is very extensive and gives you plenty of options, including an all day breakfast menu. I ordered the Big Daddy burger. When you order a burger, you receive it only with the patty and the buns. This is because Mike's Place has a unique concept called the burger bar. You take your burger and top it in any way, shape, or form you wish. However, be warned, there is nothing too out of the ordinary and the selection isn't huge, although it worked out fine for me. However, I found the burger to be only average, as it was kind of dry. It just didn't impress me all that much (and I'm pretty easily impressed by food). The curly fries were great, however. For dessert, I had fried apple pie, which came with three giant scoops of ice cream. The apple pie was good, but it wasn't great. It was unique, as I've never had fried pie. I feel that the food would've tasted better if the atmosphere was as lively as a college bar should be. The atmosphere actually felt somewhat sleepy, if anything. However, I came on a cold, rainy, November night (even though it was Saturday), so I'm guessing that people didn't want to go out, leaving Mike's Place almost empty. Overall, if you're looking for a good place to grab a burger in Kent, I don't recommend putting this at the top of your list, but don't toss it out completely."}
{"text":"Food is great and satisfying, love their breakfast but it can be very greasy. Everything comes in large portion which is a plus and the service is always good."}
{"text":"If you like good grease this might be your place.   The food is average with burgers, tots, subs and whatnot.  Grease is King here.  The real draw is the decor.   Outside they have a castle a star wars X-Wing, inside it is filled with signs, random license plates, a bus and elvis wax statutes."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! Their menu is huge and entertaining. Great food, great coffee. There's always something new to discover with the decor. A fun place to bring a group."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY IF YOU DON\"T WANT TO GET ROBBED!!! I stopped here for my first time and ordered a shot of Cuervo tequila, and they charged me $6.00!!!!!  I can get a shot of Cuervo anywhere else for $3.50 or less!  I don't think I'll ever stop there again!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used this place to sneak away and have lunch a couple times before we moved. you won't be disappointed if you like real Italian food and beer, friendly service, relaxed atmosphere. We will miss stealing away to have lunch here."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast after driving past a gazillion times over the weekend... All the things you've read here are true.  The decor is entertaining & unusual, the menu is lengthy and humorous, and the food is... pretty standard.  It's not bad by any means, just nothing very special.  I had the cinnamon roll french toast, my husband had the 2.99 breakfast special (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes).  This is definitely not health food, but it was satisfying and reasonably priced.  The coffee was good too.  This is a great place for folks who love greasy spoon and diner food, local flavor, etc."}
{"text":"you can't beat the price for what you get and if it has the name little in it you are sure to be surprised.  the staff seemed interested in kepping us happy. GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE. NUFF SAID."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant. Every meal I've had here has been a great value and good quality. Although everything I've had can be categorized as \"greasy bar food,\" you get plenty of it, and it's delicious!  The atmosphere is wonderful, and the service is good. It is the iconic restaurant of Kent, Ohio-- everyone needs to eat here once."}
{"text":"I've been to Mike's a few times, the Cinnamon Roll French Toast is just the best and that's the only reason I go back. The menu is massive but the food is generally lackluster. Very few times have I had a good or decent server, the food always takes forever to come out even when they are slow. I expect slower service if the restaurant is busy but sometimes it's past the point of ridiculous. I've been there and had good service and I've been there and had horrible service where the server forgot half our food and never came back. It's always so hit or miss that I don't go unless I have a craving for the Cinnamon Roll French Toast."}
{"text":"We had a small party for a 9 year old at the nearby skyzone and turned to yelp to find someplace close to get some pizza. A quick flip through the pictures showed a kids menu for Mike's Place, and it's close proximity made it our best option. We called ahead and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, considering we were rolling up on a bar with 9 kids and 4 adults. When we got there, there were already some children commandeering the bar's pool table. So despite a few, wait, I think this is really just a bar, concerns, we were welcomed by the bartender and by a woman I can only presume to be \"Mom\" who clucked over the children, gave us a great place to spread out, and made us feel very welcomed.  We ordered two pizzas, wings, provolone sticks, lots of pop and a beer (because who are we kidding, 9 kids at skyzone for 2 hours, we needed one!). The drafts were perfectly cold and delicious, the wings were crispy, and the pizzas were sicilian style and quite good!  We're from East of the city, so the next time we're in the area, we'll probably be at SkyZone, but we will definitely take time to stop in at Mike's Place."}
{"text":"First time at Mimes this weekend. Place is pretty cool. Good for those with kids. They allow a very relaxed atmosphere. They have a HUGE menu. Something for everyone. And normally places do not do well cooking all verity goods when menu is that big, however everyone plate in our group was spot on to cooked right. From pasta to wings the food was excellent! Only down fall was our server was very slow. But menu does state to not expect speedy service. 2 hrs for dinner though was just alittle too long. Overall would go again and do recommend others to try out the place."}
{"text":"Visited this place on Friday for their Beer Battered Fish, we ordered beer battered but when it arrived it was fried fish with a disgusting Italian bread crumb topping, greasy and over cooked ! We asked why it had Italian Bread Crumbs and was told they ran out of beer batter ? How is that even possible ? They have a BAR on site, did they run out of BEER TOO ? Our waitress  was unconcerned , inattentive, and did NOTHING to fix the problem . Won't be back anytime soon !"}
{"text":"Having never been to Kent before, this place seemed like a good deal. It's cheap for sure and the food is served in large portions. The theme here seems to be quantity over quality. There's SO much on the menu (which is never a good sign). I feel like they're trying to make a statement with serving that much variety, but the food doesn't quite meet up with the hype. Service was a bit on the slow side, which is fine if the food is worth the wait (it wasn't, really). All in all, everything seemed to have the idea of \"more grease=more flavor\". Not really, guys. If I'm in Kent again, I'll try another place."}
{"text":"I love eating there. It's inexpensive and you can get a beer with your breakfast :) :) :)"}
{"text":"I just can not get enough of the pulled pork and home made BBQ. These cheese cakes are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"This place has EVERYTHING on the menu, on account of this the food quality is decent-to-good, but nothing is great. I've been here on several occasions, it's best for breakfast or with kids. Lower your expectations if your looking for a great meal, but at least they're not advertising as if they are. Face it if your going to a restaurant with an X-wing fighter parked out front and an actual bus converted into seats and looking for fine cuisine, that's your problem. Service is hit-n-miss, mostly staffed with young college or high school kids. Cleanliness- meh, not so much."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Mom & Pop type of restaurant. Googled near Sewickley. Walked in at 11:40, not 1 customer there. Waitress was ok, was wearing opened toe sandals. Not too appealing. Ordered our food, 20 mins later food arrived. Hot Turkey & Hot Roast Beef Sandwiches. Looked ok, tasted terrible!!! Nasty sliced lunchmeat, packaged gravy (VERY SALTY), french fries were good. Needed ketchup, waitress NEVER came back to check on our food. Was only 3 other tables in there for lunch. No excuse as to why she never came back, not like she was busy. BAD food & VERY poor service. Waitress was hard to understand. Will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"been here for the 3rd time in a week.  Gonna have to find more time to travel there to try everything.  Breakfasts are unreal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... Great food, great portions - I had the blueberry pancakes and they were quite delicious, though they don't use fresh berries but frozen ones.    The restaurant is eclectic, offering seating in several busses and train car, and has an X-Wing in front of the restaurant!    Highly recommend for breakfast, and the kids will love it!"}
{"text":"THE MENU IS HUGE!!!!!! Take a look at it online before you go and find out which section you want to choose from. Everything about this place screams fun and hilarious. An upbeat place to get a good meal. Serves everything from breakfast to dinner and everything you could think of in between. Sometimes it can get a bit noisy but just one look at the place and you won't be expecting anything else. Creative menu w/ good service and good quality food. Everyone needs to experience Mike's!"}
{"text":"Mikes always has a great selection of food and great decor to entertain your family! The menu has so many options to choose from and the food is delicious! Service is always kind of slow but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love Mike's, although my thighs hate me for it! The servers are very nice, albeit a little overworked so are a little hard to get a hold of. Keeping in mind it is diner food, the food is very good.The menu is the length of a novel, so it has something for everyone. Each time I go back, there are more and more vegetarian options which makes me very happy. The portions are huge, so make sure you either starve yourself for a day or two before you go or be prepared to lug back a very full doggie bag. I also love the ambiance, which definitely feeds into my ADD. Too bad I live about 650 miles away..."}
{"text":"This place is great for a fun meal. There is a huge menu! -Lots of good options to choose from. We have been here twice and I was unfortunately disappointed by the food both times. My boyfriend really enjoyed it, I just found it to be mediocre."}
{"text":"Always liked this place because of the huge variety in food choices, all at a decent price. Still lived up to that tonight. Next time though, stay away from sitting at the bar. Had to listen to a college aged drinker use the F-word over 20 times in talking with the girls behind the counter, and the injured (broken foot) worker that was drinking on his night off. Bartender was less than helpful. Had to watch another one eat her pasta from behind the counter until she explained \"this pasta is disgusting\" to which the injured worker replied....\"this place is disgusting.\"  Lovely guys......keep it up."}
{"text":"I really should have reviewed this YEARS ago, since i think that my dad has dragged me to Mike's for many, many sundays after church.  But then, yelp didn't exist years ago, so I had to wait till I was back to mikes a few weeks ago...  It is one of the quintessential greasy spoons... complete with skillet breakfasts and witty menu descriptions.  They have 85 ways to fry an egg and most of them include fat. Its got delicious potatoes and great coffee. The decorations are humorous and its NE Ohio flair is unforgettable.   I love going back to breakfast at Mikes..."}
{"text":"Food was great service sucked 10 min to get asked about drinks then ice tea was warm no ice when I asked for ice instant attitude got ice nothing till food came then no one back to check on any thing till bill was dropped off only reason 3 stars the food is 5 stars we come a few times. Year it's. 45 min drive for us but food will not bring us back I will find place closer"}
{"text":"Very unique place. I had a great warm spinach salad with chicken and cup of chili. Big portions. Very nice service. Extremely interesting atmosphere.   Yet another reason to keep driving away from highway exits when looking to eat and you have the time."}
{"text":"Mike's place is a staple of Kent. The crazy exterior brings everyone in...everyone. The parking can get insane as can the wait. You need to go there during off hours to get the real experience. The menu hurts your eyes, but if you take your time you will find something good to eat. They have delicious food and really don't leave you hungry. They give you well over the average amount of food. The pricing is reasonable. It is great for groups and college kids."}
{"text":"Casual family restaurant with an extensive menu and alcohol section. service can be slow on busier days, but still remains a better choice than it's Bob Evans competition across the street."}
{"text":"Ran across this place while in town looking for a different place to eat. The giant X-wing out front got our attention. The rest of the building is just as eccentric but that makes it great! The menu is huge and I was a little overwhelmed at first but they have a great selection. The prices are pleasant as well. They also feature a special brew each month which is cool. Food was satisfying and we left plenty full. The service was good too! Will go back if I'm in town! Suggest if you are anywhere near Kent University since it is just down the road."}
{"text":"There is a school bus you can eat in and a X fighter. The damn menu is like 9 pages and they are all a variety of one sandwich. I usually get the sumo sandwich which is two footings integrated into a 16\" sandwich on the stuinator bun. See pic. It is super good and more calories than anyone should ever consume. All of the offers are super good and I love their coffee, can't go wrong honestly. Typically there is a wait and the service is not that great but then again it is huge so it is hard to service everyone and they also have a crazy layout."}
{"text":"I've lives in kent for several years now and given mikes place multiple tries. I've found the food there \"okay\" at the very best and \"very bad\" at the worst.  Clearly there is a lot of novelty to the place itself, the tacky exterior will turn heads, but if you're not into that kind of thing you won't find much you'll like here.   Their menu is huge, like, an intentional joke huge. This is not a good thing beyond the initial laugh you get from seeing it. Clearly there is no way the majority of this sagging menu is freshly prepared and it shows. I've gotten a gyro that was just greasy flavorless meat lazily thrown on bread and garlic bread that was just Bagged bread with the slightest hint of flavor sneezed onto it, a friend orderEd wings that looked like the tiny crumbs that were leftover at the bottom of the bag. I gave it multiple tries because other people liked it or had no where else to go but I've never had a great experience in food or service.  If you do go I recommend ordering something you feel is common or absolutely can't be messed up. The fries were okay, the cheesy tots were okay, but really what mark of cuisine is adequate stuff you just had to toss in the fryer?"}
{"text":"Cool place, huge menu selection, usually have a little wait to get seated and to order, the food is OK nothing wonderful there but it's cool to visit sometimes, could make food better"}
{"text":"mike's place is where i go when i want violent diarrhea. it's probably on their menu, frakking everything is. (fyi - when a menu is ten pages long everything has been sitting in a freezer for a few years)"}
{"text":"Sheer disappointment.  I have always loved here...started going as a kent student.   Havent been here in a couple of years and wow has it gone down hill.    The service and food were both horrible.  Waitress took a very long time to take our order, it took a very long time to come out of the kitchen.  The waitress brought out my husbands and sons food and my sides.  Took five mins longer for my entree.  Once it finally arrived my chicken schnitzel tasted like it had been fried with fish.  My husbands side salad never came...ended up just getting it boxed to go.  Our waitress took over ten mins to get our check, I ended up taking it to the hostess as I was tired of waiting.....waited to be served, waited to get our food, waited to get our check, waited to pay the check.  Spent close to an hour and half in total.   Where is the management?!!?!"}
{"text":"Mike, you had me at \"X-wing fighter in the parking lot.\"  Seriously, what else do you need to convince you to go here?  Go here & get copious amounts of fried food.  I have fond memories of being in college & getting fish & chips here.  Well...fish.  I substituted the chips for hushpuppies.  & ordered a side of hushpuppies.  I'm...really into hushpuppies, & Mike's does them right."}
{"text":"A Kent OH classic. Eclectic divey with Kent coed servers and all walks of life. If Guy Fiery does a triple d around here, this would be the place!  Gigantic menu and all the comfort food is great!"}
{"text":"Clearly the X-Wing fighter sitting outside of the parking lot will draw you into this place on curiosity alone.  Once inside it is a amuzing  arrangement of decor, ranging from Si-Fi, to Sea-Side.  Lots of little nooks and large spaces to fit most sized groups.     Clearly a collage, neighborhood type bar.   You'll see plenty of parents, families of college students here and of course there are the Kent students themselves.     However, the fun stops at the atmosphere the fun falls off a cliff once you take in the service and food.  As a parent, I left with the following impression.  The service was crap, the beer was flat and the food was a greasy flop.   It is a good, one time visit so you can say, been there done that, but otherwise I would encourage parents to look someplace else as there are plenty of other places in Kent to enjoy."}
{"text":"Mike's Place is a great, relaxed place to eat. And I'm not just saying that because I like to gawk at the Star Wars memorabilia (I dare you to miss the X-wing fighter outside).  Be forewarned; if they say it's big, it's monstrous. On two separate occasions I've ordered a dish that turned into three separate meals. On the plus side, both were just as good the second and third time.  Don't let the size of the menu scare you, you'll find something for every taste bud there. Even that picky vegetarian (ahem, me)!"}
{"text":"You can not beat the $2.99 breakfast, you pay more for less crap at McDs. The breakfast comes with two eggs cooked to order, hash browns, sausage, bacon, and pancakes or french toast. Nothing special perhaps, but it is a nice change of pace in the mornings.   Of their other food, I have found it to be hit or miss. Sometimes I really love something like their Hot Garlic Parmesan wings and been meh about others, their mashed potatoes and gravy could use some serious work.   It seems like they are always adding something to the decor, most recently a boat that can accommodate groups and they are always amenable to groups of any size and do not charge for their party rooms. Don't voluntarily sit on the bus in the winter, it's freezing out there.   We avoided this place for a while because of the political signs they had posted near the driveway entrance but that was a few years back and the problem seems to have vanished."}
{"text":"Recently revisited Mike's after not having been in at least 10 years. We had the hot pretzels which were hot and fresh. The chicken parmigiana sandwich had hand breaded chicken breast which I wasn't expecting on awesome baked Italian bread. I'm so happy that I stopped back in and am looking forward to coming back for a Bloody Mary. The service was great with the exception of not being waited on when we were I initially seated once we had our server she was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is always my go-to place when visiting the area. The Reuben-Reuben is second to none. The menu is very entertaining and the atmosphere is fun. There's always something new to look at or read on the walls or on the menu. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Are you kickin me where the sun don't shine?? Here is the kicker... The sun is out today!! Happy fourth everyone!!! I hope everyone had a good year! The menu is various. The service is to die for. A very unique joint (not the illegal stuff). Thanks for the breakfast, and I'm sure we'll see ya tonight. YELP!"}
{"text":"If you are in Kent this place is a must. Not only is then place decorated quirky, but the menu is hilarious. It is easy to get to but mostly crowded.  Still a must!"}
{"text":"I still love this place!  I returned today to Kent after not having been there since I graduated ten years ago.  I scoured the menu trying to locate the sandwich I got so often during my college years and while I'm not positive I found it, the Roman-something or other burger was very tasty.  Shhh -- don't tell anyone.  I ate the whole thing.  Yum-oh.  My two fellow diners also thought their sandwiches were quite yummy as well.  While I was disappointed to not see my Illinois license plate hanging on the wall anymore after they redid their lobby, I will always hold a special place for Mike's Place in my heart."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you need some fried, greasy, calorie-filled, deliciousness in your life. The literally have EVERYTHING. Great place to go with groups because everyone can find something they like. The hangover breakfast for $2.99 is a deal you can't beat either. Read the placemats and the \"rules\" on the menu if you want to laugh. The staff is really laid back so don't come here expecting fast service, but the food, the price, the atmosphere and the legendary X-wing in front of the restaurant are worth coming here for.   Mike's definitely has a special place in my heart. I have so many memories coming here with my friends after a night out and gorging ourselves on breakfast food, coming here with my roommates to eat our feelings, the many date nights with my boyfriend who just can't get enough of their burgers and the Rueben Rueben, sitting in the bus with a big group of people. It's one of those places that I hope to bring my future kids to and tell them all about it."}
{"text":"Loved it. Loved the venue and all the neat stuff. Had five in our party in a Friday night and even though it was busy we only waited about ten minutes. Great service. Prices weren't bad. Good was good. Had some kind of chocolate peanut butter desert that was good, but smaller than it should've been for what I paid. The menu was robust and entertaining. Lots of snippets. Had some amusing rules for the restaraunt too that I enjoyed. I'll go back when the area."}
{"text":"Just a little disappointing today couldn't order the specials because it's a holiday. Please plan your visit accordingly"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner based on the reviews that made it sound like a quirky, fun, local joint. The X-Wing replica out front was pretty cool, but I was less than impressed by the rest of the decor and atmosphere. I've been to plenty of places that do the whole \"crazy crap on the walls\" thing, and I suppose Mike's Place did this well, but it was nothing special. Our server was pleasant and nice enough, but not knowledgeable enough to be mixing and serving drinks. I ordered a well whiskey and Coke to start, only to find that they were out of well whiskey by 8 o'clock on a Friday night. My replacement ended up being a Scotch and Coke, which, well, is kinda disgusting. My wife enjoyed her grilled ham and cheese sandwich, but my plain grilled chicken sandwich was tiny, dried out and bright orange for some reason. Tasted OK, but seriously, how tough is it to get a correctly cooked chicken breast on a Friday night? As far as fries go, sorry, but they sucked. Bar food isn't tough to do decently, but, at least on this night, Mike's Place didn't deliver."}
{"text":"I love Mike's Place both for the food at atmosphere. They have one of the most extensive menus I have ever seen at a restaurant. Whether you want the taste of a home-cooked meal, a great burger, or some after drinking-munchies, Mike's is the place to get it. Prices are great, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Distinctly unique place.  It may strike you as a movie studio prop graveyard or putt-putt course but don't let that discourage you.  Huge menu selection of eclectic items to choose from.  I challenge anyone to not be able to find something that meets their desire!!! And the portions are guaranteed to meet the biggest of appetites so be careful ordering an appetizer before your entree."}
{"text":"Awesome, unique atmosphere! Huge portions!  Parking can be a bit cramped, especially on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Good portion size but the quality of the food isn't too great. Place is a little overrated if you ask me. My friends that go to Kent with me think it's good but that's only because they don't really know good food. I would recommend Wild goats cafe across the bridge on Main. Breakfast there is much better."}
{"text":"I love the wings at this place and the fresh cut fries.  I wish they were open 24/7 and on Sunday."}
{"text":"I took my nieces to Mike's Place recently and it was a pretty mixed experience.  The kids enjoyed their pasta with spaghetti sauce, chicken wrap and fries and teriyaki chicken, but my chicken schnitzel was awful.  The chicken was burned, the sauce on the side dish was terrible and the gravy on their mashed potatoes was almost as bad.  I am also sorry to report the service was horrible.  From waiting forever for a table because the hostess skipped over us, to the food taking over 30 minutes to be served (for each course--so we waited 30 minutes for soup/salad, then another 30 minutes for entrees, then another 30 minutes for dessert).  I might try Mike's Place again since the kids enjoyed the decor and their food, but I will never get the chicken schnitzel again. I also wouldn't recommend going here if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy.  It is full of kitschy stuff, the menu is so huge it could take an hour to read, and so far, I've experienced decent service.  I've been to Mike's Place twice, and I'd go back.  They serve breakfast all day long (can I get a Hallelujah?) and make a mean Bloody Mary, just the way I like it....with a garden in it.  I've done their sandwich / salad combo for lunch too and was presented with a massive amount of food that was quite delish.  I'd stick to simple sandwiches and breakfast here...not sure I'd want to risk the \"fancier\" dinner plates, but maybe I'd be surprised.  If you're a tourist, you should stop on in, and take you camera.  Behold, Mike's Place is something to be seen and experienced!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading the Yelp reviews. Very large menu, hard to narrow down your choice. Reuben was very, very large, but alas nothing special. There was a persistent fly, and his partner Fly Jr. during the course of the meal. That was troubling, since I ate inside. My server was quick and pleasant, which was a plus. I wish it had been a little bit brighter inside, felt on the dark side to me. Interesting décor."}
{"text":"First thing about Mike's place is that you will love the decor. secondly I want for the 2.99 breakfast. It was well worth the cost and the staff is friendly as always. Everytime I'm in Ohio I will definitely go there."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite since I was a little kid and it has yet to disappoint! Portions are outrageously huge, food is hearty, savory, and comfort food at its best.  If you're looking to eat lightly they DO have great options.. But it is the perfect breakfast/lunch/dinner anytime spot.  Look out for the menus.. They'll take time.  The table mats change every time I come back and they are more hilarious each visit.   I now live in NYC, Mecca of great cuisine.. And I can never wait to come back to mikes when I'm home. And I always bring friends.   Come here. Love it. Do it."}
{"text":"Very good food and fun atmosphere. They have hundreds of menu options. Their omelets tend to take awhile. I asked why and they said that there is only one omelet station in the kitchen and they can only make one at a time. All the other food came out promptly."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The menus are absolutely entertaining to read and the staff is very professional. Anyone looking for great food and a wonderful atmosphere should look no further. Also close by Kent State (very convenient). 5/5 will definitely eat here again. Great prices and great food!"}
{"text":"Every time I have ate at Mike's Place, I have never been disappointed. There is always so many options to choose from no matter what you are craving. The restaurant is very unique compared to other places I have been to which adds to the atmosphere when you go in to eat. The service, food, and location are all good."}
{"text":"I know a lot of locals are fans of Mike's Place because of the menu and the price point. But for me, a menu that long scares me off - if you have 100 items, how can you keep fresh ingredients on hand for every dish? Plus, the place has a sticky feel to it.   In short, if you're looking for a cheap option with all day breakfast, this might be your joint. But I don't know that I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Such a fun, quirky place with yummy food. I've only ever gone for breakfast and you cannot beat their prices for the quality (and amount) of food you get. The worst part is trying to decide what to order! Their menu is amusing and they always have a monthly placemat sharing any new specials, random thoughts from staff, and some good jokes. Entertainment while you wait for your food to come. I've also been seated in several different parts of the restaurant. It's like a maze inside, and every section has a different vibe. Lots to look at and talk about. The food itself is delicious and I need to promise myself to go back for lunch or dinner sometime soon because the burger menu alone looks amazing. This is a great place to take friends and family that are visiting because it's so unique and everyone is sure to find something they like on the menu."}
{"text":"Mike's Place is always a winner for me. I had the turkey dagwood sandwich and it was delicious. I am a person that does not eat beef or pork, so I like how Mike's has many turkey and chicken options. My mom got a pork sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries in & around it. The sweet potato waffle fries with cinnamon butter were so good I can't wait to get more. I had fresh cut fries with my sandwich and they have the best tasting ranch dressing I've eaten. It is homemade and you can tell the difference. No fake MSG taste. Highly recommend for tourists and locals alike."}
{"text":"Mike's Place is tough to rate because I've had so many good times there. I suppose I should break down my rating system quickly:  3 main points (taste of food, quantity of food, price, atmosphere (including service, decor, volume, etc.))  I'd say Mike's Place has below average tasting food  I'd say Mike's Place has an amazing crew, great service, fun/goofy atmosphere, and not too loud - very cozy inside  Quantities are OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Gotta love Mike's Place for brunch :)"}
{"text":"Updating my review and taking a star off because of my experience the last time I went. It was a few months ago and it was a nicer day, nice enough that we wanted to sit outside. Waited. Waited. Waited. No one came outside to take our order after we were seated. So we left and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is indeed eccentric! What a fun conglomerate of umm..collectibles..are on the walls here!   The restaurant consists of several themed areas, which is very fun and original.  The menu is written like Moby Dick; extremely lengthy, dull, and slightly anti climatic. However, the humor woven throughout the gazillions of menu items was a pleasant surprise.    Typically I stay away from restaurants that have more than 20-25 items on their menu. Over my lengthy and frequent curriculum of eating out, I found I prefer places that do one thing really well, over restaurants that do 90 things mediocre. I digress.  We ordered a reuben sandwich, which was mostly enjoyed by my husband. The coleslaw has a spice or herb in its list of ingredients we could not quite place. It wasnt bad, it was just very unusual-so beware if you are expecting a creamy, sweet slaw.    I ordered the homemade corned beef chaos hash. It was well seasoned, perhaps slightly heavy on the garlic.  The only slight qualm I had was the consistency, which was on the mushy side.    On several places throughout the restaurant, the waitresses are refered to as wenches by the owner.. And truthfully, when we visited they were definately not the bubbly, friendly kind.  Pretty ironic.  All in all a good place to eat, it did not blow me away, but for the price (most items under $10.00), and its large portions you cannot really go wrong.  I will be back to town in a few weeks, i'll probably try out something entirely different. They have a section on their menu devoted to Italian fare. I read that the recipes come from a restaurant in NY, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"The food was good, the atmosphere was fun but the manager, Tiffany Townsend was rude, abusive and downright nasty. I do not believe she is good to her staff but can attest that she is horrific  to her customers. Never again will I enter that place. Which is a shame because I really liked it."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to go back here again to really cement my opinion on this place, but I definitely enjoyed my first visit.   The good: Obviously, as everyone else has said, the decor is kind of insane. But it's fun, too. Makes me believe that Mike's basic loves in life are music, football, beer and fraternity. That makes for a fun atmosphere. My food was also really good -- I got the Sweet Roll French Toast and OMG. I was kind of scared, because I thought it was going to be ridiculously sweet, but it wasn't at all. The french toast itself was nice and cinnamon-y and it came with this icing/butter that you could put on to your own desired level of sweetness. I don't normally do sweet breakfasts, so this was a nice foray into the genre. Boyfriend got 3 Little Pigs and it was just OK.. but there's not much you can do to make little breakfast sliders amazing. Neither of us thought the food was greasy (some others have said that it is), and of course, the prices were pretty good.. we both got nice and full from a big breakfast for $20.   The not-so-good: 20 minute wait when we got in the door (11 am on a Sunday) and then a 40 minute wait for our food. Also, the place was kinda LOUD.. so, basically, Sunday morning is not a good time to go if you want a chill environment. (It's also the weekend before Kent goes back to school and it's move-in-weekend, so that might be our bad, too). Also, the menu is just TOOO much. I had to just decide that I was eating breakfast and not look at any other part of the menu, because it's completely overwhelming. Waaay too many items on the menu probably adds to the time it takes to cook so many different things, which is probably why we waited so long.   So.. my take so far: totally go check this place out and be ready for a little college-style fun. But don't go at a stupid time, and don't go starving hungry. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite diner in Ohio. I love partying at Kent and going to Mike's in the morning."}
{"text":"Overwhelming, but never disappointed! My FAVORITE restaurant in Kent!  Place is packed with personality. Their menu is the largest I've ever seen so prepare to feel conflicted on choosing what to get. Their portions are huge so you do get the most bang for your buck! Average to Excellent quality of food.   Since it's popular, expect to wait for your table and getting a slow service. Also, it is quite noisy and an intense environment. But despite these things, I always want to come back and not order the same thing twice so I can explore the menu! MASSIVELY recommend!"}
{"text":"So tired of the slowness and no one touching base with u and no one helping and no management to speak of...sigh"}
{"text":"Yuck!   My pasta was under a heat lamp so long that the sauce was literally dried to the plate.  No moisture at all left in it.   Pizza came out cold, undercooked and with the wrong toppings.  When we pointed it out the server said \"what would you like me to do about it\".  Then walked away giving us a dirty look.    Wont be back."}
{"text":"This is a real college dive on the edge of Kent they specialize in hangover breakfast food and burger bar. You can't miss this place because it has an x wing fighter in the front parking lot and a catapult on the roof."}
{"text":"This place used to be fun and food was better than average. Lately the staff is rude, never around and complain to each other about other staff and customers.  I always believe that it starts at the top, so Mike, spend more time there at different times of day and you will see lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"This place is a real hoot. It's so different than other restaurants, but very very overwhelming. The menu is huge (like lists of food in small print) and so is the restaurant. There are tables inside buses and cars. It's crazy.   I only come here for breakfast. There lunch and dinner meals are a bit too heavy for me. I really like there waffles and pancakes. It's an experience to say the least just sitting in the restaurant for a meal. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast, but not so much for lunches or dinners unless you want a large amount of food more-so on the greasy and oily side."}
{"text":"Food is good but not as good as it used to be.  Portions have gotten smaller as prices have gone up.  Cool place though and still a solid menu.  Give it a shot... if you've never been here, you won't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, menu and price are the absolute best. Mike's has the best breakfast deal in this or any other universe. Whether you eat at a table, booth, bar, bus or boat you will have a very unique and satisfying dining experience."}
{"text":"It is such a shame that I have to go so low with the stars. The food was great, our server was fine(it took her a bit to just ask for our drink order). The kitchen was SLOW!! And to make it worse there was another server who was yelling to and fro, completely disturbing our meal. This is the third time here in the past three years and it is most likely our last. The food is good, plentiful and cheap, but not worth the time wasted waiting for it to arrive."}
{"text":"Food was awesome but the side comments from the staff ruined our experience. When I go somewhere to eat I don't expect to hear the staff saying they wish people would stop coming, and that they want to get a brick out and smash their heads, you also shouldn't kick a chair towards customers to clear room for others. Also it's the day of Harry Potter fest downtown and a staff member said I'm real tired of seeing all these stupid Harry Potter fans. Unprofessional in my opinion"}
{"text":"Food was ok til we heard screaming and swearing from the kitchen. Seems Son and Mom are always getting into it an employee told us. We live in Ambridge Pa now and had our young kids with us so we WILL NOT be back."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I have been here, but may be the last. Had visited before several months ago and had the all you can eat fish. It was dripping with grease. Not good. But figured it was just one of those days things for Mike's. Yesterday we took my adult Son and his wife and two young children for breakfast.  The server was nice enough, so no big deal there. The food is another story. Not sure what the problem was but as far as I can figure our order sat under the warmer way to long. The toast was like a giant crunchy crouton. Pancakes were dry and tuff on the top. Scrambled eggs however we're cold so not sure where they sat before being plated. For $70.00 + tip I expected better food. So most likely will go to Bob Evans across the road next time, or Cracker Barrel closer to home."}
{"text":"Absolutely good food! Very unique and the large  menu and great prices were perfect! I will be coming  back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty interesting place. It has an X-Wing, a very funny menu but LARGE menu, the inside looked like a vintage 90s diner. The food was decent, I got the Romanburger copycat sub, it was alright and the fries were okay. It has really good comfort food. I can't really ask for much from a place that has such a large menu, consistency must be a big issue."}
{"text":"This place is not for the faint of heart, both literally and figuratively. Hear me out though. This place has a style all it's own. It's like American Pickers meets Diners Drive ins and Dives, with good humor thrown in as well.   Let me break this down.   American Pickers? You might ask. The style of this place is signs and pictures covering the walls. There is a shuttle bus on one side and a boat in the middle and an Irish pub in the back. There is so much to look at and enjoy. BTW there is an X-Wing fighter in front of the building. Freakin awesome. If you see that and think it's dumb, you should just keep driving.  Diners Drive Ins and Dives? Even if you see all the decor and think it's dumb and you have no sense of humor, at least try the food. Assuming you can sort through the long and hilarious menu they have to offer. Props to the chef by the way. If they can remember how to make all of that stuff, they are already amazing. But, they can do more than just make a lot of stuff. They make delicious food as well. I won't try to summarize the menu because I couldn't even scratch the surface of what there is to choose from. But I'll try. They have breakfast (served all day), burgers, sandwiches, BBQ, seafood, and appetizers.  I've only had a couple of the things they have to offer. I could honestly eat there 50 more times (and i plan to) and never eat the same thing twice. That's how much they have to offer and that's how good the food is.  If you are wanting to eat somewhere super different (meaning awesome different) and have great food and have a great time, this is absolutely the place for you. I plan on eating there as many times as I can to try as much of their hilarious menu as I can and I plan on taking my future kids there someday. That's how fun and delicious this place is."}
{"text":"The menu is overwhelming.  They could do away with half the nonsense on there and concentrate on preparing quality foods not quantity.  While the food is generally good it's not consistent. I recently had biscuits and gravy for breakfast, and the biscuits were stale and hard enough to break marble.  When I complained about this I was offered a 10% discount, which amounted to like a buck and change.  The breakfast should have been comped, and whoever dished that up should be reprimanded for preparing such awful food.  Perhaps Gordon Ramsay needs to visit Mike's Place.  A kitchen nightmare?"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here last night I need to tell y'all about. I really just need to vent I guess. So last night, I went with hubby and a friend. When we walked in, we noticed there were signs posted that they are looking for a new cook. Well, now I know why...  When we were first greeted, we asked to sit on the patio. The host took us outside, threw a pile of silverware and placemats on the table (didn't set the table) and walked away. He didn't even think or offer to put the umbrella up for us so my husband did it. The host just seemed annoyed at us for wanting to sit outside. It was a nice night! We wanted to enjoy it!  The waitress eventually came out and we ordered drinks and eventually food. Our friend ordered a burger cooked medium and it was definitely burnt. Hubby ordered the fish sandwich and it came out with no tarter sauce which he waited way too long to get after asking for it. My food was not good, wings were way overcooked and the sauce on the wings broke so it looked completely unappetizing.  So, point of me telling you all this is that this place was once a great place to eat but if they don't find a good cook soon, it will fail and people will stop eating here! Let's not let this happen! Someone has to know of a good cook looking for a job! Come on peeps!"}
{"text":"Not a real business . My date and I were lookin to get some good food nearby and I  had a taste for some cheese fries and I remember this place would give me enough to last 2 days. So I drive there on a Saturday night 2 hours before there closing time just to get take out. It's spring time but it's snowing and windy however there isn't even an inch of snow on the ground. I get in there and this girl asks me done in or take out and someone in the back chimes in and says \"we're close due to the weather \" my date and I were livid. That restaurant had been there long enough to develop some type of professionalism or common sense to know it is lazy and a joke to close down a business just because they seen some snow outside. What if I drove an hour to get here? This place must be running under some high school drop out who doesn't know a thing abt business and is clearly lazy."}
{"text":"Great menu that has you spending 15 minutes reading all funny menu items!   I had the waffle with eggs, sausage, bacon, and gravy....yum! Will be back with children to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I believe this mom-and-pop shop deserves five stars for their friendly service and delicious food! The only reason I chose to go with a four star rating was because of its location.  While they are located on Ferry Road, just off of Ohio River Boulevard, be sure and travel a little farther north towards Ambridge, and cross at the overpass. You will find this awesome gem of a bar/restaurant inside the Leetsdale Industrial Park.  Using a coupon from Eat24, I decided to try give one of their signature sandwiches a try, the Giovanni. I added a side of onion rings. The reviews for this location are spot on! Delicious combination of flavors and an awesome variety of food!  More important to me then the food, believe it or not, it's customer service. And this place has it!"}
{"text":"Mike's Place has an X-Wing in the front yard. If that doesn't get your attention, I'm not sure what will...but I'll give it a shot.  Breakfast. Pizza.  Most people hit Mike's for beer, bar food, burgers, and other things that start with B....but Breakfast is a surprisingly good idea. There's lots of delicious, carb-y stuff to soak up a few hangovers (plus the hair of the dog, when you need it!), but the pizza...oh, man. It was a total surprise, and it was absolutely worth it.  Start with a biscuit crust. Add sausage gravy. Crumbled bacon. Scrambled eggs. Cheddar cheese! The medium is enough to feed two or three people. The large will feed four to six.  It's not haute cuisine, but it's pretty amazing stuff when you're out with friends and looking for something fun."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok for my first visit. The overall aesthetic is pretty cool. Lots of cool things to check out, both inside and outside.   Our waitress was super friendly and nice. Waters always stayed full, and she was super kind to my son. I ordered the waffle loaded with sausage, eggs, and sausage gravy and potatoes! It was pretty good! Kind of reminded me of typical diner food.  The menu is HUGE. I think I spent more time reading fun facts and commentary, than trying to find something to eat (the menu is seriously so long).   I think I would definitely go back to check out the other food!"}
{"text":"Precisely the place to go if you want family style restaurant with something for everyone. Decor is remarkable--and I mean that in an entirely descriptive non-judging way. From the full-size X-Wing Fighter out front to the various artifacts inside, there is again something for everyone. Portions are generous and selection is extremely broad. Menu is overwhelming in good ways and bad. Food has been consistently good, but never amazing. Service adequate. Local place that is not mistaken for all the cookie-cutter chain places that dominant the eating options in the area."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes with 3 little kids...only to be seated literally 1 ft from the bar.  There were multiple tables actually in the restaurant, not sure why they would set up our 2 year old's highchair actually in the bar.  We then waited for a waitress to come greet us, bring water, take our order. No one came, so after another 5 min, we told another employee we hadn't seen a waitress yet.  She gave us a dirty look, shrugged, and walked off.  We got up, after all that time and left.  We'll never go back and spend our money there, that's for sure."}
{"text":"When you realize the bathroom of a restaurant is disgusting, you should probably take a hint to leave. I know that they value old crap there, they think it adds charm, but come on, clean the bathroom! Didn't find the food to be that great either. Fries were cold and soggy. I could make better things at home. I will never be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Food is ample but service and quality is lacking. Good luck if you gave an after work function at bar"}
{"text":"Waitress took forever. Children's spaghetti is spicy!  Really!?  For a kid!?  Gyro and fries came out cold!!  Took twice as long for dinner than we had planned on!  Not ideal!"}
{"text":"Visited Mike's for the first time on Friday, it is a neat place. The decor is neat, I'm pretty sure they raided my grandmas house in the 80's and came up with their design plan, just kidding. The food is good, the prices are great, I had a mimosa and it was strong (no one is complaining). The service was as good as the food. I can't say it is a \"phenomenal\" breakfast but I can say that it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"Yes, there is an X-wing outside, yes there is a funny menu, yes there is a castle and a bus and a boat and an Elvis booth. It's awesome to sit in the restaurant and I've been coming to Mike's for a well over a decade. The fact of the matter, though, is that while Mike's Place is a rad building with a rad menu, it's so woefully inconsistent that I can't justify recommending it to friends and I can't eat there without feeling disappointed about 70% of the time I eat here.  The menu is enormous. They've even pared it back in the last year and it's still enormous. This is the main issue with the place and yeah, it's humorous, but there is no way a server can learn the whole thing in a reasonable amount of time and there's no way that the kitchen can make consistently good food when most of the items are likely poured from a can or frozen - there is no way you can keep fresh ingredients with a menu like that. Just today I was there, and I was over charged for several items because the new server had no idea - items I've ordered many times, even recently. A side of curly fries will never be $5, ever, and give the attitude I refused to argue about it.  The cleanliness of the restaurant has really improved over the last year, so that is a plus, but you almost have to wonder if that's because they rearranged all the stuff on the walls and for the first time got up close and personal with their own filth. There are basically always fruit flies buzzing around in the dining area, which is a little gross. I wouldn't mention it, but I don't think I've eaten anywhere else in Kent where it's a problem. So while it's getting better, there are still issues for sure.  I don't think anyone has lofty ideas about what Mike's is supposed to be - they put it right out there. They're greasy, they're cheap, they win best hangover food almost every year from one magazine or another. The issue is not that - it's that you can totally be greasy and sugary and still be great junk food with some level of quality and consistency and they aren't there. And given that this has been an issue forever, I don't suspect they'll ever hit that mark."}
{"text":"I've never seen a menu with soooo many items! it makes it very hard to chose, but usually can find something you would like. This place is perfect for a college town, and has a great location. Everything is pretty cheap, and the portions are ginormous! The breakfast is great, the cinnamon buns huge! more than a meal in itself.... the burgers and gyros are great... HOWEVER from my first and last experience the pasta (or the pasta sauce) is terrible... when it came to the table, i was overwhelmed by the smell of hot dog food, not knowing who's plate it was coming from i tried the pasta, and it was the sauce! and it tasted just as bad as it smelled, by kids wouldn't even eat it... but everything else i have had had been worth what you pay for.  Usually friendly staff considering the majority are working through college, and very unusual, yet interesting decor."}
{"text":"Mike's makes up for quality with quantity and variety.  So, if you like to eat a lot of starchy food, here's your place. Cool decor. They should cou the menu by 75% and go for taste and flavor instead of more."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, what's not to love?  The interior decoration is American kitsch to the extreme, but unlike chain restaurants there is a theme (Star Wars, dragons, and more) with witty and entertaining notations. The menu is extensive with a healthy dose of snarky comments spread throughout.  The food is classic American greasy spoon fare served in large portions. Most items are great with only the rare iffy dish."}
{"text":"So I stop in here, my first time ever, and sit at the bar to order lunch. I look over the Menu, and settle on what they call The Giovanni (that's John for us English types). When it arrives, I have before me a Full Hoagie roll stuffed w Buffalo Chicken, Swiss cheese, veggies, and hand crafted Blue Cheese, made right in their own kitchen. A Slice of Heaven for sure.   Bottom Line, I will return to sample the rest of the menu. If this is how they do lunch, Dinner could be even Better!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was definitely unique. One of the tables is in a boat and there are all sorts of knick knacks on the wall to look at.  Options usually are a good thing, but this menu was out of control. It just made the experience a little more overwhelming.  I ordered a veggie burger. It was just ok, a little dry.  I appreciated being able to add all the toppings without the additional cost.  I did enjoy the warm pretzel.  Portions are sizeable here so be careful with how much you order.  Service was good, no complaints there.  I wouldn't mind returning if I was in the Kent area again. The food I had at this visit was just mediocre though."}
{"text":"We had dinner there on Wednesday afternoon. We had fish on a dish and onion rings. They were both served very hot and they were excellent. The waitress was very nice. Music was a little to loud but what can you expect its a bar."}
{"text":"The food was so awesome! It was beyond description. The flavors in the pulled pork sandwich I got all came through in a unique blend.  It would have gotten more stars, but the place was filthy. There was cruddy food from years past lodged in places clearly visible. The walls had food smeared on them that no one bothered to clean up. We sat in the rear of the \"boat\"....gross!"}
{"text":"when you go to a restaurant and the back of the menu lets you know youre going to have bad service. theyre not wrong. waited 20 minutes before a server even came to our table. then another 10 before they came back for our order. recieved our food and hour later and it was good but really not that special. but when i went to pay for my check 3 different servers handled the transaction and by the time it got back to me. theyd put it on another table. and charged that table to me. good thing the people were nice enough not to steal my debit card. so the server said shed fix it and then charge my card with my bill as well. so thats what $57 out of my bank account. they never apologized for the mix up and  its been a week and the money still hasnt gone back in my account from the other transaction. probably beacuse i didnt leave a tip. its incredibly obvious that this place just hires warm bodies that act like they deserve a huge tip for just showing up and standing around. dont waste your time and hard earned money. i wont be back and im sure this place wont be around very much longer with service like this."}
{"text":"\"Oh, I mean this is like the greatest thing since the X-Wing fighter!\" -- SpaceCamp (1986)  My Dad travelled for business all the time since he worked for IBM for 25+ years, and he used to say he travelled on his stomach. If you aren't sure what that means - he loved to find new local places to eat when he was on the road.  Like father, like daughter.  So when I was told I was going to Kent, Ohio, I was not happy camper. No way would I find cool places to check out... man, I was wrong.  My client told me we had to get up extra early and try out Mike's for breakfast telling us it was on the way to the office from the hotel and they have great food. Okay, sure, why not? We pulled in at 7:15am and the first thing I saw was an X-Wing fighter \"parked\" out front. My co-worker and I laughed and I said \"anyplace good enough for Luke, is good enough for me.\"  We were seated quickly and coffee was brought to the table. Not bad for a place known for great hangover food! I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and my co-worker ordered the Country Omelette. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out, but damn they were HUGE plates.  Now, I did not initially notice it, but one of my over easy eggs was broken (the yolk had run all under my hash browns and toast).  After another 5 minutes, our waitress came by the table with a small plate and a replacement egg. She said the chef felt really bad that he had \"popped\" my egg when he placed it on top of my hash, so he made me a fresh one. That never, EVER, happens... even at the nicest of joints. I was impressed.  So, of course, I put that egg on top of the broken one.  The hash was the right level of saltiness, with the rich briny, beefy flavor from the fresh, shredded corned beef, with lovely crispy hash brown potatoes running all through it and just enough caramelized onion to not give me bad breath for my all day meetings.  The only problem with this dish, is it also comes with hash browns on the plate - why when hash HAS hash browns in them? Weird, but ok. I ate a little of them too. It so much food I could not finish it all. I did, however, eat all my sourdough toast as I sopped up all the runny egg yolks.  Two coffees and both entrees came to $22 - not bad for so much food. I would definitely return here on my next trip - I hear that this is the greasy spoon to eat in when you've partaken a little too much the night before. It's also very possible it is where you were when you drank too much.  Great service and wacky decor - The force is strong with this place."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of mikes place ever since I've been a student at Kent State but something happened last time I was there that left the worst taste in my mouth... Figuratively and literally. I had the worst food I've had in years and then I walked out without my sunglasses. I walked right back in and they were gone. Management said that I misplaced my OWN glasses and they didn't ever see them. The owner came out and ACCUSED ME of being a bad customer, accusing his employees of stealing and told me to dig through the trash to find my glasses. NEVER will I ever eat at Mikes place AGAIN!! Bad management... Bad food..."}
{"text":"The foods alright. It's the typical get anywhere \"American style.\" The atmosphere is definitely the best part and the menu is slightly overwhelming at first but so many options which is a good thing in my opinion!"}
{"text":"What this place lacks in food quality it makes up for with clutter and kitch.  This is the quintessential \"greasy spoon\", minus the good comfort foods that make these establishments worth a try.  The menu is huge. This means they don't do anything particularly well and food quality/freshness is suspect.  But if you consider scrambled eggs with Velveeta on top an omelette, then this could be your place.  The atmosphere is eclectic and cluttered. Kids may love this place, in part, due the X-Wing fighter in front of establishment.  There is better diner food to be found."}
{"text":"Love going here the menus huge lots of great food beers drinks you name it they got it!!!"}
{"text":"Such a unique and interesting place to eat. Every time you go, you noticed something you haven't before. Aside from the eclectic decor, the food options are endless. Some may complaint that there is too much to choose from, but that's exactly what the restaurant is going for. (If you can't tell from the decor...) and even with so many good options, everything tastes great!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! So unique! Where to start?!?  Well, I'll start with the atmosphere. It's very eclectic. I knew I'd like when there was a huge X-Wing statue out front. Inside, the walls are covered in memorabilia and old license plates. There is a huge pirate ship in one room and behind the restaurant there is a castle bigger than the building itself.  The menu is endless. Literally anything you can think off. Its about 7 pages long with 10 point font. While there, I got the wings and the curly fries (it was national wing day that day). The hot was actually hot, nice change of place. And the curly fries were amazing as well. I stole a bite of the chicken teriyaki plate and it was very very good. Everything at our table got rave reviews.  On top of the food and atmosphere, the prices were very cheap. I noticed a huge seafood platter (fish, crab cakes and 20+ fried shrimp and 2 sides for $15). It seems very cheap for the quality you are receiving.  Lastly, the service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and very accommodating to our questions and request.s   I will certainly be returning to Mike's Place, hopefully sooner than next national wing day!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for breakfast this morning and was immediately reminded why, during the 8 years I spent in Kent, I only went here once.  This place would be great as a museum or antique shop, but as a restaurant?  No.    Like other reviewers have said the menu is the size of an encyclopedia, which, while funny, should be your first warning sign.  I'd imagine it's difficult to keep that many different ingredients within the expiration date, let alone anywhere near \"fresh.\"  And it tastes like it.  The running joke has always been this is the place to come to if you want diarrhea (see what I did there?) and that joke exists for a reason.    Yes, they do have a giant X-Wing outside.  They get points for that.  The best thing about the place is the huge assortment of random, kitschy stuff that fills every nook, cranny, and corner of the restaurant.  While this is the greatest strength, it's also a pretty big weakness.  All the antiques are great, but the whole place just feels...filthy.  Seriously.  Maybe it's all the grease oozing out from the kitchen, but it just feels dirty.  I'm not one of those people that needs a restaurant to be spotless, either.  I know the cleanliness of the dining area doesn't always reflect the quality of the food.  Here, though, the two pretty much go hand in hand.  And don't get me started on the bathroom.    Our server was friendly and I will say that there's really nowhere else quite like Mike's Place.  Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.....  Go and have a beer or two just to see the place and say you've been there.  Then go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went today and usually everytime we have been there the service and food was fantastic. Our server was barely there. After we got drinks she was no where to be found for a good 20mins. It wasn't even that busy and all the other servers were very attentive to their tables, also even people that were sat after us with a different server had their order taken and food brought out before our server even took our order. She didn't seem like she wanted to be there. I've been in the food industry since I was a teen and this was the 1st time in a long time I've encountered bad service. When she did bring our food she asked if I wanted a refill and she never came back with it. She never asked if we needed anything or to see if everything was good or not. We had to flag down another server to get our check. I'll change my stars up to a 4-5 next time as long as we don't get her. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Great place for a hearty breakfast at a very affordable price. The menu is extensive and there are specials every weekday!"}
{"text":"Had a great impromptu dinner after my sons game was delayed at Kent State field.  Great menu. Good food."}
{"text":"Great place for any meal. prices are not bad and the service is usually very good. I'd take Mike's over a lot of places in Kent"}
{"text":"I've been to mikes place just under 10 times and I've never been disappointed. Yes, it is busy a lot of the time, but it's worth the wait!! Everything I've tried on the menu is delicious. The restaurant itself is just a cool place to visit. I highly recommend Mike's Place. It's one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"We stopped here because of all the hype and \"oh my god you have to eat here\" out there.   We thought it was meh.   The food was ok, but not great. The server was very nice, but the service was very slow.   I got a meatball sub, and it came out on garlic bread pieces not a sub. The sauce was kinda odd tasting-maybe like green peppers, which I don't like.  My husband got Rolando BBQ Pork sandwich. They were out of the bread it was suppose to be on so they had to replace it with something else We ordered the apple pie and it was huge and delicious   All in all, i would say it's a one and done. We've tried it, it was ok - we'll move on."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, and great service!!! Steak wrap kicked butt! Peanut butter pie...... more like buckeye pie! This place is cool, local, and worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I'd be fat if I ate here too often. The menu is huge and can be confusing but hang in there and make a selection. Fun atmosphere with lots of nooks and crannys to be in while you eat. I usually get a breakfast so I have no idea how they lunch fare tastes. You can usually get a table right away unless you want a particular table or room (you'll know what I mean once you've been there). The other reviews have info about what memorabilia there is outside and inside - you kinda have to see it to believe it."}
{"text":"Great place in Kent.  Food was good, great beer choices, atmosphere was funky and good service.  We sat in Bilbo alcove where you can see and read early history if place which was cool.  Worth a visit...or many."}
{"text":"Luckily the X-Wing is outside - you can take pictures with it and then leave and eat somewhere else!  In general, the food at this place is pretty bad but I do want to say there are a couple of servers who are really great and generally work in the bar area in the morning.   There are a couple safe-ish options on the menu which I'll plan to stick with if I can ever be cajoled to go here again (they are mostly breakfast!!) but most of the food is overly greasy, bland, covered in plastic \"cheese\" or just plain cheap and underwhelming.   If you like your restaurant trying to pass off the bits of french fries from the bottom of the bin as home fries (SERIOUSLY?!), a bland beef sandwich, or a \"warm bacon dressing spinach salad\" that is actually iceberg lettuce with congealed sweet and sour with bacon bits in it then Mike's Place is for you!"}
{"text":"The menu at Mike's was extensive and hilarious. They have numerous jokes throughout the menu which I found entertaining! The atmosphere was very unique too, with a lot of interesting decor. There is a replica X Wing outside, while inside there is an old bus with tables inside it, a boat, etc. Very very cool.  However, the food was not very good. My wife ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries. Not horrible, but it was cold. They didn't even melt the cheese (or even try to). I ordered the cuban hot dog (I'm pretty sure that's what it was called :), and it was OK too. The fries were cold.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Rudest manager and (for the most part) servers. I went here 2 weeks ago with my friends for dinner, not very busy at all. My friend (who was with her newborn) ordered a sausage pizza and they got it wrong twice - bringing out one with gravy and eggs on it... I complained to the hostess and asked to talk to the manager and he was nothing but arrogant and unprofessional, yelling in her ear when she asked him to repeat himself. Definitely not going back to what was my favorite place in Kent."}
{"text":"While I think this place is fun for its decor and hangover food, the last time I was there not only was waitress was super super rude (arguing with us about what 'over easy' means, and about types of tea. wtf), but my eggs Benedict did not have fucking poached eggs!!! The severely misinformed waitress told me that my eggs would be basted, and that this is the same thing as poached. Fine, I said, not wanting to incur another dumb argument between customer and server at our table. The dish came and my eggs were practically hard boiled. I'm sorry I'm not sorry, but badly poached eggs are unforgivable. Period. You lose the breakfast game if you cannot do this. Take eggs Benedict off of your menu while you learn what exactly that means. Double rude."}
{"text":"This is a good place to nurse a hangover as the food is greasy and cooked to \"college kids' standards.\" The atmosphere is fun and there's lots to look at, but it's also a bit dirty. The menu is overwhelmingly big. It's a good place to go if you've been drinking and want a bite to eat before heading home, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're sober."}
{"text":"We went in late one night for dinner. Took almost 15 minutes for someone to come to the table and take our drink orders. Food is large portions...and not bad. Menu is so large it'll make ur head spin. And you question if they can do it all and do it well. Overall its just ok, and we may try it for breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"I really don't know how I haven't reviewed this place before as I've been here numerous times. It takes a spot in my top ten places I've ate at in my 34 years living. First and foremost they have a X Wing out front so that alone has my attention. Next the interior has so much to look at you could come here 100 times and see something new. Some of the seating is the coolest. Wanna sit in a bus? A boat? They have it all! Now the menu? You're gonna need 15 minutes minimal to read it all. Besides all the great options to choose from they have so much funny stuff to read. Watch out for the storm troopers! Ha! So the food is always delicious and quickly delivered. I've never had a bad experience here the employees clearly love their jobs and enjoying being here. Now please remember that this place is popular and there is always a wait to be seated. Be patient and look around you won't be disappointed. You'll love Mike's Place!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food. Awesome Alfredo sauce and it's homemade. We also got the boneless wings, sweet potato fries and my son for a small pizza. I can't believe we have never been here before. We are going to make this a regular!"}
{"text":"If you can't find SOMETHING here on the menu. You really aren't trying.  This is a Kent area classic, it brings a smile to the face of anyone that grew up around here."}
{"text":"I had driven past this place a number of times and always noted the X-Wing Fighter out front and the rundown looking building. I never knew what to think but kept avoiding it.  It's located right on 43 with its own gated parking lot. One day, curiosity got the best of me and I ended up inside.   This place looks like an episode of American Pickers. There is junk everywhere. But in a good way. You could keep yourself busy all day looking at the random artifacts and reading all the signs and humor around this place. No way around it, this is a dive but that is part of the charm here. My service was pretty good but nothing to go crazy about. But both times I was here the staff were polite and welcoming.  The menu is a work of art! It can be overwhelming but I found it really fun(ny) to read. I suggest it. It's online so you can look it up before going. My first visit I had just a standard burger and utilized the burger bar to add all kinds of stuff to it. It wasn't bad but a bit over cooked and dry. Luckily the burger bar fixed all that. Fries were pretty good.  But the second time around I got a little(sarcasm) something called The Dirk Diggler. That is 12 solid inches of grilled ham, roast beef, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions & mushrooms smothered with fries & BBQ sauce.  They aren't lying when they say you need two hands and a lot of napkins. Check out the picture!  It was a mission to take it down but oh so good!   They have a full bar which seemed well stocked. I was here around Christmas so they introduced me to a drink called The Christmas Story.  Basically fill a pint glass 1/3 with Christmas Ale of choice(I suggest Thristy Dog 12 Dogs of Christmas), equal parts of Goldschlager, Bailey's, Frangelico in shot glass, drop Shot glass into beer and drink like a car bomb.  Truly an amazing festive beverage!  The bartender was really cool and talkative. We talked at length about local craft brewers and traded stories.  Look, end of day this is a local dive beloved by many that is fun enough and serves good enough food to keep people coming back.  It isn't fine dining, there is some crude humor and the place is a little dark and dingy. If you want something different that the typical chains in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"Best place in kent! So many options on the menu and the waitstaff is really quick. Gets crowded though!"}
{"text":"Slow service,cold greasy food....No Thanks....not again!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have a good experience at this restaurant. I have been here between 5-10 times and had awful experiences each time. Terrible service, overwhelming menu, runs out of food items, and overall the quality of food hasn't been great either. When I was in college I had a roommate who worked here, and the way things are run behind the scenes (per her stories) reflect in the way customers are treated. There is poor organization and a lack of management. Additionally, after learning my lesson that the food is lackluster and frequently over or under done, I started ordering simple things in hopes there would be improvement (e.g. eggs, toast, pancakes), who can mess up things like that, right? The pancakes were salty (I'm still perplexed by this) and the toast was burnt to a crisp. I know 8 year olds who can make pancakes and toast. I am a genuine believer in giving places opportunity for redemption, but the chances have run out for Mikes. I have yet to understand why people like it here so much"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for breakfast. Great atmosphere. Great food. Reasonably priced. Absolutely worth the wait on a Sunday morning. Menu is varied. They serve traditional and deliciously eclectic options. My first time here, but I will be back when visiting my child at Kent State!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday! The macho nachos were really good, and so was this Italian melt I got. The only thing is I wish the service was a little bit faster. But working in the food industry I can understand sometimes why things get backed up. But overall it was a great experience and I love the design of mikes place!!! Also, if you are looking for the best bloody Mary's in Kent, mikes place is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went in at lunch  walk in to bar sit there 15 min 3 of us I went to front told them we were waiting she said  I know waited a few more min an left. I saw other people at tables after we arrived get served"}
{"text":"We've passed by this place so many times thinking that it looked dumpy and we were kind of afraid to go in (I'm a food snob, according to my family). Finally we got brave and decided to stop. I'm so glad we did! As everyone else has said, if you stop for the uniqueness of the place alone, you'll be highly satisfied. We sat in a tugboat, for crying out load. The menu is so extensive that there is no way that they can prep/make everything fresh. But they guaranteed the burgers and fries to be fresh/homemade and they weren't lying. The prices are great, the decor adorable, and if you can't find something here that you'd like, you're more of a food snob than I am."}
{"text":"After passing by this unique looking establishment many times, we decided to check it out. The outside vibe is a medical, beachy, garage, Rebel Force. The interior is just as unusual. There's a bus, a Bilbo hobbit hole and pirate ship decorating the inside. License plates, airplane parts and signs galore hang on the walls. The menu is 4 plus pages long. It includes rules for the restaurant provided by \"Mike\". The food was great. The prices were great. We will definitely stop in again and not just drive by. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss some days food is good others days food is subpar. Plenty to look at on the walls good luck finding a parking spot. Even thought resturant is only half full"}
{"text":"Over the holidays, we were in Cleveland visiting family, and I knew that I had to take my Star Wars fanatic husband to see the replica of the X-Wing Fighter. Once he got done geeking out over it, and many photos were taken, we went inside to eat. Every section of the inside is different, you can dine in a boat complete with a mermaid or in a full-sized vintage bus or a in a British pub. It's very kitschy, but it's also very fun to walk around and explore the different areas.   We started out with a round of drinks and pickle fries. I love fried pickles--if they are on a menu, I'm ordering them. The pickle fries were somehow even better than normal fried pickles! The seasonal cider that I ordered was also amazing! The menu is MASSIVE--it was sooooo hard to decide what to order. So much so, that my husband went with a sandwich called, I'm So Confused, But Oh I Like It! It was a sort of Reuben/gyro combo, and I actually liked it way better than the random sandwich I ordered. It was called the Lutz Lavishous Lush and was a strange combo of chicken, bacon, pineapple, and thousand island dressing. It was good but not necessarily something I'd order again. I highly recommend checking out the menu before you go because there are so many different options! Another thing to note is that the sandwiches are HUGE, and you will definitely leave feeling super full!  Our server was super sweet and attentive throughout our entire meal. It was such a unique experience, and if you're in the area, you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"In this area, this is one of the better places. Pretty eccentric - there is an X-Wing outside, as well as some other random things - and the inside is covered in license plates and other memorabilia. It's a very casual place with a large menu.  I always find that is FREEZING in this place - no matter what time of year we go. Bring a sweater! The service is okay - never great - and we've had times where it was just downright terrible. We waited an hour once for our check,and were leaving to go out of town right after and were getting a little impatient.   The food is okay - greasy food - but they have a large menu and you can almost always find something to eat for every one in the party. The menu can be a little hard to navigate, and I sometimes have trouble deciding by the time the waitress comes because I can't make it through the whole thing in that short of time.   The portions are huge - you can almost always share. If not, you will have left overs."}
{"text":"I admit I am a sucker for the abundant kitsch here; it often reels me on trips to Kent. The menu is massive -- too massive -- but if you stick to simple items, you'll likely be satisfied. Very good beer list, college town prices, and a very fun place."}
{"text":"putting aside that this place is a fire hazard .. this place is FILTHY .. the service is HORRIBLE .. + the food SUCKS .. when you have to return pancakes twice because they are raw in the middle you got problems .. when they came back for the third time burned that puts the nail in the coffin on the decision to never return to this place ever again"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. Delicious, and sooo well priced. Amazing and abundant choices! We were in a party of 11 and we were seated as soon as we walked in (around 6p). It was great! The wait after putting our order in was short for the amount of food we ordered! I had the vulture burger It was delicious! Most of the people with me had the 10/16 pc wing dinner come with two sides. They all finished it!   Just a tip check their menu online before heading over, at least glance at it. Their menu is 4 tiny print, back and front, pages long! But it's so diverse!  Definitely stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Had a 8 oz smothered sirloin steak that had sauteed onions and mushrooms on it.  Very tasty!  We also had a rack of ribs.  Very tender and falls right off the bone.  The salad was good too although the curly fries were so-so.  The service wasn't too good though.  The waiter never came back at all, we had to flag down another worker.  The decor was interesting, although I think the x-wing is the only thing really unusual.  Where we were seated the rest was mostly just license plates and random mike related or older items.  The menu had tons of items and was really funny to read.  The next time we ate there we had the chef's supreme salad and wings.  They were both very good and tasty.  The service was also a lot better with the waitress actually coming around asking us how it was going and fixing our order with extra wings on the house when she gave us the wrong amount the first time."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight for my wife's birthday. This is a Kent staple and takes me back to my college days. I love this place with all the decor and funny menus. The waitress did a fantastic job juggling our party of 12. We had a 2 year old with us and she interacted with him so well.   The food is always amazing. The problem is that there is so much on the menu and I want to try it all!! I usually get wings and my wife always gets breakfast. Btw the serve breakfast all day. I would highly recommend this to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mike's Place!! I think they probably have over 100 things on their menu!! Mike's Place has decorations everywhere... from license plates to an old bus you can eat in. Sometimes the service sucks (hence the 4star rating), the food is always great though. I would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"A very unique & interesting place. First time visitors should walk through and have a look. The breakfast special is the best bang for your buck in the North-East United States. There is a huge menu & a bar. The staff is knowledgeable & attentive. A all around great place for breakfast, lunch, dinner & drinks. Or a late night stop when your on your way home from the bars."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant!! We have never had any complaints! The Gouda macaroni bites are excellent. The menu is huge the food is great and the service is wonderful!! We come here at least once a week!!  The decor is phenomenal you won't get bored waiting if you just look around!!  They have daily specials and a good deal on breakfast during the week!! If you have a chance I would stop by!!"}
{"text":"We go there almost every time we drop my sister off at school...if you can't find something you like here....I don't know what to tell you! The menu is huge and the prices are very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"The place is really interesting, with the bus and boat inside, and all the memorabilia inside. Too bad the food is bad and the service really slow. Like a previous reviewer said, there are some safe breakfast options. The Captain Jack fish sandwich was really bad. Ordered Cajun, got breaded deep fried anyway. Fish undercooked and slimy inside. Fries had been sitting out cold a while before reaching the table. It's a big place. Should have lots of help in the kitchen on a Sunday noon. I guess they didn't. It's worth a visit and a safe breakfast choice."}
{"text":"Given that there are few places to eat in Kent, its not surprising that Mike's Place could get positive reviews...or maybe Star Wars fans are just easily impressed.  Yes there is a model X-wing Fighter outside and yes that is definitely cool.  The food end of things however...not so cool.  The portions are huge but the food is garbage, so I'm not sure how larger portions of garbage is better than smaller portions.  Despite my bad experiences, I returned a few times to see if maybe it was just a bad night, but it was always bad.  The burger topping bar.....has anyone witnessed that thing being cleaned in any way?  I know I havn't, despite the ingredients looking like they've clearly been sitting out for 6+ hours.  Service was always bad.  I think they only care about going outside to smoke.  We ordered ice cream once and never got anything to eat it with...had to ask the waitress twice for spoons (never got them).  Finally got up and bugged a different waitress for them.  One one occasion, management insisted on sending us a gift-card to come back....we said we didn't want it...but they insisted.....well we never got the gift card.  Kent deserves better"}
{"text":"nothing i could say would be good enough to describe this place. the food is super unique and so is the atmosphere. you can sit in a bus or in ur own private alcove. the food and the prices are great as well as the service. must try. The menu is huge. I miss living out in that area because of this restaurant. If you live in ohio and ever go through kent or nearby STOP HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I *cannot* believe that someone reviewed this before me. ... ... ...  Well, actually YES I can - because it is so awesome.  Where do I begin about Mike's Place?  Located in my hometown (read the sidebar, beeotches) this is the place in high school that my pals and I would ditch school to go hang out at...  (Golly, I hope my Mommaship doesn't read Yelp reviews.)  In college (went to KENT STATE baybee) it was the best place to go after a heavy night of drinking... their belly buster breakfast could cure any hangover...  Since?  Whenever I am home I try to go to Mike's at least once... usually on Christmas Eve morning - with my whole crayzee family - for a great-big-stinking-Midwestern-cheese-sausage-bacon-fried breakfast...  The food? Exactly what you'd expect if you saw the outside of this place.  As the mysterious ? mark Terry M. points out - Mike's Place is chock full of memorabilia...  it is truly a unique place - the bus shell with seating is cool... but, not as cool as:  THE X-WING FIGHTER IN THE PARKING LOT.  Full scale. Who gives a shit on how good the food is? X-Wing Mo' Fo' FIGHTER... Use the force, Luke..."}
{"text":"Unique. Perfect word to describe Mike's Place!  If you want to go to a restaurant and have something to talk about this is for you. A great place to take out-of-towners for a unique dining experience. Some folks that work for my husband brought us here for lunch last week and we were seated immediately in the Irish room so we were secluded which we all liked.  Mike's is filled with all kinds of memorabilia and there is always something new to see. They also have the biggest menu I have literally ever seen in my life! We had about 15 minutes to look it over before ordering and I know for a fact I didn't even read everything in there, it was overwhelming! Our waitress was real hoot and razzed my lunch guests throughout the meal. When the food came I was speechless, largest portions I have seen in a very, long time. Absolutely massive food!  I ordered the Flogging Molly which was a fish sandwich and it ended up being 2 meals for me easily. Nicely breaded fish, deep fried crunchy coating, lettuce, tomato, cheese and tartar sauce on the side. I also ordered the Peanut Butter Pie because that is just a menu item that I can't pass up-and it isn't something you find very often. It was definitely full of peanut butter, more so than chocolate. It was a frozen PB pie drizzled with chocolate syrup and also had whipped cream rosettes. Loved it. Everyone seemed to enjoy all of the items they ordered and not one person managed to finish either. I was with 4 men with very hearty appetites so that tells you that I do not lie when I say the portions were ginormous!  No military discount."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants! The menu is just insane! The variety of things you can order is pretty mind boggling. The food is delicious and BIG! You get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time. The decor is fun the first time, but overwhelming every time thereafter. If you're looking for decent, greasy, hangover food, then Mike's is the place for you. However, it doesn't seem very clean and the service is pretty crummy.   I ordered a vegetarian omelette and told the waiter 3 times that it was very important for there to NOT be meat in the food because I am a vegetarian that gets sick from eating meat. I am not kidding: the last 3 TIMES I went here, there ended up being chunks of meat (usually ham) in my food. I got sick twice. I won't go here again.  Bottom line: if you can eat anything and prefer greasy food, then try Mike's. If that doesn't describe you, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mike's Place is one of those places you go & feel really welcomed by the staff! Server Maria has taken care of us the last two times we went & she is sweet and makes sure you have what you need. The menu is massive! I have never seen one with so many options! Most places can't have that many choices and still have quality food, but Mike's crew does a good job! Everything is fresh & tasty. The decor is amazing. You can't go here & see everything in one, two, or ten visits. The atmosphere is very laid back & everyone always seems really happy to be there! We love it & can't wait to go back. The beer battered fish is amazing & I love love love their green bean casserole. Haven't been able to try their desserts since I haven't been able to even get through a whole meal! So far, I make it about half way through & that's as far as I can go. One if these days we'll do dessert first because they look incredible!"}
{"text":"Given all of the new restaurants in Kent, I think Mikes place will soon be out of business. I'm a student at Kent State, so for a while this was one of the only restaurants in Kent (especially if you didn't want dorm hall food). The few times I have been there the food is extremely greasy, I'm not a health nut, but literally my chicken tenders were in a pool of grease. I will however say that the side salad with ranch dressing and there rolls were very good. However, the last time I went there it was a Friday night and just my boyfriend and I. We expected a little wait when we came in and were told it would be about 20 minutes-not bad. We waited and waited, until about 40 minutes later when we specifically asked for our table. The hostess sat us in the bar are (which is in the castle towards the back) which was fun, but I do believe there is NO heat...I was shivering, and it took about an hour to just get some basic dishes. I think they need to do a better job of getting more servers and cooks because others will turn to the new restaurants in downtown Kent to get a meal."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant. Very casual. Pool table. Very child friendly-pictures colored by kids are all over the walls. Full bar. I had ravioli and it was great. Meatloaf was huge. Ziti with chicken was huge. Fried mushrooms wee hit and not greasy. I think the waitress Tomi knew everyone. They don't rush you out. Dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"I went here today and had the Cajun Chicken Pasta.  It was good and fresh, but needed more noodles and heavier sauce.  ( So ask for extra).  My friend had the country fried steak breakfast. It was good.  I also tried the house Italian dressing which was delicious. The service was grwat. The decor is sweet.  It is decorated with all kinds of eye catching stuff.  The centerpiece being the Star Wars fighter parked out front. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a different experience when they go out to eat."}
{"text":"Recently raised their prices. On very mediocre food. And sometimes hard to find staff."}
{"text":"Me and mommy stumbled upon this place while out visiting in Ravenna. And man were we happy we did. This place has awesome food and service. I grabbed the country fried steak dinner. Mash and green beans. And a potato hash. It was delicious. The menu is very funny. Service was very pleasant"}
{"text":"I try not to eat anything but breakfast at this place. It is a grease fest even with breakfast sometimes. I also think they should fix the booths and tables before they buy anymore junk to hang on the walls or make another room out of. Sitting in the bus is terrible. It's like sitting on a barstool without a back on it for an hour while you try to eat: not for me."}
{"text":"Ugh I love this place ! It brings me right back to home. You walk in there's all kinds of random stuff on the wall. Everything's unique and special. That's first. If you ever get the chance, sit in the bus to eat. Yes, I said bus.   Then you look at this menu. First of all, the waiters/waitresses apparently have to memorize this entire thing. It's practically a novel y'all. They have so many different food items it's absurd. Any combination of turkey, bacon, burger, vegetable, fry, sauce that you could think of - they have a sandwich for it.   My personal favorite was the fish sandwich but I vaguely remember eating some sort of a pulled pork sandwich but all I remember was that I loved it. My boyfriend also enjoyed the ruebens they have there. He's a big reuben guy.   The overall vibe is just chill. I've also heard from MANY that their breakfast is to die for. I haven't personally tried it, but always meant to. The atmosphere is definitely the best part for me!"}
{"text":"With an atmosphere as unique and interesting as the menu, there is something for all (even us picky , I dissect everything I eat) walks of life. Ranging from their delicious Reese's Peanutbutter Cup pancakes to their Bride of Chuckie sandwich; the prices are fair, the service is always polite and it's easy to ignore bad company at this place because there's plenty to stare at.   Good visual distraction, yummyness in your tummy & money still left in your pocket :)"}
{"text":"Ridiculous amount of items on their menu. Something for everyone. Very reasonably priced. Large portions. Entertaining decor. Good service.  Have yet to ever be disappointed there."}
{"text":"Out of town for a few days and tried this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  It took a really long time for anyone to acknowledge me, but service improved after I got a menu. Soooo many options to choose from. Got Ron's nachos. Heaping plate with three kinds of cheese ( one being of the whiz variety). Side of very nice house made salsa . Decent, unoverwhelming  beer list. Got a magic hat # 9.  Would definitely go back with a group so there's room left to share a dessert!"}
{"text":"This is s laid back joint!  From the outside it resembles a dive bar, but don't let that fool you.  Our party found this a perfect spot to get good food and adult pops.   The staff was very friendly, attentive and engaging.   The menu was off the charts.  The amount of options were extensive, and offered both normal foods, as well some nice twists to some old conventional foods.  Be prepared...it's a giant menu.  We all ordered different foods and enjoyed each.  Portions were large, and the prices were low.  Much of the menu is not health friendly, but there are a few options that could meet the need.   This place reminded of the late night, or really late morning college after party grub joints.  It's family friendly, but may be more appealing to a group of friends.   We'll be back to try the other menu items that looked great."}
{"text":"Great place!  The food is good and good prices. It's a low key place to hang out with friends and family.  If you're in Kent stop in. Alot to see while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"The food here is affordable, and the burger I got was gigantic. However, the burger the bun, and the french fries all lacked seasoning. The service was quick as well. However the building is in an industrial park and very run down. Overall not a bad experience and very affordable and quick for lunch. Don't go out of your way to go to it, but if you're in the area and need a quick bite this isn't a bad place to visit"}
{"text":"Hands down, the most unique restaurant in Kent.  The biggest restaurant menu I have ever seen. The decor is wild and the food is even better. There is absolutely something for everyone. Half priced margaritas on Monday's and they are HUGE. Best items are the breakfast food that come in crazy portions (the dump breakfast...enough said) and the toasted sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was immediately nervous about dining here when our family was banished to the back room that smelled like stale cigarettes. Whatever, I get people don't want to be near little kids. By I knew we wouldn't get any service as soon as we sat down and I was right. 10 minutes for drinks. Longer for food. The lady who sat us was horribly unpleasant and apparently angry she was working. I used to love coming here, but I think this will be the last time."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. I've had a variety of their breakfast foods including waffles, pancakes, skillets, and sandwiches. The portions are huge and I feel that they try to make up for the mediocre food by giving monstrous portions sizes.   For the price (everything mainly under $10), I kept coming back only to be continually disappointed by the abysmal service. Even in days when there are barely four tables full, servers take 15 minutes just to take drink orders and the food takes ages to come  out. Want a refill on coffee? Be prepared to be ignored by servers standing in a corner, texting on phones."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for salads and wings!  Their food is tasty as long as you don't expect gourmet cooking and they have a VERY LARGE selection to choose from.  The kids menu is just as diverse and the noise level is on the loud side to accommodate the loudness of kids!  Our 2 boys love coming here.  You can't beat the prices for the sheer amount if food you get.  TV's are in the bar area. The decor is awesome!  Kid proof because mist of it is nailed to the walls!  They can host parties in their castle and large groups on their bus.  My kids like the Star Wars X-Wing in front of the building best.  Worth visiting at least once!"}
{"text":"I went up to northern Ohio to visit some friends, and they took us to Mike's Place for lunch. I was so overwhelmed by the menu, and all the cool stuff on the walls. I had a philly sandwich and it was awesome, it also came with some pretty rawkin' french fries.   I knew this was gonna be a cool place when we pulled up and they had an X-Wing. I will be making a return trip."}
{"text":"I have only ordered take out from Mike's Place, I have not yet had a sit-in meal so I cannot tell you much about the restaurant, but I can about the food. Mike's Place is the only restaurant close enough to my house that allows you to order online from Eat24 and I love having that option!   I ordered the House Salad and the Giovanni Sandwich. The salad was fresh and crisp and the Giovanni, WHAT A SANDWICH! What a concept of a sandwich! Whoever thought putting chicken tenders tossed in hot sauce, melted Swiss cheese, salami, lettuce, tomato, onions, and homemade blue cheese on a sandwich, was brilliant. My point is, its a great sandwich and my mouth is watering just writing this review."}
{"text":"Service was OUTSTANDING, the Gouda mac n cheese bites have got to be the best appetizer i've had anywhere. A little bit expensive, at almost $40 before tip for 2 meals, 1 appetizer and 2 drinks. Awesome atmosphere, and one of the coolest restaurants i've been to! The portion sizes are huge, enough for 2 people per meal depending on what you order. Only 4 stars because the burger i got wasn't great. Everything else was awesome there! I will be coming back and recommending this place to other people as well :)"}
{"text":"Typical greasy spoon. Big portions, fun atmosphere but the service is consistently atrocious. Last time, I was seated in the bus and sat there for 25 minutes and no one even came to take a drink order.  Time before that, a big party came in at breakfast time who were apparently friends with the owner because our server kept apologizing after our food was delayed OVER AN HOUR (for eggs, seriously), and the owner kept hanging out next to the big group, chatting them up. I'm done giving this place chances to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Crazy, cramped, unique and one of a kind experience, it's all here.   You know before you even pull into the driveway that something is crazy here. The Stars Wars full size fighter, the castle, the draw bridge.....anything on the outside screams unique.  The inside adds to the oddness.  The lobby is extremely small and crowded. If you are seated to the left, you enter a standard style restaurant. If you are seated to the right, weirdness ensues. You may sit in the front of a fishing boat, a train car or who knows what else. It is pure madness over there.  The menu.......overwhelming just doesn't do it justice. It takes forever just to look it over. I can honestly say I have never seen such an incredible amount of variety and choices in one place before. Good luck making a decision.  Once you decide, get comfy. The service is slow. It is no wonder with the size of the menu! The food is good, different.  If you are looking for a landmark, unique, fully encompassing experience, then this is the place. But, plan on making an extended trip out of it. One simply cannot dine and dash so to speak.   The staff is friendly and welcoming. The sights are unusual but at a cost. All these things make it completely cramped and visually overwhelming. It also makes it difficult to clean as you will see if you look up or around close enough.  Everyone should go at least once for the experience itself!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is AWESOME. There's an X-Wing out front, for sobbing out loud. It's a super unique, kitschy place, but it's definitely overcompensating for their overloaded menu. There are WAY too many options, and the food was rather mediocre.   I have no idea how those poor waitresses memorize this entire thing. It's literally the largest menu I've ever seen. Ever. And that's not a good thing."}
{"text":"Sadly, very disappointing. The venue was interesting and different. The service was quick and efficient but she virtually had no personality. I order the \"famous\" Walleye sandwich and it was absolutely terrible!  It was severely overcooked creating a crust of concrete and rubbery fish on the inside.  The tartar sauce had no flavor and the curly fries lacking seasoning.  And I agree with some other comments in that the place was not very clean."}
{"text":"What an icon .. since 80s and still going strong. Menu is huge and so far .. all we can do is get through the breakfast part of menu. I had broccoli omelet with Swiss cheese and hasbrowns  really good  another guest ordered sausage and gravy and biscuits   can't go wrong with anything on menu"}
{"text":"The stuff outside the restaurant I didn't really look at much. Inside, seems very cramped but definitely not your average restaurant. I had seen the menu online ahead of time so knew what I wanted but the menu is overwhelming. Too many things!  I ordered a very basic (or so I thought) Turkey Club with a salad. The salad was delicious (though I forgot about saying no cheese - I just don't think of cheese on a salad, yet many places do that). The sandwich was huge. A triple decker is usually squished down so you can fit it in your mouth, not this one.  While it is nice they serve healthy portions, I didn't like having to cut my sandwich up and eat it in pieces. It lacked the combination taste you get with a sandwich. Waitress was attentive which was good. I just don't feel I want to go again. The food was below average (mainly because I couldn't eat the sandwich like a sandwich) and the décor while interesting, meant I was sequestered into a nook with two other tables present, couldn't see anyone else."}
{"text":"Such a great place. Staff is always friendly and like to joke with their customers. A lot of clutter everywhere gives this place a warm ''been around forever'' feel. Food is in large portions with small prices. I recommend the Sabrina's Demented Friend burger if you like peanut butter and bacon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and the menu is absolutely enormous. Take some time to read through it--it's funny, too.  But the food. Ugh, the food. You can tell that the quality of the food that they use is very meh. The cheese sauce tastes orange. My gyro tasted like what i'd guess cooking a pair of my really old shoes might taste like.  This is another place that is totally awesome if you're drunk, but sober? RUN."}
{"text":"My new favorite place around the Akron/Kent area. The place looks very old fashioned, like 60's/70's themed. Biggest menu selection I have ever seen- bigger than Cheesecake Factory's, and the diversity is unreal. They have a full breakfast menu with everything you can think of on it, lunch menu, vegetarian menu, kids, a fancier selection, etc. They have a plentiful drink selection as well with specials on drinks every day. The prices are average, but the portion sizes are incredibly big. I went here a couple nights ago, and the staff was so nice and attentive. Our waitress did whatever she could to make us as happy as possible with our experience there. I got the build your own pasta with cheese tortellini and chicken, and it was delicious! This was one of the only times I could not finish a meal because the portion size was so large and filling. Will be coming back here a lot more often to try out new menu items!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is awesome, their lunch and dinner are so-so by comparison.  This place should offer a course over at KSU, because you need one to get through the menu and know what all they have.  Seriously, they have everything under the sun.  Gyros?  got it.  Burgers? got it.  Crab Cakes?  Got it.  Hummus?  I don't know, but I have a feeling they do.  It would probably take a reasonable human being a whole 5 or more years to try everything on the menu.... I kinda want to try, but I am not so strapped with cash that I can afford to do it.  You'll find something you like, if not the first time, then the next time, or the next time, or the next time, or the next time...."}
