{"text":"Had my son's baptism here back in September.  They accommodated 40 of us with no problem (including the kids!). Food was excellent (it was a pre-set 3 course chicken entree) and they even went out of their way to make me a delicious eggplant parmigiana (I was the only vegetarian in the group). Service was outstanding; the waiters worked hard non-stop to service us and even sang and smiled! Would definitely recommend Tosca for your important family functions!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a few weeks ago for dinner as a change, after driving by several times. The service is excellent - there is absolutely nothing to complain about there.   The main courses were also good, but the appetizers really left a lot to be desired. The ingredients used were NOT fresh (bruised basil (almost rotting), and poor quality tomatoes/cheese on the caprese salad; seafood not fresh). This is such a simple thing to get wrong - if they fix it, they would be a pretty good italian restaurant, and would likely see an upturn in their dinner business. Some advice: buy your ingredients fresh every day (and only as much as you need for that day) and dont settle for sub-par ingredients. Buy the best that you can find, as it will make a world of difference in the quality of your end product. I wish them the best of luck, but we wont be going back."}

{"text":"J'ai été super étonnée par ce resto à la façade moche dans un \"centre commercial\" affreux. Je me suis demandée ce qu'on pourrait bien me servir là dedans.  La carte propose des viandes, des pâtes, de ce que je me souviens. Certains plats sont végétariens.  Et bien j'ai choisi une viande, que je pensais retrouver bêtement avec des spaghetti. Mais non ! Des petits légumes cuisinés, savamment disposés. J'ai pris un cheesecake pour le dessert qui était pas mal mais servi avec du chocolat ET du coulis de fraise (chelou, non?).  En bref, pourquoi pas tester si vous faites du shopping dans le coin"}
{"text":"I've been to Tosca a few times for lunch and the overall, the food was generally good. It's a white table cloth-type dining establishment in a strip mall, so for the business lunch crowd, it is a notch above Boston Pizza or Swiss Chalet. Pasta dishes are good as well as the salads.   However, I had the opportunity to visit for a mid-week dinner with clients. We made reservations, but it turns out it wasn't necessary as the restaurant was generally empty. I had the veal parmigiana and by comparison, was on par with any italian restaurant. As we completed our meal, there was a short selection of desserts available - what no tiramisu? I selected the chocolate cheesecake and was disappointed with a very small piece of cake and was not surprised to see that same cake on my next visit to Costco.   Overall, it's not a bad place for lunch in an area with limited options nearby, but if you are expecting freshly made italian dining (if dessert was any indication) I'd take a pass."}
{"text":"I've been forced to go here a few times due to it's close proximity to my workplace. Business lunch with clients arrive and we're off to Tosca. It's one of the oldest sit down restaurants in the north business area of Mississauga. This area (until recently) is a restaurant wasteland.  Tosca tries to be somewhat upscale but the food and lack of service makes it no better than the Boston Pizza or Drake and the Firken that are nearby. I've had the bruschetta a few times. Most of the time, it's the average deal and nothing outstanding. One time was miserable and you can tell they plated the darn thing WAY before lunch service. The bread beneath the tomatos was soggy. It was unedible and went back to the kitchen. Salads are ok. Decent sized but sometimes the proteins seemed to be very skimpy (1 slice of proscuitto for the entire salad??).  Pastas are very boring and uneventful. Sometimes they're a bit underseasoned and too bland. What makes it worse is that they charge you for $17 ++ just for sauce and pasta. No proteins at times. I'm so glad I don't pay for most of these meals. You feel like you're getting ripped off.   The service can be very slow. We went once and we were one of 2 tables. It nearly took 7+ minutes to get our bill and we knew they had at least 3 servers running about during the entire lunch. I wouldn't recommend this place. There are far better options now for business lunches."}
