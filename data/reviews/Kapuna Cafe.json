{"text":"mochi pancakes, ridiculously good, with or without the haupia syrup. eggs were fluffy and done right. absolutely a must try when you're in las vegas. can't wait to try their other food. recommend to all who are in the area to come here to eat."}
{"text":"M O C H I  P A N C A K E S
That's all I really have to say LOL But seriously, the main reason I decided to drag my family here early one Saturday morning was to try their mochi pancakes. I was like \"hey, I love mochi and I love pancakes, what a great combination.\" The pancakes had a nice crisp on the outside and gooeyness on the inside.  I personally like them plain with no syrup but if you're not like me and like syrup, they do serve it was some yummy coconut syrup. The coconut syrup add a nice touch to the pancakes. Trust me, you won't miss the maple syrup.  The two combined was a perfect match. 

I must add though, that we did have a hard time finding the place initially, since the sign wasn't as visible from the parking lot.  It must be how the plaza was set up though since the sign was in the walkway vs the front.  The shop itself is also a bit small but the service we received here was great.  The wait was a bit long, but then again we did order a ton of food (family of 6 here).  The lady in the front also gave us a heads up that the pancakes will take a little bit longer due to the fact that mochi does take a bit longer to cook than regular pancakes, which we appreciated.  

All and all, I would definitely recommend you try their mochi pancakes.  I can't say much about the other dishes they serve since my main focus was pretty much on the pancakes.  But my fams has no complaints on what their food."}
{"text":"Whenever we're up in the north Las Vegas area, we try a new restaurant...this one was a great find via Yelp. The owners are super friendly and the food is onolicious. Since the food made to order, there is a bit of a wait, but well worth it! The mochi pancakes are definitely worth the wait...light and fluffy with a nice medium crust. By far the best pancake I've eaten. The pork adobo omelette was equally delicious!!"}
{"text":"Just found a new Hawaiian spot near my house!! Ono food & great staff, highly recommended!!  I ordered the House saimin and spam musubi. My boyfriend ordered the meat jun and manapua, it was delicious must try! They even have Cocoa Puffs for dessert"}
{"text":"New Mom and pop shop hidden away in a corner plaza. Very friendly and personable server. Ordered the breakfast plate: eggs, fried rice with Portuguese sausage. When you check-in, you get a free Hawaiian sun drink. I also ordered their signature li-Hing moi juice. It was good. The best part about this place is their signature mochi pancakes. Nothing like the islands but it comes close. Be prepared To spend between $20-$40 bucks easily with a family of 2 adults and a kid"}
{"text":"Kapuna Cafe is the newest of the emerging Hawaiian restaurants in Las Vegas, that you have to try.  It's location on Decatur and Cheyenne makes it convenient for those living in the northwest.  Their variety of entrees are very enticing, that you want to order everything-also, homemade bakery items. They cater too!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and found this place on yelp. Ordered my favorite Loco Moco. It took a while but that was because they had to make everything freash. The hamburger itself was definitely made fresh and is of substance compared to a frozen patty you might find elsewhere. However my over easy egg had its yolk completely hard and the rice was just plain white rice didn't have any spam or anything else typical of true Loco Moco.

That being said I may come here again. They give a military discount as well."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out as there are so many different Hawaiian places to eat. Some good others just like to carry the Hawaiian name making it not so good.
I was not disappointed there were 3 of us so we all got different foods we wanted to try. 
I heard of the Mochi Pancakes glad I tried it with or without the Coconut Syrup it was great. 
Pasteles was Ono too. 
Lastly the Portugese Sausage they use for breakfast was just as Ono.
Thank Victoria for your wonderful service as if we were back on the Islands. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lite lunch today. Kind of hard to find but when you find it you will keep coming back. I had the pork guisantes which is tender chunks of pork in sauce of  tomato, peas, yellow and red peppers. I got the mini bowl which comes with a scoop of rice and a pasta and potato salad. The service was wonderful and the whole place is owned and run by a husband and wife along with their kids. All of the food is made by the mom and she has a passion for putting out some delicious food. You can be sure I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband picked a great spot. I'm happy everything was freshly cooked the only thing is a true local moko has Spam in it. You want a Fresh Hamburger. Come here. Other than that so so.

My I say Victoria, the manager is OUTSTANDING!!!"}
{"text":"Do not come here for quick service! Do no come here for the food either!

Waited for 45 minutes for our order (3 meals). There were 2 other groups (maybe 7 meals total) ahead of us. The lady at the register said they were working on a lot of orders which in my opinion isn't a lot. Although she was super nice. We came here because of the good reviews and I was hoping for an L&L style quick service and great food. We didn't get either. The food was bland."}
{"text":"My son had his high school graduation party at Kapuna Cafe last weekend.  I cannot fully express how grateful I am to the staff that made us feel more like ohana.  The food was excellent (kalbi, chicken katsu, kalua pig, pansit, etc.) and so were the desserts!  The accommodations were more than adequate as we were entertained in the patio in front of the restaurant, which was easily accessible by my father who is in a wheelchair. Even the view of the strip was incredible!  In all, we felt like we were back home in Hawaii with the food, ambiance, and helpful staff that made the party an overwhelming success.  Mahalo Kapuna Cafe!"}
{"text":"I saw this place through google search, they have apple turnover, and other sweets, decided to go in.  Had sweets displayed purchased turnover and the cream puffs and long john.  Also noticed Hawaiian food then pancit and pork Guisantes.  So I thought they consider themselves (Hawaiian) Kapuna Cafe is Authentic local food.  I realize they are  pure Filipino owner not Hawaiian but that's ok (maybe prefer to be Hawaiian).  The place was very nice and small it's in a good crossing roads a little old area, parking lot was practically empty.  I tasted everything I purchased it is sad to say, all the sweets I purchased tasted like it was bought and re-sold to customers.  Why I say this comments, I have my own Bakery for 20 years in San Diego and I know when I taste one.  The long John you can just taste it is not baked fresh, I bet this is bought as well??? The custard has a bitter taste after bite.  I didn't taste the hawaiian fusion food because I want an authentic Hawaiian food real local food.   I wish KC the best to identify their fusion food."}
{"text":"Thank you so much to the Rivera family for catering to us while we ate at the restaurant. We had the Kalbi lunch plate, enjoyed every bite. Until next time we are in LV."}

{"text":"Husband, baby and I just heard about this place last night and decided to try it out today for lunch. Food is broke da mouth!! Waitress (Sorry I didn't grab your name) was super friendly which is such a nice change of pace. Try their chili! It'll make you say, \"Zippy's who?\" It's that ono. Also, if you can get it, mochi brownie is the best. Wash it all down with the house li hing drink and you won't need anything else! Mahalo you guys for everything and for letting our baby make some noise. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was an okay experience. Customer service was great but the wait time after I've ordered was long. We paid at 1201 and never get our food after 30 minutes. That's when we got my manapua and three pork hash. Then our meat jun plate came five minutes after and another five for my chow fun. 

The chow fun was warm and not hot. Like the cook was afraid to cook the noodles and the amount of spam was a small amount for the large size. It's like two regular spam size cut into 8 pieces each. 

Flavor of the chow fun was bland, could use more soy sauce, sesame oil or something for more flavor. The manapua was ehh, you can taste that it was frozen before steamed and the pork hash was alright. 

I gave Kapuna Cafe only three stars because of the wait time from when you've ordered, not that big of a dining in area, there is no fountain drinks and the drinks that's in the fridge cooler not that cold."}
{"text":"So excited to finally try their food!!! Such a welcoming vibe that just says \"aloha\". Very friendly customer service and overall, just a great place to get some really tasty local favorites and more!"}
{"text":"Maaaan... don't do it unless you wanna wait a whole hour. Like legit an hour. Staff apologized for the long wait but gosh it's pretty upsetting. If only we would have been warned about the wait up front, I would have thought differently. It was obvious that other people before us had been waiting as well. Therefore, I don't see why we couldn't be warned. On to the food... guava turnover was good. I think it was more artificially flavored guava. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I got the kalbi lunch plate which included 3 strips of kalbi, 2 scoops of white rice and a side of Mac salad. Hubby got the mixed plate (Teri chicken, kalbi, and Teri beef). I wanted to add a pancake order after placing the other items and paying by card but front staff said $10 minimum. I wish she could have allowed a \"return\" and repurchase. After all, we literally just paid $30 sumtin (add the Hawaiian Sun drink). But nope, sadly. It's cool, my error though. I came back with cash from the car about 35 mins later and waited in a line of 3 people ahead of me to order a Li Hing drink only to be told they were sold out. It was between 1040am-1210pm that we were there. I'm really curious about the mochi pancakes still and will most likely come back sometime for them. Other than that, our plates were ok. That wait was just absolutely horrendous. Maybe it was just our luck of the draw that day. I sure hope so!"}
{"text":"This place was just hands down amazing. Really excellent service and the taste the food has will definitely have me coming back! The vibe in this establishment was very welcoming I felt right at home, I even got too enjoy FREE Hawaiian coffee while I waited in line. For as much as we enjoyed our meals my wife and I thought that we got above and beyond our monies worth. The menu was great, they really have something for everyone from BBQ chicken to pork specials, Burger, Hawaiian burgers and the FRENCH FRIES ARE A MUST HAVE!! What topped everything off is the desserts. The house specials are awesome and I can't wait to come to this place again. 5 stars, this place is a gem. MAHALO!!!"}
{"text":"Mochi pancakes are awesome. Plate lunches are like Hawaii......
Good family  style atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here to try put there breakfast and let me tell you its good. The service is great so much aloha when you walk thru the door. Willing to come back to taste other food there keep up the good work see you guys next time."}
{"text":"Food is ono and the staff is very friendly.  They really make you feel like you back at home."}
{"text":"Family friendly & great food! First Time here and I'm glad I found my new fave meat jun and Mochi pancakes are off the chain! Thank you Marcy & Family for making my first Time an awesome one! I'll be back for sure to try everything! Lol"}
{"text":"I had the most enjoyable breakfast this morning at Kapuna Cafe thanks to Victoria, her mom, and nephew!! My husband works in the same area and he insisted we support the local community! 

Pro Tip: There is complimentary coffee for guests and it's delicious! Pairs perfectly with their fresh pastries baked in house daily! 

Kapuna is 100% family operated and the menu showcases authentic Hawian meals cooked by Victoria's mother. Today I ordered the 2 eggs and pancakes plate which also included a choice of sausage, harm, or bacon. My husband ordered the 2 eggs and meat plate. We both chose sausage which I hands down recommend!! It's some of the best breakfast sausage I've had in a very long time. 

Pro Tip: The pancakes are actually Mochi pancakes. If at first you aren't sure, just try them!! I promise you will not be disappointed. The flavor is slightly less sweet than a typical wheat flower pancake and the texture is slightly moister than a dry feeling pancake. I wouldn't even say they were chewier than normal like I was expecting. They were perfect!

The pancake matched with the sausage was exactly what I was looking for. I chose the coconut syrup and it was to die for. 100% a must-try.  Victoria also graciously offered us a complimentary pastry ( I'm telling you the customer service  is on point) and let me tell you it was heavenly. The outside was flaky and the inside was moist and filled with cream!  They are definitely worth spending  $2 to try!! I can't wait to make this a regular lunch spot !!"}
{"text":"It's always nice to walk in to a friendly face. Seems to be the closest Hawaiian style food place around my area so i can't wait to try the food. I'm pretty sure i won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Food was very ONO! Everything we tried was really good! 

We started with their Mochi pancakes with coconut sauce, a side of Portuguese sausage and one of the best coffee I've had in a while. We also got their loco moco, chicken katsu, lumpia, and zucchini sticks. Every single item was made fresh and very flavorful. The Mac salad here is yummy as well."}
{"text":"Great food great people, highly recommended for those looking to have The Hawaiian islands comfort food."}
{"text":"Very Hawaiian felt like I went to Hawaii. Clean dining room and a friendly smile with the aloha. Loco Moco me all over again."}
{"text":"Great Island food and the Service is friendly and the fantastic.  We ordered the Kalbi Plates and Spam Musubi. The Kalbi really hit the spot, very savory and tasty.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Loved  the Pastele, pork hash, shaka long john pastry. The young girl who took our order was so cute and friendly. I wanted the manapua but they never had so i got an extra pastele."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Great customer service, the pancakes are a must have item weather it's early or late. Very reasonable pricing on their entire menu. True gem, I will recommend to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Great mochi pancakes. Friendly service. Great service. Aloha! We were visiting in the area and checked Yelp....all great reviews were accurate"}
{"text":"as others have tried and mentioned, the mochi pancakes are worth every bit of the wait.  delicious all the way through.  eggs were done perfect - fluffy and cooked properly, and the portuguese sausages is always a local fan favorite.  drove almost 40 minutes to get there and will do it again."}
{"text":"Great place reminds me of my grandmas cooking back home great customer service.  Little slice of home in the middle of the mainland"}
{"text":"My first time at this fine establishment -- food is very good , especially the mochi pancake -- yummy! Restaurant is so clean, and the staff is super friendly -- they go out of their way to make you feel special. 

Congratulations Marcy and Victoria, and the rest of the  Rivera clan!"}
{"text":"Ordered a loco moco. Frozen patty, runny gravy, and microwaved eggs. Maybe an off day but definitely wouldn't recommend this dish. Mac salad on the other hand was on point."}
{"text":"The Mochi pancakes were DELICIOUS. Real Hawaiian kine hospitality. Clean, comfortable, cute indoor atmosphere. I ordered the mochi pancakes & portugese sausage plate & there were no leftovers...  yum! If you check in they give you a free musubi! Gotta come back & try the li hing mui lemonade"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our loco moco today the owners are such nice people I highly recommend this place.  I was born in Hawaii and feel that I know unique authentic food. We drove 15 miles to eat here and it was worth the drive. We will always come here in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING . The
Hawaiian Burger was so juicy and the addition of caramelized onions and grilled pineapple gave so much flavor to this HUGE 10oz Angus burger. The seasoned fries were a great accompaniment. This is a family establishment and they treat you like family.l"}
{"text":"For me it was a solid 5 stars. I went in for lunch but also had to try the Mochi pancakes after reading reviews. 

First impressions:

Clean and cute store front. The service was excellent and the food was great! I'll definitely be back. **note this is not a fast food joint everything is fresh and made to order don't except food to be cooked in 5 min! If you're in a hurry call ahead**

Food review:

Portion to quality and value is on point!
To me this is not the \"traditional hawaiian\" food joints we see in the states this place is more than that. It's definitely Asian fusion and I would categorize it as Filipino Hawaiian food and Bakery. Being half Haole and half Pinyo from Hawaii it's like eating at home. The mochi pancake reminded me of a steam cake my mom made when we were kids...delicious! The bbq chicken had the Hawaiian taste but with a little Filipino flare...also delicious! 
But don't take my word for it go try it. 
I'll be back with my family."}
{"text":"My husband hasn't been home in 5 years and theres a severe lack of good authentic Hawaiian food in California. We stopped by here while we were in town visiting family. We got the pastele plate, pork hash, and manapua. My husband was absolutely happy and all the food was exactly like back home. It was so good we ordered a kalua pork plate to go but it didnt get far coz he ate it in the car. Cant wait to come back again."}
{"text":"First visit and very happy and satisfied ! Boni and Victoria made the food taste even better with their  personable and caring manner. Had the Teri Beef. Wife had them delicious mochi pancakes with eggs and Portuguese sausage. No need to go anywhere else. This is the place for us. Great variety, great food and Great family owned Restaurant.. Desserts are also Excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The service and attentiveness of the staff was amazing 5stars.  Unfortunately the food was 3stars missing flavor and nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"First time at this new Hawaiian dining establishment and the food is sooo delicious and the service is outstanding and full of warm aloha!  We were greeted with smiles and treated like a part of their family!  Victoria, the General Manager, is such a gracious host and her mother (also Owner) Marcy, is such a great cook!  We had their signature Mochi pancakes which my 4 yr old nephew loved.  Also had their BBQ mixed plate, House Saimin, Pasteles, and pork hash...everything was so ono (delicious)!  Will definitely be back and will certainly spread the word about this place."}
{"text":"Another visit to this cafe where it delivers consistency and unique tastes. 
The mochi pancakes and the Chicken pancit were both delicious again because the taste is so unique. Another must have is the Steamed pork hash.
Meat Jun and sauce were unique in taste.
The saimin was delicious.  
The chicken katsu was a lot for a mini order.
I ordered eggs and it tasted like it was microwaved, fyi.
I would recommend that you call in your order if you are in a rush or come when you have time to talk story and wait for your food.
Lots of Aloha here, come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and it was so delicious! The food was very authentic and the entire restaurant was very family oriented. The Mochi pancakes are TO DIE FOR!!! Must get if you have never tried before because it is the only place in Vegas that has it! Definitely worth the trip going off the strip for some great Hawaiian food!!!"}
{"text":"The mochi pancake was very delicious it was pretty busy when i got there but trust me after i tasted the food my wait was very worth it!!"}
{"text":"Good food's and excellent customer service. I enjoyed my mochi pancake and pork hash,definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great hawaiian food excellent customer service  full of aloha loved the aloha  breakfast  and Apple turnover and lumpias were my favorite.  Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"The cashier was friendly & the chef was too! I think they might of been mother & daughter. 
The deserts was good. Food was good. Their specialty drink was good. The only thing that bothered me was that my daughter didn't get her food till after we finished our burgers. Then she waited another 10 more minutes. She said they had to cook more rice but the other two people who came their after us got their 2 plates before my daughter."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, being from Red Rock area this is a little out of the way for us, this place is actually really good.
You can tell there is heart and pride in making the dishes. Wait time was average for a made to order restaurant.
Ordered the mixed plate as they had a special Buy 1 get 1/2 off another today.
First was told they were out of Kalbi, but when we got our plates there was Kalbi in it, that's awesome to see the extra effort in prepping the plates to match the menu and thanks!
Also had the Meat Jun and Saimin and both were as good if not better than places back home in Hawaii.
The Coco Puffs were on the smaller side, but that Shaka Long John was too cool to pass up!
The Mochi and Taro ball pastries was also very tasty!
Sistah waiting on us was courteous and even checked on us a few times while we ate there, thanks Sistah, simple gestures like that always welcomes anyone who visits here!
We'll definitely be back here to get some Pork Hash and Chantilly cake and try some of the other dishes that were already sold out when we got here."}
{"text":"Ordered Meat Jun, Pastele, Mochi Brownie, Taro Mochi Balls, and Strawberry Lemonade with Li Hing Mui. Everything was yummy!!!! Definitely will be back again on the weekend, when I have more time. One hour lunch break was not enough time for all that food! Lol."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a friend so I was excited to see they were open on a Sunday. Tried their amazing signature Li Hing Mui drink and was not disappointed, such a huge drink too, big enough to share. I recommend getting there a little early, we showed up a little after 4 and all their popular stuff were sold out but I was more than happy with the BBQ mix plate and Meat Jun. The owner came out to ask us how everything was, and it was nice to see a locally owned family business with such amazing authentic Hawaiian flavor. Will DEFINITELY be back, this is my new favorite Hawaiian spot. Our server was also the sweetest, she let us try their house made ube mochi, which I will be back for btw. Thank you so much. I recommend to everyone. I'm so happy."}
{"text":"The chicken Katsu was very tender and juicy.  The people were very pleasant and welcoming.  Definitely a treat."}
{"text":"Being an east coast native and permanent resident, my palet for pacific island dishes hasn't been fully exposed and developed.  Where I'm from, teriyaki sauce and pineapples are the essence of Hawaiian dishes. 

Kapuna has went above and beyond to capture the true paradise flavor that I've been missing with their hearty plates, seasoned noodles, and awesome desserts!! If you're ever in Las Vegas and looking to break away and grab some good Hawaiian food to remind you of back home or show you what you've been missing, try this place out !!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in feeling more than welcomed, family owned restaurant with a extremely friendly positive bunch of good people. I was already thinking about how soon I could make it  back within the first ten minutes or so of my first visit here haha. Food freshly cooked upon ordering and it's tastes absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Try their MOCHI pancakes sooo delicious!!!! Great customer service will definitely come back again:-))"}
{"text":"It was my first time here this morning with my fambam from San Diego and we were super happy to find that if you check in, you could get a FREE Musubi which is the only thing my big son wanted anyway. 
I ordered a bowl of saimin and my itty bitty son got the mochi pancake short stack. It was a weekday when we went in and so they weren't selling some of the specials that they're known for like the pastele, chantilly puffs and long John's. They were also out of their signature drink. 
They open at 9am, we got there a little after 10am and the complimentary coffee wasn't brewed yet so we had to wait around for that a bit. However, I appreciated that it was comp! 
The dining area is small but overall clean. There's no trash bin which I thought was kind of odd, so our server/counter person just told us to leave our trash on the table. She was very friendly.
This morning there was only one counter person/server and she got busy real quick with no one to take over orders and accept their delivery of products which happened to be at the same time we were ready to order. It seemed like there was only one other person in the back manning the kitchen as well. The wait for our food was a bit longer than I'd like but the pancake was very unique - if you're Filipino, you'd compare it to bibingka. My saimin was good but the dashi was a little too salty for me. 
I don't think I'd order the saimin and pancakes again but I'd definitely be back to try the weekend specialty items and the desserts. Oh and the coffee! I definitely want to try their specialty drink with li hing mui too!"}
{"text":"The meat Jun Plate was good, nothing compared to Young's Korean bbq in Aiea.  Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins for your food."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I got the aloha breakfast w/ fried rice it's so amazing I'm in awe. It took a little long but was so worth it because it's fresh. The eggs are insane I've never had an egg that actually tastes good. I'm so please with the food and service. New go to breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Our last full day in Vegas and of course, we wanted to satisfy our Hawaiian Kine cravings.
Their mochi pancakes are AMAZING!! My family and I loved it! It was so hard to decide what we wanted even though the menu was minimal. The portions were generous so you'll never leave hungry. Everything tasted so ono!! We'll definitely be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"A taste of Hawaii on the main Island is what Kapuna Cafe will give you.  A family owned and operated joint that has been opened now for about 2 months, it's one of the closest comfort Hawaiian food we've discovered in LV... probably because most of their ingredients are brought in from Hawaii.  The wife and daughter aren't big fans of Hawaiin food due to high carbs, but they both enjoyed their lunches yesterday and will be back.  The mochi pancakes are a must!  Now I have two local joints when I'm feeling the carve for proteins and carbs.   

Tip:   If you want to have their tasty pastries and desserts, you'll need to either get there on Fri and Sat before they're all sold out.  OR pre-order then ahead of time."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good I can't even describe how good there food is. It's highly recommended. If you had Hawaiian food before this is the place to dine in or take out. North LV is stepping up there food game."}
{"text":"The Mochi Pancakes is to die for...OMG!  The pancakes comes with a coconut syrup... Your tastebuds will thank you! 

My son ordered the Kal Bi (Korean style short ribs) it was full of flavor, it wasn't overcooked or undercooked, it was great!

I had the loco moco without the egg.  The hamburger patty was thick and cooked all the way through, just the way I like my hamburger pattys.  The gravy over the rice and patty was delicious!

This restaurant was clean, it's a family owned businesses... The customer service was great, they are very welcoming.

This restaurant is located across the North Las Vegas Airport, which I think is a great location.  Its not hard to find, it's in a strip mall near the escalators.  

But of course, don't just believe me... Try Kapuna Cafe for yourself!"}
{"text":"Went here for a grad party last night.  They have about 4 tables in the covered patio in front of the restaurant (near parking lot).   The owners are nice people.    They had prepared and kept on warm burners: Kalua pork, kalbi, chicken katsu, pancit and rice.  The food is just like being in Hawaii at an awesome pot luck.  The cakes are beautiful and yummy too.  Wanted to go back today for breakfast but they are closed.  Looking forward to trying their pasteles and mochi pancakes.

Update!  We went back three days later and had breakfast.  Mochi pancakes are so ono!  I had a short stack. They went down fast.  Also ate a manapua (pork) and a patele (pastele).  The patele is one of the best I've every had because it had a bit of heat, not a lot but enough that it stands out when compared to other pateles I've had.  

The service was friendly and helpful.  I will be going back...for desserts and pancake.

They are new in that space and I'm hoping that they'll put some decorations or some kind of color on the walls and maybe some plants in and outside.  They are in the middle of the strip mall.  Look for them behind the tables and chairs near the parking lot."}
{"text":"this place is amazing ! I work at the vape shop two doors down from them and we get food from them a lot. it's soooooooo good! pork hash, adbo omelette!  mmmmmm and the staff is amazing. keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The service too slow. The food is alright nothing over the top. My macaroni salad is spoiled. The only good think is the pancake is good. The rest just ok"}
{"text":"I love their sweets  Such a loving environment, everyone there treats you like home. Very warm and friendly  food is awesome  They are doing so great, happy for their new business start up and so glad it's so close to my area of town. Definitely will be the go to when there's no food at home"}
{"text":"Awesome service !! Awesome food ! Having the Kalbi today ! Favorite! Atmosphere feels like you're at home Hawaii Nei thank you Marcy & ohana for the best Hawaiian food and aloha spirit !"}
