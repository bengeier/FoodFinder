{"text":"Wow awesome bbq!!! Found by accident getting gas off of 85.  The smell of the place which is over powering pulled us in.  I cannot emphasize it enough  the smell is overpowering.   It is a smokey slightly sticky place, but hey that's how I like a good bbq joint!  The bbq was intensely smokey and flavorful.  My issue with \"most\" NC bbq is that it tends to be bland.   Not here tho very smoky and intense flavors.    And a plus Quite a decent value for your money"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, reasonable prices and friendly staff. My husband and I have been here twice for lunch now, and are definitely fans. I've tried the barbequed ribs, beef, pork and chicken- and all were great. Plus their house sauce is excellent- not too sweet or tomatoey, not too sour- just how I like it.  They have daily specials on a marker board up front, and cheap lunch specials on a sheet in the menu. Even the soups are decent. Service is quick, though I've noticed they do cut some corners during lunch while they're busy- like bringing you a second drink ahead of time.  In all I'm pretty happy with this place, and it's the best cheap barbeque I've found so far in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The BBQ was dry and the huss puppies not done all the way and the chicken was also dry. Overall  disappointed and the the price I paid not worth it."}
{"text":"Great stop on our way to Vintage. Go for the pulled pork instead of the pork ribs, ribs were a little dry. But overall very satisfying for BBQ urge."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Hush puppies were overcooked and at room temp. Chopped bbq had bone chips. Ribs were tough. Steak was undercooked. Slaw was bland. Chili and sweet tea were only positives of meals (tried place twice).  Service was good."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Had a great waitress. Would go back anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been going to Hillbilly's for a few years now and the food is consistently good. Never had a bad experience like everyone else is reporting.The pulled pork is always flavorful and moist and their BBQ Beans are the best in town!"}
{"text":"It's sad that you have to give some places a whole star.Went to Hillbillies and had a really bad dinner, the only thing worse than the the food was the serves."}
{"text":"I had the small BBQ plate for lunch with fried okra and mac-n-cheese. Everything was delicious! This was a perfect lunch-sized portion."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday and there were only a few tables full. Obviously, this resulted in fast service. The wait staff were very nice and interacted with our son, who was being a little difficult.   The BBQ pit is situated in the middle of the restaurant as you come in. It's nice to have it there for everyone to see, but it does result in a lot of smoke seeping into the restaurant.   The food was good, typical barbecue. I had a sweet potato and fried okra with pork BBQ. The BBQ and sweet potato were good. The okra was alright, but it didn't taste fresh (I assume it was frozen).   My wife felt her BBQ sandwich was kindof small. I thought my \"small BBQ plate\" serving was alright. Overall, we felt like it was an average BBQ place. Nothing was bad, but nothing was really that spectacular either."}
{"text":"Not up to par, took a family of 10 or so waitresses was new, food was less than good. Save your money"}
{"text":"The food is ok, as to be expected. Nothing to write home about. The BBQ sauce and the potato salad is really, really good. That said, they are in need of a renovation something fierce. I'm sure their business would double if they would do something with the tackiness, show some pride in your establishment. It's 2017 and the interior looks like 1965. Atmosphere is part of the dining experience too."}
{"text":"No standout items but the service was exceptional. Overall this place isn't worth driving out of the way for but if you're in the area and desperate for BBQ as was the case for my friend and I then it will do the trick."}
{"text":"In a word... disappointed.  I was craving bbq and in the vacinity so I took the family and a friend to Hillbilly's BBQ. My first impression was good. The smell of smoked bbq really had me anticipating some great food...  Unfortunately, what I got was just \"ok\" food. In fact, the beef bbq was cold, the pork bbq was semi-warm and the ribs were dried out.  Hardly the great dinner I was looking for. And not light on the wallet to boot. Not the worst I've ever had. But FAR from the best.  Try it for yourself... perhaps I visited on an off night."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have gotten burger and fries. Today I asked for a grilled chicken sandwhich with baked potato and baked beans. Paid close to $12 for it. When I looked in the menu while I was waiting, I noticed they have a combo plate with your choice of potato and hush puppies for 6.99. Wish I was told there is an option to order a combo rather than being charged for each item seperately. Received my order, when I got to my desk at work I noticed after a few bites it was quite chewy. The chicken was very undercooked. I called in for a replacement. They were nice over the phone and said it would be 10 minutes. Quite dissapointing! I know they are capable of doing better. It sucks having to make 2 trips and the rest of my food had to sit and get cold on my desk. They could have stepped up and said have a courtesy coupon or free soda or anything."}
{"text":"Don't let the sappy sign fool you - this is a good BBQ joint.  The hush puppies they lay on you like table bread are fantastic.  Watch out, 'cause they'll bring more and you can get full before your meal arrives.  The pulled pork was pretty darn good, but one time it was better than the other (a bit dry once, but not bad, just less moist).  Sides are standard stuff, not special.  Fries might be frozen fries.  Not bad, but not special...  The service is spotty.  It's staffed by young ladies, like high-school aged.  Some are nice and well intentioned.  Others appear bored, like they can't wait to leave.  So overall, service is a let down, and costs them a star in my book.  But, again, the food is good."}
{"text":"Thus far: Lunch once and takeout once...  Buddy of mine at work suggested we go here for lunch, so we agreed.  Good wood smell inside hints at BBQ done right.  We got seated quickly and our server brought out (free!) some hushpuppies with some sauce.  I like bread and I like having it brought out without asking.    The lunch portions were good and with the specials the value was very much there.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The takeout was similar, and because I have 4 kids, I had to order a lot of food, and the cashier was very helpful in helping me pick a takeout option that got me what I needed for a good price.  Part of that special included a gallon of sweet tea, that I watched her fill up from the stuff that was fresh brewed."}
{"text":"Do not bother going here.  I travel all of NC and have tried BBQ in 100 NC counties so I know good from bad.  This place smells good at the door but the Q is dry, no flavor, bland,  need I say more.  I actually started a yelp account just to warn others."}
{"text":"My father in law loves this place...hence, the 2 stars.  Why he loves it...I am not sure other than perhaps he is not familiar with good BBQ.  When we went, it was early, but the parking lot was packed, so I figured it had to be all that and then some. We finally had a spot open up and after I got us parked...parking lot is average, but they had smokers and used cars for sale taking up many spaces... Yes...used cars..   Once we made our way in, we were greeted..rather, ignored by a younger lady who wanted to be anywhere but there, who never asked how many, or actually spoke a word. She gathered up three menus, and walked to a table, dropped the menus, and walked off. When our server arrived, she was nice enough and educated about the menu items, as I had never been before.  As I am from the BBQ capital of NC, I wasnt sure I was going to order their que, and I didnt after seeing a plate go by...but my father in law did, and the wife and I ordered their 2 half chicken plates. When it finally arrived, I did try a bit of their BBQ at the request of dad... It sufficed, but by far not fantastic. I took one bite of my chicken, and stopped.  The Sahara might not be as dry as this was. When the wife tried hers, it was the same. I never saw our server again, but when we got up to leave, another girl came over and offered to go boxes. I figured since I was going to end up paying for it anyway, perhaps my brothers cat might tolerate it. For $50, I can do better....much better. Its honestly not worth stopping for with other places with a better track record, and much better ambiance, along with friendly staff close by.  Pass, unless you simply must..dont let the full parking lot fool you either. From what we could tell, being as there were not many others there, the employees must park out front to make it look busier than it is. Thankfully, they keep half way decent hushpuppies rolling out as you wait..."}
{"text":"Gerald is a very passionate owner. They serve awesome BBQ. I highly recommend there food."}
{"text":"I've had ribs at many places across the US and I have to say that Hillbilly's has some of the tastiest, smokiest, meatiest ribs I'd ever have. They're fantastic. I actually did the all you can eat ribs and felt I got my money's worth. Not somewhere I eat often, but definitely a fun place to go and splurge.  I'd like to try a steak here, but gosh darn it when there are fresh ribs nearby it's hard to pass them up!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite hometown spots. We always make a point to stop in for lunch when we are visiting!"}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ, wonderful \"sides\" and the staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Hillbillies BBQ  is a good and convenience place right off of 85 highway, specially if you are not in the mood for regular fast food (Mc Donald's, BK, Subway, etc.)   It was an average bbq, I have had better. Since it was my boyfriend, my dog and I, we decided to take it to go. There's no outside seating. They didn't have any forks and told us to go to the gas station and that we can get some utensils from there, in addition they didn't provide napkins either.   The pulled pork was good, I personally like the pork more seasoned, the Hillbillie's fries tasted like steak fries, BBQ cole slaw was good too, but my favorite were the hushpuppies, those were really good. Overall a good place, not my favorite BBQ place."}
{"text":"YUMMMYYYY this is the best ribs and hush puppys ever!!!! It has gotten a lot slower in people coming in but it is the best bbq place ever"}
{"text":"There is something to be said about a bbq place where you can see the smoke from the smoker a block away!  I was here this past Saturday and my boyfriend and I got the same thing - bbq platter which comes with the house sauce and a side.  He got the baked potato and I got the sweet potato fries.  First I have to say the bbq is smokey and delicious and exactly what you would want in southern bbq.  My sweet potato fries were thicker and lightly salted and soooo good.  The coleslaw here is mayo based and just perfect.  I also got a side of deep-fried okra which was 'fresh' out of the fryer....On previous occasions I have ordered the ribs which I love here....My boyfriend is actually from the South and he said 'these are good' - which from him is a high compliment.  I can't say enough about the food at this place and we were out of there for around 20 bucks!    The ambiance is 'eh'.  But it is the perfect spot for Saturday lunch (especially after a long exhausting hike at Crowders!!)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good BBQ, this place is okay. Service was great - definitely very friendly. I was looking for some authentic NC BBQ and this place was recommended. Not exactly disappointed but nothing to write home about as well.  Smells great as you approach."}
{"text":"Wow; I actually said it out loud after my first bite of rib; food was outstanding - 5 stars plus; could have reduced score due to service and overall appearance; not terrible but food was too good! Clean but somewhat dated and old; server was friendly and very nice. Ribs were probably the best ever! BBQ and other items were also great; BBQ sauce was definitely tasty and unique. No alcohol is available"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Above average smoky barbecue. Wonderful sauce. Steak fries."}
{"text":"Pulled pork with BBQslaw. Can't beat it. Everything is cooked over a fire and served with BBQ sauces. It isn't NC style, but still very good. If you're lucky, you'll smell it from the highway."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time. A Friday night at 630, my son ordered a BLT and Chili and they were out of both.  How can you be out of simple ingredients on a Friday night?  A BBQ place with no bacon???  Everyone go their food in a timely manner. The food was \"ok\".    However, towards the end of a meal a huge COCK ROACH was crawling around our table.  The waitress saw it and did and said nothing.  I got up and killed it.  My wife was so grossed out she could not finish her meal.  We got our check and left right after.  On the way out no staff said anything about the COCKROACH.  I said to the waitress did you let someone know and she said yes.  I feel like a manager or someone that was standing close by and heard me ask should have said something to me about this.  We won't be going back ever.  If there is one COCKROACH there are more."}
{"text":"Yumm-y! Good barbecue joint, old home style place with a good ol' boy vibe and decor.  Nothing fancy here but you don't come to a place like this for fancy or if you do, you obviously don't belong.    Love the hush puppies (a true southern staple) and the pulled pork and pulled beef were great.  The only thing I didn't really like was the supposed potato salad.  It was like minced potatoes or something.  I like my potato salad to have slices or cubes of potatoes but this was more like potato 'bits'.  Weird, tasty, but weird.  Service was great and everyone greeted us with the southern hospitality the South is known for.    The barbecue was so good it's got me wondering how good the steaks are considering it's in the name of the restaurant.  Next time, I'm wearing my overalls! :)"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ that we have tasted. Some of the other comments, are inaccurate.  This one is not off I85, and parking lot is clean.  I don't know about the other Hillbilly that is located off of I85,  if they are owned by the same owner. LOVE the hush puppies.  BBQ sauce is awesome. Monster burger is a favorite with the husband. The restaurant itself is very old, and really needs to be updated. We usually get take out. Sweet tea is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I had the 3 meat combo with ribs, chopped pork and chopped beef.  All were very good.  Ribs were very meaty.  No fat in the chopped meats.  Sweet thick BBQ sauce.  I loved the BBQ slaw.  Excellent pinto beans.  Wonderful hushpuppies served when you are seated.    My wife and daughter had the salad bar and had no complaints.  The person doing the hiring must be a guy, because the staff is young, female and...impressive! Either that or they have a very attractive family and they all work at there LOL!"}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of place we like to find when traveling - true local flavor. Very enjoyable dinner, great service and down home BBQ."}
{"text":"Eh. This place is the epitome of mediocre. The interior is drab and kind of depressing, and the food is kind of drab and depressing as well. Let me say though, I am a vegetarian and this is a BBQ place, but I feel like the sides say a lot about the food in general. I got Mac n cheese(3/10), hush puppies(9/10), fried okra(7/10), mashed potatoes(7.5/10) and corn on the cob (0/10). The mac was severely disappointing and I could hardly eat it. Also, I don't know how simple corn on the cob could be rendered completely inedible, but that's what happened here and I don't even have high standards for food. Service was mediocre as well, waitress was nice but didn't check back after the food was dropped off. I would return only if desperate."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food!!!! The hush puppies are out of this world. The restaurant itself is really cool looking. I must say we have been here a lot and the last 2 times seems like the waitresses have changed and not for the better."}
{"text":"Always been a favorite of my moms! They have great food and great service!! We did my cousins baby shower there and they were so accommodating home town people and hometown food!!"}
{"text":"just straight up good smoked BBQ, I love all their pork items, I ordered turkey one time and was disappointed with the portion of it for the price but that was the only time I've ever had a problem at the place,"}
{"text":"Regular here, great cue and ribs. Like the ginger chicken as well."}
{"text":"I liked the service here. The waiter was super friendly, kept refilling my sweet tea and asked how I was doing.  The food was ok, the pork ribs were just moist enough to be satisfying.  Loved the sweet potatoes! with butter and sugar.  The slaw was above average and for $10 I'd come back :)"}
{"text":"Been a long time customer. This place is legit. Not only is the food amazing, the people are great as well. I'm a Pork Sandwich with Hushpuppies kinda guy. And oh the ribs. You know good barbecue by one telling factor, if it doesn't need sauce to taste good. Well that's Hillbilly's."}
{"text":"Eat in or take out, can't go wrong. Ribs vs. Q is an epic gastronomic battle for the ages. Be Switzerland and get both. Great hush puppies, green beans and potato salad."}
{"text":"Looking for some good old fashion BBQ. This is the place, the Brisket outstanding , pulled pork seasoned to perfection, ribs fall off the bone with that smoke flavor , don't forget the hush puppies and collard greens. A must Stop for Good Old Fashion Smoked BBQ."}
{"text":"I had the 1/2 plate chicken (leg and thigh). The chicken was flavorful and if you like vinegar base bbq sauce then this place is for you. Unlimited hush puppies! Major plus :-)"}
{"text":"After the smoke dissipates and that amazingly drool inducing smell is gone, all that's left over is semi moist, somewhat bland, smokeless pork.   What happened to that wonderful smokey aroma upon entering the building? That same smokey smell that I was afraid to have linger on me and have hungry women chasing me up and down the office halls begging for a bite of my Q? Is my deodorant working that well? Is this the same Hillbillys I remembered?   I think Dave was right. It really does smell smokier than it tastes. Mac and cheese isn't worth mentioning, so I dunno why I'm even mentioning it. Ribs are still good though and while the pork was a disappointment, the $3.39 price tag for a small sandwich sure as hell wasn't! A lil' sauce makes everything better. I still like you my Hillbilly friend."}
{"text":"I have a case of the Mondays today and I needed a boost mentally and physically to make me feel better. Coffee wasn't doing the trick, and the only thing that was going to work is good food. Once a co worker whispered the word sauce, a smile crept up on my face and my urge for BBQ had to be met.   Instead of visiting the always consistent, highly praised Macs, I decided to check out the newly opened Hillbilly's BBQ on Tyvola. This is the former location of Carolina Country BBQ. I had eaten at Hilbilly's before in Lowell, but never returned due to a bad experience with some of the patrons there. I guess you can say they weren't too keen on me being in that restaurant. When this new location opened, I was very excited to eat here again.   Unlike traditional Carolina BBQ, Hilbillys, uses a thick tomato based sauce. Even on the pulled pork, its the tomato based sauce. That is my preference with me being a west coaster. The watery vinegar based sauce is something new for me and something I haven't yet acquired a taste for. I'll keep trying though!   Today I opted for the large pork sandwich. With fries, it only cost $4.99. I chose not to have fries ($4.29), so ordered onion rings (2.49) and mac & cheese instead (I have a weakness for mac $1.49). On the sandwich is a coleslaw, which is a red color. It has some spice, looks vinegar based and is quite tasty.   The two restaurants are about equal in price and offer many of the same dishes. I do have to say that Mac's wins for sides. They have a better, and tastier selection. Esp their Mac and Cheese. Hillbilly's uses a very wet cheese sauce, similar to the stuff you find at KFC. I prefer Mac's mac. I also have to give Mac's an edge on their sauce. While Hillbilly's isn't bad, Mac's is just a tad better.   As much as I love Macs, I think Hillbillys has better ribs and pork. Ribs are flavorful, smoky without sauce and their pork is much more juicer. I've founds macs to be a little dry. As soon as you enter the place, the smell of smoke slaps your taste buds and senses, in a good way.   Hillbillys is a great place for BBQ and will most definitely be in my regular lunch rotation. As far as it being better than Macs, that's a toss up. It definitely does compete and might just come down to personal preference or the day of the week. Please check out Hillbillys, I'd love to hear other reviews and opinions of the two!"}
{"text":"Attempted to eat here. Pulled in and parking lot is full of cigarette smoking bikers and police. Walked in with our family of 4 adults & 2 kids. 5 staff members stare at and completely ignore us and the gentleman in front of us. I asked to a server if we were to seat ourselves and she blankly ignored me. They were not busy. They were horribly rude. I'm pretty sure the initial rudeness would reflect on their service and in turn the food would suck since nobody gives a damn About their customers!!! BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"This space used to be occupied by Carolina Country BBQ which was my favorite bbq place in Charlotte since forever.  When they closed  I was at a loss of good cue.  So when Hillbilly's opened up in the same space, I had to try it.  Hillbilly's renovated the space and lightened up the walls a bit and added a salad bar though the selections on it are very limited.  And unfortunately, the barbecue doesn't live up to its predecessor.  It's decent barbecue and certainly edible but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.  And the service was just average as well at my last visit.    Oh well....next."}
