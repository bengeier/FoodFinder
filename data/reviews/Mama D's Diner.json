{"text":"The breakfast was ok, nothing special. It took 45 minutes after ordering to get to the table. I had to ask for my drink, 25 minutes after ordering, and my friend, who got her coffee a few minutes after ordering, had to ask for her juice from another waitress about 35 minutes after ordering. The coffee was served in a styrofoam cups without a lid because the waitress said she didn't have time to do dishes. There was an issue with the cash register which the waitress said meant she couldn't split our check, but the cashier would. The cashier couldn't get into the cash register because she said the owner was doing something on the computer. Just one silly fiasco after another.

The decor is nice, clean, freshly painted and the prices are good. The menu is limited and the staff are very slow.  I won't return."}
{"text":"I will be conservative and go with a sold 4 stars. I was really thinking the place would be bigger but it is in a small storefront. Upon arrival at 8:50 on Sunday, there was only 3 seats left at the bar so we opted for 2 of them. The food menu isn't huge but all the basics are there.  Staff is friendly and of course, it's super clean. I think the kitchen was slammed because the food was a smidge slow coming out but it gave us time to watch the news and take in the sights. 
The prices are super reasonable.  My special of the day was good and hot/fresh. Hubby's breakfast patty melt was huge and he says \"really good\". Pancakes looked great coming out of the kitchen. They do have the option of ordering online. 
Bonus: they have an 'online only' special for the a.m. - I might try that one day for my morning commute.  
We'll try it again for other items. I am all for the local community and small businesses succeeding. I wish them well!"}
{"text":"What great food! This place just opened about a 1min walking distance from my place. I must let everyone know there isn't a lot of seating but worth it. The food was hot and the staff was nice. Great pricing too! My wife and I got out of the for under $22. We each had an omelette with hash browns and a bagel instead of toast. Can't wait to go back!"}
