{"text":"This is such a hidden gem. Way better food than I was expecting from a food court. They lured me in with a sample of their bread that I could not resisit. Their pizza and breads are amazing! All their ingredients and salads are super fresh. A perfect creation of flavours! They were very freindly and easily accomodated my allergies. Love this place!"}
{"text":"tried their lahambajeen flat bread. delicious. The owner, mohammed is a very sweet man and mentioned the fact that the food is halal to whomever is interested in knowing."}
{"text":"I've passed this place hundreds of times, it's by the escalator and a bit further out from the rest of the food court.

So I decided to try this place, I normally avoid it because these types of places carry mostly pre-made food.
I ordered a half-zaatar, half-cheese manakeesh ($4)

The guy behind the counter did something I amost never see: he made it FRESH, on the spot in a wood burning oven where you can see the dough and cheese bubbling up.

It came out burning my tongue, but I couldn't wait to scarf it down, how much better than Al-Taib where the food just sits there.

To be fair, the baklawa is pre-made and some stuff sits there, but they at least offer a fresh alternative.

Defintely worth it, will go back to try some other items."}
{"text":"We ordered a lahambajeen flat bread with minced beef, cheese and tomato sauce. 
It was fresh out of the oven and tasted extremely authentic and flavourful. 
The service was efficient and friendly! 

Will definitely head back to try more things!"}
{"text":"This is a Lebanese fast food restaurant. It serves lahmajoun which is kind of like pizza which minced meat on top. They have other varieties to try such as a tomato and cheese dish. The food was ok but nothing to rave for. The taboul√© was good I have to say. Service however was horrible. Took 15min to get the order. The owner had to always remind his employees who ordered what. I will go back in a couple of weeks to see if it has organized it's self better"}
{"text":"LEBANESE PIZZAS AND MUCH MORE...

For those who think that food court restaurant are just sandwich places or french fries counter, think again: this place is awesome. What a nice upgrade for a food court. 
Zaatar and other dishes are fantastic. And...they are made fresh from the big oven on the spot. Very good salads to go with your main dish.
Go see them. They know what they are doing and the service is excellent. Bet you never go back to regular food court places!!"}
