{"text":"I'm lucky enough to live just around the corner from this Bakery so I can now buy real bread! They keep adding to their selection - meat pies; cakes; pizza; cupcakes! 
Fantastically fresh and yummy. Try it out - across from the new LCBO on Danforth Ave.

{"text":"Amazing breads  (sour dough, challah and raisin breads) great lemon squares, cookies, brownies....

Nice staff.

Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I am not sure what it was I was tasting: either rancid poppyseeds, or a bagel that had once been frozen and just tasted funny.  In either case, I was not impressed with my first purchase from this place."}
{"text":"I work close (too close) to this wonderful local bakery.  The prices are reasonable for their amazing baked goods!!! 

 Recently, I brought one their carrot cakes to a party-it was literally the talk of the party.  After, I was in a large nice grocery store and saw a similar sized cake which was more costly! I say, support dough - you won't be sorry!  

Also,their montreal style bagels are awesome too -beats tims down the street and is only slightly more money (cents). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try out the newly opened Dough Bakeshop last week and it was definitely everything I wanted it to be and more!

To make our first visit a well-rounded one, my roommate and I bought a variety of goodies: a loaf of brown bran bread, a pair of chocolate brownies, and a bag of fresh pizza dough...all for $10 even! We made the pizza that very night and although homemade pizza even on store-bought crust is delicious, this fantastic dough definitely made a huge difference. For only $3 you get a bag full of yummy dough, just waiting for you to roll out and make an awesome pizza on. (Oh, and the dough is stored in an adorably old-school light teal fridge, marked only with a sign that excitedly says \"Pizza Dough!\")

For the bread we went with a rather basic pick, but it was still super good. I've made several sandwiches with it since we brought it home, all of which have been way better than any sandwich Dempsters could make me! Oh, and the brownies? Mmm! They were very perfectly chocolately and had bits of chocolate chips/chunks baked in as well - a great touch.

Next time I visit I'm eager to try their yummy looking bagels, as well as some other sweet treats. Oh, and some more pizza dough, of course!"}
{"text":"Was walking on Danforth ave and saw this bakery. I stopped by and get a coffee and a croissant, end up a great surprise for the day! Crispy croissant, yummy!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The bread and bagels are good, as are the pastries. They also have the best carrot cake I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their cheesecake and chocolate chip cookies. But the bread is so bland! And expensive for what it is...oy. The crust and insides lack flavour.  I could just go to Loblaws. Couldn't you guys work on the bread?  Your baking skills elsewhere are solid."}
{"text":"I moved into a new office near Dough and at first out of convenience I started grabbing my morning coffee there.  I quickly realized this place is doing really great things.  I get a latte and I've tried their scones and croissants which are made fresh in-house (obviously, it's a bakery first and foremost). The chocolate croissants (pain du chocolate) are ridiculously good.  I noticed that they make a breakfast sandwich and I'll update my review once I tried one.  I also noticed they have a small freezer with homemade dishes (meat pies, mac and cheese, comfort food classics) that I will also try soon.

The latte is excellent as are the baked goods that I've tried.  Service is very good with zero pretentiousness.  Definitely worth popping in is as you'll find something delicious."}
{"text":"Dough Bakeshop is a small neighbourhood bakery. They have a small counter with a few seat to have a cup of coffee. I was not impressed with their pastries and coffee, but there were always many regular customers in a shop. I thought it was pricey as a small neighbourhood bakery."}
{"text":"I'm rating this for coffee geeks, not as a bakery. Although they have a gorgeous, 60's-era Victoria Arduino espresso machine and use \"i deal coffee\" beans, they don't take their espresso seriously, at least not seriously enough to have all their staff properly trained. In addition, they don't have proper \"to stay\" cups for those who want to utilize one of their 4 window-side stools. My cappuccino was poorly made...too hot, sloppy foam and a bit bitter. (Grinder calibrated lately?) one comment on the baked goods...it all looked great, and my pain au chocolat, though huge, was tasty but chewy."}
{"text":"The have the best blueberry-cranberry scone in the whole Danforth. It has that edge that makes you keep coming back for it every now and then. Pricier that a simple scone but you get what you pay for. Yummy chocolate brownies too."}
{"text":"Ordered a Birthday Carrot Cake ..the best we ever have had; deeeeelicious!.
Uma took the order, no muss no fuss ready when promised and very reasonably priced.
I love walking into the store, like a step back in time with so many great products, bakers in plain view, kneading, rolling, flouring and making magic!
I've lived in this neighbourhood for 25+ years and this is a very welcome addition to the uniqueness of The Danforth."}
{"text":"Incredible scones. But the thing that I love is that I can phone them a couple of days a head and order sliders. They're always ready for me as soon as I arrive. And they're soft with a great crust. Perfect for that little burger. Oh, and the place smells fantastic."}
{"text":"Dough just gave me another reason to be thankful that I live on the Danforth. I walk by this place all the time, but I've never walked in until this past weekend. It always smells really good as you walk by, and the place is always packed, so I don't know why I didn't take it as a sign that I should probably stop by. Anyways, I finally have and I've fallen in love!

I walked in on Sunday morning. The selection was huge and just so fresh. I love Dough because they use fresh, organic, and local ingredients. This bakery is like your mom and pop type of bakery- which is a plus. Staff are super friendly. The cashier was stopped by the customer in front of me to make a coffee, so someone from the back stepped in so that I wouldn't have to wait too long to cash out. 

I ordered a cheese danish and a latte that morning. Cheese danish was great. I've often had danishes that make your mouth feel like there's a layer of butter on the roof of your mouth (it's pretty gross), but this didn't feel like that! Latte was also great. It did the trick and woke me right up (because being up at 10:30am on a Sunday is a little wrong). 

Anyways, I think this might be my new morning spot. A bit of a walk from the Starbucks I usually frequent, but this is definitely worth the walk."}
{"text":"3.5 I ordered some pecan pots as well as a gluten free butterscotch cookie.  The pecan potts were pretty delicious id say 3.5-4.  And the butterscotch cookie was average, id say 3.  
I like the shop though its quaint. and the staff was helpful.  I would come back and try other things...."}
{"text":"Still my favourite bakery!  I am addicted to their Basque Cakes.  I buy the large ones when I have company.  But I buy two of the small ones ( big enough for 2 people) monthly.
Their challah is perfect for French toast!
But the new star in their show, imho is their southern style cornbread!  A couple of different flavours such as cheese and jalape√±o or plain.  I buy it weekly to have with chilli or barbecue!
The staff here are amazing each and everyone of them.  They treat you like members of their extended family.
They also take phone reservations so you can order what you want or, if you are running late, to make sure that they will save your desired item for you happily."}
{"text":"I come here all the time when I'm at Danforth Music Hall. It is truly one of the best, filled with yummy goodness. There's everything you could think of here including gluten free and vegan items. Slightly pricy but worth every penny! Love the homemade soups that come in big glass mason jars, Montreal style bagels WOOHOOO. 

Last time I was there I picked up a gluten free cookie, a danish, a vegan pumpkin chocolate bread loaf (that was moist and delish) and a croissant. I try something new every time I'm there, which I have to admit, is not that often since I live in the states. However, each time Dough continues to impress and excite me and I really look forward to coming here each time I am nearby.

It's absolutely fantastic whether or not you are GF, vegan, sweet tooth, savory tooth or just if you enjoy supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"BEST CARROT CAKE ever. On the last day of my rotation recently, one of my seniors brought in a whole carrot cake to share. I still can't get over how absolutely phenomenal it was... The cake portion was moist and dense with real carrot buts and chunky seeds, and was sandwiched and topped with a (too sweet) rich, thick cream cheese frosting. Even my colleague who usually hates sweets couldn't put down his fork. Lost one star due to a scarcity vegan options. But still. Oh gosh... If you have a huge sweet tooth and enjoy dense, gooey, homemade cakes, *dough* yourself a favor and check out Dough!"}
{"text":"Really good baked goods. AMAZING carrot cake, excellent cookies, the various squares are so yummy... I have so many good things to say about this place, and have tried many of the goodies... But then there's the coffee. It could be that their old-school espresso machine needs cleaning, or that they really don't know how to pull a good shot of espresso... I *love* IDEAL coffee, but find the coffees they serve up at Dough undrinkable. So I just don't order coffee there. *shrugs*"}
{"text":"I love the ...... the best I've ever had period!! I won't tell you what it is because I don't want to risk them being all out.
But if you are lucky to stumble in on it you'll know what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"A fantastic neighbourhood bakery. A lot of TLC goes into their baked goods. Personal favourites are the cheese croissants, flourless chocolate cakes, multigrain bread, among many others. Great coffee too, and very friendly staff. They also feature gluten free items remarkably."}
{"text":"As much as I would like to support any new local enterprise I was disappointed with both visits I made to this new store. First visit was okay, the lady made me a great meatloaf sandwich on a house baked bun and I had it with a coffee, yum yum. However the shop layout appeared to have been put up with little retail in mind. Two examples: 
1. An old retro style frig filled to the tits with pizza dough, when I opened the door the stuff literally exploded onto the floor. The front window display was an ancient wooden rack filled with plastic bags full of day old reduced breads. How appealing is that? 
2. Later as we were finishing up our snack the store filled up with customers. The lady at the cash (an owner I presume) had her hands full servicing the customers, however she received no help from the other employees that were placidly working/chatting in the production area in the rear of the shop. 
To the Owner/Nice lady: Crack that whip!!
3. A year goes by. One fine spring day I passed by and went in for a coffee and bun. Here is what I saw: A woman sitting on a stool at a mezzanine table, her back to me. She had a newspaper spread out with all of her stuff lying on the table. I thought, hmmm Owner? Customer? Wasn't sure. There was no one else around in the shop. I hesitated... the woman didn't turn around, she was wearing a pair of low rise tights and displaying a good 6 inches of sweaty ass crack. I quickly left, shaking my head as I did. Not sure what I had just witnessed other than it was really unappealing. I never returned. I cannot get that image out of my mind no matter how hard I try. What would possess someone to let it all hang out in such a blatant manner?"}
{"text":"Dropped by this place unintentially because my husband love baked goods. I wasnt keen on getting anything but we end up getting a cinnamon bun, lemon tart, a brownie and an americano.

I was really impressed with the cinnamon bun, it is crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside, it is sooooooooo good. The lemon tart is full of flavour and the shortbread crust bring it up another level. Omg I haven't had such delicious baked dessert for a long time.

I just wish they have more seating area. Only 4 seats is a bit difficult when u just want to sit down and enjoy the food because everyone is eyeing your seat and waiting for you to get off.

Lovely food and coffee, I will come back and visit again."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get these cravings (nooo not pregnant cravings hehe*). Typically I wouldnt say that I crave sweet things however I definitely do crave that perfect butter tart!! It has to be flakey and soft in the middle. This ABSOLUTELY was the best butter tart I have ever had. The shop itself was cute and smelled amazing. They had everything from freshly baked bread, sweet treats, sandwiches and beverages. I will definitely be going back to this spot again."}
{"text":"Friendly service & great smiles.
Everything looks so delicious here, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you pick sweet or savory.

But if there's one thing you like to try and have a sweet tooth. I'd recommend the butter tart. 

Also, this is more of a grab & go kinda place. They have very few seats on a high stool by the window."}
{"text":"I was just walking down Danforth and couldn't resist popping into Dough. It has the look that I want a cute little bakery to have. I got a couple dinner rolls and an almond croissant. Neither were anything to get excited about. The rolls didn't have much flavor. The almond croissant was all right, but I would have have preferred the croissant to be lighter and flakier. The dough part was too dense for my taste.

I think this probably is a very good bakery, but stick with the proper breads."}
{"text":"Odours on the Danforth are normal - part of the neighbourhood. The smell of fresh roast coffee, souvlaki, and other ethnic flavours...

But there's a new smell on the Danforth, (at Broadview).  Dough Bakeshop. Fresh baked breads, muffins and other oven tasty treats, including ice-cream.

The bread is often oven hot and incredibly fresh. They've only been open for a month or two and already I've met people that drive across town to pick up their evening bread.

I don't know if they do gluten-free products or not."}
{"text":"Really close to Broadview TTC station for a quick hop off.  Especially if you want home cooking vs. fast food.

CROISSANT REVIEW - I'll have to agree its a solid citizen if you like soft, mushy/dense and relatively oily vs. crisp, flaky, and relatively dry.

Other points
- there's only 4 seats
- they sell and assume use I deal coffee
- pleasant old school interior with wood shelves, exposed brick and stately appliances.
- $2.00 americano (don't know if single or double)

I wouldn't return specifically for the croissant but I'd try some of the other baked goods."}
{"text":"This is a quaint bakery and ice cream shop on The Danforth - I made a special note about the ice cream because it's not to be missed, and they have a large rotation of flavours. Can you name another ice cream shop on Danforth? Because I totally can't, so this is a new discovery.

My bagel (they get them from somewhere else) was stale-ish, but my in-house croissant was dynamite! At 2pm it was still astoundingly fresh, and there were other baked things taunting me...from brownies to pizza. This place is dangerously delightful."}
