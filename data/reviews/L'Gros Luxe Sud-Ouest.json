{"text":"I had already tried the two locations on the Plateau, so I was eager to see if the chain's consistency rang true.  Since it was probably one of the last warm evenings to eat outdoors, we opted to sit on the back patio. About a dozen tables are crammed out there with minimal lighting. I noticed two lights overhead, but all they did was cast shadows, making it difficult to see the menu. I saw other diners using their phone lights to illuminate the situation, which is hilariously sad. A few LED candles from the Dollar Store could really help here.   I ordered the grilled cheese Cubano, which comes with a side of fries or salad. I opted for the salad, but should have taken the former. The sandwich was delicious, but the piddly salad was just sad. It came in a tiny little bowl with half a handful of greens and a couple of cherry tomatoes. I saw others had ordered the fries, which was a decent portion. For $9, I expect the portion of the side to be on the smaller side, but this was insulting to salad eating clients. I will forgive them their trespass, since they did have $7 pints of Kronenbourg Blanc 1664.  The dessert menu could use some imagination, with only four items to choose from. Three of which are ice cream based, so not much variety if you don't feel like ice cream. The servers we had were good, and efficient for the most part.  Overall, my dining experience was passable for the price point."}
{"text":"Very slow service. 1 hour 45 min for 4-person brunch, when not crowded at all on a Saturday. Took 25 min just to place our order. Hostess who finally gave us the bill still took 10 minutes to take our credit cards etc. And she was rude to us.  Food was great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  service (Vanessa, Audrey as well as the gentlemen there  were awesome!),  food was REALLY good,  served rapidly and was hot.  Prices were really affordable too.  A must  try!  Tried the fish tacos,  pulled pork tacos,  fried dulls,  the ceasar,  the beef burger and the El burrito : everything  was GREAT!"}
{"text":"I'd love to tell you about the food, if I could've HAD ANY.   We called twice and were told to download the app to reserve, so we did. 45 min later, at the door the hostess says her app hasn't worked for 3 months?! As if it's no big deal. How has it not been fixed in all this time? It's your ONLY method of reserving a table, since all your employees tell us to download the app. We even had proof on our phones, which we showed her. She didn't really believe us and asked which restaurant we called, so we showed her the call log on our phone. She didn't seem to care.   Overall we waited an hour before she gave away a perfectly good table to another group that had literally JUST walked in, also having used the app. Needless to say, it was a shit experience, and totally insulting. We left. We had to go wait elsewhere and missed a chunk of the live show we had purchased tickets for.   FIX YOUR APP since you don't accept phone reservations. Or just delete your whole app from the Play Store, since it doesn't fulfill it's main purpose."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, ok service, food was bland and cold. Received the wrong order, which seemed to have been sitting out for a while. The server, who blamed the mistake on the kitchen, sort of stopped serving us after we pointed out the mistake. To be fair, it was the end of her shift and she seemed pretty done.   Probably won't eat here again, but it seems like a decent spot for a couple drinks. The beer selection isn't great, but hey, at least they sometimes serve it in a slightly bigger than normal glass."}
{"text":"Just awful for brunch . Super nice setting but the food was no good and our orders were wrong. The one on Bernard was good. Maybe better for supper but there are a million places on monkland that have amazing brunch."}
{"text":"If you are on budget but still like to go out to enjoy a few drinks without restraining yourself from ordering food or simply don't want to break the bank, you would probably appreciate what L'Gros Luxe has to offer: tasty finger food,  a wide variety of brunch and main dishes, drinks and cocktails - everything at affordable costs! Read more about this place  on our blog!"}
{"text":"Service is beyond terrible, food is crazy salty... Not even the coffee/espresso was good -- pretty bad sign for a business in this area when there is so much quality surrounding this place. After waiting to be seated in the mostly empty restaurant, I told the waiter that we'd already waited 20 minutes looking at the menu and so we knew what we wanted... He said \"I'm with clients right now.\" Laughable. Completely rude, awful staff at this place... I asked if I could get another coffee (they served me a cold one...) and the guy looked at me like I was asking for something he'd never heard of before. Bon Vivant is literally 100 times better. Even Toi & Moi Caf√© is better. Just because prices are cheap...doesn't mean it's worth it."}
{"text":"Obvious growing pains, might be worth it in a few months.  Went there with someone who's loved L'Gros luxe other locations. However, we found the overall experience quite disappointing.  Initially seated in their \"terrasse\" behind the restaurant ( a 4 table nook where you have to move your chair each time the waiter needs to pass, sitting below the AC compressor ). We then moved indoors where the ambiance was much better.   Took about 45 minutes to get our drinks ( apparently this was due to the \"ceaser with a burger\" taking a long time ). Eventually food arrived, fries not cooked enough / cold, grilled cheeses good, poutine same as fries, bahn-mi was eaten with a fork.   Manager sidled in, concensus was that he seemed quite drunk and frankly wouldn't leave us alone. Frankly he was likely the most disagreeable part of the evening. We get a new restaurant having opening week issues, but being harassed by the manager is ... odd to say the least.   Staff are great and friendly, though you see them running from one task to the other which makes you think that they need some additional staff.  We'll be back ... in a few months."}
{"text":"Came here last night after work to grab a couple of bites with friends. This location opened not too long ago, so we wanted to check it out. It's located right across from Joe Beef, and 5 min walk from Lionel Groulx.     We chose to sit inside, but they also have an outdoor patio/terasse at the back. there were 3 of us and we decided to share a number of dishes on the menu.     We had the White Sangria ($25) to start, which tasted strongly of rhubarb and quite weak. As for food, we decided to get the Watermelon & Feta Salad ($8), Fish Tacos (2/$5), Pull Pork Tacos(2/$5), Pork Pork Poutine ($), Wings ($8) and Veggie Burger ($8). The standout dishes out of them were definitely the Tacos which were outstanding (both pork & fish option). If you're not a fan of soft shell tacos, you probably wont enjoy them as much. However we found the soft shell complimented the richness of the filling and sauce perfectly. For $2.50/ taco, I'd definitely recommend it. The poutine grilled cheese was also excellent if you're in a carb craving mood.     The portion are actually quite generous for the price, but youd probably want to get a couple of dishes if you're not sharing. Reasonable price, great atmosphere and awesome comfort food. Great place to catch up with friends or first date."}
{"text":"Never going back to this place. Service was slow and waiter never brought plates or picked up dirty dishes. Dirty finished plates were sitting on our table for over 45 minutes before we had to ask to please clear the table. Food took forever to come, others were also complaining about slow service and leaving after waiting too long for order. Food wasn't as good as it used to be. My friends and I had stomach aches after we left and felt a little sick. Was the worst I have experienced in a years"}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous to go here after being at the plateau location and having tried the 20$ ceaser. The reason being the burger attached was quite terrible. That known, I ordered the fish tacos and the watermelon salad. They were both delicious and fresh and I was very relieved. Service was super friendly and fast. Decor was lovely.  I'd definitely go back for any non burger non grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Been here many times and like the place. The food is good value as are the drinks. Just what is needed in the area as we sadly lack decent happy hour offers from the other nearby bars. Griffintown has some new bars that offer very good prices at happy hour(s).  I also don't mind the first come first served policy.  What I don't like is what happened the other evening.  After waiting 30 mins when we had been told it won't be long, we then get to the front of the line and are told it will be at least another 30 mins. Apparently there is a list of people in front of us. So is it first come first served or not?"}
{"text":"Very average place. Cant say I ever found any of their dishes to be well executed or that tasty. Prices are reasonable though and its a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Its a decent late night option as usually nothing is open past 9-10 in this city. Couple of examples of what I tried.  Poutine - too salty Duck Tacos -  cold and nothing special Fish burger - Almost no fish but instead two huge onion rings, so pretty much an onion ring burger."}
{"text":"I went their for the first time during the evening and I just felt in love with the amazing welcoming my friend and I had. We when back the same week for the brunch on the Sunday morning and I was delighted again with the nice service and sweet team we had. I recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the look of this place, and what a fun menu!  Really cool vibe inside. Try one of their unique caesars, and the tater tot poutine. Pulled pork sliders are great too. Lunch bill including a beer came in under $20. Awesome.  My absolute favourite item on the menu though, is the fried pickles. I fell hard in love with chip-like fried pickles many years ago (not spears, more like round chips) and they're really hard to find in Montreal. Whenever I order fried pickle spears, I'm disappointed that they're not crispy and crunchy. But L'Gros Luxe does SUPER crunchy pickle spears, and they're amaaaazing.  I think there's Panko and regular breadcrumbs on them. You MUST try them.   (Edit) - Went back a second time a few weeks later, and ordered the Bahn Mi.  Big mistake. If you've ever had Bahn Mi, you'll be incredibly disappointed with this one. Order something else (there are so many awesome options) and if you're craving a Bahn Mi, go to Vua Sandwichs instead.   Also tried the location in Longueuil on my third visit to L'Gros Luxe, and wasn't as impressed by the food as my 2 visits to the Notre-Dame location. They didn't cook the dishes as well (tried the same things again + my husband had the fish tacos & it was hard and dry and unappetizing), so stick to this Little Burgundy location if you can! :)"}
{"text":"Updated review, very inconsistent service. Went there last night with friends from out of town and was embarrassed by the crappy service they got. Kinda leaves a sour impression of Montreal. First off, their application showed that we were 6th in wait. We went directly so we could wait in the lobby. We were seated after maybe 20 minutes or so but the app still showed we were 6th in line... Ordered drinks before food. Got food first. Took 25 minutes for drinks for which we had to remind the waitress of. They promptly came after that but the appetizers on the Cesar's were lukewarm. Ordered some Piri Piri wings which came undercooked. The batter was still moist and the chicken was pinkish. When I asked the waitress she said it was normal. We sent them back. Took at least 20 minutes. We had to remind her again of the wings. The moist \"normal\" batter was actual crisp this time.  The waitresses were actual busier with the table behind us. Drinking at their table, having clamato shots and having bites off a burger in between. Very unprofessional. Those customers were pretty obnoxious as well. They were going behind the bar. After we finished eating, they mostly ignored us. They didn't ask us if we wanted a refill, dessert, water, nothing. After 25 minutes of empty glasses, one of them cleared the table and gave us a pitcher of water. That was it. We asked for the bills they didn't even bother to close the transaction themselves. They sent the buss boy to whom we voiced our concern. To our astonishment, he informed us the manager was there. I was mostly amazed how he could tolerate such unprofessional behaviour. We then left. No thank you nothing. I think the buss boy told his manager because he came running after us. We explained the whole situation and learned at the same time that the table behind us was the one of the staff's brother. When you're at work, if there's a distraction and it prevents you from doing your job probably, there's a serious problem. Also, Tip is proportional to service. That's why we left the bare minimum. I live in the neighbourhood but I won't be going back to this branch."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my girlfriend and a group of her friends. The decor was pretty cool with a rustic chic feel though at the expense of comfort as I was stuck between two different levelled wood tables.   The staff were extremely limited with one poor girl supplemented by a few busboys serving the entire restaurant of over 40 guests, so predictably the service was extremely slow and incorrect. I waited 30 minutes for my spiked coffee and only when prompted did the waitress acknowledge that she had forgotten and would get on it, she had to be additionally prompted that I needed to choose what to spike it with! Her knowledge of the menu was extremely lacking, and her ability to take English orders was also limited as she seemed to understand slightly better when I switched to French.  The food was nothing to write home about and with the substandard service and wait time this place falls short of the mark. If you're looking for a brunch place in the area I would rather go to Toi, moi et caf√©."}
{"text":"Just got back from a girls night at L'Gros Luxe and what a disappointment the whole experience was!   We walked in around 6pm this Friday and were surprised to see that the place was pretty empty. We were seated at a high table and given menus.   We decided on a bottle of Rose wine to share, and so we were disappointed when we were told that they hadn't carried that bottle for 3 weeks. We then asked for another bottle - got a similar response. Then we asked for sliders and the watermelon salad. Neither was available either! By this point, we were pretty irritated. When we asked to taste a specific bottle of wine before ordering, we were told we couldn't. I mentioned that even high end restaurants give you a little sip of the wine to make sure it's to your taste before committing, and our server quickly tapped me on the shoulder and said \"ok\" as if to indicate that I had convinced her.   We ended up with a bottle of white, the tater tot poutine, fried pickles, sweet potato fries, and the burrito bowl. The food was fine apart from the fact that despite asking for the spicy sauce that comes in the burrito bowl to come on the side, it was mixed into the bowl....overall, we left pretty unhappy except for the fact that we paid less than $30 per person. Service was sparse and lacking, and the restaurant was missing many items from the menu for it to be more than a coincidence. Will not be back and cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Rien √† redire sur ce restaurant, nous avons ador√© notre exp√©rience, autant gr√¢ce √† la nourriture que gr√¢ce au personnel, tr√®s chaleureux et attentif. J'aime beaucoup le fait qu'on puisse choisir autant de \"sides\" peu co√ªteux, c'est une bonne id√©e pour les grosses tabl√©es.  Nous avons toutes craqu√© pour les grilled cheese (le Cubano est incroyable), avec des onion rings en plus.  En dessert, ne passez pas √† c√¥t√© de la fried cookie dough, √ßa peut para√Ætre √©trange sur le menu, mais c'est vraiment d√©licieux !! J'y retournerai sans h√©siter (Pour go√ªter leurs burgers ?) je m'y suis vraiment sentie bien.  √Ä voir si les autres franchises sont aussi bien :)"}
{"text":"Dined in for my wife's birthday. Requested something cozy or with a view and got a perfect table by the windows up front. Delicious cocktails, scrumptious poutine, and the house burger was one of the best I've ever had. My wife had the fish tacos and raved about them as well. We got the cookie cheese cake and it was unbelievable. So so good. Great service, fun atmosphere; we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just went there with my brother and his girlfriend for brunch. We ate on the terrasse in the back. The waitress wasn't welcoming and didn't look happy that we wanted to eat outside. Very disappointing experience. The waitress looked very annoyed, was not friendly at all and never came to check that we had everything we needed. She was very absent and it was hard to get her attention. We tried the brunch burrito, the Classique and the Hachi. All our meals were very plain. The waitress brought them without refilling our water glasses, no ketchup for our potatoes and no jam/maple sirup for our toasts. 20 minutes later we got a hold of her and asked for it and she replied OK without apologizing. My brother's coffee was cold and he had to ask for another one. Even at the end when we wanted to pay, we couldn't find her. Bathrooms needed toilet paper and the soap machine was broken. So it's our first and last brunch at this horrible place. Very unfortunate because I enjoyed dinner at other L'Gros Luxe places in the past."}
{"text":"Overall, the concept of accessible restaurant quality food for all is fabulous. The great prices are the first thing you'll notice about l'Gros Luxe when you sit down at any of their locations. With mains priced between  $7-9 (before adding extras) you really feel like you have the freedom to order everything off the menu- and you'll want to because everything looks SO good.   This particular branch has good vibes all around. The staff are friendly and attentive and the decor is very eclectic. We're talking a mix of black subway tile and gilded antique accents.   The plates are reasonably sized and the menu lists very fun and indulgent options. It's very veggie and vegan friendly but there are still plenty of meat-lover options available as well. The health-conscious also don't have to look too hard either. The food itself is for the most part pretty good. Their potato game is weak but that's the only real complaint.   The cocktail menu is expansive and looks super fun. The caffeinated beverages are good -we were in awe of the crema on our espresso!  Weekends here means brunch till dinner service (!!!) and their brunch is pretty good! We came around 2:40ish and were seated right away but I understand that coming at more conventional brunch times means possibly waiting in line first. Apparently they have an app for that though, but I just haven't used it.      All around you really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We went there twice for brunch. I truly love the concept of L'Gros Luxe, fun food that is on the cheaper side. It's a very nice atmosphere and the staff are great... However, after two tries I will be calling it quits for this place. The food is really hit or miss. We had gone back in September for brunch and ordered the tater tot poutine== which was absolutely delicious, and the breakfast grilled cheese,,, which was not. This tasted like soggy lettuce with bread. But given the low price at the end of our meal and the good poutine we decided to give it another go. We went last week, and the menu had significantly changed, and much to our dismay, so did the portions. We ordered the breakfast poutine, which was disappointingly small with about 10 potatoes, cold hollandaise sauce and a very sad looking egg, as well as ordering the burrito bowl, again essentially just rice and a bit of cold salsa and an even sadder looking egg, with what has to be the smallest yolk I have ever seen. Moreover the egg had a gelly-like consistency, and looked absolutely disgusting. We were happy with the low price on the bill, and to be leaving this place for good in the end."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great but the food is just very basic. Fish tacos & burgers and some salads. Definitely was expecting something a little more varied, like l'entrep√¥t or other similar fixed price restos. Came on a Sunday night when they are supposed to close at 11.30-12 and although not many tables were going, they do last call for food at 10.45pm. To boot, the kitchen staff start cleaning and start blaring mega hard-core music that overpowers the music of the resto itself. Definitely left me wanting more.."}
{"text":"Ive enjoyed this restaurant at other locations but had less than enjoyable service here. Besides the rude service, the Vegetarian tacos leave a lot to be desired. A serving of tacos is two tacos, two unseasoned strips of tofu, and what appears to be a teaspoon of coleslaw. I usually get a veggie burger and will probably stick to that but at the other locations."}
{"text":"Had a pretty disappointing brunch here today. I was excited about a lot of the options on the menu, settled on the fried chicken and French toast. When it arrived, it was alright in terms of taste (a bit bland but fine), but it was a minuscule portion and didn't have ANY of the fruit it was supposed to include due to an upcoming menu change we weren't warned about when we ordered. Oh, and I noticed halfway through my coffee that my mug still had someone else's lipstick on it, so... yay. Other folks at my table seemed similarly disappointed by how drab and piddly their orders turned out to be.   The price was fine (9 bucks), but I gladly would've paid nearly twice as much for a decent-sized brunch with some fruits and/or veggies included. Brunch has to fill in for TWO MEALS, so it kind of needs to be hearty and contain some amount of variety."}
{"text":"We went during lunch time; it wasn't packed. At first, we got seats in the middle on high table and chairs. Later we see, a group leaving, from a corner. My friend grabs the waiter asks if we can have that spot. The waiter cleaned the table in a jiffy and transferred us in the corner. It was so beautiful, looked like vintage. The wallpapers, the mirror the table and chairs from Victorian Era.   Our waiter was amazing. Smiley, friendly and helpful. Answered our questions regarding the menu and helped my friend to choose something. My friend got Peruvian grilled cheese with onion rings. She simply adored it. I got piri piri chicken tacos and man n cheese. The stuffing of my tacos was perfect, loved how it was spicy and perfect amount. My tortilla bread got hard fast, maybe I was eating too slow. Mac n cheese was sadly a letdown. It was just plain. It's like macaroni, sprinkled some cheese on it, and baked. It was missing flavors.   Overall, it's a beautiful place, great staff... I would like to come try something else but no Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Samedi ils ouvrent √† 11h00. √Ä l'ouverture, meilleur moment pour s'y rendre bruncher, aucune attente.   Le d√©cor: super! Vintage √† souhait (je veux leur divan capitonn√©!).   Le service: bien, ne nous sommes aucunement sentis press√©s pour choisir ce que nous voulons, remplissage de verre d'eau r√©guli√®rement. Sourire sinc√®re.  Bouffe: j'ai pris le sandwich-d√©jeuner contenant oeuf ,salade, sauce, tomate, accompagn√© de petites patates √† d√©jeuner,  vraiment bonnes avec leur assaisonnement. Un shooter de shake au yogourt/fruits tr√®s bon aussi. Cappuccino tr√®s appr√©ci√© √©galement.   La facture: 15$ pour mon d√©jeuner comprenant cappuccino, les taxes et le pourboire! Quand on sait que certains endroits chargent 15$ simplement pour une assiette d'oeufs...on se rend compte que c'est du vol ailleurs. La qualit√© ici d√©passe le prix.  Je vous le conseille fortement!  J'y retournerai assur√©ment!"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing brunch here, especially since we'd heard good things and were looking forward to it.  Things started off well, cute decor with quirky mixed furniture, and friendly welcome from the waitress.  They were out of my first choice from the menu (avocado toast).  After ordering, the waitress disappeared for the next 30 minutes.  We had our baby with us, and I ended up needing to change her, but the washrooms didn't have a change table, so I had to do it on a blanket on a very cramped washroom floor.  I don't expect a place like this to have change tables, it's not really a family restaurant, but just be warned if you're going there with a little one.  The food finally arrived, and was barely lukewarm.  Nothing was outstandingly bad, but it was just all very bland and meh.    This might be a fun place to go for drinks in the evening with friends, but definitely give it a pass for brunch."}
{"text":"Good tasting brunch, fun, interesting menu!  We wanted to come back to try the dinner menu on a Sunday night, your website says you're open until midnight 7days a week. We got there at 10:40pm and were told the restaurant was close!?If it was a quarter to 12 we would have understood (my bf and I are both servers) but if you close the kitchen an hr and a half before closing time (because it's dead) or wtv - please make that known on your site!  Food and prices are awesome but service is severely lacking....  Looks like a cool work environment but the staff is too busy talking to each other to take care of their tables...  Sucks."}
{"text":"I was a bit underwhelmed with my lunch. I ordered a chicken burger that was overcooked and dry also my salad felt like it had been out of the fridge for a while ( edible but warm) Otherwise, service was ok. They seemed understaffed the day I went so it may have been an off day for them. I expected the food to be better though. Not a terrible experience overall but that could be because of the pitcher of Bourbon Lemonade we had!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a warn and cozy pub atmosphere with some great plant based options, this is the place to go.   I went to L'Gros Luxe a few weeks ago and ordered the vegan \"chicken\" tacos and they were amazing. It probably had something to do with the marinade but these tacos would fool any meat lover into thinking it was chicken.   The menu is also geared to omnivores... so everyone is happy. They've got a great drink menu with about four different caesar options.   My only issue is it was a bit loud and hard to talk. Every time I pass by, the place is always packed."}
{"text":"I went for my second visit last Saturday and I must say I was really disappointed. My first time back in October was awesome, which is the only reason why i didn't a 1-star review this time around. Although the place was half empty, food took a very long time to reach our table. My burger was well seasoned, but dry and overcooked. We also ordered the fried cookie dough for dessert and went it reached our table, it looked like it had been sitting on the counter for 10 minutes (the fried balls were soggy and all of the ice cream had melted). I was so impressed the first time around, such a shame this place took that turn :("}
{"text":"The atmosphere was chill, felt more like a bar that you are obligated to buy food to get alcohol, which you are, by the way, its a restaurant, not a bar.  Food was quite average, even subpar. I ordered a Mac and Cheese with some extra bacon. It was quite bland, the pasta was not salted and it lacked cheese. The bacon helped a lot but for 16$ the price was quite steep."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on my own on a Sat, it was a good idea. The bar staff were very friendly and hospitable :). And the food was ok typical of you get for the price in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside. Adorable terrace. Great, easy menu. Not too expensive. Tacos, salads, grilled cheese, Vietnamese sandwiches, poutine, burgers, nachos, chicken wings. But it's not a pub. You have to eat to drink."}
{"text":"Beau! Bon! Pas cher! D√©cor convivial. On y accueille bien les enfants ce qui cr√©e une atmosph√®re enjou√©e. Menu vari√© et original  autant pour les boissons que la bouffe. Personnel souriant aimable et vraiment engag√© √† rendre votre exp√©rience agr√©able."}
{"text":"My spaghetti squash came to the table cold and lacking any real flavour... had to dump a bunch of spicy sauce. We were swatted in front of the door, cold wind kept coming through every time someone walked in and out, worse is the slamming sound it kept making!! What a disaster. How could you enjoy a cold meal in cold weather with sudden loud door slamming. As if a Velcro curtain was going to solve the issue.  Food does not meet typical Montreal food standards. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I like going to l'gros luxe, they have lots of plates you can't find anywhere else, i really liked the porc and fish tacos, also liked their fried pickles, their beef burger is excellent, the place is fairly new good ambiance, staff is good, but the best thing has to be the prices really not expensive at all. If you want good small dishes not too pricey its the place to go."}
{"text":"The service was not good and the food wasn't great. I ordered the watermelon salad and it was barely edible. I only had a few bites. This is a successful chain so this is probably just a case of growing pains but to the places defense, the drinks were great and the d√©cor is nice. They just need to up the food quality and service."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite one night after climbing gym. It was not during usual meal hours so the place was almost empty. Was a bit concerned with some of the reviews regarding the service, but we were treated just fine. Tried the burger and grilled cheese cubano which is a ulled pork sandwich with cheese.  While the burger end it up being slightly over cooked and dry, the cubano was executed perfectly.  I later saw that the owners went on Dragon's Den and managed to get additional funding to expand. The Bloody Caesar looked very very tempting and I may go back and try it sometime."}
{"text":"Nous sommes all√©s au L'Gos luxe alors que nous cherchions √† d√©jeuner dans St-Henri et nous avons √©t√© agr√©ablement surprise de notre exp√©rience au L'Gros luxe.

{"text":"Having been to other l'gros luxe locations (plateau and mile end) many times, I thought this was a safe bet to bring out of town guests before a concert at th√©√¢tre corona. It was actually one of my worst ever restaurant experiences in Montreal!   First, it was SLOW. I mean, we waited probably 30-45 mins to receive our drinks. I ordered the \"mr. Miyagi\" Caesar, which is made with sake and comes garnished with spring rolls. Instead, I got samosas. No big deal, I like samosas, but when I bit into one it was frozen inside. The waiter said he'd replace them, and I only got one replacement samosa instead of two. Again, not a huge deal, especially since I wasn't charged for the drink in the end, as a consolation for the admitted mistake.   What came next was a little shocking. I could see our meals come up at the pass through, and they were left sitting there for ages. Eventually I saw another waitress come to the pass through, and put her whole hand on top of our fried pickles to test the temperature (when they eventually arrived, they were burnt but cold.) Next she put her hand on each and every plate, opened every sandwich and felt inside the sandwiches. Then she brought us our food. It was all cold, and two of us had grilled cheese sandwiches which are really not the same when they're not hot. We all only at half of our meals, and didn't ask to have the leftovers, because we were pretty unimpressed. And through all of this no one asked us once if our food was ok. We were there for about 2.5 hours total (as I said, service was slowwww) and the entire time we watched that waitress put her hands on every plate that came through, and open every sandwich. I was thankful I didn't order soup, for fear that she'd stick her finger in it!"}
{"text":"Don't go if you're a large crowd. We waited almost 2 hours for a table for 8. They let another table of 8 get seated before us because they knew someone who worked there. Thats absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this restaurant and was happy to check it out on a Tuesday evening before a concert at the Corona.  It was pretty busy for a Tuesday, but luckily we were seated quickly and got a chance to get a good look around before ordering.  The decor is really cool and the bar looks like a fun place to hang out if you're alone and want to watch all the action.  To start, my partner and I shared a plate of fried pickles.  She is not a pickle fan at all, but deep fry it and serve it with a dipping sauce and even the most avid pickle hater can be won over.  Their recipe did not disappoint.  We also ordered two pints of the house beer.  It was very good and pretty cheap to boot!  For my main I ordered 3 vegetarian tacos.  They were excellent.  Sweet potato, tempeh, black beans and amazing pickled onions.  I think I could eat 20 of them.  My partner ordered the poutine grilled cheese sandwich with a side of onion rings.  She really went all out!  I had a bite of the sandwich which was basically a grilled sandwich stuffed with fries gravy and cheese curd.  It was decadent and it's making my mouth water just typing about it now.  The onion rings were also great and I made sure to help her finish all of them.    I know they have a bunch of other locations with different menus.  I can't wait to try the next one!"}
{"text":"I'm wondering why my fellow Yelpers are so unhappy with L'Gros Luxe. As compared with them I'm happy and have had pleasant evenings in the pub located at Notre Dame. The ambiance is nice and cozy, the last time we were seated in a room at the back that is somehow an extension to the actual pub, which I can vaguely describe as a covered terrace with summer type furniture. It was weird the room was extremely warm and there were ventilators at the ceiling trying to introduce some movement of the air, but why would I complain about heat in a wintry April.   The famous Bloody Caesars are perfect as a concept, pick your ingredients, extras and you are potentially happy, unfortunately the drink is almost virgin, I couldn't feel the alcohol, but you can have an extra shot for additional fee if you need a little buzz. Choice of other cocktails and beers is solid. Food is nice, everybody would love fried pickles and onion rings as a little unhealthy snack because they are yummy. If you need something more solid you can enjoy fresh salads or well prepared poutines, or tacos that can be served with a nice little bowl of house salad. The traditional poutine version is made with Tater Tots, but I decided to substitute them for regular fries and add one of my favorite extras: bacon, nice choice of mine.   I have experienced timely and attentive service at L'Gros Luxe. Prices are reasonable, but this is not necessarily a cheap pub. In the past there was no option to book a table, now you can reserve on the web site and that makes the pub even more attractive for bigger groups of people."}
{"text":"Just not good, unfortunately, as I wanted to like this place.  My wine was brought out with a fly in it, which I had to point out after the waitress put the glass down (not sure how you can miss that).  She was unapologetic but did get me a fresh glass.  Waited a long time for service, both to order drinks and food and receive them, which wouldn't be a huge deal, but we were seated on the patio, which had several tables that hadn't been bussed in quite some time and had half eaten plates of food and half empty glasses sitting on them.  There were flies everywhere.  It wasn't until halfway through our stay that someone came and cleared the tables.  Shared an order of tacos with my dining partner which were fine but nothing special.  I overheard the table next to us trying to order and it seemed that the restaurant had either run out of things or wasn't offering them at that time, although they were on the menu.  Overall, just a very unpleasant experience, particularly from a cleanliness perspective, and I would not return."}
{"text":"Lovely space for brunch, with plenty of room for groups (and they take reservations). The food was pretty good but not amazing. If you want to get stuffed just from one drink, however, the Bloody Mary toppings are unrivaled. Service was friendly but very slow, especially getting the check, even when it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"I liked that they have plenty of vegan options but my experience wasn't too great. The plate was a bit skinny with just a tiny bit of under-seasoned tofu scramble and some raw spinach instead of kale. The servers were a bit head in the clouds but overall it wasn't bad, I'll give 4 stars for at least having vegan options :)"}
{"text":"Le concept du gros luxe est super int√©ressant.. Je suis aller au Mont-Royal il y quelques ann√©es d√©j√† ((avant qu'il devienne vegan)) et c'√©tait super. Hier soir, par contre, le resto de Saint-Henri m'a d√©√ßue.. moi et mon copain avons envie d'une poutine avec les tater tots (patates d√©jeuner), en arrivant, l'h√¥te nous r√©pond rapidement et nous place √† une table avec nos menus. La serveuse nous dit qu'elle sera avec nous dans un moment quand cela fait plus de 10 minutes que nous somme assis. Elle semble avoir de la difficult√© √† g√©rer sa section (va et vient, sans pour autant servir qui que ce soit, comme si elle ne sait plus o√π donner de la t√™te). Pourtant √† 9pm il ne semble pas avoir de 'rush'. Finalement l'h√¥te prend notre commande apr√®s un minimum de 20 minutes d'attentes. Le service en cuisine a pris un bon 45-50 minutes pour une poutine, des tacos piri piri au poulet et un hamburger. La cuisine √©tant 'ouverte', mon chum est aller regarder ce qui s'y passait. .. Il avait l'impression que beaucoup de plats √©taient pr√™ts et attendaient d'√™tre servis. Finalement nous avons nos plats, froids, tout de m√™me bons. Dommage.. mais le service a tout g√¢cher et le froid des plats. C'est un no go pour moi"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. The service was good and I like the ambiance. It didn't feel too crowded, and the noise level was low enough that you could have a conversation without yelling at each other. I had the meatball Mac & Cheese and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The pasta wasn't over-cooked and the cheese wasn't too overwhelming. The dish itself was easy to finish, and the meatballs complimented it nicely. I also tried the \"El Cartel\" Caesar that came with mini quesadillas. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Classic bar food but with a bit better of an atmosphere. It was very busy Saturday night there and it felt like our waitress was stressed. It seemed there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant with a few busboys. Nothing special but good enough."}
{"text":"The food was creative but just ok. The service is just simply non existent. I've been at this place 3x now to give it a fair chance and every time it never fails on the bad service and just ok food. Would not recommend this place to no one . It always feels as though the staff is running around like chicken without heads ."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with couple friends and had a great experience. I ordered the mushroom soup, fish burger, sweet potato fries and cr√©me br√ªl√©e. The soup was the real deal, not soup coming out of bag bullshit. The fish burger was perfect, they put guacamole in it which I enjoyed better than tons or mayo. The cr√©me br√ªl√©e was amazing, I will totally recommend it. One of my friends ordered the poutine, it was a bit too salty for his taste but again why would you get poutine there."}
{"text":"Terrible everything.. -Waiter/manager pour water into one of our glasses, took off, then came back and poured water over my cellphone. -Cherry tomatoes on a $12 (very poor looking) caesar salad   -Cold fries....how do you screw this up.... -Potato leek soup tasted absolutely ghastly -Honey Sriracha wings were sitting on lettuce...lettuce really? -Waitress never came back to offer us refills -The table next to us sat dirty and wasn't cleared for at least 45 minutes. -The manager thought it would be a great idea to do the mannequin challenge next to our table while we were eating, he was extremely awkward. -If you type in B U R R I T O into google then click Images, you see round Burritos NOT FLAT!   **Bottom line I flew to Montreal for the weekend and was really looking forward enjoying a nice meal with my friends but instead I find myself wasting more time reviewing this place.  I HIGHLY recommenced not visiting this establishment, one of the worst places I've ever been to in my life."}
{"text":"I had heard many things about L'Gros Luxe over the years but I never found myself here until recently.  Their original restaurant opened up in the Plateau and this location was part of their expansion into other parts of the city.  They don't take reservations so you can take a gamble and just show up or you can download their app to add your name to their waitlist.  On a Wednesday night our group of four just showed up and had no problem getting seated.  To start off the night I got a JOPO which is one of their house cocktails.  Sadly it was a little too weak and I tasted more of the passion fruit puree than the actual Wild Turkey.They are known for their Caesars here which you can customize yourself by choosing the alcohol, garnish, you name it.  Despite not being a big Caesar fan I thought I would give it a go to see if a customized version of this classic drink might finally convince me to change my mind.  My personalized Caesar had rum instead of vodka and deep fried pickles as a garnish.  This was a big improvement over my first drink.  While it didn't convince me to change my mind about Caesars the deep fried pickles were good and for what it's worth my friends who are big Caesars fans really enjoyed theirs.   When discussing food they have a small menu here serving mostly bar food (tacos, burgers, sandwiches, etc).  My dish for the night was a grilled cheese sandwich with pulled pork.  There was loads of cheese (which as a cheese lover makes me happy) but the pork was on the dry side.  That was followed by a dessert of deep fried cookie dough.  On paper it sounds like an interesting dish but the execution was really off here.  Maybe cookie dough isn't meant to go in the deep fryer or maybe they overcooked it but it tasted like burnt cookies which wasn't very pleasant.  The prices were quite reasonable.  I think my whole meal, drinks included was about $40 before tip which is not bad.  My only real complaint is that the whole experience was a little inconsistent.  Certain parts were good, others not so much.  It's an okay place but I think I'll scope out other restaurants before coming back here."}
{"text":"Thank you, Paul, for making our first trip to Canada one to remember! My husband and I visited a few weeks back with our group of friends from Chicago, IL. We visited L'Gros Luxe twice during our four-day stay, largely because we were so impressed with the experience Paul crafted for us on the first visit.  Wandering around in a brand new town, it's funny how much unknown pressure is actually on the restaurants you pop into and the staff with whom you interact. Every moment, every morsel, we are judging and evaluating this new city, right? We all do it.  Paul was open & kind, funny & helpful, a complete delight as we joined him at the bar for some drinks and poutine. My favorite cocktail is THE TIPPERARY, Paul's own creation. It has the strangest ingredient list but the most fascinating flavor profile, once built. I'm still trying to force my favorite Chicago bartenders to adopt it! I also loved the ambiance and decor inside L'Gros Luxe. Very cool textures and patterns, which magically complemented one another.   Our entire group consists of service industry vets, staff, and owners. I think we are probably (not on purpose) a tough group to impress. Nonetheless, we were impressed by this spot in Little Burgundy. Ask for Paul!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with a group of 10. There was 1 waitress for the entire restaurant and a few busboys. It took over 30 minutes to get coffees, which were refilled only once over the course of the several hours we were there. I ordered the frittata which was terrible. It was thin, black on the edges and had no taste. I don't like to pay for something that I know I can make a million times better.  There are so many restaurant choices on Notre-Dame, I can guarantee I will not be returning to this branch of L'Gros Luxe."}
{"text":"I went there this past Saturday evening with my wife.  I had not been there in a long time but I remembered it for its quality and good menu.  We were seated outside on the street terrace and the hostess was very nice and so was the waiter.  We wanted something light so we both ordered salads, my wife added mushrooms and I added grilled chicken.  I was very surprised when the salads arrived as they were featured as a main dish --$12 on the menu however the portions were very meager and the presentation was very poor.  My wife was disappointed but never the less ate her salad.  My chicken all 5 tiny PCs were dry and cold as if they had been microwaved several times.  I complained to the waiter and he was gracious and brought me another one, which was better.  Unfortunately the whole experience left a bad taste.    It looks like there has been a major change in management and kitchen staff.  I expected a lot more from le grande luxe.  It seems to now be a place just for average burgers and alcohol.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The service is abominable, and when we discreetly asked the gentleman who was begrudgingly allowing us to pay whether it was simply a busy night, we were stunned to learn that he literally DGAF. The food is fine, and the price is definitely right, but it's truly nothing special and there's simply no excuse for the way we were treated.  To name a few issues: - In spit of repeated requests for drinks/service, the waitress ignored our table until our full group had arrived. This seems like a terrible decision on her part, since we would have had time to drink quite a bit while waiting for the two people who rounded out our group of ten. I wanted to ask her, Pretty Woman styles, if she worked for tips. (\"You work on commission, right? Big mistake. Big. Huge!\") - The place was a total mess, and Janet's of bussing glassware the bussers were hiding them behind plants and on any available surface. I... I don't get it. Why move them twice?  - When the waitress forgot one of our orders, she complained TO THE CLIENT that he had not ordered clearly. ?????  Customer service, y'all. What a goddamn embarrassment of a restaurant. Get in touch guys - I would happily train your team in the arts of stop, drop, and serve, smiles are free, and all the other straightforward pleasantries that fast food joints and high need restaurants alike so easily get right."}
{"text":"We had a tremendously disappointing visit to L'Gros Luxe recently. Firstly, when you reserve online, what they fail to tell you is that is for the terrace. With that being said, if the terrace is closed, your reservation is meaningless. We received a call roughly 30 minutes prior to our reservation that they needed to push it by one hour and will not honour the original time.  In terms of the food, we had three dishes: piri piri tacos, a wasabi salad and the burrito. The tacos were tasty, but the salad and burrito lacked any flavour and were disappointing. Our group shared two desserts: fried cookie dough and cookies, which took over 30 minutes to arrive, was different than describes and was cold.  Overall, poor food, very poor service and six very disappointing customers."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening to grab drinks and we were told that we must buy a plate of food each which was no problem fair enough.. When we received our bill we were each charged for extra tacos because the taco plate was only considered an appetizer and it's not a \"full meal\" the extra charge was only $2.50 but the fact that we were not told prior to placing out order was kind of a disappointment. Also, there was a lack of staff.. We saw our drinks sit at the bar prepared for about 15 mins before receiving it and the food as well. Our waitress was nice with friendly service but it would've been more nice if they were more prompt on the service.   Pros: nice decor, chic and rustic feel. Great options for vegetarians!! Friendly staff"}
{"text":"L'Gros Luxe seems amazing - from the branding, decor, and rather interesting menu they seemed to have everything to excite a horny hipster with a cool bicycle, but I lost my boner pretty fast. I had the \"Fried Chicken & Pain Dor√©\", the idea seemed amazing, but the execution was bare."}
{"text":"Great Bistro food with a twist, Generous portions for a very affordable price range, very popular wich can make you wait a little for your decadent burger but staff is friendly and the mesh of rococo d√©cor with almost steem punk accents provides for plenty dissertation material.   Nested in area full of cute venues, Instagram crazy folks will love it!"}
{"text":"Over the past few years, I had heard many things about L'Gros Luxe, the originally plateau-only restaurant known for solid cocktails and cheap but enjoyable food. However, like for many restaurants in our fair city, time and circumstances were such that I hadn't tried them yet even as they expanded to Mile End and Longueuil. A few months ago though, L'Gros Luxe came to me as they opened up a Sud Ouest location on Notre-Dame right beside Corona Theater and more importantly, only a 10 minute walk away from my apartment. With a spot that close, I really had no excuses anymore!  Over the past month, I went twice with a couple different groups. First thing which is a little unique is the fact that L'Gros Luxe does not do reservations. However, thankfully for those of us who don't want to wait outside in the cold, they have created an app with which you can add yourself onto a waitlist to get a table. First time around, we didn't think about it so we ended up waiting about 35 minutes so we grabbed a beer next door (thanks Burgundy Lion!). The second time around, I used the app but ended up not needing to as the restaurant was strangely empty that Thursday night.  I really like the look of the restaurant - a mixture of vintage Victorian style with some more modern touches. The room feels very inviting and warm - a solid place to enjoy a happy hour. When it was very busy though, I felt the noise level to be too high which is a common complaint nowadays in many restaurants but one that still bugs me when it affects my ability to actually understand what my friend sitting next to me is saying. The second time was much more enjoyable.  Drinks options are plenty at L'Gros Luxe. Bourbon lemonade by the pitcher is available and while the price point is cheaper than many others restaurants around, personally I found it to be a little light on the bourbon and more of the sweet side of things. The ladies with me enjoyed it that way... me not as much. I did however enjoy their Sud Ouest Lemonade - a mixture of Ungava gin, white beer, simple syrup and lemon juice. This was a better balance of sweet and strong.  The other staple of l'Gros Luxe drink wise is their Caesars. I hate caesars so it's not my thing but each one is quite large and also topped with a variety of food items. When your caesar comes with onion rings and a fried pickle on top, I can imagine it being worthwhile.  Foodwise, L'Gros Luxe is an odd mixture of items that I guess you would characterize as bar food but frankly it runs the gamut from tacos, salads, burgers, poutines, etc. I was able to try a variety of items over my two visits. The appetizers I had were up and down. First was the nachos - topped with black beans, cheese, green onions, marinated jalape√±o slaw, corn and coriander. The size of the plate was nice but the cheese was weirdly only on the under layer and underside of the nachos so most chips had no melted cheese on top of them. When one buys nachos, there is an expectation of cheese on most of the chips. Frankly, that's a pretty easy thing to ensure when you make them. That was not done here which was strange.  The other appetizer was the grilled feta - served with olives, cherry tomatoes, basil, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and bread. Pretty self-explanatory and a solid dish overall. The feta was grilled just enough to make it less salty and a touch softer than normal. We had enough bread to make proper croutons for the entirety of the portion we got.  The poutine is one of their big dishes and very enjoyable. Their classic is made with tater tots! I don't think I'd had tater tots for at least 10 years. Topped with green onions as well as the usual cheese curds and gravy, there are a multitude of extras you can add - be it pulled pork, grounded beef,etc... The pulled pork I added to mine was nice and tender. My friend's version is ground beef and regular fries was solid as well.  One of my friend's tried out their beef burger - served on a shallot bun with siracha mayo and the usual condiments. Good sized burger, cooked nicely through. The bun was light and fluffy but didn't fall apart as it eaten. A solid burger overall.  Finally, I got to try a dessert - deep fried cookie dough served with ice cream, whipped cream and caramel/chocolate sauce. Or at least it was supposed to be served with ice cream. On receiving the dish, we quickly realized that no ice cream was actually present. The problem got solved once we mentioned it to our waitress but still a weird issue. Overall the dessert was good but too much whipped cream compared to the other elements.  L'Gros Luxe was a up-and-down food experience. The items are good - not great - so while the price is reasonable, I still wanted better. Same thing for the drinks. I left after my second visit thinking that L'Gros Luxe's best fit is as a great happy hour or drink spot. Not sure a full dinner is truly worth it.  Cheers!"}
