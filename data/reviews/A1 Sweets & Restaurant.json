{"text":"Food is too greasy! Samosas used to be good, but looks like the owner is trying to reduce quality ingredients in order to save money!  Come on Vikas!"}
{"text":"The worst possible Indian food that you can get. Even the cheapest Indian restaurant in Brampton has better food. Will never ever go again."}
{"text":"They have some of the best samosas I have ever had. Served fresh. Good prices and friendly service. Recommended."}
{"text":"Service is OK.  Not very friendly.  Food is decent and reliable.  Relatively clean.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years since my friends from school first brought me here and every now and then when i get reminiscent of my trip to india I pop in. The food is always excellent, great variety and always has great service. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic indian cuisine, they won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is one of the best vegetarian Indian restaurant! Tasty and affordable. The sweets look very delicious as well. The pakoras are amazing. I would eat here at least twice a week if I live nearby."}
{"text":"Serendipity... from California Burrito... what?    One night after work, I had a craving for some Mexican food and stumbled upon California Burrito.  Coming from California myself, I had to give this place a try.  But what I didn't realize was that California Burrito apparently is on California time and was closed before 8 on a weeknight.  LAME!  So I decided to give A1 Sweets a try.  Like other reviewers mentioned, there are about 8-10 cafeteria bins of vegetarian Indian food.  I chose the Paneer Tikki Masala (nuclear orange colored - like butter chicken but w/ cheese) and the Aloo Gobi (orange potato-y stew - spicy potatoes and cauliflower).  Both were super tasty and had more that home cooked quality that results from cooking in smaller quantities.   Entree came with rice and roti and was more than plenty of food for a single person, I think the Thali plate could probably feed two.  Oh yeah, can any Yelpers here take a camera pic and label the entrees for the rest of us?  That would be amazing!"}
{"text":"Parents order the thali from here commonly. Around $15 for 2...takeout only. Simple food, tastes alright. The dahi vada isn't good. They have buffet options around $10-12.  Oh Bombay has better food, but for  vegetarian choice A1 is there."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since it opened. The owners are hard working individuals who take pride in the quality food they provide. The food taste good and is at great value. The customer  service is amazing. The server are always willing to explain what each food is made of or always have something new. Overall a great place to get something quick to eat at a great value."}
{"text":"We keep having cravings on Mondays, and then realize they're closed on Mondays after driving up!   Came on a Sunday at 8pm.  Service was incredibly slow.   They had one speed.... Very very slow....  We waited over 15 minutes after paying to get our Thalis.  As for the food... It's usually consistently good.  Except tonight the kadi pakora was rock hard although the sauce was fine.  Same with the malai kofta.  Not quite soft.  Roti and naan that comes with the thali is always light and fluffy and fresh."}
{"text":"Sat here had a meal after a long time. The last time we sat there was when A1 would let customers buy a Thali and let you eat at the restaurant. From the time they started buffet we just do takeout.   So this time we took 2 two item combos and 1 one item combo with a Samosa Chaat. This not only prevents us from eating mindlessly but also eat as soon as it served rather than eat at home within containers and also perhaps be a little more economical.   The family had Palak Paneer and Malai Kofta, a Mixed Vegetables and Mutter Paneer and the third one with just Cumin Potatoes (one of the four item that is marked as Vegan) The 2 two item were with Naans and the one item with Rotis without butter to make it vegan. The Samosa Chaat also without the Green Spicy Chutney as it has yogurt to make it Vegan. The Cumin Potatoes were too dry to eat and gets to you after a couple of bites. Will stick Chole or Daal the next time.   The items fresh and perfectly spiced - not too spicy and not overly seasoned as many Indian Restaurants are. The naans were soft and hot. The way family likes it. The Rotis came out nice and hot and were soft.  Did we like the food, sure. Did we save some money? A bit. Could have paid a few extra dollars and had a larger variety of food, however on the downside would have gained a couple of pounds and regretted at night. Overall I am glad we ate what we did."}
{"text":"Visited this place during a recent trip to Toronto (stayed at Oakville Holiday Inn) and were craving Indian food. We were pleasantly surprised at the options at the buffet and great tasting food. We recommend the Rasmalai that is sold separately. The staff were very friendly. The only drawback was that we had to pay cash or debit card - no big deal if you know this before going."}
{"text":"Really bad experience at this location. The food was stale and the staff were busy chatting amongst themselves. Not interested on waiting on the customers or taking orders. The samosas were stale, and we fell sick after eating. Dont recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for  years. If your interested in authentic, vegetarian Indian eats, this the place to be. The food is tasty and consitant. And Yes. It does get busy, so sometimes the wait time gets a bit long, but it's worth.  Love it. Keep up the good work A1."}
{"text":"I was here during lunch hours on a Saturday and found the place quite crowded. The folks seemed to be unclear about how to manage stuff efficiently and the service gets slow. The food is good - they have have chaats as well as the buffet and there are several options. The prices are reasonable and that draws the crowd to the place. Seems like they have a constant flow of regular customers and don't care to address the service issue. Overall, it's a good place if you are wanting Indian vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie samosas and ended up getting a fresh batch! Samosas were well made with tasty potato filling and not those samosas you get where it's 80% dough and 20% filling. Got 30 samosas for $22. Waited 15 minutes but worth it since we got freshly fried ones. Would like to come back and try their other menu items."}
{"text":"We started going to this restaurant about two yeard ago for Saturday or Sunday for Gobi Prantha breakfast special. Pranthas were made with TLC with all the typical spices, ginger corriender eyc. The Gobi stuffing was plentiful. One Prantha with yogurt would leave you totally satisfied Alas! Like most Indian Restaurants, success usually leads to quality deterioration and significant increase in prices. Pranthas are half the size and about 50% more expensive.  Last time we went, there was no ginger or corriender in Pranthas. But still their vege buffet  is pretty good."}
{"text":"Food appears to be good, tastes ok,  BUT it definitely is stale, the take out I took has given me food poisoning... Please stay away from this joint.."}
{"text":"Excellent punjabi food. And more importantly, its not expensive at all. You can have a nice punjabi meal in the price of a sub!"}
{"text":"I went to A1 Sweets recently with my brother. We were craving paranthas so this was the only choice we had in Oakville.   I have been here before for their samosas and they are really good. Although this time the quality of food was very disappointing. We ordered Aloo and Mixed Paranthas; both with medium level of spices. Aloo Paranthas tasted like they had only put boiled potatoes (aloo) in them and nothing else. There was no flavour at all. On the other hand, mixed parantha didn't had anything in it other than way too many spices. We ordered Mango Lassi as well which was supposed to be discounted as part of a meal (written on the menu) but they refused to do so and it was $5 each again with disappointing quality and quantity.  As long as service goes, it has been bad both times. Expect to be ignored and served slowly if you decide to visit this place.   Tip to the owner: You have a wonderful opportunity to make it a Indian food hub since it is at a good location with no other Indian places nearby. I wouldn't mind paying more than what I pay in Brampton if the quality is good. But the last visit made me determined to never go back."}
{"text":"Great quality and quantity of food for unbelievable prices. Consistent taste and awesome service. Been coming here since they have opened and hope they sooon open location near mee tooooo"}
