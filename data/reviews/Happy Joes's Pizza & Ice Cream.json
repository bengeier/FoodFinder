{"text":"Frozen Pizzas for A LOT more $...  Extremely disappointing!
Mostly canned, pre-made, nothing fresh.  Still took 30 minutes to make. 
If you have a craving for really low quality pizza, buy a Tottino's and save your self the $ and the wait.
BOOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"The Pizza Gods have blessed us today.   Thank you for closing down!  


One and done.  Tried it once and never went back.    If I could give zero stars, I would have definitely given what was deserved."}
{"text":"OMG I'm so happy that Happy Joe's has found its way from the Quad Cities to Arizona!!  Hallelujah!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Midwest pizza place. So glad it's here in AZ, the Taco pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"A previous review said that you can't compare this place to Nello's - that's for sure!  Nothing in this place, except the decor, resembles the old Nellos.  This place is only suitable for kids, like Peter Piper Pizza.  (without the entertainment)  We just had the lunch buffet - about all I can say is it's edible.  The pizza selections were not my favorites, and were lukewarm.  The \"famous\" taco pizza is gross.  The pasta was cold.  The meatballs were OK - but they had BBQ sauce on them so they were better than the pizza.  We will be looking for a new pizza place.  We didn't want to even try the desserts.  However, I must say that the service was good, and that's why it gets at least one star."}
{"text":"Incredibly understaffed. It took an hour to be seated and be given menus.... when there weren't many people at all.... outrageous. There was only one waitress as the lunch rush came in and everything was an absolute disaster... never again."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, however they seem to have hiccups with online orders.  I had ordered online but when I went in to pick my order up, they didn't have it in their system."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS AMAZING! Jennifer was very attentive, had a fun attitude and let me know about all the \"freebies\" they offer when you sign up for their rewards program. Tried their taco pizza (their specialty) and it was pretty good. The friendly people really made my day though. They're opening up the pizza buffet soon!"}
{"text":"Service was good but pizza was awful...dry, scant toppings & it took forever to arrive.  I'm missing Nello's already."}
{"text":"This place was great. We came a little later and there was only other person inside, but we were daring and still gave it a shot. We order an order of cheese sticks and a medium half/half original crust. The cheese sticks were out relatively quick, but the pizza took a little longer than I would have expected for no other customers (but not bad enough for us to really have an issue). Our server was very nice and attentive (didn't catch his name). Good little joint, I'd come back. Plus free Sunday's are ALWAYS good."}
{"text":"By accident I found a long time favorite of mine from 20 years ago when I lived in Iowa.  This would be Happy Joe's.  Right in my own backyard.  I loved their lunch buffet and their Taco Pizza was awesome.  So Sunday we ordered a Taco Joe pizza and brought it home with us.  I'll be damned that nothing has changed.  Everything was as good as I remembered,  Why is it so hard to get a taco pizza in Arizona?  Seriously folks.  I will be back for more and even try their lunch buffet.  The only gripe I had was the price.  $27 for a large 15\" taco pizza is steep.  This won't be my go to pizza because of the price but I will treat myself every once in a while."}
{"text":"I will not be back. Went for the lunch buffet and nothing was fresh. It was worse than Cicis, worse than Peter Piper."}
{"text":"Two words.....taco pizza! Well, in my case, 4 words...taco pizza no meat lol. It's delicious! I'm so glad Happy Joe's has made it to the valley for us Midwesterners. The owner stopped by our table and you can tell he is passionate and cares for his customers' experience. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything is good. Good service!!! Taco pizza and Canadian bacon are my favorites!!! So happy they're in Tempe!!!"}
{"text":"WOW PLEASE READ ALL OF THE REVIEWS ON LINE PLEASE! 
This new restaurant is located in the old Nello's location on Southern.  People either love it or hate it. We were one of two tables when we sat down. Very \"happy\" hostess/server/bartender arrived right away and sat us in a booth by an extremely dirty window. We ordered two sodas. We needed time to look at the over priced menu. Flagged the server down who was nice but had no idea of what she was doing. We ordered small pizza and sandwich fifteen minutes after we ordered the two sodas which still had not arrived. Two more tables were seated next to us. About 20 minutes later we noticed both tables had received their orders. We again flagged down server who told us that our food was pushed behind a large group that had come in after us in a party room. Ah those two tables also came in after us?  Again one server for the whole restaurant?  Why not stop at our table and explain that to us?  Eventually the pepperoni pizza arrives.. Lots of super thin pepperoni, and crisp like I like it.  Two bites and I sensed it might be a frozen pie from the local grocery store.  Unbelievably bad. Wife couldn't eat it.

Finally 5-10 minutes later the sandwich arrived, not much better. Came with a tiny cup of \"beef broth\" for dipping. No way dry sandwich could fit into the cup. Wife took a couple bites and gave it back to me.  I took a bite and she looked at me with a shocked look and said stop. She reached across and pulled a hair out of the food in my mouth.  You guessed it, we flagged the server down and showed her the hair now on the plate. She immediately took it away. As she was walking away both of the two neighboring tables called her over as there orders were wrong.

After another long absence the server returned to inform us that we wouldn't be charged for the sandwich with the hair. After another 15 minutes the check finally arrived and we paid for the pizza and two drinks and left. 

Interesting as we were leaving a woman came out of the kitchen and came into dining area. Other than that the only other employees I saw was a kid who might have been 10-12 years old walking in and out of the kitchen. Sorry but we won't be back and once again PLEASE READ ALL REVIEWS ON LINE!"}
{"text":"Strike out. We gave this place a try after reading Yelp reviews about their Taco Pizza. It was sad! Everything was sad. The menu prices were sad. The pizza was super sad. I even think the employees were sad. Taco pizza is nothing to write home about, I would expect to see it on Jack In The Box's value menu next to their funnel cake. 
I think this place originated in Indiana were they might have a chance of tricking people into thinking this is good pizza. Well I got news for you, you can't trick us, we're from the land of Oreganos and Neilos. Nice try.
P.S. My wife liked the bbq pizza. But she also likes Papa Johns."}
{"text":"As I indicated they won't last long! As someone else indicated the Pizza Gods took action and they are now closed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service 
Quality of food so so
Basicly, when i was told its taking so ling due to the fact that the cooking staff was new ... i knew i was doomed. 
Sorry was hoping for something good. This wasnt it."}
{"text":"Their taco pizza is a must-try. This pie was wildly popular in the Midwest, where the company originates, but surprisingly is hard to find here in Arizona. Well, thanks to Happy Joes, it's here. Now this location isn't as clean looking as the Gilbert location, but the staff are pretty accommodating. The pizza is huge, and you may have leftovers for a few days (although much better fresh)."}
{"text":"Ordered a Taco pizza, we are from Iowa and grew up with this pizza. The waitress came out and said they accidentally put sour cream on it , we said that's ok we would still take it. Pizza came out cold and boneless wings were frozen and not what you would ever expect at a pizza joint. Terrible experience all the way around. Girl that worked there was more concerned about people in the back and at the bar and going to ride her horse. Terrible experience and will never be back. Joe Whitty would be ashamed of this establishment !!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are great- I get the Hawaiian pizza.  I've had 4 networking events here and the service was fabulous. Love Melissa:) The last time I was there though it took a lot longer to get the food than normal. Overall, food quality is good for the price."}
{"text":"It wouldn't be fair to compare this place to the former Nello's so I wont.

What you find here is casual Pizza Parlor with shakes and sundaes. It's a family place so it's real loud. 

I'm a pizza snob, and it's not that kind of pizza. we had a Taco Pizza, it was highly recommended and The Combo pie, and started with a really average Caesar salad. The pizzas we got were what I expected from a chain like Happy Joes. It reminded me of Round Table Pizza and I always liked them.

Bring the kids but beware of the enevitable sugar rush, cause you wont be able to get out without having some ice cream."}
{"text":"Underwhelming....and over priced for what it is.  On the phone the staff was helpful at the to-go counter they were less....helpful. I went in and added a salad to my to-go order.  When it was given to me with the mushrooms that I asked to be removed, the counter guy went in the kitchen and asked every employees if they wanted my salad. I mean hello, I'm standing right here waiting for you to make me a new salad minus mushrooms. Super frustrating for a premixed iceberg lettuce salad for $6.99. And they burned my boneless chicken wings.  Ehhh ....I'd rather order nasty PapaJohns across them street then order here again."}
{"text":"I hate to write harsh reviews. But I almost feel I have to because my experience today at this establishment. We had never been in since the place opened, so we decided to try their lunch buffet today. Upon walking up to the buffet bar I noticed that there wasn't too many selections to choose from. I tried the pizza and I also tried the barbecue wings. The pizza tasted like a frozen red Baron or tombstone pizza that you were getting the frozen food section at the grocery store. The The barbecue wings tasted like they came out of a frozen bag of Tyson chicken wings and thrown in the microwave. But to disguise it, they totally submerged them in barbecue sauce. My wife tried the world famous taco pizza. She was doing after just one bite. There was a concoction that look like tater tot'scovered in some kind of cheesy sauce with a hint of diced chicken. It too was not that tasty. If you've ever been to that restaurant where you sat down and took a bite only to second-guess yourself on why you came there in the first place, this was that place. I'm only doing the review to help people stay away from this place. But if you must; feel free to try it like I did and you be the judge."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon. Very large place. Wasn't busy at all with 4 tables being full. Quick service and got me seated with a root beer quickly. They do serve alcohol. I ordered a Little Joe Taco Joe Pizza. The place was very clean and the temp was perfect. The good do some repair on some of the seats is a small complaint. Baseball was on the TV in front of me and country/pop played overhead. There is plenty of parking here. The decor is great with neon beer signs up everywhere and tasteful paintings up on the walls.  They do have a quick carry out service available and delivery. The pizza was very good and I made some good talk with my server who was very nice. This place is definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Great people great food .. a must try the TACO pizza amazing  !!!!!! Met the founders son great guy this place brought  back memories  love it ..."}
{"text":"Shitty food! Pesto pizza isn't the same it's so sad. We were kicked out one night around 9 & one of the workers cussed out my brother! Terrible. Never again"}
{"text":"Tempe location is CLOSED. It's great to have Happy Joe's in the Valley of the Sun! We tried the Tempe location. Our server Tyler was amazing! Very accommodating to diet restrictions and so fun. Happy Joe's is careful to keep their pizza sauce the same as in their Iowa base. Recommend overhaul on the restroom decor and consider putting in an ice cream parlor that kids and big kids will be drawn to as in Iowa. We'll be back, Gluten free crust available."}
{"text":"Hadn't tried Happy Joe's Pizza since Nellos went out of business summer of 2016.  We received  some coupons in the mail and decided to try a large combo pizza for takeout.  I went in on a Monday around 7:30ish and the restaurant was completely empty.  This could be due to it being a Monday (Nellos was closed Mondays) but I've noticed the parking lot to be rather sparse even during the week and weekends.  Anyway, brought pizza home and right away realized this pizza can't be compared to traditional NY or Chicago pies.  It had cheddar cheese in addition to mozzarella, large chunks of onion, green pepper and small nuggets of sausage.  There is something missing here though; the interplay of all the various toppings complementing each other.  There just wasn't a lot of flavor bursting from each slice.  I used to love Nellos sausage which had a good amount of fennel, here the sausage seems to be Owens country sausage.  I've never been to Iowa (and probably will never go) but if this pizza is indicative of local flavor and cuisine, then there is a lot to be desired.  I think we'll stick with Spinatos, Oregano's or Red Devil."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it.  Who wouldn't want to with a name like Happy Joe's? But this visit was far from happy.  I should have realized what we were about to experience by the lack of other folks.  The tator tots were soggy.  The pretzels were the only redemptive option we tried.  We ordered salads which were pathetic. I ordered an antipasto salad that had 6 olives, weird chopped meat and carrot and celery sticks.  They don't have an Italian dressing just balsamic.  Then came pizza.  Which was terrible.  Not nello's that's for sure.  The hubby got Alfredo which was a giant lump of overcooked glue.  It was all very sad and I'm sure we all left hungry."}
{"text":"I'll first start by saying we went here just to compare it to the old Nello's which it recently replaced. The old Nello's was a family favorite dating back to the 90's. I thought I'd be more skeptical, but I was just hungry and had a craving for pizza. To start the pizza was very good, and the deep dish crust was even Nello's-esque. In fact the \"pizza sticks\" appetizer we got was nothing short of a direct replica of the old \"pizza crust\" app. Although the new app can be ordered in three sizes which couldn't be done with the old app. If it sounds like I'm comparing the two heavily, it's probably because the restaurant is still nearly identical to the old one. Most of the same sports memorabilia is still hanging exactly where it was, all the tables and booths are the same billiards green tables left behind. You can't help feel like you're in the twilight zone, everything looks and feels the exact same, but it's not, it's Happy Joes now. So if you can get over that strange feeling of being somewhere the same but different then you'll have a tasty pizza, prepared well with quality toppings, friendly service, and a yummy sundae to top it all off. The only negative I noticed was the servers didn't seem to clear the table until after you left, so at the end of the meal, we had a messy table that we had to maneuver around when boxing up leftovers and signing the check. It would've been much appreciated to have the table cleared right away, but other than that I have to say I was impressed, even when I assumed I couldn't be."}
{"text":"The Canadian bacon with sauerkraut pizza is amazing! Their sundaes are mighty tasty too. We had excellent service and a really good time. We will be back."}
{"text":"\"Going to Happy Joe's is like going to Disneyland...always magical.\"

At least that's what the sign at the hostess stand said. Our actual experience? It wasn't bad!

We started off with a small order of Cheese Sticks. It was buttery, garlicky, super cheesy and hard to put down. The amount of cheese drag is decent. The marina that comes with it has a sweet taste to it. They were pretty good! But alas, before I could even think of devouring a third cheese stick, our BBQ Joe with chicken pizza in the original deep dish was set before our eyes. First impression? It certainly didn't look like a deep dish! And after the first bite, I was so overwhelmed with the taste of BBQ sauce. It was a solid pizza with an even more solid crust. That stuff stayed crunchy and never got soggy. It still held its stiffness in the \"cold pizza\" taste test. Try not to compare this place to other more authentic deep dish joints around town to avoid being disappointed. The product itself was decent. The medium was plenty for the two of us. As for the free sundae they had given us? It was a standard sundae. Who can be mad about that? 

I think I want to try their infamous taco pizza they heavily advertise in my next visit. Service was great and the place was clean. They keep it pretty cold in here so bring a light jacket if you're like me. All in all, it was a decent place for a slice of pie!"}
