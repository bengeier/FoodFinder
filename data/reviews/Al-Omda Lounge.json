{"text":"Feels just Like food cooked at home. Amazing taste. And you can play cards provided by them or bring your laptop"}
{"text":"Al Omda is by the best Shisha place I have ever been to. Customer service is unreal. For me and my best friend this place feels like home. We come here almost everyday after work.
I would highly recommend this place. The owner Luther is the best host you've ever met. He comes and chit chats with us. Amazingg you should definitely come try it out."}
{"text":"This place is in a weird location as it is in an industrial area. But never the less its always, always busy. No matter what day, after 9-10pm you'll be waiting for a table. And for good reason as the shisha here is super affordable averaging under $10 a pop.

Food is pretty good as well, they offer a variety of beverages, smoothies etc. Great place to study or play Fifa (they have a ps4 with tv) hang with friends. Wouldn't recommend bringing a date here as it is a sausage fest lol. A lot of regulars who come everyday (older Arabic men) they also play Arabic music.

All in all great place to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"This here is a hidden gem! located in a far industrial lands of Mississauga! I was out and about with the some yelpers at our high-end supper club Cambodian experience and we decided to enjoy some shisha. 

One of the yelper brought us here and Wow the place was packed and people seem to be enjoying and having a good time. 

We were seated we started to order and all of us good our own shishas... Various flavours all good but one of us had Pineapple and Coconut mix which was a killer as I had never tired that. I myself had watermelon and it was nice as well. There Shisha material base is big and they top it up so the who shisha lasts long. I did about 3 servings of 2 coals and it was still good to smoke. The have both the original coals and the fast running ones. 

The service here is up notch multiple staff and Luther (owner) himself came to check if everything was good and they cleaned our shisha and put on more coals. The service was quite fast when compared to other middle eastern similar places. 

The place has a lot of parking and seating inside. The seating includes booths as well as open tables. The place is designed nice as it used to be a sushi joint before. I saw a lot of people playing domino's so I am assuming they have it in house. The also had a PlayStation base as well as very high speed free wifi. The also have TV which were playing sports.

There food menu was quiet good and reasonably priced but as we eat already I didn't had anything but we did try desserts. 

First off we had \"kunafa\" - I would say a Middle East's version of a cheese cake. the cheese is mild, stretchy and white and topped up with rich semolina pastry, all of it soaked in sweet rosewater syrup. This here was made fresh, hot and delicious. I have had this before and the keep to success is not to make to toooo rubbery and this was perfect. 

Then followed another dessert my buddy described it as \"rooz laban\" practically it was rice pudding topped with lot of crushed nuts and cinnamon powdered.  Which was very good. I didn't know cinnamon went with that so well. 

Overall the whole experience (service, easy on the pocket, products) were excellent. 

For my Muslim brother and sisters - There menu for food stated Halal on the top."}
{"text":"Wow. Last night a group of us decided to venture to the Mississauga/Oakville border just off of Dundas near the 403 for some after dinner shisha, and boy was it ever worth the trip. Al-Omda is tucked away in an industrial plaza so you'll need to keep an eye open or you may miss it. 

I'll start by saying, top to bottom, this is far and away, the best Hookah Lounge around. In fact the experience overall was so good that I plan to lower all my previous hookah lounge reviews down a star now that I know how good it can be.

To start each of us ordered out own hookah pipe with unique flavours - I've never done this before as to me Hookah/shisha was always a shared thing amongst friends, but now that I've done it this way, I'll never share again.. EVER. One of the guys in our group went for a special shisha which came with Pineapple and Coconut as well as a ice chamber around the base to cool his smoke. I was instantly jealous of this and asked if there was anything that could be done to cool my smoke... absolutely. they quickly went to the back and swapped out my hose for one with a frozen head (that resembled some sort of missile) that instantly changed the quality of my shisha experience by 1000%.

The service for the shisha is unmatched, compared to anywhere I have been before. not only did numerous servers stop by to check on us, but both owner, manager and chef from the kitchen. They really take customer service to the next level! In fact this was the first and only time that when the smoke got too harsh that a lounge employee actually serviced my hookah by removing the bowl, blowing backwards into it to clear the impurities before lightly rapping the bowl to move the cooked and uncooked shisha around. The minute he put it back down it was like a brand new bowl. Incredible.

Having already eaten I only briefly looked over their menu and noticed that their selection of (halal friendly) sandwiches which ranged from a Chicken Zinger to a Philly cheesesteak ranged in price from $5-10. While not ordering food I did have a mint tea which I learned was made from the authentic Lipton tea bags from Egypt (those who know the difference will understand what this means in terms of flavour and strength). The tea came in a massive mug and garnished with fresh mint leaves. It was fantastic with no chalky aftertaste.

Eventually we did get a little peckish and ended up ordering some sharable dessert items which were unbelievable! The first, and excuse my ignorance for not getting the name right, was phonetically called Konafa. This was sort of like a middle eastern dessert pizza made with cheese, pistachios and an assortment of sweet toppings that were, in short, a delight to put in my mouth!

Following the dessert cheese pizza we got to try traditional warmed rice pudding, which was amazing as well. I really enjoyed the pistachios and cinnamon on top! Yum!!

One of the best things about this place was the prices. For the shisha and tea it was only $12 and change all in, I was shocked!

This place might be a tad hidden and out of the way for some, but those who can get here are lucky, this is an example of a true hidden gem in the 905. But don't tell too many of your friends because it's already super busy, my suggestion is to call ahead and book a table when you're thinking of heading over for a few games of dominos, PS4, board game and a shisha!"}
{"text":"I came here after dinner with a few yelp friends. One of our party is a regular and knew the owners and staff well. 

The Shiaha was excellent, and service was polite. They were very busy and so some things took a little long but I'm told that the custom of Shiaha bars is to be laid back and for things to happen in there own time. 

We had kanaffa, it was extraordinary. 

The wifi is excellent, there are two play stations for your amusement, if you are into that sort of thing.

If you go, be sure to ask for the Shiaha with the ice in the hookah, it's much smoother."}
{"text":"Best place I've ever been. Better than Mazaya. Shisha is AMAZING. Friendly service and a zing cheap food. I would rate the shisha 10/10 the fries 10/10 service 10/10.  Once we walked in we felt welcome and the service was quick. The guy made me try 3 different shisha and got to keep the one I liked. There sandwiches are phenomenal. I would highly recommend everyone to go there. I liked how there shisha is clean. 

I would say this is the place to go too"}
{"text":"Great place to relax in sauga city. Had watermelon mint for my shisha flavour (not my favourite though) as well as a cup of black tea. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"My new hang out spot after work. Come very often. Found this gem 3 weeks ago. I come here to do work, or just to hang out. What earned them a perfect score: Food, hookah, atmosphere, customer service, cleanliness, and price point. 

Food: Their food is always fresh. Great portions. Has a lot of flavor. 
Hookah: Many flavors to choose from. Great price. Pipes are always new. Their hookah lasts for a couple hours. Always coming around with new coal. 
Atmosphere: Everyone here is friendly. Is always live. GREAT WIFI. Never have any issues with their WIFI. Always fast and dependable. They have plugs all over the place. Never had to worry about a place to charge my laptop. 
Customer Service: By the second visit, they have already known me. Make sure you have what you need.
Cleanliness: Everything is clean unlike a lot of hookah places. 
Price: Great prices for everything they offer. You don't sacrifice quality for price here 

Overall: If you want good hookah place, this should definitely be on the top of your list. Word of advice, make reservations if your coming past 8:00pm because they get full."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, their music is not loud. Very friendly staff. A wide variety of Shisha flavours that are prepared very well. Also they have special flavours from time to time. Their food is also good, especially the Shawarma. Good timing, they're open late. They have a video game station for customers too."}
{"text":"Worst Service at Moods introduced us to this hidden GEM!
We were kicked out from moods for not ordering enough food and we were looking for a Sheesha place to go to in the area, came across this on yelp and I have never been to a better sheesha place!

I had two friends with me who have lived in middle east and know their sheesha, they said their sheeshas are really high quality (even though it was the cheapest around).

We also ordered Fries, Mango shake and a brownie, wasn't really expecting it to be good but just something to eat. However, Fries were AMAZING (with best garlic sauce), Mango shake looked really fancy and tasted pretty good and brownie wasn't bad either.

The service, while a little on the slow side, was caring.

Some things that were a little off: Place was very busy on a saturday night so environment got a little cramped.

Lack of women customers, there was no other table other than ours which had a female presence. However, there was a female server, and at no point did we feel uncomfortable or encountered any creepy activity. So while there weren't a lot of a women, i think it's still safe for women to go there."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is how clean and not dingy it is when compared to other hookah bars. Sheesha was good as well, food was decent. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've decided to do a second updated review on this place just to give people a heads up on what to expect of Friday nights and the weekend!

First of all, if your a lady and want to bring your girlfriends here for a night to chill, that's cool but I will warn you that it is 90% all men and mostly on the mature side.

Second, this isn't a place to catch up as you won't be able to hear the other person talk. I feel like it's a yelling competition here and the constant slapping of domino chips on the table.

The other thing that will annoy you as a customer is the restaurant has no control of their seating plan!!!! They will add chairs on a table that can't fit another chair! Which in turn annoys the next table because it gets really tight. When we were about to get seated on a 2 seat table the larger party beside us took the table and joined it with theirs! The owner was such a push over and he had to squeeze another table in the already tight space. 

This last experience really turned me off. 

P.S. they gave me the wrong order of tea."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in this very smokey restaurant for one fruit cocktail while dozens of loud rowdy teenage boys played dominos and cards. And it wasn't even a cocktail like Paramount has, it was just a strawberry and banana smoothie. And it wasn't even good. Are they even allowed to have smoking indoors in Mississauga? Save yourself the trouble, go to Paramount unless you are looking for second (or first) hand lung cancer."}
{"text":"My favourite shisha place in Mississauga. I've been to quite a few but the service and overall environment of Al-Omda keeps me coming back. The staff are very friendly and greet you as soon as you walk in. The shisha flavours are plentiful and only $10. I suggest getting grape-mint, it's my favourite flavour. They also provide you with disposable hookah pipes and if it is available, ask for an ice pipe. The food is also cheap and tasty, french fries are extra crispy. While it can get quite busy at times, the staff do their best to get you seated immediately. Lastly, their kunafa is the best I've ever had, not too sweet and delicious."}
{"text":"Walking in I was glad to be quickly seated and enjoyed to casual middle eastern vibe of the place. I felt like I was going around the corner to hang with the locals. 

Service was a mess. While our shisha came on time, our server (who seemed to be the manager) forgot to bring our simple first order of water and coffee (and repeatedly forgot the cream until we had another person get it).  After asking questions about the menu I settled on a chicken shawarma sandwich...which never came.  Maybe I would have asked about it again, but his interaction with us made me wonder how he could forget such a thing. 

He provided some jokes and even a little magic trick. But in some instances the jokes were a bit much.  Particularly, I was made to feel as if he wanted to fight me as he angrily asked me to stand up from my chair. My friend felt the tension and we were wondering what was going on....only to have him reveal a joke that he was changing my chair. This would be fun if I didn't actually feel threatened for a moment or if I had been getting my orders. Looking around, the food and drinks seemed good.  Wish I knew. 

It was such a poor experience that I can never go back. Tip to the owners: remember simple orders before being an entertainer."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Their sheesha is probably the best in Mississauga because they actually take the time to clean the sheesha's unlike many other spots. The water is always clean and you never hey any filth coming out of the pipes (that's the worst). I have been a regular customer for quite some time now and this has become my new favourite spot. The customer service is always great, the environment is relaxing and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great Shisha & Service. A great place for a hangout. The shisha is unlike many places full of flavour and lasts a long time. They also have 10 different flavours of shisha."}
{"text":"I have had the worst experience at this place. We went around a normal time before it got busy. Placed our orders and the server completely forgot one of the orders. Waited for an hour to get 4/5 orders. No one came to us to ask if we were good. If we needed anything.During the hour wait for the orders. When we got our orders. We were informed then at that time they had no rice. We wanted to be fair so we got fries instead. However, there was one order that was still missing. We waited for 10-minutes to see if it would be coming. So everyone can eat together.  During that time again no one came to our table to see if we were good. Had to go personally to see if our order(Philly cheese steak platter with fries) was placed. They said \"yeah give us a sec.They will come to our table.\" Which they never did. The second time we had to go again to see if the order was coming after 10 minutes. That's when we found out that they just started making the order. Everyone had finished their meals when they finally brought our last order and It was the wrong order.(15 mins)They were so incompetent that they gave us Philly cheese steak sandwich. After more than an hours we got what we didn't place as our order. Another 5 minutes later they bring the platter. We return the sandwich and keep the platter. I personally didn't want the platter at that time but my friends are too kind. So we took the final platter. 

Our final order the Philly platter was not good at all. Let just say it was edible. I don't know if there was something wrong with the cook, the food was not great or decent as it was before. The overall food quality was bad. 

In closing, the bad service delivered by the staff and the food not being great/decent. I will not be returning to this place. There are better joints around the neighbourhood now.

Folks find a different place to go to. I recommend it!  Al omda is no longer the same as it was before back in the days."}
