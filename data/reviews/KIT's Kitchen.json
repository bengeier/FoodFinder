{"text":"My friends took me there for lunch and I must say it was fantastic! The good and service were first class! I ordered salmon eggs Benedict, delish! I'm texting all my friends to go and support this incredible place."}
{"text":"The service and food were excellent!! The croissant with the breakfast sandwich was a perfect buttery flaky texture. The avocado toast meal was equally delicious as well as the potatoes. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how good the breakfast was, considering the low prices. The restaurant was clean and pleasant, lots of light. The service was also excellent. I would definitely return and also recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"You have to eat why not support a cause at the same time. I only wish I'd known before now what KITs mission was. I would have supported it long before.  Our breakfast would match any local breakfast diner, well apart from the price amazing value."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little place. Super great workers and yummy food and drinks. They also have fundraising for children in need. I love to eat here for that reason! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, let me say this up front, Kit's Kitchen is the best kept secret in the Las Vegas Valley. The food is all under $10. Breakfast is $5, dinner is $10. The variety is excellent. The quality is deliciously fantastic.  The service is personal and attentive, and the decor is simple and functional. They have a bar if you're there for dinner, and the choices and different cuisines range from French to Asian, Spanish, and continental (American).  Please give this place a try, you'll be glad you did. We go for breakfast on Saturday mornings, and have done dinner once; the bread pudding is the best I've had in the valley. Also note, the restaurant is supporting a fantastic cause with their profits.  It's my new place to take friends and not go broke over a meal."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is incredibly slow and forgetful.  We love the charitable aspect so we keep coming back."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and it is ALWAYS fantastic! Food is excellent every time, service is spot on, and the prices, unbeatable! If all this weren't enough, KIT stands for Kids In Transition, AMAZING organization! Do yourself a favor, eat there.....often!  Oh, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since it was CB Legacy. The owner had past away a few years ago and since then the restaurant workers and friends have worked hard to keep this place alive. They now bring you Kits Kitchen serving some of the CB's finest recipes!  DRINK: Alcohol is always a great option, but I highly recommend the Virgin Sangria to those who don't drink. The drink is fresh crafted and is super delicious. They have a wide variety of basic beverages as well.  FOOD: First look at the menu, many believe that this place doesn't have anything for them to eat. My advice, be adventurous and try their original recipes! I have been here so many times over the years and have not had a single bad dish. I highly recommend the Escargot Belle Epoque! I am not a fan of snails, but I will order it here every time. It has a delicious sauce and it pairs perfectly with their garlic bread. For breakfast, their Quiche is amazing and fresh made, either one is good depending on what you want in it. For lunch and dinner, their entrees are all great. I highly recommend their steak or fish dishes:)  ATMOSPHERE: Love the workers, they are all super friendly. If you get the chance, talk to them about the history of the place. It's actually really interesting! The setting of the place changes everytime I go, but it's nice how everything is set up.  Wish this restaurant the best because I absolutely love it here!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!! Great menu International. American. Mexican. Asian!!!!!! The staff was wonderful   Vegan menus coming soon!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was amazing!! Everything under $10 and it is so good!!! This is a non profit restaurant and everyone is volunteer but omg I would pay way more for the quality of the food! Definitely recommend! They also have a full bar!!"}
{"text":"Went today with a large group of ladies and service and food was great. Had a quiche topped with what look like bechamel sauce. It was very high, with a beautiful browned crust that had a slightly sweet taste that was fabulous, probably the best quiche ever. I was not happy about the bechamel sauce, did not add anything to meal, but oh, that quiche was so flavorful. The service, for a non profit restaurant was as good as a five star, very attentive and accommodating which is quite a trick for so many ladies with lots of requests  Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the prices unbelievably low. It's now a non-profit restaurant. They have kept the extensive variety and the 1st class quality, just dropped the prices to be very affordable. I highly recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"Tried out out on Friday, the 3rd of December. This restaurant is located where Bernard's and then Bernard's Legacy was located. It's a tough spot to do well, and there have been numerous restaurants, and even a teen night club, in the same location.  They are a Charity based enterprise, and have a 501 tax number. That said, most of their \"staff\" is volunteer. I'm not sure whether some are young people from the Charity.  I saw no dinner menu, even though they advertise Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. ALL breakfasts are $4 and ALL lunches are $6. My sister had the Chicken Wrap and I had the hamburger. Both were excellent. Hers came with chips (nah), but mine came with very tasty, hot, and lightly seasoned fries. These items were much better than those being served in other restaurants and twice the price. Service? iffy at best. It reminded me of one of those training exercises on Top Chef. That said, I'd go again. All monies after the menu price plus tax goes to the charity. I left 2 tens, plus a buck to cover the tax: all the green I had at the time.  I am truly hoping that this is on the up and up, and not just a scam...it IS Las Vegas, after all."}
{"text":"2.5 stars really. It was very basic food. Frozen fries. No flavor in the burrito. But I guess whatdya want for $10? The service was good and quick. The space was cute enough; odd that there was no ambient music on so it felt kinda quiet and unwelcoming. Have a nice looking patio. There were paper and crayons on the table, so that was fun. The logo is hard to read--too small and busy, hard to see from the street. Great concept however that I want to support."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices.  Nice staff (all volunteers) and seating outside where you can bring your dogs :)  Very good value and a good cause. Try it !"}
{"text":"KIT's Kitchen is a nonprofit run entirely by volunteers- prices are low and go directly towards helping local youth via collaboration of schools and community organizations. What's not to love?!  Breakfast dishes are $5 and lunches are $6, allowing families to dine out together without taking out a second mortgage. Dishes are standard diner-style fare, with some standouts including the chicken and biscuits with gravy and the buffalo wings. Food may not win any awards,  but is freshly made and the restaurant itself is very clean- dine on the patio if the weather is nice.  Rumor has it that KIT's Kitchen has an awesome dinner menu- I'll have to come back again soon. I was bummed to see the previous businesses in this spot close (Bernard's Bistro, then CB's Legacy), but happy to see they've been replaced by a business doing real good in our community."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  It's a charitable organization.  1.  The food was excellent. 2.  The service was perfect! 3.  The prices are incredible!  It's not a fancy place - very casual.  We are brunch (see my photos) and thoroughly enjoyed every bite!  There is loads of free parking and they play happy music!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the concept of this business. There is a large outdoor patio.  However, we ate inside.  The restaurant was not busy at all we were there at 11:30 it was a bit cool in the restaurant and the manager came over to our table and lowered the air conditioning so that we could be comfortable I ordered two items the first item that I ordered was there beet salad and it was absolutely fresh and absolutely delicious attending included candied walnuts goat cheese fresh beets and greens the other item I ordered was a vegetable scramble it came with two orange slices all those good veggies scrambled with eggs and it was also very good"}
{"text":"**updated review Feb 2017** I've been here a handful of times now and there are a few hiccups that are constant. The service is awkward at best. One man in particular is not very friendly and he isn't helpful about the menu items. He also stands to the side and watches you eat to see when he should come by to get your plates. I feel a little uncomfortable eating while somebody is standing across the way staring at me.  The other thing is that the inside of this restaurant smells weird, I don't know if it's sewage or a particular chemical they use to clean the inside of the place but it smells really bad. Kind of hard to have an appetite when you're in a place that reeks. I do want to support this good cause, but if they could get their staff more properly trained in addition to the stench gone that would be really good.  ********************  I love this place and I love the concept! Eating and giving to those in need are two of my favorite things! I see so many cool places pop up and then vanish in this town...I truly hope this place makes it for a loooooong time!  Tim the chef came out and talked to me about custom making me a vegan meal, I was craving a veggie sammich and he made me an amazing one!  Prices are so reasonable. Restaurant has a caf√© type vibe to it, is clean and simple inside. Their brunch menu looks pretty dang cool too. This may become a staple in my dining out rotation."}
{"text":"I had a meatball spaghetti. The food was ok but the server seemed to be too busy to get me a table. There were two tables. I stood there for a while and I asked him if I can sit any table I want. He just pointed out somewhere I don't know. I don't want to leave a bad review but my experience was like that."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I've eaten at every restaurant that has been in this location over the last fifteen years. This location seems to be cursed and doomed for failure, but I think Kit's Kitchen stands a chance for survival.   What I liked: the food quality, the presentation and the concept of the restaurant. I also liked the pricing, but I think they're doing themselves a disservice by not charging more on some items. There's not a single item over $10 on the dinner menu which makes it great for large parties.  What I didn't like: slow service, which was inexcusable considering the place had eight customers total including my party. I was also overwhelmed by their menu. Way too many items (probably 60+ items?) and no real sense of organization to the list.   Overall, I liked my meal enough that I think I'll come back and try their $3 breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food, super affordable, lovely atmosphere, and the feeling of knowing you're making a difference in the lives of local youth by giving back to the community. I'm so glad I finally tried this place out. Now I know I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and it's really delicious!  They have a wonderful concept in that they have a mission to guide and develop positive influences to underprivileged kids and teens.  The food is great; they have scrumptious avocado rolls that we devoured in seconds and I tried the cannelloni for dinner which is made with braised beef in a Cabernet sauce that is wonderful. The greatest part?  Besides the food (and our server was very kind too!) the prices are out of this world!! The highest price dinner is $10.00 and they have breakfast and lunch in the $5.00-7.00 range.  Wow!!!  Give this place a try it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I admire what they are doing as  a company, with that written, their food is horrible. Yes their prices are great,  but even for that amount of money, I expect better than subpar food. It shows in the ingredients. You also have to flag down the waiters/waitresses before they even acknowledge you when you come in for take out because they are all hanging out at the bar talking to each other. I finally got the attention of a chef before he ran into the back room by yelling at him and he reluctantly took my order. I have had six dinners here so far hoping that everyone would be better than the last, I have been sadly disappointed every single time. I guess this location really is cursed. P.S. The food at the last named location at this place was absolutely wonderful, sad they couldn't keep on going with the CB's Legacy."}
{"text":"Omg!  Great food, service and prices!!  Highly recommend and it goes to community charities!!  One of the best deals in town!!"}
{"text":"All the feels!  Love the idea behind this place, it's an NPO with most of its workers being volunteers and/or local highschool kids learning the ropes of the restaurant biz. There's also a small thrift shop located on one side of the restaurant, so get a meal while getting styled out.  KIT's Kitchen has a solid diner vibe, with nothing fancy, no frills just straight forward breakfast options offered here, great spot for the rents. I went with the eggs Benedict, it had a rich creamy hollandaise sauce, perfectly poacher eggs and breakfast taters, what else do you need?   Don't come here looking for that popping brunch spot, come here to support the community and load up on warm and fuzzies.   Eat, donate, earn karma."}
{"text":"We love this place! We have driven by many times and had no idea how wonderful it is. The food is delicious and well presented, the servers (all volunteers!) are great, the decor is very nice and the prices are amazingly affordable! There is a bar inside, some tables outside and they have recently started a Sunday jazz dinner from 6-9pm which was fun!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Not only is it for  great cause, but the food is really good and extremely affordable. Last time we went in there, they were all donating their time.. and the food cost only whatever donation you chose to give!  I cant wait to go back. Great local place."}
{"text":"Amazing. The fastest service and the food is just to die for. I got the hangover hash and it was amazing. Our waiter told us that they just recently updated the menu and raised prices slightly in order to give more back to the Kit Foundation. I love his place. Will be back again. We need more restaurants with a good mission and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here with a friend because she saw the good reviews for their brunch and we figured their dinner menu must be good as well. Upon entry we were greeted by a very polite worker and quickly seated at a booth.   I ended up ordering the shrimp scampi since it sounded really good and was highly recommended by the waitress. The dish itself was alright, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Honestly this was a dish I could probably make on my own at home (and I really don't cook often). The flavor didn't really feel cohesive to me and I think it's because the sauce didn't do a good job of bringing the dish together. The shrimp was good, but I had two tail pieces that were still left on, but considering the good amount of shrimp that I got, I guess it wasn't too bad.   Overall, my experience here was alright. The service was very good, but I think the food is overhyped (at least for dinner). I might come back for brunch since there have been positive reviews and the food is cheaper! Kind of sad that I paid $10 for my dish and I wasn't really full after the meal. But I am glad that the money will be going towards a great cause."}
{"text":"Solid new restaurant with a great mission. Really liked my quiche with lots of flavor at a very reasonable price. The mac and cheese was fine but a bit salty and runny. I love that kids can draw on the table and the service was friendly and quick. We'll be coming back to help the mission and eat some good food."}
{"text":"Unlike any restaurant I have ever been to, this restaurant is non-profit!  How that is even possible is beyond me, but Kit's Kitchen is doing it, and it's pretty awesome.  With community efforts and super affordable food, donations and proceeds go to KIT, the Kids in Transition Foundation. The owners also own the popular Essence and Herbs, as well as Sonrisa Grill in Lake Las Vegas.  They have $5 breakfast and lunch meals, that are pretty generous and very good.  But my favorites come from the Sunday brunch menu.  The marinated shrimp and avocado open faced sandwich had my taste buds all over it.  I initially pictured it to be a messy fork and knife sandwich, but it's pretty and looks like an appetizer you'd share at a fancy wine place because of its toasted baguette presentation.  It was so fresh and easy to eat.  Another good one is their ahi tuna dish.  I may be biased with these choices, but trust me, you can't go wrong with these choices!  Among other things, there's a bar in here, and they also have outdoor seating.  It really does seem like a great place to meet with friends and family. Booze, food, and a nice atmosphere... all to support a good cause - I'm in!"}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews when the place represents a good cause, food comes out hot and on time or when the service is fine. So, I will point out the positives and let the stars do the talking: -Food was priced good for what you get - real butter - Hot and fast  - juice or coffee priced w/the breakfast -other folks seemed to be saying they liked the food -short wait (when I went )"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the cause behind this restaurant really is wonderful. The presentation of the food was beautiful. However, our dinner really wasn't good. There was just no getting around the fact that we didn't enjoy the flavor. No plates went back to the kitchen licked clean.  I get that the price point is low and they are trying to provide a higher end experience for a very reasonable price. I don't think this will work though until they use higher quality ingredients and improve their flavor.  Service was also spotty. Again, I understand the servers are volunteers and I respect that. We could tell, however, that the staff weren't servers in their day jobs."}
{"text":"The food is super tasty and delicious, we really enjoyed our meal, afforadle prices and the services is excellent they take the time to explain to you the plates if you ask. I will recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! The ambiance is beautiful, the people are friendly and professional, and the food is amazing! To top it off, the prices are incredibly low and the money goes to a wonderful cause. We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for a birthday party after hours. The restaurant was quaint and had a fun vibe about it.   For my meal, I had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The chicken was seasoned nicely and the green sauce on top was tangy and had a light spice to it. Have I had better enchiladas? Yes. Have I had worse enchiladas? Yes. Would I drive across town to eat here? Probably not, but if I happened to be on sunset and needed to eat something good and reasonably priced I would hesitate to stop by.   The owner has a great story about where she came from and why she opened this restaurant. You can tell she cares about the community and reaching out a hand to those less fortunate."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for weeks! Went today but unfortunately had to leave without trying it. Walked in and all employees were talking at bar, finally got seated by a pleasant person and waited 10 minutes for two waters and there were three of us. The waiter/busboy (not sure) said he would be back with another water. Waited about ten more minutes before I asked two servers that were clearing empty tables if we had a server. She said oh yes and walked back to the bar area. Still no server for another ten minutes got up to leave and they all turned to look at us confused but said nothing. Really disappoint especially since I own a restaurant. By the way the restaurant only had about four tables seated and I counted at least four employees."}
{"text":"Feeling guilty that you're splurging on brunch? How would you feel if I told you there was a brunch spot that supports underprivileged local kids AND won't break the bank? Well, welcome to KIT's Kitchen :)  The restaurant is a non-profit that supports local underprivileged kids- ask the owner (who is frequently around) and she'll tell you all about it! No, it does not mean your food is going to be made by a 16 year old who was forced to volunteer there by his parents- don't worry! The restaurant is clean and has a bright grade A health district sign on their door.  On weekdays (Closed on Mondays!) they have a $6 lunch menu that I highly recommend. The food is made quick and can be made to go. I ordered the Caesar wrap, which came with chips and a soda. The wrap was huge, filling and better than a wrap you would pick up in your grocery store deli section. For the price, the quick service and the good you're doing for the community it was definitely worth it.  We also ordered the pancakes and croissant sandwich. Both were equally filling. However, they packed us the pancakes to go with no syrup or even butter :( Double check your bag before you go!  They have lots of neat events listed on their page- painting night, buffet for donations, DJ night! Definitely worth checking out! Also their Sunday brunch looks like it needs to be added to my bookmarks!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having breakfast here yesterday and meeting the owner, Chanthy. First of all, it warms my heart to know that this sweet lady uses every dime the restaurant makes to help kids in the community. The entire wait staff is helpful, friendly and they volunteer their time. The food is delicious and the prices are unbelievably low. Kudos Chanthy for your warm heart and loving personality, may the idea of Kit's Kitchen spread throughout the world!"}
{"text":"Great food!! great mission!! Second time here will be back many more times! The staff has always been great and attentive."}
{"text":"I must have eaten at a different kits kitchen. The intent to help kids is good but food is basic institutional. Ham was similar to canned in texture and croissant was soggy. I only did breakfast so maybe the rest of the menu is fantastic but this is on par with Jerrys nugget or boulder station or the now extinct Klondike.  I used to run restaurants and the fact that no restaurant has ever done well there and the one time it did, the chef died should say something about the location being cursed. Location alone says this is not designed for any kind of restaurant but more for an insurance office or legal office. Something that doesn't require steady traffic. The help is volunteer or free so the  lackadaisical attitude of the host/server is a direct reflection of that.  I've bought,sold, reorganized, and cannibalized restaurants and not even sure restaurant impossible could help. Noble effort but take the red pill. The competition in this area for food dollars is too tough to serve mediocre even if done with best intentions. I can smell the death of a restaurant and regretfully this place is bleeding out slowly.  Sadly there aren't that many reviews and the few here but mine are all 5 star which makes me suspicious."}
{"text":"Kits kitchen is a newer restaurant in the North Green Valley area. They have a full bar. They are a nonprofit and give all of their proceeds back to the community to kids and seniors. They also assist underprivileged young adults who want to learn from The culinary business. For starters we had the French onion soup lots of onions, tasty broth. And a bargain for less than $10. We had the tuna tartare appetizer. The tuna may have been a little scarce but the flavors are well blended and it is a large portion. Entr√©es the spicy shrimp scampi is delicious. The wait staff is very friendly and very prompt. They are open for breakfast lunch and dinner all of their prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious. Give kids kitchen I try to feed your stomach and your sense of community"}
{"text":"I walked to this restaurant with my kids in this summer heat & the doors were locked during operating hours. It is a disappointment to the neighborhood considering this is the only eatery that isn't a pizza shop or casino"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Delicious chicken crepes. So delicious I had to dig in and forgot to take Pic. This place is non profit and benefits kids in transition!  Very reasonably priced!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If I could rate it a ten I would.  The food is fabulous...the chef rivals any chef on the strip. Every dish I sampled was amazing.  The atmosphere is darling.  My new favorite place in town!"}
{"text":"Came across this gem today  got the avocado rolls & the veggie scramble - delicious. My daughter had the Japanese pancakes with Nutella strawberries & banana - it was ok. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been delaying this review because I don't know how to review a place that deserves lots of business but isn't top-notch in every way. I went with a group of 6 women & we had a nice time. I'll go there again & will be happy to give them more business.  Concept: 5 star. Proceeds support a charity & workers are mostly volunteers.  Atmosphere: 4 star. Very nice. Would have been a bit better if the staff wasn't hanging around chatting with each other. But they're volunteers.  Service: 2 star. They're volunteers. Lots of mistakes made. No mention to our table that drinks are included in the price. No mention that at lunch we could only order from one side of the menu. Got our drink orders wrong or just didn't deliver them. More than one server was trying to do the same thing that had already been covered (ordering food, drinks, etc.). Lots of confusion.  My food: 1 star. The seafood crepes at $10 were bad. Just 2 little white things with NOTHING else on the plate. Hey, might you have a couple leaves of something you could add to this plate? An orange slice? The \"seafood\" was no more than mashed salmon as I could see or taste. I should've taken a pic but I was a bit embarrassed at the time to do this. Really. This item should be removed from the menu.  Others' food: 3-4 star. They seemed to like it. The gluten free people were disappointed that the gluten-free option was sold out at noon.  Give this place a chance. It just feels good to support a business that's trying to help the community. Next time I'll get one of their $5 breakfast specials. Low expectations, tough to mess up."}
{"text":"The most incredible food. A wonderful experience. The service was prompt and inpecable, loved the waiter. He spoke spanish also and made us feel like we were surrounded by class & finness! Come try this restaurant. Its gourmet food at resonable prices. I Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"What a great concept. This little gem of a restaurant serves some great food and is all about helping the community. Great food at great prices, with wonderful service and some great people giving back to the underprivileged is a place worth going to and telling your friends about"}
{"text":"I have had dinner and breakfast here. Both meals were very good. The service was awesome and of course, the price was perfect. The best thing is that it is all for a good cause. I'll continue to support this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great service, and amazing prices. This was an all around great experience. Very impressed. Try the Philly Cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast at 9am on a Saturday morning. It wasn't too busy when I got there, and slowly a few more tables filled up while I was there, but still plenty of seating available.  Its a neat concept where they have $5 breakfasts and $6 lunches available after 10am. It's a non-profit training restaurant for young people. Staffed by volunteers.   I ordered fried chicken with biscuits and gravy, topped with cheese. Comes with potatoes and a watermelon slice, as well as a cup of coffee or a juice. Good price for a decent sized meal that tastes good.  Everyone very friendly, happy to stop and explain what they are doing with their program. Several tables asked.   I'll be back to check out some of the other meals and support their cause, especially since it is less than 5 minutes away from home."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch for the office and everyone was satisfied with their order. When I picked up our food the gentleman that helped me over the phone was really nice he even remembered my name and explained to me the concept of KITS Kitchen. I'm sure if I had asked him for a tour he would have been willing to do that as well. We all agreed we would be returning again."}
{"text":"Great place supports a great cause. Food is really good. But The service lacks a bit. But they are all volunteers so it makes sense in the end."}
