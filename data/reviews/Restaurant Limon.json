{"text":"I was really hoping to find the next great mexican restaurant... but i didn't !!! the food is ok, not bad but not great, the problem is that it's way overpriced for what it is  apetizer + entree will bring you to 35$-40$ per person!! i don't mind spending when the food is great but when it's just average, then LIMON we have a problem!  even the Margaritas are average but at 12$ a glass... can get way better for half the price.  the restaurant itself is very nice, i would recommend going with a group because it's quite noisy. but the seats... oh my God, so uncomfortable, no cushion and so big you are too far from the table when you wanna eat!!!  service was nice, a bit slow, but ok for a Sat night  i really love mexican food and i can say i was disapointed with Limon, maybe the expectations were too high! too bad, i will not be coming back and will not recommend it"}
{"text":"I've had Mexican food in Mexico City, in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in Tucson. Just about everywhere both at high end and low end places. Cheap to expensive.  Limon was excellent. The margaritas are made by hand without using a sweet/sour mix. The lamb enchiladas were really good and my husband loved his tampiquena. Fresh guacamole was also good.  So funny to just find this place accidentally in our new griffin town neighborhood.  Also heard the tuna tartar was good."}
{"text":"Why cant you give zero stars??? Worst place ever! They had an all you can drink margharita special, which got us in the door. What we learned is that they made them absurdly salty so that people cant drink more than 1, maybe 2, with lots of water. We asked for them to be less salty but thwy said they are \"premade\".  Since im a stubborn guy, I insisted in drinking them. Once id had 5 they said that was the max! I told them that they advertize \"all you can drink\". Their response was that 5 is enough and no one drinka that many. Not surprising given the fact that they sabotage them.with ridiculous amounts of salt. This place is just a scam. In a city with so many great restaurants and bars, this one should be avoided. Or better yet, closed down for good."}
{"text":"Being Mexican, I would expect tasty food and excelent service the way fine restaurants are in my country. This place is anything but that. Ordered Cochinita Pibil and I can say the cans they sell in Latin stores taste better.Service was a challenge, may be because it was a busy evening,but still, I believe they need to prepare for those nights,no? also, not friendly staff.They don't talk or establish any rapport with customers. I have been there two times because it's one block from my place.Won't come back anymore though..."}
{"text":"I really hate to give bad reviews (this is my first ever bad review) but this place is to be avoided. The prices are absurdly high for the portions you get. But based on the taste of the food the small portions aren't a bad thing. I had the beef tacos. They were four mini beef tacos (served with no side whatsoever), the meat was extremely dry. The only way to salvage them was to dump loads of salsa and sour cream on them. I also ordered what the menu said was a pina colada I took one sip and immediately pushed it to the side (they had the courtesy to not charge me for it). All in all it was a really bad experience and I would not go there again nor recommend this place to anyone. To be avoided"}
{"text":"I've been here twice during winter and ordered both lunch once and dinner another time (my client was performing at the nearby venue) and asked for my meals to be plant based and they did a good job getting my orders correct, catering to my lifestyle and it was delicious. A few other co workers had seen my food and ended up ordering too, everyone was happy. My only negative critique is that they took a long time even when there was hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the neighborhood close to Limon, so we thought we'd give it a try. Our first experience we were surprised to find out that they do not offer traditional chips and salsa. We asked our server if we could have a side of pico de gallo for our chips and she brought us a good sized bowl. Once we received our bill, we saw that we were charged $12.00 for the pico!! Outrageous considering most Mexican restaurants offer salsa free of charge...Another time, we tried to get food for take out (since we livejust around the corner) and they made it seem like taking food to go was impossible! Not sure what that's about...  The food overall is good, but very expensive. I have tried the fajitas and enchiladas and both plates were very tasty--I just don't understand why Limon has to be so expensive and why they make it a challenge to order food To Go.  All in all, I'd give it a shot and see what you think, as I said, the food is good."}
{"text":"Mexican food at its finest... Their Guacamole was whipped, the cevice was awesome, the best I've ever had. The fajita was juicy and tasty.  Try the margarita !!!!  A must in the Atwater neighborhood"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Limon late at night and decided to check it out on a whim. We regretted it. Limon is overpriced, too noisy, too pretentious and has no idea what good and fresh food is. Also, they have giant car and wine ads inside their menu which is the weirdest thing I have ever seen at a restaurant. I guess selling out their integrity as restauranteurs wasn't too difficult.  On to the food.. the entree we had, the guacamole dip with nachos. The guacamole has no spiciness to it whatsoever, so while the taste is acceptable it definitely lacks in depth.  The fajitas... for $15 I expected something more than what an El Paso Fajitas kit could give me on a tuesday night after work. The flavors were really bland and the ingredients sorely under seasoned. The vegetables and condiments tasted like water and the chilli sauce (which the waitress forgot to bring us at first) had no bite to it whatsoever and once again no depth to it.  We spent most of the meal joking around about how bad the place was and how they have to pump \"bar music\" really loudly so that their customers might forget how they are being screwed and how their food tastes like Uncle Bob's Very Forgettable  Taco Night."}
{"text":"Service merdique!  La serveuse m'a demandé pourquoi je lui a avais donné 10% de tip!  Quelle insulte!"}
{"text":"Je ne peux pas commenter sur la nourriture, car j'ai été pour prendre des verres. Bref, une belle ambiance comme Griffintown le connais. Les proprios super sympa. Il y a toute sorte de drink et le décors est tout cute. C'est sûre que j'y retourne ça sentait trop bon! En plus, il y a un jardin qui va ouvrir en été!! J'ai hâte!"}
{"text":"Restaurant mexicain au plein coeur du Sud-Ouest qui fait mon plaisir chaque fois que j'ai un craving de mexicain.  Ce restaurant ressemble plus à un restaurant normal qu'à un restaurant 3 amigos plus restauration rapide. Il y a un très bon choix d'entrées, de la guacamole avec nachos au ceviche (très bon). Au niveau des plats principaux, il y a de tout : Fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, burgers et autres plats mexicains. Côté alcool, vous trouverez une vaste sélection de margaritas et de tequila, aye aye aye.   Atmosphère un peu détente, peu de lumière et tables éloignées les unes des autres. Tout ça avec un bon fond de musique mexicaine.  Je n'essaie pas de le décrire comme étant le meilleur restaurant de mexicain à Montréal, mais comme un très bon restaurant de mexicain dans le Sud-Ouest. C'est un choix sur. Un peu dispendieux peut-être si vous prenez tous les services.  L'été est encore plus spécial chez Limon, car il y a une terrasse en arrière."}
{"text":"This was prob my fav meal while in Montreal.  The food was amazing, even though the menu was small.  We both had nachos and the black beans were incredible which were served on the size.  We sat at a great table near the window (fun people watching) and service was perfect.  The music was great as well.  If I lived in Montreal, I would be here all the time.  Laid back, relaxing atmosphere in a fun antiquey district for shopping."}
{"text":"My second time coming to Limon, and like each time, it doesn't leave much of an impression on me.   The food is not the best, but I've only tried the tacos here, and they are okay. They are also really pricey and perhaps the ambience is just a bit loud and too dark.  The first time I came to this place, we had such a difficult time reading the menu, that each of us (5 total) had to take the candle close to the menu to read what it said.    Also of note: there is an ad on the back of the menu. Yes, that's right there is an ad on the back of the menu.  I draw attention to this only because the decor of the restaurant is quite modern and tasteful. The menu is set to be something of moderate-pricey,  The clientele seemed to be touch classier than casual dressers. The appearance of the ad on the back of the menu, is so out of character and doesn't fit in. We concluded that they must be trying to help out a family member or close friend because selling ad space would be down right tacky.  Now, having said all that, I found myself going back to it, because of proximity and as I said, their food is okay."}
{"text":"I am really surprised about the poor reviews, I have been here about five times and have had excellent service, which is rare in Montreal at any resto. The food was delicious, and the margaritas were great, as was the atmosphere. Very relaxed and comfortable."}
{"text":"A bunch of buddies came up to Montreal for a bachelor party.. This place is fucking unreal.. The owner is a lady named Genevieve who was absolutely phenomenal. The Huevos rancheros and Beef tacos were to die for and generally the staff was incredible."}
{"text":"I am not really big on mexican food. I ended up ordering a filet mignon.   The meat was cooked perfectly, had a light, rich sauce. Beautiful cut of meat. Vegetables were very nice, asparagus, assorted peppers, roasted potatoes along with the meat came together very well. Great presentation.   This place is a bit pricey but I expected that when ordering my meal. Looking at other items on the menu and judging by what my friends ordered, I'd say they can take it down a notch. The 5 a 7 is pretty good if you are ordering margaritas, it's basically 2 for 1.   The decor is very calm and relaxing. We sat outside on the terrace which didn't have a very nice view. You are basically looking at a back ally. The tables weren't very sturdy and I found them to be small.   The staff who served us did what they are paid to do. Be there when I need another beer, frequently checked on us and explained the menu as needed."}
{"text":"And now we come to Cinco de Mayo. Sadly, there were no events in Montreal. I diligently searched on Google to no avail. So I settled on a snazzy Mexican joint, Limòn, in the St. Henri quartier. I met my friend, Philippe, at 5:30 sans reservations - shame on me. Every single table in the place was open but there wasn't anything available until 8:00. Strange. I guess they just reserve the tables the whole night with reserved signs and the party has it for the whole night. So we ended up eating at the bar.  Even the Mexican restaurant didn't have any Cinco de Mayo specials! Although, I guess this is to be expected since it commemorates the Battle of Puebla, which was a victory over the French. I celebrated with a couple of margaritas which weren't of the size or quality that I'm used to, and the place had absolutely no Mexican flare.The enchiladas were so so, although the presentation was very nice. The service was just so so as they could've been more friendly."}
{"text":"I live 10 minutes away from Limon so when my sister called me and asked where I wanted to go for my birthday, I figured it might be nice to hit Limon and enjoy a nice Mexican meal on the terasse. I have to say the night started off on a bad note when we were told that they didn't have a table for us on the terasse even if we had made our reservation the week before and were assured a table on the terasse. The hostess gave us an attitude as if it was our fault they had given our table away. We were seated at the noisiest table in the place right next to the bar where the owner seemed to be hosting a party for his friends. This made it hard to hold a conversation with anyone other then the person sitting next to you.  The hostess seated us but forgot to give us menus and the wine list, so when our waitress finally see if we wanted something to drink and we asked for menus and a wine list she turned walked away mumbling something that sounded like insults and didn't come back around for another 10 minutes. We finally ordered drinks and some appetizers which came quickly because they were delivered to our table by the busboy. Our waitress spend the entire night at another table drinking wine and doing shots, thank god for the busboy. If it wasn't for him I fear we would have never received our meals.   When we finally got our food we all agreed that it had about as much in common with authentic Mexican food as the taco kit from old Elpasso. my meal was bland, the presentation looked thrown together and it was served cold. Suffice it to say I was unimpressed with my meal.  The decor of the place is interesting, they had framed images of various Mexican themed pictures that made us chuckle, the tables had good separation between them and were pretty comfortable.  All and all our experience at Limon was disappointing. Bad service and bland food makes that I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yeah... Probably won't be back.  We were there on a Thursday before a show and they were overwhelmed - big time!! It was early when we got there but they were already out of burgers (really?) and out of a few other items, too. Our waiter didn't really talk to us (seriously?) and I couldn't even tell if he spike English if French at all. He forgot our drinks, and took a long time to come back with more - the guys had to wave at him AND ask another waitress to send him to our table.  The food was just OK. My guacamole was a bit sparkling (which isn't usually a good sign) but I'll admit the braised pork sandwich was quite good. My sister in law had the veggie fajitas which seemed a little disapointing on the serving size - and the veggies looked like they were out of a frozen bag.... Bummer.  Perhaps it wasn't a good night and we just weren't lucky, but I really felt like the prices were way beyond the quality of the food and service. I usually don't give out bad reviews, especially regarding service (as I've been there myself), but it just wasn't worth the wait / money."}
{"text":"Le Limon se veut être un restaurant authentiquement Mexicain. Ayant été à quelques reprise (je parle du Mexique là), je dirais que le Limon présente une bouffe presque authentique. Mon assiette de taco aux crevettes était délicieuse, la portion parfaite pour ne pas avoir mal au ventre une fois terminée, et les épices étaient subtiles et bien agrémentés de coriandre fraîche. Les plats des membres de ma famille semblaient être presque aussi bon, mais ils n'ont pas eu l'air d'aimer autant que moi. Le soupe au tortilla donnait plutôt l'impression d'être une soupe aux tomates Campbell avec des biscuits sodas et des épices à la mexicaine (chili, paprika, cannelle, etc...).Ça n'était pas mauvais, mais ça ne goûtait pas vraiment ce qu'on a mangé au Mexique.  J'adore les grosses peintures de chiens comiques et l'ambiance intime mais on dirait qu'il faisait juste un peu trop noir. Pourtant, j'aime manger à la lueur de chandelle, mais quand on a à assembler son repas comme ma mère avec ses tortillas, c'est le fun de savoir ce qu'on met dedans et en quelle quantité."}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas un grand fan de cuisine mexicaine, mais je dois avouer que les burritos et les tacos sont bons. L'ambiance est également bien appréciée. Toutefois, je trouve que les prix sont un peu trop élevés par rapport à la qualité des plats servis."}
