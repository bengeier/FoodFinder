{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place, but was severally disappointed. Took my husband there for his birthday, which he was excited about and even he was disappointed. They just opened and still have a lot of kinks to work out. So I am going to give a very detailed account of what was good and what was bad. Hopefully someone at Modern Rounds reads this and will take it as constructive feedback. 

Website: Website was easy to navigate and make reservations for both the shooting lounge and for dinner. It even asked if we were celebrating an occasion. I marked birthday for my husband. Great job on the website!
Registration process: We were told when we got there we had to pay $5 membership fee each to shoot. I said ok, what does membership get you? Her answer, it is so you don't have to fill out the form every time, you just give us your phone number after today. Well, ok I paid $15 (there were 3 of us) to not have to fill out a form again. Instead of explaining anything I felt like the girl tried to up sell us on the extra time and the live action scenarios. I declined the scenarios because it was our first time and just wanted to try the regular stuff first. I am so glad I did. PARENTAL WARNING: the live scenarios (going on in the booth next to us) were full of F-bombs and other profanity. We had our 14 year old son with us, so I was shocked that they offered it to us, without even a warning. Also, it should be noted at this time they did ask if we were celebrating anything and I said, yes it is my husbands birthday today, she said great, I'll let them know. I am not sure who they are, because I was asked 3 times (website and 2 people) if we were celebrating any thing. Every time I said yes, birthday and nothing was done at all. Not sure why they bothered to ask. 
Shooting lounge area: The girl spent all of 1 minutes showing us how everything worked, started a video and then disappeared. A cocktail waitress did come over right away and asked if we wanted anything. But we hadn't even looked at menu yet. So we said can we just have 3 waters for now. She brought them back at some point and we never saw her again. 
We figured out the games on our own, but once we were out of CO2 we had to flag someone down to ask how to get more. He said just put them in the tray and we will replace (that would have been nice to know from our orientation). A man did come over at some point and because my son is 14 did a 2 minute safety talk with him. He was kind enough to answer all our other questions.  When our time was up we literally couldn't find anyone, we waited over 5 minutes for someone to come.  We gave up and went back out front to the reception area to be seated for dinner. 
Dinner: The waiter was very prompt, very friendly. He knew the menu well. I have a wheat allergy, so he helped figure out my gluten free options. He was even very sympathetic to the fact that is was one of the most uncomfortable dinning experience we have ever had. Meaning, the chairs, while beautiful are way over sized and the wrong height for the tables. None of us could pull our seats in all the way because the seat hit each other and then our feet were all on top of each others. I finally tucked my feet under me in the chair to both elevate myself and keep them from getting stepped on. When we mentioned it to waiter he said, yeah I know, I have had several people complain about that. All that being said, we all loved our food. Hats off to the chef, great food. Just please save your waiters some anguish and mark your gluten free friendly options on the menu. 

Wow! Didn't realize I had that much to say... longest review in history :)"}
{"text":"Loved it! Such a classy new hang out! The guns were much more accurate than I expected and the food was quite tasty! We had the filet sliders, chicken sandwich and chicken skewers, we all enjoyed the food. Our waitress was very tentative. I would have given it 5 stars but we all couldn't help but notice the bar smell as we walked in the door, they might want to try and improve the ventilation system or find out what is causing the icky beer smell. This won't stop me from returning with friends next week, hopefully the issue will be resolved."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced at a new place. As soon as I arrived I felt pretty good only to be disappointed in the longs line and the lack of organization from the people working there. We had a group that made a reservation but unfortunately they could not help us and kept asking if we were members. I would not recommend going to this place and I know I will never go there in the future."}
{"text":"I made reservations for my husband's birthday party in person in July and when I called to confirm the reservation two days before the event in August the hostess said they didn't have my reservation and quickly put me on hold to get the manager. Bruce, the manager, got on the phone and diffused the situation. I showed up on Friday, September 1st with my 10 guests and we had two bays side by side waiting for us. Celeste, our server, was lovely and handled all the separate tabs like a pro. All my guests had a great time and we loved the food! We will be back. Just make sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"5 star service from Allie our server once we were in the door.  She gave us fast and happy service and was very nice to our kids.  The food was great, awesome burger.  The shooting was fantastic with a lot of scenarios for kids or adults. Definitely will come here again because of my service from Allie.

1 star service from the ladies that supposed to greet you at the front and help you out.  I stood in front of them for almost 10 minutes, there was 5 women and 2 working, no one said anything to me.  Lets try \"I will be right with you\". Nope I had to interrupt them, I was 2 feet away, someone needs to update their staff on customer service.  It was a joke I took my phone out and started a timer.

The rest was great when I was done with the worthless ladies at the front counter."}
{"text":"Concept is awesome but by the time you're seated and get a water, you're already halfway through your time. So, plan on being there at least 3 hours. We left since we felt the service was subpar on what it looked to be a slow night. No one was at the bar. Managers were of course courteous and refund was given as well as offering a free gift card, which I declined. The hostess didn't seem to know what the heck was going on and gave me and the party a head of us incorrect information. Place is sorta lame and tacky. Maybe with time it'll get better? This review is coming from an actual customer, not an employee that has made reviews below me. For prices that start at $45.99 an hour, and for atmosphere they are trying to create, I would expect way better service than what was experienced. I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. The staff made us feel like VIP'S. When we arrived there was a small hiccup in our reservation but everyone made sure we had an amazing time with great food."}
{"text":"This place has such a fun, friendly atmosphere! Came here for the first time with some friends who had suggested it to me. Absolutely loved the shooting games. I was really impressed with the entire place - very upscale and entertaining. Our waitress (Journey) was extremely helpful since I had no idea what to get off the menu. She took care of us and was very attentive, outgoing, and personable. Ended up getting the Margherita flatbread and a margarita to match lol. Overall, great games, great food, and great service. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and had a blast! Great customer service from walking in the door to the bar. Each person we dealt with were very personable. I had a Sangria and gummy bear shot and both great. Our server was awesome and explained everything in detail. I love the ambiance of this place. Great for groups and date night, It's a little pricey but we got a Groupon.  We'll return!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Was fun to try something new. Service smooth. The girls at the front desk were welcoming to some newbies and explained it all. Tried it using a Groupon  was an hr for ~$24 and then food drink extra."}
{"text":"The company Christmas party was held there.. a great time , great environment, and friendly staff"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a whim for a day date. The place was absolutely gorgeous...I can't imagine how much the build out must have cost them. The staff was phenomenally helpful and informative. We had such a blast playing all the games and the drinks were great. Love that a place like this is in the West Valley!!!!"}
{"text":"A very thoughtful woman brought me to Modern Round for a date.  What a great idea!  The place looks and feels amazing.  A lot of thought went into it.  Great for a date or friends out having fun.  The bar is very cool.  What surprised me was that the food is excellent.  I highly recommend this place.  I've already been 3 times in the last two weeks."}
{"text":"There are still some technical issues to work out, my wife beat me three times in a row, something must be wrong ;-),  but otherwise, this place is great.  Server was Amy Joe, she was awesome. 
P.J, the manager, was great, spent some time with us to talk about the place.  He was really great.
We had the BBQ, chicken pizza which was very good, the beer was reasonably priced.  I would come back again for a full dinner to see how that is.
Keep it up.  Good luck on the place."}
{"text":"The food was good, The place looks really nice. cool idea.  Iron sights in a dark room, with a dark projection makes aiming somewhat difficult at times... 

Unfortunately, most of the guns we had would stop working half way through each game.  When the guns DID work, we would run out of 'ammo' and reach for a new mag...nothing.  We literally had stood by our lounge for 15minutes before our person came back to check on us and give us mag refills.  Same type service for food and drink.  We ended up walking downstairs to the bar ourselves to place drink and food orders."}
{"text":"I love coming here! :) The virtual shooting is a lot of fun, I came here for my 22nd birthday and I got 10$ of my lounge and a complimentary coffee mug filled with ice cream. I had the Sedona chicken sandwich which was really good and my husband got the Margarita flatbread (pizza) and he loved it. If you try any of the desserts I definitely recommend the Brownie Ice Cream sand which!! It was delicious. We shot for a good 2 hours and we had time to eat and just enjoy my birthday. Journey was our server and she was amazing, she was super sweet and made sure we were having a good time, never had an empty glass. I already made reservation to bring my family!"}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite hangout!
Shame on you Modern Round!!!!
Poor customer service and argumentative managers...when all it would of taken was a simple... We appologize and we will make it right for ruining your Birthday Dinner. But all I got was...Who did you talk to.. who did you make a reservation with...so unprofessional.  3 different Manger and 3 separate times continue to argue  with me in front of my guest.

I  am event planner and I have had several parties here but never again...We spent well over $1000 to be treat like crap!!!!  I rather spend my money at Chucky Cheese at least they tell you Happy Birthday!!!!"}
{"text":"Modern round is a great establishment I recommend you trying this place good service good food good atmosphere fun all around"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever experienced in my life. I never do reviews but I had such an awful experience that I had to share my feedback. I had a reservation and as soon as I walked in, it took over 15 minutes just to get to someone who could help me. As I was the next person in line, the girls working at the front were very disorganized and didn't acknowledge me for after a few minutes of me standing in front of them. They advised me to come back when I had my whole group. I got back into line and was waiting another 25 minutes and was still not helped so we decided to leave. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Cool idea , but the overall experience is expensive and a let down. It's basically a newer version of duck hunt. Food is ok and the people are great. Just way more fun options that are less expensive."}
{"text":"This place is nice. Good food and games. The problem is that when u start playing and ur food comes the time keeps going. So u have to play first or eat first. And at 35.00 an half hour. It could get expensive."}
{"text":"We had a great time! It's different than any experience we've had in AZ, so it's great for a fun night out. We had Alexis as our server and she took great care of us. There's not quite enough variety to give this place 5 stars, but for a once-in-a-while experience, it's great fun."}
{"text":"This has now turned into my favorite go to spot when having happy hour, Sunday lunch, etc. We did the shooting once and it was super fun. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. The last few times, however, we just wanted a bite to eat and beer to drink so sat at the bar. The bartenders are phenomenal! You can tell they enjoy where they work and make you want to come back. And the food is awesome! I've only been 3 times, so still working my way through the menu, but haven't had any complaints. I figured I'd get annoyed by the shooting in the background while I'm trying to enjoy a few drinks, but it just doesn't happen here due to the great set up. Lots of TVs sports fans! Excited to go there again today to watch the Cardinals and have a birthday lunch :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The employees definitely make you feel like you stepped into a movie, from opening the entrance door, to walking you to your section with the gun briefcase handcuffed to their wrist, explaining how to use the guns and then finally killing some Zombies! Its such a neat mix too, you feel fancy while holding a gun!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things is that anyone can come eat dinner here. You don't have to be playing games, they have a restaurant in the middle & you can actually watch people shoot while you're eating. 
I didn't like that we called & they told us no reservations until 9 pm (on both Friday & Saturday) so we still made that reservation. We showed up early (7:30pm) and got in within 10 minutes. There was also a few empty bays and just kept getting more empty the longer we were there. 
Many awesome selections of games, we paid the extra $10 to get the police tactical unit but was not very impressed with it. (Police actually come here to practice) 
Loved the CO2 cartridges, felt almost real.
Staff was very tentative. 
Very modern looking.
Can't wait to come back. Would be great for double or triple date night, family night, girls night, guys night, etc."}
{"text":"So much fun! Love having date night here with my Fiance! Good food, great atmosphere and best of all great entertainment!"}
{"text":"I have visited Modern Round twice (7/3-12 people and 7/8-8 people) and feel I have a good handle on this place.  First of all, this is a great concept!  It is an upscale restaurant and bar with amazing food and a great environment!  You can sit in a romantic private niche, open tables, or at the bar.  The food is very innovative and reasonably priced.  I have tried four of their appetizers, two of their flatbreads, and two of the skewer entrees and they all have been excellent!  The service has been very attentive and I was surprised to see how well-run and organized this place is for being so new.  I have personally been greeted by two of their managers, PJ and Jeff and they were truly interested in our satisfaction and care.  

The shooting lounges are really cool.  Please do not be disuaded from this place due to the fact that this place has guns!  It is basically a video game that is intended for fun, not to incite violence.  I would recommend downloading the app on your smart phone prior to arriving, which will make your transition easier.  The shooting lounges are very fun and the service has been excellent on both occasions.  We had a variety of people with us.  Some had never fired a gun and others are proficient.  All had fun and several have gone back as a result of their initial experience.  

This eatertainment establishment is very similar to Top Golf except it is nicer and has shooting rather than golf.  Give this place a try and see what this new independent restaurant is bringing to Peoria."}
{"text":"I didn't make it to your place and games. It was a pretty good experience overall. The food was pretty good and the service was pretty on point. The only downfall is the guns kept acting up and failing so they would have asked to constantly give us new magazines or different guns. They did a good job To accommodate us an extended our time for the time that we lost with the issues on the guns. So I give you four stars for doing a great job with customer service and taking care of us. It would be nice to see maybe the guns work better so you don't have the frustration in the future. Thanks again"}
{"text":"The experience was less than what I expected. I honestly could of stayed home and played Xbox and had a better experience. The gaming part was poorly executed. Upon checking in they had a flaw with the system and I was forced to play under there employees. Which I found to take away and start my experience off on the wrong foot. The woman who helped us was a little rude as well. The bartender stone was amazing and had very good service. Same as our server that helped us during gaming. I feel this could be a good experience but was ruined from the start. I would a never recommend going here as you could go to top golf and have a better experience or play at home."}
{"text":"Planned a surprise for my husband's birthday and it could not have been better. Great place, super friendly and knowledgeable people with fantastic customer service.  We did not order any food this time (but the menu looks great) as we had breakfast just a short time before arriving. They even surprised my husband with an ice cream sundae....so nice. We will definitely be back and often.  If you are looking for a fun time with friends, I hope you will give this great place a try."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now, definitely different and fun with helpful staff but the guns and software are very faulty. Everytime I have been we constantly need help with the games or guns. Cool place."}
{"text":"We came here looking for sports bar and we were not disappointed. We walked in and the ambiance was great. We also like the concept that they have big screen video games. We will try that next time. For today,we were satisfied with the nice ambiamce and the great number of tv's for watching sports. Good food and service too!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok little overpriced for what you get the game itself isn't any better than something you would play at Dave & Busters but for ten times the cost the similar part is definitely not worth ten extra dollars The Guns of cells are pretty cool because they actually feel realistic this place may be cool if you bring a bunch of friends and just hanging out give me something to do but if you come at night at think it's like 35 or 40 bucks an hour definitely won't be back I'll be going Dave and Buster's next time"}
{"text":"We were pretty surprised how much we enjoyed this place! The food was good especially the chicken and waffles! Our server was very accomodating. He was able to push back our reserved lounge time until we finished eating. For the virtual shooting... each membership start up fee is $5/year and you pay by the hour. The weight of the guns and the CO2 cartridged made it feel more realistic and there were a variety of different shooting games. This is something we never did before and we really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Great place when opened. Tonight birthday party 12 people waited over a hour while having a reservation. Then out party was split up in separate areas. Don't recommend if you actually want to make plans to hang out with friends. Top gold is a way better selection."}
{"text":"This place is truly one of a kind. Unfortunately they lack organization. This is the second time our groups have had issues. We called in advance for a party of 13 for 6:30 and we were not seated until 7:40. I don't mind waiting but when we reserved 2 booths for a specific time then had to wait an hour and 10 minutes it becomes frustrating. The waitresses we're not friendly and seemed to have a chip on their shoulders. I really tried to enjoy the place but I cannot recommend this place to anyone. Sadly we will be taking our group activities and teambuilds elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome Venue and entertainment.
It's like Nintendo, meets call of duty meets shooting range meets sports bar with great food.

Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends and reserved two lanes. Kinda weird that your reservation confirmation says first available after your reservation time, so who knows how long that could be... Maybe it's because they are relatively new, but the people answering phones and checking you in don't seem to have it all down yet. Friends tried checking in for our party (after we'd checked in at least 20 minutes earlier) and were told we weren't there yet. 

We waited 40 minutes so we could have two lanes together. No big deal. We were planning on snacking and drinking anyway. Ordered a pitcher of sangria, which came as soda water with a little color. Waitress (Courtney) was great - took it back and had another made, which was really good. Meatballs, poutine fries and BBQ chicken pizza were all much better than expected. 

When the lanes were ready, we had to close out with our waitress and start a tab with the new one, even though we moved only 5 feet away! That was dumb. Only other complaint was the firearms instructor who hovered around us and kept telling us what we were doing wrong. Uh, it's virtual + alcohol, so we didn't really care if we shot someone who wasn't a threat. Didn't like feeling like we were getting in trouble for that. We came to have fun. 

Definitely a good time, with surprisingly good food."}
{"text":"Very fun! Went for date night and it was awesome and the cuban sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here and I was pretty happy. The food was really good and the bartender, Zarah, was really good. She served me and my date the $3 special on Saturday night. Definitely returning here soon"}
{"text":"Seemed like a cool concept so I went there for dinner this past weekend.  Had an upscale feel, but without the upscale prices on their food and drinks.  Staff was friendly and helpful with our questions on the games.  My family had a blast with the shooting lounge.  Plenty of games to choose from and kept everyone entertained!  It's a drive from my house in Scottsdale but was worth the trip out there."}
{"text":"The Groupon for Modern Round is a total scam!  It says it covers 2 entrees but way down at the bottom of all the reviews it says there are only 3 items on the menu that you can pick from.  We are both vegetarians so we asked the manager if we could substitute a flatbread with no meat for one of the 3 options.  She said no.  I showed her my actual Groupon that I purchased and it doesn't list the approved entrees, it just says 2 entrees.  She had to pull up the current listing for the Groupon and scroll past every review to show us that there are only 3 items.  So really this was a total waste of money and the inflexibility of the management left such a bad taste in our mouths that we won't be going back.  The whole place was totally dead during happy hour on a Friday, so I imagine other guests have had a bad experience too!"}
{"text":"Excellent! So much fun! Great service!!!! Food is yummy! Will be back to this place to practice my shooting."}
{"text":"This place is modern, chic, glamorous with outstanding decor!  Our server was Edward and he was one of the nicest guys and genuinely loves his job!! We met the GM Rio and he was very personable and wanted to know how we were enjoying ourselves.  The Mahi Mahi tacos were GREAT!  Plenty of TV's so we watched the basketball game too!  Can't wait to come back with more friends and have a work group come in, as well."}
{"text":"Great fun with the laser (or not if you don't need a laser) shooting games. The atmosphere is great, food is great, best margarita I've gotten outside of home and at a resort in Mexico. One of my new favorite places. I tried the buffalo chicken wraps, buffalo chicken pizza, and quesadillas; all delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok so the shooting was lots of fun and the waitress was attentive, but this place really shines in the dining room. Our waitress (Vanessa) was literally the best we have had in 10 years. The Hot Shot burger was one of best I have had in a long time. Even the side salad was great. I don't even know where to start about dessert. The bread pudding was awesome. I can't say enough good things about this place. Great job, Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to Modern Round or any place like this.  I went with a small group and we had a blast.  
Anna was our hostess.  She was very helpful and super nice.  She brought drink refills when we were empty and kept our magazines loaded.  Her personality helped make this an awesome experience.  
I paid extra for the military and law enforcement scenarios.  I don't recommend paying for these on your first visit.  Just enjoy the scenarios.  
The decorations in the place are cool."}
{"text":"This is a really fun new place in the P83 area, and I have gone there 3 times so far. I have had a great time each time, and the food and drinks are great. The membership fee of $5 for each person is a little misleading, but it wasn't a deal breaker. It is a great place to go with friends and out of town guests."}
{"text":"This was a really fun, different experience. When my in-laws said we were going to a virtual shooting gallery I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out to be excellent. We had a large group so they gave us two of the shooting areas that were located next to each other and brought us a nice selection of appetizers. The food was excellent and service was very attentive.

Now, as to the game play it was fun. Each area has two pistols and two automatic weapons that feel like real weapons. You can play everything from zombie shooting games to actual Police and Military scenarios. The Police scenarios are fun, and scary, because you can see how much pressure our officers are under and how hard it is to know who is a threat. Also, I noticed that another reviewer was upset that the Military scenarios all involve Arab combatants and while I agree that it would be fun to have Nazi or other enemy scenes, I think we need to consider where the US has been at war for the past 15 years.

Is it as much fun as shooting a real gun? No, but its safer and easier to do, plus my kids had a great time. I'm hoping they succeed and open more locations!"}
{"text":"What a great and innovative place!  Nothing else like it in the Valley.  The decor is absolutely stunning inside and out.  Lots of fun shooting!  The drinks are very creative and the food is really good.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking this place out, but it turned out to be way over priced and not very fun. I felt like I could've played these games on my kids' Xbox.  We waited long for drinks and clips (waiting for clips is ridiculous btw) and every little thing was extra.  It also smelt like sewage, which was really odd and off putting. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"My first time here celebrating both my son's birthday. While the bus and concept is cool... I hate to say the service was mediocre at best ... being checked in the attendant wasn't overly friendly didnt ask what the occasion was or anything... turns out that you get $10 off for birthdays..  then on to my waitress... very poor service, not friendly at all.. no menus... I had to keep going to the bar with my questions as it took the waitress a while to even acknowledge my group..  drinks took a very long time... when I mentioned that we had two birthdays the first attendant gave me two coupons for $10 off our next visit... this was very much appreciated but this place is not cheap so I dont think I will pay this type of money for poor service in the future"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool concept. Four of us went this weekend - reservations are a must! We arrived about 315 for our 330 reservation, checked in and waited at the bar. By 3:45 we were brought upstairs to our bay area. Seating was great, instruction and set up was super easy. Everyone on staff was very friendly as well. 

They have games for everyone, from duck hunt or candy crush style games to zombie fps to police training (these were actually boring) but overall, something for everyone. No real firearm exp needed. Kids are welcome - I'm not sure on any age restrictions.

We played, drank and had a few apps (mushroom caps & poutine were awesome) - the four of us had a great time. Plenty of room for more people in bays if needed but only two can play at a time. Two hours was plenty to run thru all the games. Our waitress was awesome, kept the CO2 cartridges replaced and drinks flowing!

We would definitely come back for another round. We did use a groupon this time and had no problems."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. I planned a night out for my husbands birthday and a few other couples. Highly recommended however extremely disappointed in service. We had reservations, waited in the lobby for 20 min before being offered a dining table while we waited for area. We had to finally ask for a manager and were brushed off by manager. Mysteriously enough when he finally did come around to speak to us we were \"next\". We received a 60 sec spiel on directions. Our food arrived and immediately after bill came. waitress wanted us to pay bill right away. Now if this is done in order to clear out by end of paid time I understand. However none of that was explained. Service was horrible and so were the attitudes. I run my own business and am in the service industry. will never return to this place and will never refer anyone here. Cool concept, horrible staff and lack professionalism."}
{"text":"Two stars for this review only because the place is clean and ran well. At least the front of the house. This place is suppose to be an upscale modernized entertainment place. It is modernized and provides decent entertainment. The problem here is the FOOD it's prices for high end pub food. It does not deliver at all. 

First I will say 99% sure I got food poisoning from the Chicken and Waffles entree. The menu in concept and theory is great but lacks any sort of quality food. The preparation and execution to not meet the expectations set by price of reading through the menu. 

We order 3 appetizer type dishes here. All three were barely edible at best. We ordered two desserts and found the same fate as the appetizers. 

Overall I would go back for drinks and fun, but I don't think I will be eating here again. 

A slow off night doesn't mean you can serve horrible food. On the contrary with a slow house the food should shine! 

Eaters beware! Entertainment goers enjoy!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying, we have been here before during the day and the service was amazing! Tonight the service was HORRIBLE! We had to literally stop our game 5 times and wait for more ammo! And we actually hunted  someone down for ammo twice!! The drinks were way overpriced and our waitress did not pay attention to us until we complained about the ammo and lack of attention. Then they started to pay attention. We did not like 2 drinks and they offered to remake and we said no thank you but make us something different. They still charged us for the horrible drinks!!! The manager was just okay about our complaints when we addressed them. If this was my first experience I would never come again! Hopefully they will make changes."}
{"text":"This is a great place. It would be really cool to go to this place for some type of party. The food is actually really good. The service is great but if you are coming here with younger kids never do the police scenario activity because there is a lot of cussing. I went there with my brother and my friends and the people next to us do the police scenario activity and all the cussing just gets really annoying. When you need to refill your CO2 cartridges the waitresses get those quickly before you run out. If your just there to eat, it is a great place to watch the sports games in tv because there is a lot of TVs. It is kind of like a David n busters but not as loud and smaller. Great place to have fun."}
{"text":"The concept is great, the food was great (except the dessert - you can pass on that) and we had exceptional service once we were in our lounge.  The downfall of this is that it took way too long to get us checked in. We had pre-registered and made a reservation so it should have been easy, however the people in front of us had not and so we waited over 20 mins while they filled out all the forms.  There were two staff checking in, but they were unable to grasp the concept of two check in lines."}
{"text":"****Let me start off with explaining that the two stars are only for the waitresses after we were seated and the shooting itself*****

I booked a reservation for Friday evening, called over the phone for 10 people.  She set everything up for me and explained I could use their app on our phones to register before hand so it would make the check in smoother.  Everyone in our group did, but we still had to wait almost 20 mins in line just to check in.  They were very busy, but I felt like they should have a better system for those who have previously registered, there was nothing \"smooth\" about this process.  When we got to the front they were completely disorganized. I had two different people asking me different questions about names and reservations, it made things very confusing.  I then learned that it's only 6 per lounge, so I was forced to pay another $45 for the extra lounge. When pressed on why I had to pay even though I was told 10 was fine for one, they just kept saying it was only 6 per lounge.  I was incredibly displeased with my experience here, I should not have had to pay extra, let alone the entire price, for something that was not my own mistake.
The games themselves were fun and we had a great time after we were taken back.  The girls explained how to use everything very well, and the waitresses were so attentive to our needs while we were there.  If it weren't for the check in issues I would definitely recommend this for a fun night out, but the management and some of the employees really need to sort out check in and how they resolve miscommunications.

PS Tyler is the best one there."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a Co worker we decided to give this place a try, went in and everything was good, once we started playing we ran out of mags and literally stood there waiting for a waitress to change the mags out but they never came. I had to approach a waiter to replace the used mags. Once the waitress came we placed our food orders and when our food came the orders were taken to the wrong booths. What was worse was that we paid 45 an hour but literally spent at least 20 mins waiting for the waitress to bring us more mags so we can play some more. After receiving the bill the waitresses made many mistakes billing everyone for each other's orders and they had to hudle to try and figure out was was going on, we waited 30 mins for them to sort it out, after paying we waited 15 mins for our change in which one of the waitresses told a person in our group to f*ck off  for pointing out the horrible customer service. Will never return to this place again nor recommend it to anyone. horrible customer service. This place looks nice and fancy but it's all looks, they do not take care of their customers. Very unprofessional and unorganized"}
{"text":"Fancy arcade/bar/entertainment. For the price you pay going in large groups and splitting it up is pretty good. The games was fun, guns feel very legit and expensive. They really invest into all their supplies here. 5$ for a one year membership is pretty fair. 

The service was pretty good. Our server was nice and very good at checking up on us. Food was great but a little on the expensive side, so you will spend quite the money if you're going to buy food here. 

Anyways, my experience was great. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Took the wife out for a special event/dinner.  We arrived early and were well attended.  We got a shooting lounge, ordered drinks and some appetizers.    Buffalo Chicken egg rolls, mushroom fries, fish tacos, all very good.  

Note - since it was just the two of us, shooting for one hour straight was quite a bit.  It would have been better as a double date, sharing costs and splitting the time."}
{"text":"The shooting games and the atmosphere were great. There are a few reasons why I didn't give it a higher rating. An annual membership fee is kind of ridiculous, especially considering that a place like Top Golf is a one-time membership fee (that's half the price, by the way). Luckily, our memberships were included in the price of a Groupon we bought, which is about the only way to make this place affordable. Like many others have said, it also gets frustrating when your ammo runs out faster than they can replace it. Even then, sometimes the new ammo still doesn't work or the guns malfunction, which gets frustrating. It's still fun overall, and the concept is very cool. I would go again... with a Groupon, of course ;-)"}
{"text":"Our waitress Courtney gave us the best service. We had a blast and I'm definitely going to tell my friends about how good the service is and how fun the experience is! They will definitely see me back here again"}
{"text":"The service was horrible from beginning to end. The gal that explained how everything works was so un enthusiastic and monotone it was rediculous. Our food/drink server messed up every item and was so ditsy that it was astonishing. As a business, you cant just hire cute girls without a brain,  because not everyone just cares about eye candy, some people actually want service and a good experience. It took forever to load games, and get new co2 cartridges so that most of the hour was wasted that we payed for. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Staff turnover has caused the place to go downhill. Service is NOT what it was. Most of the regular hostess and wait staff have left, seems so disorganized. After reading some comments the of the staff having problems with the managers it's no wonder. Sad, hope they replace some of the top and get some consistency with the servers and hostesses."}
{"text":"Customer service here is a joke.  Our party arrived 20 minutes early for a 5:30 PM reservation, completed registration, and sat at the bar waiting for the text notification.  5:30 PM came and went and still nothing.  Checked 3 times with the clueless hostesses and they said it should be anytime. Finally At 7 PM went to talk to the front desk person who proceeded to tell us our phone was notified, no one responded, and we had now lost our reservation.  Complete waste of time with watered down drinks for nothing.  Obviously I will not be back, nor will any of my friends or clients."}
{"text":"When this place opened I was stoked! The first visit was great! The food and drinks were amazing the only thing that made me mad was the reservation still had us wait 30+ mins. My second visit was good food and atmosphere was awesome. My third visit during a week day was okay. The food was terrible and they told us the company who made their co2 hand guns discontinued them. The stimulated shooting was what made it fun! We will probably be back."}
{"text":"First off, a big thank you shout out to Yelp, because without it, there's NO WAY I would have found this place.  Who would have imagined a place in the ultra-suburban West Valley where you could play life-size video games with air pistols while eating really freaking good food!  It saved our family visit weekend!

The games were fun, the food was really top notch.  What impressed me most was how smoothly they handled the whole introduction to the concept.  My husband isn't good at trying out \"new\" concepts (he couldn't handle the dine-in movie theater, for example).  However, he felt right at home and took to this place like a duck to water.  Soon, he was slaying zombies in between bites of his gourmet hamburger like he'd been doing it all his life.  I'm worried he may want to visit Peoria again and again.

The place lost a star simply because it is pretty expensive, with a lot of effort put into it being a high-end experience, with decor, food and prices to match.  If that's what you're into, then I suppose paying more for it wouldn't bug you.  But I\"m more into being a fuddy old person these days, and I'd have preferred a little less hip-class.  For the 2 of us, an hour-and-a-half game lounge rental two meals and two drinks, it came out to about $180 with tip (and we didn't go for the upgraded game packages).  It'd be cheaper per-person with a group, since the rental is fixed and not based on occupancy, but for date night, it was a little steep.

Finally, the air pistols and rifles are really pretty cool.  Having experience with real firearms, they certainly feel MORE real than the plastic toys that come with a Wii, but they're not uncomfortably real (with huge recoil and deafening noise) so that's nice.  However, the air cartridges play out quick, and the staff wasn't good about getting us new ones at the pace we were blasting through them.  Maybe this is better on busy nights, or maybe its worse."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place but expensive and the guns kept jamming. Being that you pay for time it would have been nice to have that time back when I couldn't shoot because the gun jammed"}
{"text":"Lots of fun!  I think the food is too high end for a shooting joint,be better with plain old bar food. Place was clean and service was great. Will go back again"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. Went to one of their soft openings. The staff was amazing. There was never a time I was wishing someone would come to ask if I needed another drink or if I would like another appetizer. The food was phenomenal. The hot dog Wellington is for sure a must try for hot dog lovers. The games were fun. While there are real life simulations for the people that want to do that type of shooting, there are also games for people who may not be comfortable with a firearm, for example duck hunt. The CO2 cartridges give the weapon a little realistic kick, and the weight is realistic as well. Place is good for groups as well as a couple. The finishes were high end. Beautifully done."}
{"text":"Was thinking about doing something here in the spirit of Veterans Day. NOPE. No specials thought it would be a cool place for some younger vets to get together."}
{"text":"I made reservations for my friends birthday and we all had a blast! The frickles were bomb if you like fried pickles! There was 4 of us and we drank and ate for 2 hours of shooting and it was affordable and fun. It was all of our first time and we will def be back. The Zombie games were my favorite, I even screamed because I couldn't kill this one that was slapping at my face....virtually of course, but my scream was real! Lol!!"}
{"text":"We took my dad here today for his birthday and had a blast! We made a reservation online which is the way to go. I can imagine there is a wait for walk ins. Everyone was super helpful in getting us registered since it was our first time. They took us to our shooting lounge and discovered a small technical problem but they worked hard to fix it, kept in constant communication with us while they worked on it, took our drink orders while we waited and then gave us 30 extra minutes of play time for the trouble. 

There are a ton of different games to play so there was something for everyone in our group ranging from teens to seniors. We passed on the live action scenarios today but we will be back to try them another day. We had 3 pistols and one rifle and they were quick to provide new co2 cartridges so you were never waiting for for them. There is also a tv in the lounge if you are tired of watching others shoot. 

We ordered a bunch of shareable items to eat. We tried the buffalo chicken spring rolls, mac and cheese puffs, hot dog Wellington, portobello mushroom fries and the charcuterie plate. There was a ton of food and everyone got to try everything. Everything was delicious. The cocktails are also quite tasty and they don't skimp on the alcohol. 

The service today is what led me to give them 5 stars. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful and it made for a great experience. The free sundae for my dads birthday was also a nice treat!

The place is very sleek and stylish. The couches in the shooting lounges are quite comfortable and there is a full bar with plenty of seating if you find yourself having to wait for a lounge. The bathrooms are also very nice and very clean."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance went a few months ago. Super fun. Staff was very nice and even though we played through our 2 hours and had to change our guns a few times because they weren't working right, the manager gave us a 10 dollar off chip for our next visit. 

My son is turning 11 this week and we are taking him there this weekend to celebrate his birthday with video games, food and hopefully another stellar experience"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was the bartender and the food... the amount of money we spent for my birthday for the crappy service we got once we went back to our area was severely lacking!!! My guests were constantly having to chase down servers for a damn drink... the guns malfunctioned immensely and certain games you needed those guns to work properly or resort to using the non air version which the triggers were absolute garbage and left cuts and blisters on several of my guests... also the refills for he guns were almost non existent leaving me or my guests to chase someone down for those too!!! Between the crappy servers, guns, and piss poor treatment of our guests for asking for help we will never spend money here again, nor will we ever recommend anyone to this place!!! Social media will aid in that as well.... what a terrible waste of $300 my wife spent on my friends and myself and ruining my 30th birthday... for that kind of money she could have bought me 1000 rounds of ammo or a hotel for a couple nights in vegas.... don't go here folks it's tacky and not worth your hard earned cash... go to a real range and learn some life skills.. forgot to mention that the tv in our area didn't work so my guests couldn't even watch the game when it wasn't their turn to shoot... and not even a single apology for it.. the waitstaff just kinda shrugged and look at us like we were a holes for mentioning it..."}
{"text":"You guys hire some dense people. We paid 3 separate ways and she still gave change total. Like. If we pay three separate ways, we probably each want our change. She seemed confused by the fact we each wanted our own change. When people pay separately, they tend to prefer their money back. Not left with a bill we can't split ourselves cause we needed smaller bills... In no universe does \"we are paying separately with cash each\" mean \"we are putting this all together so ONE person gets change. Then when we asked them \"Hey, can we get this separately?\" They stared at us with blank looks because I guess they did not understand??

Obviously a minor annoyance, hence why I didn't give like, 1 star. But come on.. Getting in the door was so frustrating and kinda set the tone for the night.

The drinks are a bit overpriced. Pre-game before hand!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place when I was in town for Spring Training last week. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when my friends told me they wanted to go there..mainly because I thought they had real guns and that doesn't sound very safe around alcohol! As it turns out the shooting is virtual reality and it is SUPER COOL. I felt like a cop on Chicago PD! A bad ass cop. As much fun as I had shooting, I had just as much fun eating and drinking! For some reason I ordered a chocolate martini (probably because I saw another chick drinking one and it looked good). It was delicious! I wanted to drink ten of them, but I was staying on the other side of town and I probably wouldn't have made it back to my hotel if I had. I also had a burger (I think it was called \"The Shot\" or \"Big Shot\"? I don't often rave about burgers but this one was pretty special. Smoked Gouda, caramelized onions, and bacon. Wow, that was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. Unbelievable. I am salivating just thinking about it. Anyhow, to sum things up this place had a super cool unique atmosphere and (somewhat surprisingly) amazing food and drinks. If you live in the Phoenix area (or are there for spring training) I highly recommend checking it out. Definitely an experience you don't see every day!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and the last 2 times I've had the same bartender Zarah!! She's amazing always checking on me for refills or another drink (she remembered my drink from the 1st time I saw her) and also recommend some great food both times too! Always a fun time there shooting the simulator but great time at the bar also!! Zarah is the best there!!"}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean. The food was good and average price for the area. The shooting makes the place with plenty of scenarios, games, and fun.  The guns are CO2 recoil guns so a little better than just a video game and the defense scenarios are nice for learning. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great concept. The food is a step above bar food. I have been here 2 times, both times I had a reservation for a bay and everyone was pre registered with memberships. Both times we waited in line for 30-40 mins to pay for the bay and get to our bay. There has to be a better way. 1st time I thought a fluke, 2nd time I realized this is a flaw in the system."}
{"text":"What a nice add to Peoria. Was definitely impressed. The staff is really nice and professional as well. The shooting is awesome! Next time I go on a date, we are going there."}
{"text":"Interesting concept... Little firing guns while having beers. Food was great and the staff was vey friendly. AR15's were fun to play with and all the games seemed to be fun. The braised pork poutine was awesome! Lots of fun, we will be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I really enjoyed our Sunday Funday; at this location. The drinks were good, we enjoyed the wonderful ambience. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Love hanging out at Modern Round and Zarah makes the best drinks!! The convo and company isn't too bad either"}
{"text":"This place is a little strange. Not sure how I feel about the whole concept of upscale shooting game experience. I went with some friends who wanted to try it and had fun, but I can't say I would plan to go back again. It was a little overpriced and the experience was nothing spectacular"}
{"text":"Visited this weekend. Cool concept, nice atmosphere. No gluten free choices, but most places are that way still. Gave it 3 stars because we had a jr (12, which is age limit) with us so we chose to just play the basic (jr friendly) game package. All of the suites are just open area with big screens and your own seating, so you can hear the mature package if they are near you. F bombs were flying behind us. Normally that would be ok but we had a kid in tow. The place wasn't full, so they could have put them on the other side, but they didn't even think about it. Totally a 4 star place but gave 3 stars because of that. Servers were all super nice."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Modern Round a few months ago, I would have given it 5 stars.  Since we had such a great experience that time, we decided to go back and bring along some friends. 

We tried to plan our night and we were disappointed when only a 10pm time slot with your online reservation system was available.  We are not late night people and we decided to can the idea and try again the following week. 

I hopped online a few days before we planned to go and was baffled again that the only available reservations were 4pm, or 10pm and later. Luckily my group was able to make the 4pm time slot work. 

We arrived on time and I noticed that the parking lot was empty. The lobby was empty. The bar was empty. We checked in at the front, paid for our shooting bay in advance and they escorted us inside. 

We were immediately disappointed that the handguns with the CO2 cartridges (which simulated recoil in the weapon) were no longer a part of the experience.  The hostess said that they kept \"breaking and were too expensive to fix\".  Why wasn't this told to us before we paid while we were \"checking in\"??  Our friends were not fortunate enough to have the same experience we did when we went the first time. This place is charging 45$ an hour just to play and it's too expensive to fix a CO2 gun?  Come on. 

We decided to stay anyway. We chatted, drank beer, ate some wings, and played some games for our first hour. At 5pm, I commented to the group that the place was still empty.  At 6pm we observed the same thing. 

We left around 6:30pm (Still, at a minimum, 10 empty bays) and we stopped at the front desk.  I directed my question to one of the girls I had remembered from our first visit. I asked why the online reservation showed only a 4pm and 10pm slot available but the place was obviously empty.  She began to answer me when another woman with an accent interrupted her. She tried to explain that they had a lot of reservations booked but not all the parties were there yet. Really?  We observed at least 10 empty bays on the first floor alone. I asked, \"do you leave bays empty for walk-ins?\"  Her answer was \"no\" that you have to make a reservation at least three hours in advance. This makes no sense!!   A 5 or 6pm time slot would have been easier for my group. 

I'm disappointed with this experience and my friends were unimpressed.  Sorry Modern Round, I don't see you making it in this business. Your online reservation system obviously failed and you need to bring back the recoil CO2 handguns.  Or - charge less money per hour for the glorified video game system, because that's really what it is."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for a birthday party. Was never told that there could only be 8 people in each area until the minute we all started signing up. We even said by multiple people that we had 9 in our group from the get go. The 9th person wasn't even aloud to be in the same booth. Weird because the website asks how many people in your group and you can select over 9. It was fun and especially with a group of people however very expensive. Not sure how we paid $75 for one hour but didn't seem right.  Would like to come back but unfortunately don't think we will return. Too many little issues for the amount of money just my husband and I paid ($75 for JUST one hour of games)"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun! A lot to learn during your first visit as their is a small learning curve. Hostesses up front had a hard time explaining everything in a clear matter. However, once you get the hang of it, it is a lot of fun! Make sure to pay extra for the \"training scenarios.\" We did not and we watched others' screens all night wishing we had. You cannot decide later to add the training videos unless you purchase more time. Service was very attentive except for when we ran out of mags a couple of times and had to wait for more to be given to us. Did not try the food. Great place for groups."}
{"text":"Tried this place for something different.  It's a great combination of food and entertainment.  It's a cool concept.  You play games using electronic guns in your own semi private area.  You have a comfortable couch area with a huge screen.  You can also just dine in.  The food was fantastic.  I had the salmon sliders with French fries that were to die for.  The service was great. I recommend it for a fun night out with friends or family."}
{"text":"I thought this place had a really cool concept and I have to admit, it was fun, but I'm giving it 3 stars because this place has the potential to be even better. By the time the hour finished for my group, we were ready to head out, unlike when we go to top golf and end up playing for about 2-3 hours! The prices are very fair here and reasonable for the experience, but I hope that in the future, they can make their games more realistic and interactive! It was kind of just like shooting games at Dave and busters. Stationary, shooting at the targets. If they made it more interactive where we'd have to move around a bit, it's definitely be a game changer!"}
{"text":"Not my place.  Although, to be fair, I did not do the entire experience.  But we went for drinks.  No one in the place and it was SLOW!!  The drinks were high priced and the specials were not clear.  

May go back one day and rent a stall, but I will NOT go back to hang at the bar and eat."}
{"text":"I've been sitting on this review for a bit. Not because I was busy (although I was). But because after celebrating my girlfriend's birthday at Modern Round, it left me feeling \"meh\". It was my first visit and her second. From how she described her previous experience, I was really interested in checking this place out. However, after thinking about it for a couple of weeks, this is what I've concluded.

Modern Round makes an impressive first impression. The lobby gives off a luxurious feel. And the computer interfaces that are necessary for \"registration\" are pretty slick. The staff was friendly, but somehow, also completely incapable of organizing our group of ten in a timely fashion. Remember, you're paying for the time.

Once we got to our lounges, a quick demonstration explained how simple the equipment and simulations are. Despite the fact that these are not real guns, the staff made sure to emphasize safety. Kudos! That's how you're supposed to handle something that so closely resembles a real weapon.

The simulations range from clever, to fun, to fairly realistic. There are head-to-head games, target practice, and even police and military simulations. Everyone took turns and participated in the games that appealed to them. However, not everyone's names were always present on the screens for scoring purposes. It was as if half of the group were supposed to play in the first hour when their name was on screen, and then do nothing for the next hour.

Several appetizers and buckets of beer were consumed. So we got a pretty healthy sampling of what the kitchen is capable of. Let's just say, it's a good thing that they don't bottle the beers. I overheard more than a few of those in our group mentioning how salty the food was. It was good, but not great. It definitely wasn't worth what we paid for it.

Here's the bottom line. Modern Round is a great concept. It's hard to say that it's an expensive way to pass the time, namely because we had such a large group. But, it would be great if they could at least make it seem as if they've had large groups before. And work on that menu! Frankly, I would've rather spent a couple hours at a real shooting range."}
{"text":"Came in for first time for birthday get together for husband and I. Concept was awesome, our server was great. Had to minus 2 stars for the girls who run the front. Very rude and didn't help much with questions we were asking. We're too busy taking with each other about personal stuff. Very tacky. Replace them and this place would get 5 stars! First impression is everything!!"}
{"text":"Service absolutely terrible.. 40 mins for just a drink.. Manger was useless to a point of accusing us of having an agenda whatever that meant.. Unless management changes go else where.. Birthday party not a happy one..
Having said that the night did end on a great tone our server in the suite was wonderful and went above and beyond to make the rest of the night fantastic.. I will be back because of her"}
{"text":"I love this place! I seem to always come when \"zarah\" is working and she is absolutely amazing! She's very attentive and nice :)

I love the food here as well. Funny enough I've never actually played here but it looks a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Usually, being anywhere more upscale than a Denny's yields me gazes of confusion from wall to wall (Ya'know, that good ol' \"Are you sure you're in the right place sir?\" look), however my experience here was much more pleasant.  The ladies are all well kept, from their uniforms down to their elegant accessories. Our server (Elizabeth) was pretty \"dope\" as the hip kids would say! WARNING: A few of the live action actors were pretty horrible, so I had a number of \"accidental\" civilian casualties haha."}
{"text":"Totally unexpected fancy \"schmancy\" shooting arcade makes great strides in entertaining the west side of town. The staff really invests in the atmosphere and stays in character the entire time. By atmosphere, they make it seem very James Bond-esque. As you are escorted to your shooting gallery area, the hostesses dressed in skin tight body-con cocktail dresses are handcuffed to the silver attaché cases filled with the AR-15 and pistols that would be used for the duration of your stay. 
What makes these guns special is that they have CO2 cartridges so you feel some recoil when shooting. There are 2 guns that have laser aim assistance with no CO2 cartridges that have \"unlimited\" ammo but the other four guns require reloads. 
While shooting, we were well attended to with notable bar food. We really enjoyed the filet sliders. We also ordered the poutine fries. We were also never short of cocktails. 
Some things to keep aware of: make sure to register beforehand. It's free to become a \"member,\" but it'll just speed up the process of checking in when you arrive. During the holidays and weekends, you may want to make reservations to make sure you get in or at least at a decent time so you don't have to wait long. There's also a full restaurant menu if you just want to eat and grab drinks if you don't feel like shooting. It's a really neat Vegas like atmosphere with 2 stories of fun. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! The wait is super long even with reservation. We waited almost until 10 and the games weren't worth it! The waitress and bartender we had were cool but the staff lags professionalism! Oh and reservations don't matter here bc it's first come first serve or unless you bitch a million times about when you can shoot. I'm never going back my party wasn't impressed either we left within an hour. Shitty! Don't let good reviews fool you, our time spent was a waste!"}
{"text":"Something different to do, where you also can get some good food and drinks.  Make a reservation if you plan on also doing the virtual shooting. If not there is also a dining area and huge bar.  The virtual shooting is fun you can get a personal lounge for up to 6 people, where you can use an automatic rifle or handgun that are powered with co2 and are very realistic.  There are all sorts of games from zombies, realistic, to war.  The food and drinks are pretty extensive.  I tried a Cuban Sami and a white sangria and both were good!  The staff was very attentive and always exchanging our CO2 cartridges for the guns.  The lounges and the whole place were done pretty swanky!  I was pretty impressed with the whole thing."}
{"text":"Came here two or three time had different servers but the server I had today her name was Anna was the best ever. Will definitely come back again for her."}
{"text":"This place was great! The shooting scenarios were fun, and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the short rib and Gouda \"flatbread\" (pizza). If I had a complaint it would be that the beer is overpriced, but that's not enough of an issue to keep us from returning. Expect to spend at least $100 a couple though."}
{"text":"This is a really awesome place. From the many many shooting lounges, to the amazing food, to the really cool dessert menu, it's definitely a great place to bring the family, go on a date, or any occasion! I'd definitely recommend this amazing new place!"}
{"text":"As an avid shooter this was something I was looking forward to.  The atmosphere is unique, the food was on point & it appears they have a full bar.  We had problems with the guns a couple times, minor stuff but considering it was $60 for an hour and we were down +5 mins and at that price it seems like everything should run flawlessly.  The trigger pull on the pistols are ridiculously heavy, its a workout playing for 10 mins.  The AR's have a lighter trigger, so I used it most of the time.  The games were fun, we opted to try the police & military simulations.  The simulations are almost impossible to beat, but probably is closer to reality than most \"gamers\" are use to.  Overall a fun experience, but for my wife & I to play for 1.5 hours plus 2 meal, 1 app & softdrinks it was $120 plus tip.  If the cost was lower or the equipment worked better this would've easily been a 4 of 5 stars.  Fun place, don't forget to bring some cash"}
{"text":"I was in the area to handle some business and wanted to have a little fun. I was referred by a friend who had been once before so I thought why not. I found the place to be a little over rated. Ambiance was beautiful though. The guns didn't work and it didn't seem like the girls were there to help their customers. A bit pricey for the experience. Why do I need to pay for a year pass when I'm only coming once?  The cost for the hour was way expensive too. I probably would not come back here. I can shoot and play video games at home."}
{"text":"Seems like it could be a fun concept for groups, but after arriving with our party we found the check-in process to be too lengthy and cumbersome. About 40 minutes after our planned reservation time we gave up and left."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun. Great food, drinks, and shooting zombies. The Monte Carlo scenario is the best, don't pay extra for the Live Action Scenarios. They aren't nearly as much fun as killing zombies, spiders, and robots. Tons of fun all around!"}
{"text":"First off, this place smells terrible inside. Second, the pricing is ridiculous for basically the same thing you can do on your Xbox or play station. I really hope I don't have to come here again, it's so loud, the only reason I'm here is to be the DD. The only good thing is that our server was nice."}
{"text":"We went here last night for a friends bday..our reservation was for 5pm. When we arrived we checked in and went and sat at the bar, we were the only people there and yet still had to wait for the servers to stop talking to come help us ( about 10 min). We ordered drinks and then we went to check again on when we would be seated, while we waited for the rest of our party.

When they took us to our seats we were sat upstairs in a back corner , they set up all our stuff and showed us how to use the guns. however, the area was quite hot. We asked for the air to be turned down and they did but it was still quite warm. The GM ( aurelio/rio) came upstairs visibly annoyed that we had complained. And when I say visibly I mean he looked annoyed and spoke to us in a condescending tone. He stated the generator was down in that area and it may or may not cool down. He stated they had a fan in the booth next to ours and could move it over. We asked to be moved downstairs to which he said \" I can either buy you a round of drinks or move you downstairs\" ,we opted for downstairs and grabbed our stuff to get up..he told us to calm down and to wait as they had to reset everything for us downstairs and find a booth.

When they moved us down no guidance was given..no one told us our time had started and we could start the games. Our set up wasn't the same, upstairs our names had been on the screen and downstairs it only said guest. About 10 minutes after we were seated a waitress came and switched out our guns saying something about the wrong numbers. After another 10 or so minutes, another waitress came and we asked her when we could start. She said we were ready to start and we asked for our names to be on the screen so we could track scores. she took our names and said she would get the GM. Rio returned with his same poor attitude, telling us the names would be set up but it would take a while. As well he stated he added 2 hours to our time, it was about 610 at this time. So we play , we eat, we drink, trying not to be miffed about the way we are being spoken to by the GM. And our time runs out, we get the waitress , she brings over a different  manager whose name I didn't catch. He gives us a gift card for a free hour and that was it.

This place is a cool concept but the service was BEYOND disappointing. To have a GM have such an attitude after we'd already spent over $100 in their establishment is beyond me, and he never once offered an apology or was sincere in his efforts. I'm not sure I would return."}
{"text":"I really like the concept but a little pricey, guess you can expect that as it is entertainment driven. I have not taken my kids yet due to pricing and time restraints. The food was really good and drinks are great. The guns had a few issues though taking up some time overall they made an effort to corrwct. I will eventually try it again with my kids hopefully on a weekday when it's more cost effective. If you haven't been I would say you have to try it."}
{"text":"First time I've every written a review but I feel I need to. Long story short had reservations for 8:00 couples got sitters and showed up a little early. Was told it would be an hour to and hour and a half even with reservations. I got the manager to complain that we had gotten sitters and had to get up at 3 in morning for work. She told us reservations don't really matter but would try to help. After 20 minutes walked to a nearby bar and had a few drinks. On my way home at 9:40 I got a text that my table was ready. An hour and forty minutes after my reserved time. First time I went I enjoyed the games but food was so so. In fact the chicken and waffles tasted so weird we sent it back an got a salad that was pretty sorry looking. Not sure I'll ever go back or really recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow, wish 0 stars was an option. we had 4 guns replaced because they didn't work.. wasting easily half our time. Some of the team said don't worry we will add time, then some random ammo refill guy with a goatee showed up and offered us $10 off our next trip.. and no extension because they were too busy. Basically telling us we don't matter.. No discount at all. Other people here seemed to have fun.. too bad we got the broken setup. The server was nice cannot say anything bad there. Overall not worth it and very disappointed.  Could be so much better.. :("}
{"text":"We had a blast at Modern Round today celebrating my husbands birthday. We made a reservation online for two lounges since there was 14 of us. The staff was very friendly and helped get us all signed up since it was all our first time. 

The shooting was a lot of fun. About 4 hand guns and 2 rifles to choose from. They are filled with co2 so you get the same kick back as a real gun. They have a ton of free games to play and you can upgrade $10 to add the live action games.

The food and drinks were very good. Our server was awesome and constantly checking in on us. We got the frickles, hot dog Wellington(AMAZING!), beef sliders, quesadilla, and ended with the bacon wrapped Oreos. Everything was super good. 

For your birthday they give you a $10 credit on your game and you also get a cute coffee cup Sunday with a candle for dessert. You even get to keep the cup. 

We had a lot of fun and can't wait to come back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Alexis was an outstanding waitress, she took care of our party of 9 with ease. She was very friendly and had a great personality, I would recommend this place of business any day of the week."}
{"text":"Food was really good desert was amazing. Didn't get to shoot but looked like a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Modern Round is a fun and different gaming/social concept. I think if they somehow could work out the kinks in the equipment this place would get more 5 star reviews. We went at 9 pm on a Friday night. On weekends they have a 2 hour max lounge reserve time. We had made a reservation online. The place was packed. We only had to wait 20 minutes for a lounge to open so I don't have complaints about the wait time. You have to pay $5 to register but it lasts a year. Depending on the day and time you go, the prices per hour differ. Friday nights are $45 an hour but that covers up to 6 people so for me I think this is a deal. We paid for 2 hours but left about 15 minutes before our session ended because our fingers were sore (from the equipment). The place is clean inside and has a large bar. You don't have to play games to go and have a drink and eat either. We paid extra for the upgrade for real life scenarios which includes the police and military training scenarios. They have quite a few games to choose from as well as training drills. You can play, single, co-op or against each other. 

Now the equipment is my only complaint. The service was actually really good. Our servers were friendly and were good about switching out our faulty guns and making sure we had a continuous supply of air clips for the AR rifle. The AR is the only  gun with the air recoil. The handguns are just regular laser point and shoot. The triggers suck! For the fast shooting games your fingers hurt bad. It makes sense on the training scenarios but not the other games. Our guns triggers kept sticking and the AR would randomly shoot in burst mode. I feel the triggers should be fixed to be easier to shoot. I understand it is meant to feel like real life guns with the whole trigger pull pounds, but not when you are shooting at a hoard of zombies haha. 

The food was pretty good and the drink prices were what you would expect pretty much anywhere. Cheaper than Scottsdale. We only got French fries as a snack, but the food I saw going around looked good. 

Overall this place is fun and different. If you are someone easily offended don't play the real life military scenarios since the bad guys are Muslim. I know that strikes a chord with people. I was there to have fun so who cares. It's a game."}
{"text":"I want to award 10 stars to Modern Round! My husband and I have been fans here since the opening and have enjoyed every time we have come here. Tonight, however, was exceptional! We were privileged to have Bennie as our server and she was amazing! Her phenomenal customer service truly made the evening  special for our out of town guest. Bennie took care of our every need and special request. The food came out quickly and perfectly done. I had the quinoa and arugula salad with chicken- extremely delicious. My husband had the southwestern chop salad which he enjoyed. Our guest had the signature chicken and waffles which are truly an experience and a work of art. It was an excellent evening and Bennie truly made us VIPS. We will for sure to come back and request her!"}
{"text":"The concept of his place is cool and unique. The execution needs some adjusting. Granted they have not even held a grand opening yet, the games have some kinks. Games not really built for a large group. Food was unique and edible. Overall theme is an upscale James Bond; would have been satisfied with stools and a table to put my beer on. Price is more expensive then I would have liked to pay. (About 170 for 5 ppl. For 2 hours of play time on a Friday night; Not including food and alcohol) 

Side note: the waitresses here appear to work there ass off. Our waitress was Phenomenal; but she was doing EVERYTHING! (Suggestion: have someone who tends to the games and gaming equipment.) This establishment is not suitable for children and does not claim to be; (suggestion: the bathrooms should have some area for nursing mothers/ changing babies.) Red baskets for the empty magazines, and a runner for the mags per each booth instead of one running around the whole place."}
{"text":"This is the greatest new concept/entertainment bar ever.  Upscale Atmosphere, food, drinks, music, and play games with guns.  Like laser tag for adults.  Feel your inner James Bond!  Such fun!"}
{"text":"Hi Miranda,

Just wanted to let you know we really appreciate your review for modern round. We came in and sat down and the couple next to us were playing the military that involved shooting Arabs. We took a big offense to it being Muslim and Arabs ourselves. Seeing these kinds of games that just reinforce stereotypes is so hard and to go on Yelp find your review was a nice breath or air. Thank you for using your voice even if you were the only one.



When i arrived to this place I was very excised. I've grown up with guns all my life and thought it was really clever idea. The food the service was exceptional.

The reason my review is the lowest possible is because of one issues that really doesn't sit well with me. The games they have for option have zombie scenarios, fishing, hunting, robbery ect. One of the options is live scenarios of war. It show a Muslim man wearing a hijab kidnapping people and you have to shoot them. I found this extremely racist and disturbing. I get that is live war scenario. However i didn't see Natzi soldiers or Viet Kong. Even if they were in live scenario as well that would completely be inappropriate and wrong. That's how you raise hate in each others eyes by targeting a specific race.I have hard working friends of that culture that are AMERICAN and are afraid to even wear their Hijab out in public without being targeted for a hate crime.

Call of Duty is a war game a and your fighting against other soldiers no race is distinguished between enemies. 

I strongly encourage Modern Round to eliminate the games that target hate and racism towards the Muslim Community."}
{"text":"You have to sign up for membership before being able to go inside and play. They charge everyone a members fee for the year without telling us. They charged $10 for better quality shooting board/screens. Which we opted in on. 

Actual playing time was fun, however loading up the mags inside the guns takes away time! Especially if you run out before them giving you some more. I just wasn't hype afterwards about it. I guess you can say it was mediocre for me.... it's image got me inside (curiosity) but don't waste your money. Go down to the arcades instead you'll save a grip!

I did get a AMF while there. It tasted horrible too lol! I did not win that night."}
{"text":"Fun place, but way too expensive! The music was loud and we couldn't hear the scenarios on our screen :-/ small tables for eating in the couch area made it rough to enjoy the time."}
{"text":"A brand new spot with a lot of potential success ahead. For being a Sunday during off season, it's pretty busy in here. Good service from the bar and food is decent enough. Love the concept , and seems like a lot of fun with a large group.

Environment - 5
Service - 4
Food - NA (only had an appetizer)
Drink Selection - 4

Would love to see more local beers on selection, and a full bar that can do an old fashion. Service is good, but could be a \"wow\" with some tweeks. I look forward to seeing this place after being open for more than a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Modern Round and I feel it deserves a good review. 

The first time I came it was on St. Patrick's Day. Our server was friendly and the staff was nice. I ordered a turkey panini for lunch and it came with fries. It wasn't the greatest but you can't do much with a turkey sandwich. 

Tonight's visit was for my cousins birthday. We had a big family together and everyone enjoyed their time. Nina was very helpful and made sure our ammos were always ready to go. Every question was answered and help was given when trying to load in the ammo for the rifle.

The virtual reality goggles for the dessert menu was neat. We ordered ice cream sandwiches and they were delicious! My cousin received a free ice cream in a keepsake ceramic mug that comes with a spoon! They even lit a candle on top and she got to blow it out. 

Great service tonight. Thanks Modern Round."}
{"text":"First time here hostess was great showed us around. This place is so pretty and modern. I enjoyed the mixture of music and the element. There was many groupings some singles mingling, couples, and groups hanging out, very diverse in culture as well which was a nice thing to see. The people were very friendly and the decor was sexy. It looked like a upscale club but without the dress code and need to dress up. I truly enjoyed it. They had live big screens where you can play shooting games while you eat and drink. The food was tasty we ordered filet mignon sliders with fries. The sliders were great tender and had caramelized onion on them delicious hold the bleu cheese :) we will definitely return! Thanks MR Staff"}
{"text":"Really amazing, food was good, drinks were great, whole concept was amazing. Service was excellent!!! Worth every penny and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came into Modern round to shoot, have dinner and drinks. The environment is classy and the food was delicious. Zarah took great care of us and had a great personality."}
{"text":"Super fun place to come. We came for my sons 14th bday. It would be a great place for a date night as well."}
{"text":"Zarah made our night! We Stumble them here thinking it was a sushi bar. Come to find out, it is a awesome adult arcade games business. They made us Long Island's which were great the establishment was clean but service was excellent and Zara was amazing. We stayed here for for drinks when we came in for one. Thank you Sarah for the hospitality and we will be back to do one of the virtual shooting ranges."}
{"text":"Awesome place! We had a birthday party for my boyfriend here. The group was about 16 people and we had reserved 2 lounges. Nobody from the group had been to this place before and all loved it, the experienced shooters as well as the novice.  The service was great and very flexible. The lounge was large and comfortable. At times it seemed like the aim wasn't accurate but it didn't stop anyone from having a great time. Price is reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great new place and great concept..like top golf (but with guns)!  The place gives off a bit of a Vegas vibe and to be honest I was kind of put off by the doormen-thinking this was going to be some fancy high dollar place...not so but we did just drive by and not stop in last week because we thought we were underdressed.  Great bar and food-cheeseboard was fantastic!  Bartender Deanna was very knowledgable and helpful in making pics.  Grilled chicken skewer with pineapple and jalapeño with BBQ sauce...little kick there but great!  You can rent a shooting lounge area by the hour.  Zombies - targets- law enforcement scenario simulators...your pick of games.  Two types of guns. All are weighted to feel real.  One type has a laser with no kick-the other a co2 cartridge which gives a kick and no laser.  If you want to just hang in the bar and drink and people watch...you will not be disappointed.  PS-Deanna makes a wicked chocolate martini!"}
{"text":"I Really hope this amazing concept is just experiencing Growing pains...  

Be aware there is a sign up process when you get there...  This takes a bit to get thru...  Should have an online pre-register option... 

The actual gun play is mediocre at best as there's no bang,  little kick (recoil) and found us going thru Mags faster then they could resupply them causing down time.... 

They advertise this establishment as an upper scale lounge but have a sub-par whiskey selection... (makers mark being about as top shelf as it got)  

The food was the Kicker...  It's was Sub-par and equal to Shwans finest Frozen...  I had the Short Rib \"poutine\"...  poutine is all in the gravy and this gravy was minimal and lacking and the Braised Short ribs was more like shredded roast beef from the deli...  Also the portobello fries I ordered came out as some stuffed mushrooms dish with hard cheese and sliced pre-cooked (frozen and thawed tasting) bacon on it... No horseradish sauce anywhere to be seen and nothing breaded... With that being the appetitezer round I choose not to get into entrees....

While the Hostess with the mostest ( I think.. Might even be a manager)  was awesome and seemed par for the course in her role... They should be less overbearing and more focused on what counts...  Good food,  a relaxing environment with a more upscale liqour selection..  I just think if you're going to advertise your establishment as upscale, then the food and drink must deliver....  

I will Give them another Visit in the future and hopefully see improvement on what could be a very awesome place to lounge...."}
{"text":"I went here last night with two other adults and two teenagers. We had a blast! The decor is sleek and modern. The staff was friendly and attentive and helped us get signed in. The prices are pretty reasonable, especially if you split the cost. You can have up to 6 people in your group. 

We were led to our lounge and given a brief demo of how the guns and system worked. Very simple and easy to use. I am not a video game person but I do enjoy shooting and this only requires a gun, not a controller. The kids, who are hooked on Fortnight, thought it was great. 

We ate while we were there and the food was pretty good. I had a burger that I requested medium well. It came out medium rare but still tasted good. I tried the wings and they were  delicious. The food is priced a little high for glorified bar food but it was flavorful.

Overall this was a great place for a family outing, especially in the summer when it's too hot to do anything else but swim."}
{"text":"OMG! Arranged for a birthday celebration to start at MR.Arrived at 11 in a weekday, had an awesome experience!- Alexis was our 'girl'- she kept the rounds going( drink wise and ammo!!)
Had a great experience,t hanks Matt... for the info on the games. Hubby was entertained and impressed.We had birthday shots, flat bread pizza, and a b- day Sunday w/ take home cup!! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The theme is Duck Hunt. Picture the game in modern settings. Video games with guns. Not real ones! The old Fox and Hound looks good. The mac and cheese bites are great too!"}
{"text":"Nope. Perhaps I am too old to get it. Just seems like the answer to the question no one on the Westside asked. Super upscale bar with loud toy gun shooting in the background. My $8 sangria was yummy and strong. My $12 frozen burger with limp fries not so much. ????"}
{"text":"First time in here last night with my wife and had a great time! The place looks amazing and is comfortable to start. The shooting games are fun and competition between friends and family is always a great time. The scenarios are pretty real and with the upgrade you can get a feel for what police have to decide on in their everyday job. The drinks are average food is better then typical bar food but still not a restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food or the drinks because we just came for the games. We paid extra for better games-waste, don't do it. Stick with the regular games. We had a lot of issues with the guns-the lasers kept going in and out and the Co2 cartridges were not always working. People next to us had different guns and we had no idea why. It could be fun but they have to do so me fixin."}
{"text":"I was given a groupon gift for 2 free hours of virtual fun for 4 people so i invited my buds n i must say it was pretty fun. There are so many games and scenarios to choose from u cant play them all but definately worth coming back to try the others. Food was great tasting n price was ok 12 wings for $8 n very good flavor. Service is on point they come around frequently to replace you with new CO2 tank mags for ur guns n drinks are always refilled. The establishment is small ao reservation is a must cuz booths can fill up fast, its a very nice classy place n i was told kids can be there is they r under 18yrs but must be with an adult im not sure how young though?. Drink prices r very reasonable also. Id def come bak again."}
{"text":"OMG this place was so much fun!!! We just traveled to the area for Spring Training and were going to attend a game at the Padres/Mariners facility and were looking for something new to do. I found Modern Round on line and it looked like something pretty cool to try and maybe eat, if we still had time.

You are set up and the girls get a silver case with your weapons which they handcuff to their wrist, just like protecting the nuclear codes, and walk you to your space. They give you a great tutorial on the pistols and assault rifle before getting you set up with your gaming experience. The pistols are real weight and have a little kick like a Glock. 

You have the basic shooting scenarios like target practice, duck hunting, Monte Carlo shoot out with gangsters and some Zombie Apocalypse scenarios. But, I would very much recommend upgrading, for $10, to get the Police and Military scenarios that are portrayed by real actors and are lifelike when you have to make a decision to shoot or not to shoot. It was so amazing.

A nice waitress took our drink orders and imagine, cold beer and guns, who would have thunk it??? They had a pretty good looking menu but there were only two of us shooting and your turn came up pretty quick so we just did not take the time to order food because we were so into the shooting that we did not want to waste any of our time. I would recommend either getting a table and eating before you shoot or when you're done, they can move you to a table and take your drinks with you and eat then.

I would book a reservation for a good two hours at least. We did an hour and a half and it went by pretty darn quick and we wanted to keep going but we had to get to the game. You can park there and just walk across the street to the stadium. This looked like it was getting to be quite the popular place so I would definitely call ahead and book a reservation."}
{"text":"Very unique place and cool experience. Swanky vegas club decor. Have to become a member in order to participate and you ha e to pay for it which seems weird. All just to get your email address for marketing. Bar service was very slow. Once in the area to play the live action games it got very fun. Our waitress Destiny did great! She was helpful with some gun issues, and informative and was fun.  I'd go again for sure"}
{"text":"An amazing place and really fun but we had a few issues. We came on a Thursday night. We had everyone in our party register at home. The sign in process took 45mins! They compensated our bill accordingly but it is an easy, fixable problem. Our waitress
was terrible. My husband has a dairy allergy and she managed to put cheese on everything he ordered. On a positive note the bar tenders were amazing and the food was decent. The gun games were really fun too. With good friends you can have a great time despite the bad service and long check in"}
{"text":"Terrrrrrrible. Slow service,crazy expensive. So disappointed that I picked this place for a going away party. You guys are ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place was SO much fun and something new to do! I came in town for my dads Birthday and wanted to try something new besides the same old \"Birthday Dinner\" After hearing great things about this place I gave it a try and SO happy I did. My dad and I had an awesome time and he really enjoyed himself. The food was great atmosphere even better, we will def be back! If you are looking for a fun day of shooting look no further"}
{"text":"The service at the restaurant was great. The waiter was extremely attentive, and the food was really yummy.  The environment was really classy and the layout was fun.  You can watch the groups that are shooting and they also play pretty good music.  The only problem that I saw was with the magazine cartridge refills. The group is only allotted a certain number of magazines, so you have to wait for the staff to refill them.  It is easy to burn through your rounds and the hour play goes by quick especially when you are waiting on refills. Overall the whole experience was fun and definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"I came in with a group of 10 and My first impression walking in was \"wow, they made this place look just like a strip club\".  Neon and fluorescent lights outside. The bartop looked like it was supposed to have a pole on one corner, and the chairs and decor matched the strip club look.
Our group got settled and watched the tutorial for the games and waited for a server.... and we kept waiting. Two other gals and I went up to the bar to get our drinks because we were tired of waiting. As we tried ordering from the bartender he told us we had a server and that she would be the one giving us drinks. We told him we waited over 10 minutes and just wanted to pay cash for our first round until the server actually showed up. We asked for a Doxx bottle, coorslight bottle, and blue moon on tap. He walked away and walked back with the doxx and said they didn't carry coordinated light bottles and it was only on tap. No biggie, I don't see why they don't have a popular domestic in a bottle but whatever, I don't like draft but I'll suck it up. He comes back with the coors light and asked \"ok what else?\" I told him a blue moon and at that point a server walked up(Very rudely) and asked why we're at the bar. She said she was the server for our party and told us to go sit back down and she'd take care of us. We told her we were ok, and we waited for a long time and she could grab our next round. She got a pissy and walked away. 
Back to the bartender, he finally came back with a blue moon and we asked how much for each. He said he didn't know the prices or any of the beers... how can you be a bartender and not know ANY prices of your beers? The two gals and I were visibly annoyed with the whole beginning experience and there was a manager watching this whole thing happen. He never came to talk to us and the bartender never told him. 
We sat back down and someone bought a round of shots. They were absolutely repulsive! Not one person liked the shot or even knew what it was supposed to be! It tasted like 151 with old orange juice and cranberry. 
The rest of the night was equally terrible. The server came by every 15 minutes. (When you have a party of 10, and all are drinking, you should be around more than every 15 minutes).
All in all, terrible! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, I'll just warn people not to go here because obviously management does care about anything in this place including snotty employees"}
{"text":"Depending on when you go - the price per hour varies.   Get a group together and it is reasonably priced.  Food prices are a little high but some drink prices are reasonable.  Make sure you get there with  your whole party so you do not lose reservation.  Once your reservation is active your time starts in your lounge.  It was a little disorganized at front desk and received different directions - attribute it to being new.    Once we were in the lounge - service was incredible!"}
{"text":"Today was our 2nd visit to Modern Round. Our first server was Natalie, and today we had Chaynna. BOTH servers were helpful, responsive, and kept us informed of our time. Chaynna asked before dropping off the check if an hour was going to be plenty, or did we want to extend our time? When I asked if we could extend 1/2 an hour rather than a full hour, she said, \"Of Course!\" and took care of that right on our bill so we didn't have to go back to the desk. That was so great! Our experiences both times were enhanced by the wonderful food and amazing service!

This is a beautiful facility and is fun for singles, couples, or families like us who feel that \"A family who plays together, stays together.\" We have a college student (girl) and a fifth grader (boy). The introductory lesson on gun safety matches what we teach at home that I (Mom) learned in my handgun safety course: Keep your weapon pointed in a safe direction at all times, keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot, and know your target and what is behind it. We had SO MUCH FUN!!!! It's great to have a private area and feel like you're having a nice meal and an adventure at the same time. We like to look over at the Live Action players' screens because they look so real! We have decided to upgrade to one of those when the offspring don't accompany us. Language and all.:)

The reception attendants are very helpful and friendly and we even picked up some merch they sell today. We love places like Dave and Buster's, but there is no comparison to the quality of Modern Round. The girls working are lovely, the artwork is visually stunning, and the food is amazing! The hot dog Wellington is yummy, the individual sliders are big enough burgers to eat and not feel hungry, the Big Shot burger is huge, the rib and gouda flatbreat is delicious, the Margherita flatbread is light and tasty, and the Mac and Cheese balls are scrumptious. On our next visit we think we'll try loaded fries, but I didn't have wipees in my bag and I didn't want to get the weapons messy! Hoping to try one of the weekday specials (It's cheaper during the week, early on Saturdays, and all day Sundays! Check out the deals on their website!).

We're totally going back soon. Go try it out! It's a cool experience!"}
{"text":"Went here on a work outing and I can easily say that it was a lot of fun.  Server/host was very attentive and made sure that we were good for the few hours that we were there.   Drinks kept coming and food was rather quick as it was being ordered.   Overall, food was just ok, but I do recommend the Mac and cheese bites as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Great time !!!! The food was very good along with the service. No to bad on the wallet."}
{"text":"Super fun rooms to shoot in with amazing food!  This is an upscale place to bring the family to your own \"family room\", snack and shoot some rounds.  Expensive to take the kids but worth the memories."}
{"text":"Wow deli meats are always foul tasting on the charcuterie I had a Cuban sammy that made me so sick for days does anyone watch the dates on the food here I got sick 3x now I will not order food plus the servers are all bitchy and rude sorry I dont tip for attitude and half nudeness and fairness I suppose the guys would tip for your ass hanging out of your shorts ... but one server short girl black hair got a solid 60$ from me though I got sick from the food that time too she was on point wasnt sexist and had good chat on the couch good for her she has more then enough to work in a classier joint with good food not this crap. Sure the tip amount will let her know who she is on this post. Girl get a classy job in a high end spot! You got more then body parts hanging out going for you! Ps half the toy guys are busted games are a waste and it's not that cool"}
{"text":"Just spent 3 hours here with family. Kids loved it and even mom had good time. 3 hours and no kids arguing,  it was great. Would be fun date night and/or corporate event. We had Alexis as our server and she was awesome. Gave us recommendations and was on point with everything. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Cool idea but so not worth the crappy service. Sat at the bar and waited for ten minutes for someone to even make eye contact. Then moved our party to a table to eat and were ignored for another fifteen minutes easily. By then our lane was ready. Trying to pay our bill from our table where nobody saw us was next to impossible. Left a $0 tip for the first time in my life. Would like to come back but probably won't. Not worth the hassle and lack of service. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I made a yelp account just to say how amazing this place is. The decor is absolutely breathtaking, very trendy but not in your face. You can tell the people that designed this place really took pride in it. Attention to every detail. The atmosphere, staff, and food is the best experience I have ever had. Also the VR shooting range gives it fun experience for adults! Bartenders amazing! My new spot for sure :)"}
{"text":"What a neat place!

We stopped in after a long hike, and were pleasantly greeted by the hostess, who gave us a tour and sat us down. 

The place has quite a few virtual shooting booths, and is very tastefully decorated. Our waiter was also a bartender, and he was fantastic. He anticipated all our needs, and served us quickly. We had a burger, white sangria, and a turkey Brie sandwich. It was SO delicious, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good place to hang around in if you like gun play and alcohol. Wait....what!? Yeah that's what I thought when I heard of it, not a good mix, but there is no live amo. 
Simulation screen shooting with air gums and rifles. The rounds and sight alignment is off but accurate enough to have fun, drink hard liquor and eat finger food brought out late. Oops one hour and a half has passes and so has $100 for two, three drinks and a chicken quesadia dish. NOT BAD AT ALL..."}
{"text":"Super fun place classy atmosphere , great shooting scenario options, games , zombies live scenarios , military and police. With fantastic service and great food beverage selections . It's like a shooting night club that is open all day. Excellent for family friend and work events .. or a date . I will be back ! Like Arnold says hahha"}
{"text":"Went with three friends on a Monday afternoon. We were the only lounge in use. My first beef with the place is that the price thy advertise is misleading. They also charge a \"membership fee\" of $5 per person on top of the hourly rate. 
Towards the end of our hour, my friend was using the AR and was using a kind of rapid fire technique. An employee of the establishment rudely came in and said, \"don't shoot the gun that way. It costs $1500 and it costs me $100 to fix it!!\" 
There is a way to approach people, and he could have been much nicer in his approach. We felt uncomfortable even staying to finish our drinks after being reprimanded. The same employee came back to the lounge to collect the guns at the end of our session and didn't say a word. He could have asked how our experience was and made it less awkward. But he made no attempt to remedy the situation. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time in this is establishment I reserved  a booth it was a very important evening for me and my partner it was our anniversary celebration on the reservations now we didn't know what to expect upon entrance the elegancy of the establishment caught our eyes from the beauty of the place but very disappointed with the treatment of nonchalant care the girls had us pay $5 per person membership fee even though it was going to be our first and only time there it was a requirement now we were very shocked to see how pricey it was to play for just 1 hour that went by so fast and 15 minutes of it was for orientation of how to  utilize the gun and the TV now we paid $45 on top of the membership fee and was very disappointed due to the game selections which were old school shooting games that you can play at a arcade room nothing was demographic and or updated for the high price. None of the selection of the games was good at all now the guns was pretty and very realistic looking the lounge of the booth was colsey and very romantic  and we are huge video gamers so we were very disappointed and that the waitress was nice however for the high price drinks one that I had Amaretto Sour tasted non-alcoholic and I'm a light drinker where as it will get me tipsy off one sip but I felt nothing I felt like I was just sipping on watered-down fruity flavor water on top of that and my partner had the adios and his drink was extremely strong and heavy with the fumes of alcohol that he only was capable of taking one sip through the time being there never have anyone congratulated our celebration never have anyone acknowledge the presence of it being a first-time there they were more like ghost in that place I didn't like the Fill from the host so after the hour past we left and decided this place is not worth coming back unless you enjoy spending over 70 bucks to play low-quality Arcade games I gave three stars for the beauty of the scenery and romantic Ness of the establishment and that's it we will never return back good luck to those that want to go waste their money playing low-budget arcade games and drinking watered down liquor"}
{"text":"Gameplay is great! However... in my hour and a half session... I saw my waitress 3 times. One to get my order then bring it, and one to ask if I wanted anything else (a polite no was my response). I had to ask the bartender for my check only to have my waitress sent to me immediately blaming other customers for her delay. I spent a good 20 minutes of my session waiting on co2 refills, and watching the young man in charge of that use a rifle in a nearby booth. 

I used to love this place -- it's obviously declined."}
{"text":"Went to Modern Round for the first time tonight with a few friends and we had a really good time. The staff was friendly and the games were fun. I had the Margarita Flatbread, which was good, and also sampled the Quesadilla, which was even better. After our shooting time we went downstairs for dessert. We ordered the mason jar sampler and the bread pudding and shared them all. The desserts were all good, but the bread pudding was a stand out.

I would definitely go here again and will probably take friends from out of town."}
{"text":"Came up here for a birthday party and was pleasantly surprised. It was a Saturday and Happy Hour and the Champagne Cocktails are hella good. I also had a burger that was delicious. Then we got our bay and started to shoot. Very fun games and quick wait staff. It's definitely about having fun with friends. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"First time I went to this place. Overall decent place. Customer service, food and drink prices were great. The negative is that the screen in my opinion is too close to you and honestly it just wasn't as fun as I had thought. Don't waste your money on the upgrade for lifelike scenarios. Not worthy it. I'd probably just come again to hang at the bar and have a drink or two. I guess I just expected more or maybe my expectations were too high before coming here in the first place."}
{"text":"Quite frankly,  I was excited about the concept and the drink menu.  Stone the bartender ruined it for me.  Awful service and we were the only ones at his bar. He treated us like he was better than us.  I would never treat a guest like that.  The prices were high,  but with great service I never mind paying. I would fire him. Sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food,Shooting,Drinks and Service are all top notch. I would highly recommend this place OH and make sure you make reservations, it does get busy. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"1st time here and it has been fun! An hour goes by really fast even in a party of three. Totally recommend it. Food is good as well. We shared two Share Plates of Buffalo Egg Rolls and Quesadillas. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good and they gave out complimentary drinks for Mother's Day. I like the concept and will come back to play during happy hour."}
{"text":"I would like to say me and my family had such a great time at modern round in Peoria. This was the first time we had been there, the guns were great and so real . The staff here really made it worth the money and time . Andrew and Celeste were on top of everything and made sure our experience was awesome! Thank you both so much .. we'll be back and we'll be bringing our friends and family."}
{"text":"This was an amazing place!! Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!! Spent 2 hours here- had excellent food including chicken sliders, a huge burger, and a salad! All delicious! We started with these massive loaded potato wedges too that were incredible! Upgraded to get the 'live' action screens too and they were well worth it!"}
{"text":"Lame! Came in on a Saturday night at 9:30 and was told to hangout and eat and the next lounge would be ours. Ate, drank and 1.5 hrs later no lounge BUT 4 parties that got there after us got lounges. The place is suppose to be a blast but it was snoozeville on a Saturday night. The food is disappointing to say the least. Expensive for really horrible food. I was soo excited when I heard about this concept restaurant but very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Full disclosure... I would have given 5 stars however we could not extend our time due to a waiting list and I was told that I could not pay for more than 2 hours due to later reservations. My thought was I am here now with a reservation but they are risking losing my business at the time for potential business later... 

Anyhow onto the review!

This is really a great concept and incredibly fun! I wish the bays were more open like a top golf set up but other than that amazing place to take family, friends, even kids. There are so many game options to choose from, it takes arcade shooters to a whole new level. Especially since you have to actually reload magazines into the weapons. The weapons has some kick back when firing. Not realistic but cool effect. Also, this is no where as realistic as going to a gun range, but it really is not about that.

The live scenarios are fun but cost $10.00 an hour extra. We played those less than the other game, therefore, it was kinda a waste of money that time, but depending on who you take to shoot you may want to consider these. I did prefer the military scenarios over the police scenarios. 

Now onto the food... I expected microwaved Chucky cheese type did using but everything was amazing!! Really great great food and special. They were doing $3.00 shots of Jameson! And their BBQ chicken flatbread is better than California Pizza Kitchens! The loaded fries were over priced for what you got so I would not order those again. Yet their burgers were perfectly cooked and that says something especially since I have been to bother joints there can't cook to order. 

I recommend making a reservation as this place gets slammed."}
{"text":"Fun new form of entertainment. Amazing food! Decent time recognition for the guns, maybe a half second difference and a few degrees off mark. Not impressed with the $10 live action scenerios (too much talking, not enough action). Excited to take my son next time."}
{"text":"Looking for something fun and different? If your significant other is a gamer and you're looking to win major brownie points, come here! I definitely got an excited, huge smile from the hubby when I surprised him and brought him here for Father's Day!! 

Even with the sign \"Modern Round,\" my husband was a little unsure what to expect and exactly what we were walking into. At first he thought it was a shooting range, not a virtual one. He LOVES gaming and since he doesn't get a chance to much these days, this was the perfect gift. 

Upon entering, we were immediately struck by the unique, modern, upscale decor. The hostess showed us to our lounge carrying the virtual guns in a locked metal box with an attached handcuff - a nice touch that kicked off our unique, upscale experience. All the staff were super friendly, attentive and willing to take our \"Bonnie and Clyde\" pics! 

Whoever thought of this concept is brilliant. Think fancy, adult virtual shooting lounge meets restaurant/bar. Love that you get your own lounge, server, that the food and drinks are actually yummy...and there aren't a ton of kids running around (unlike most gaming spots). 

Fun place to come to with a group so that you can split the cost of the hourly rental. Also a nice place to enjoy as a couple so that you can get more playing time!

So much fun - we'll definitely be back soon!"}
