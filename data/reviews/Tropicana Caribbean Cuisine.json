{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant, and I'm happy they are here. They bring a much needed Caribbean flavor to highway 7 & Markham rd area. Prices are reasonable, and so far the jerk chicken was very tasty. I will need to update this review after I have tried a few more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in this area I stop by Tropicana to get my poutine Jerk chicken on! Sooo good. The owners are super nice and the food overall is great!"}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken - Lunch special for $5.99. Pretty good piece of chicken, big portion. Chicken is not dry at all, you get fresh salad on the side instead of coleslaw. Will definitely come back for this.   Goat - Medium for $9.99. A little disappointing, not much meat on the goat. Most of it are bones. The curry tasted alright though and fresh salad as well. Will not get this, not worth the price for so little meat."}
{"text":"The reviews on this site don't do this place justice.  The food is awesome!!! I've been coming here for over a year ... Jerk chicken is fresh and really good quality in my opinion ... For the price point it's a solid homemade meal for a decent price.  The pork is also nice as is the curry and roti.  Note:  Hot sauce exceptionally good."}
{"text":"The food had zero flavor  I ordered one oxtail meal and one curry goal meal They gave five pieces of curry goat. Unacceptable! The oxtail was flavorless  I paid around $24 basically for nice and peas  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a few times now. I lived around the area and would pick up dinner from them. I gotta say, their food is yummy and service is awesome. The owners (Roxy and her husband) were very helpful when I couldn't make up my mind for what to get for dinner the other day. They suggested a couple items, and I ended up getting 3 dinners for 2 people. My husband loves the roti and the oxtail! - It's AMAZING! Try them nice time."}
{"text":"This place opened recently and I stopped to grab a chicken roti for lunch today.  I highly recommend the hot sauce with this meal....a nice kick!   Looking forward to going back to try the jerk.   Not a lot of seating and set up for take out."}
{"text":"Visited 3 times now. The first time was amazing. I had the Chicken Roti and it was delicious. I went for the same thing the second time and it was a terrible meal. IT fels like I was eating a Roti with nothing in it. They literally put a scoop of curry with a piece of chicken, needless to say it felt like eating a dough-ball. Third time I decided to play it safe and went with the Coco bread and beef patty. The beef patty was fine, but the it was such a disappointment to see they used coco bread from Nofrils - ugh. The owner was bragging with how everything is home made, and they take pride in what they do. I am all about supporting owner operated businesses. But in this case I am done and will not come back."}
{"text":"Running a restaurant is tough..  It's long hours and hard work..  But you do not get ahead by ripping off customers.  When someone pays $16.50 for 24oz of meat (about 1.5 lbs ) they expect something close to that.  I received 10oz of meat(including bone weight)  1 Oz of carrot and 4 Oz of liquid.  That is nowhere near 24 Oz let alone the fact the bulk was essentially water.  There was not enough substance to cover my 10 year old daughter.   I did call and complain and they did make good by delivering at their cost another 16oz container of meat...  But really it should not be necessary."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. Had a jerk chicken sandwich. Was not pleased as there way barely any chicken in the sandwich...."}
{"text":"There's finally good Caribbean food in Markham Village!  This is just your typical take-out place with a few seats inside, but the food is great. I had the jerk goat that was on special and it was falling off the bone tender. It was well seasoned and came with rice and beans, which were also tasty."}
{"text":"Started off well, but agree with some comments I have seen.  I got the goat roti and it is much more roti than actual meat.  Also got the jerk chicken which was nice flavour, a bit on the dry side.  That night though, only people who tried the food felt really sick, and prayed to porcelain god's throughout the night.  Going to have to get my jerk food from Scarborough, as there are not to many Markham options."}
{"text":"I have visited this location three times for their lunch special.  The first time I tried the jerk chicken and chicken soup and both dishes were absolutely delicious.  The jerk chicken was seasoned perfectly and have just enough spice.  The chicken noodle soup was superb as well.  So at the time I would have give. It a 4 out of 5 based on my first dinning experience.  On my last visit to the restaurant it took them 10 minutes to take my order and actually put it through as both cashiers were too busy and I felt like walking out.  However, against better judgement I waited and waited to get my lunch jerk chicken special.  When they finally rang me through the lady told me she doesn't use any sugar so I was like ok and took my meal.  She never asked me what I wanted as a side and stuck in soggy steamed vegetables that had no taste nor did she put gravy on the chicken.  So when I dove into my meal I was horrified with how bland and tasteless the chicken was that it probably tasted like old dirty socks.  I literally had to drive around to buy some mints because the after taste was so horrible.  There was absolutely nothing salvageable about that meal and I would never ever go back.  Just when you thought that you found a great place they get rid of their chef and it goes downhill.  I'm not trying to be harsh but I would definitely save my money and go else where."}
{"text":"Their prices are great and so is their food. I've had their doubles and I was impressed. The woman at the front is very friendly and quite funny. Their pepper sauce is so good. I recommend getting the jerk chicken Roti with pumpkin (extra charge of $2, I think) but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I dropped by on my way home to pick up bday dinner. I ordered veggie roti, chicken roti, oxtail dinner and jerk chicken dinner. The staff was attentive, engaging and friendly. The place was clean and organized for a small number of seating. The food was hot, fresh, succulent and satisfied the hunger pains. Also pleasantly surprised the portions were fair for everyone. Will drop by again!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and fantastic pepper sauce. This place is under rated in my opinion.   Ordered the jerk chicken dinner for $8.50 and it was good. My only recommendation is that the portions be somewhat bigger. The chicken portion wasn't substantial for a 'dinner' and is served in a small styrofoam container. Other, more well known places in Toronto serve their 'dinner' portion in the lager square styrofoam containers. In my opinion it was a lunch sized portion.   What they should do is raise the price by $2 and serve more.  All in all though the quality was great, customer service was friendly and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"iF THEY DON'T KNOW YOU THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF.   My buddy asked me to pick up a couple of chicken roti at lunch today.  When I got there it took minutes to be acknowledged and served.  Everyone was out back chatting !     When I got to my friends place he asked me how much I paid.  I said $7.  He said they were half the size he picked up last week.  He called the restaurant and they said they changed prices this week and there was now two sizes.  $7 for small and $8 for the large one.  What BS !   My buddy said there were others cheaper around and they left it at that.  Extremely poor customer service.  There was never mention of two sizes and I am a big guy so I would have taken the large one for the extra $1    This is all an excuse.  We will never go back there !"}
{"text":"Decent Caribbean food in Markham is hard to come by when its dominated by a large Chinese population. Inside is small with a few seats and a TV. Mainly a take-out place.  To start I got a beef patty for $1.35 - Nice flaky crust and juicy beef on the inside. Not bad to start off.  Also got the jerk chicken with rice and peas $9.85 - for the most part the meat was tasty and moist but there were a few dry parts. But only a few. Comes with sweet coleslaw which I liked. Portions were large with a good amount of meat.   Also got the oxtail rice and peas for $12 - fall off the bone tender. Decent portion of meat. Tasted good but can't beat my moms home made oxtail :)"}
{"text":"The lady is very pleasant and I ordered the chicken roti for $9. It's a big roti and you're full afterwards. I totally recommend her food!! It's yummy"}
{"text":"Tried their chicken special lunch, $6.99 u can two big pieces of chicken with rice n salad, comes with a can of pop, good value good food. Will come back when i at the area."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now, and both times were pretty great! The lady at the counter was pleasant and friendly, the location is pretty small but there are a few tables to eat there if you wish.  The first time I got the chicken roti, and while it was tasty, I did find it to be a bit dry. Nothing a bit of extra gravy can't fix. There sadly was not a lot of chicken in the roti, even still though, it was filling. I got a few Doubles as well, and they were delicious!! Gotta love doubles. The second visit I got the veggie roti, and I think that will now be my go-to meal here. I still would like even MORE gravy (the roti wrap has a lot of crumbs inside adding to the dry factor) but over all, a solid place and likely my new roti stop in Markham!"}
{"text":"If you ask for roti make sure you tell the person you do not want bones in the roti.  Mine had it and I had to open up the roti to pick out each piece of bone that was inside.  There was alot of pieces of bones should not have been in the roti.  Imagine if someone swolled the roti with the bones inside."}
{"text":"We picked up some take out for dinner.   First time here.   We both ordered jerk chicken with rice and vegetables,  as well as a beef patty each.     Jerk chicken was pretty bland.   She threw in a couple pieces of BBQ chicken and that too was very bland.   Vegetables were just steamed so nothing bad or good there.   Rice was decent and tasty but it over powered the chicken.   Had to cover the chicken in hot sauce to get the kick we were looking for so,  spicy wise,  very disappointing.   The patties must have been warmed up a few times because when we bit into them,  they were tough and chewy,  so needless to say,  we didn't finish them.   Not sure if what we got was the end of the day left overs but really bad first impression."}
{"text":"Lunch special from 11am-3pm Med jerk bbq/fried chicken thigh.  Rice & peas + salad /coleslaw  Can of pop  $6.99"}
{"text":"So I have been to this place three times now. I ordered the chicken roti(on two occasions). It was more roti than chicken. When I finally found a few pieces of chicken they were more dry than I expected.   I have tried the Jerk chicken with rice and peas and the coleslaw. The rice and peas were OK the jerk chicken was Ok a bit dry. The coleslaw was soggy.   I found that the staff/cashier was Ok not overly friendly not rude. I think I will look for a different place to eat jerk....  Will I be back.. I do not think so."}
