{"text":"Amazing food at great prices. I love the biscuits and gravy and the kielbasa and sauerkraut. The cakes are amazing!!!! And I love that you can special order cakes and pies for whatever occasion. I also enjoy the \"We Support Our Troops\" wall."}
{"text":"I took my mother in law for lunch she had the meatloaf sandwich and I had a bacon cheese burger food was great and prices were reasonable we could not leave until we bought cookies and Bavarian brownies you must try them.  We will go back."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly. I had a Philly cheesesteak with fries and a fudge brownie...$13. The Philly was pretty good, I just wish they had mushrooms. The brownie was kind of hard. 

Overall, it was good. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but if I was in the neighborhood I would go."}
{"text":"Cute and on the way to/from Hoover Dam. Reasonable prices and variety for lunch and sweets."}
{"text":"Corner of water & Atlantic.  Cute place. Perfect place when you crave traditional home-made comfort food. Our food was very good, only reason I deducted 1 star is the only drinks available were soda in cans & teas etc. Great place to grab lunch to avoid going to a casino when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Yum we stopped in here on our way out to boulder city. It was a nice family owned and operated place with a \"support our troops\" theme. They had fresh baked goods.I ordered a ham sandwich and my honey had a Ruben and we ordered some fried zucchini . it was delish. My ham sandwich was simple and fresh, the Ruben was greasy and cheesy. The zucchini was perfect. They brew there own tea and it was all 16$. will defiantly be back soon when were over in old Henderson."}
