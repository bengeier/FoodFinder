{"text":"It was a great experience eating at ohiyo.  My parents and I came here on a whim and left full and unexpectedly satisfied.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"The location doesn't do this place justice...the sushi was twice as much as I expected for the price.  I over ordered and couldn't finish my two rolls.  Delicious, fresh, and plentiful.  Also, hidden behind a CVS...get out here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The tuna tataki is amazing. Sushi rolls are great and the Indonesian soup is great as well. I recommend stopping in"}

{"text":"VERY VERY friendly people! Great place to eat! I'm happy it's so close to my job too  Great service, yummy food"}
{"text":"Wow, I had not realized this restaurant was here, but now that I know about it, I will be there often!  It is sort of tucked down the side of a strip mall, but don't let the location fool you. It has a pleasant atmosphere, and also seems to do a good carry out business.  The menu spans several Asian cuisines. My daughter had gado gado and loved it. I had basil fried rice (medium spicy) and also loved it. I would not go spicier unless you really like \"Thai\" spicy levels. The cucumbers on the side were very cooling. My husband had Ohiyo meshi yaki (also medium spicy) and was pleased too. So we spanned Indonesian, Thai, and Japanese in one stop, all very well executed. They also offer a variety of sushi, although we did not try that this time.  Overall a great find, and I know we will be back       Our server was very helpful and pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! The prices are also nice. Definitely recommend their Indonesian dishes if you want to try something different :)"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for Father's Day.  I was pretty pumped that there is a place serving Indonesian food in the central Cleveland area.  It is tucked away in a random strip mall in Independence with a small dining room some random masks on the wall.  Very mom and pop.  The menu is a mix of sushi, Thai and Indonesian food.  We ordered some of the specials, including a fried chicken and a meatball and tendon soup.  We also ordered beef rendang which is a classic Indonesian and Malaysian dish.  Probably my favorite was the Indonesian grilled chicken- savory, well marinated and authentic.  The beef rendang was decent- but the portion was smaller.  The one on the Malaysian menu at PacEast on Coventry is better.  Pad Kee Mau was ok- I didn't get to eat too much of it, because everyone else got to it first.  For dessert we ordered the Indonesian pancake which was not exactly authentic (chocolate?) but was still delicious.  Sticky mango rice could have used more salt but it was still pretty good.  Overall, it was good- I probably like PacEast better but this place is heckofalot closer to me which means something to me."}
{"text":"We went there as a group of 5 people last Tuesday and were so happy brought a newbie with us tonight.  The waiter is outstanding.  Nice as can be.  We tried different things last week and this week.  LOVED them all! If you like spicy, they have spicy options. (I do not like spicy)  You can get dishes spicy or not. Thai, Japanese, sushi, Indonesian I recommend this to anyone. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been delicious.  The basil fried rice was excellent and each of the sushi selections I've had have been outstanding.  Don't sleep on the appetizers you may not have had before, they are very flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is good. We have done carry out twice, dine in once. Yes, the service is a bit slow. But the quality of the food is really good compared to other places in the area. Pad Kee Mau is my go too."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful first visit!! Warm and friendly staff. Tuna tataki was fresh and delicious.  I had the Lo mein spicy.. everything  was presented beautifully and my lunch was delicious. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Ohiyo 68 is a really good Indonesian restaurant?. Because it takes a while to prepare, request the martbak manis. It's a folded pancake stuffed with condensed milk, cheese, chocolate and crushed peanuts. It's very popular in Jakarta, especially? late night. The batagor and empek empek Palembang were also very good. All the dishes we tried are extremely popular in Indonesia"}
{"text":"Order the Ohiyo sunset roll and basil fried rice.! One of the best sushi I have ever had. More people need to know about this place.. the owner is the chef and he is super nice too :)"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience. If you are an Indonesian food lover, this restaurant will likely meet your expectations. If you are not yet, you may join the club after trying this. They provide authentic delicious Indonesian food. I haven't tried the Japanese menu, so I can't evaluate that."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I waited 5 minutes for anyone to even realize that I was there waiting to be seated. Then when the hostess approached me, she said that they close and nine and that we could not be served. So do not bother showing up 25 minutes before closing because they will refuse service. She did offer a menu for next time."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work and a friend raved about it so I decided to stop in one evening on my way home. I picked up a variety of items:  *Gyoza $4.50 *Ohiyo Spring Roll $4.99 *Basil Fried Rice $10.95 *Ohiyo Sunset Roll $12.99 *Cowboy Roll $11.99  Honestly it was just okay. I did enjoy the basil fried rice and it's a huge portion so I got two meals out of it, but other than that I didn't think anything was \"woo hooo\" worthy. I'd probably give them another shot and try something else on the menu, but I don't see that happening anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem Independence! The pad Thai is the best I've ever eaten! The ingredients in their sushi are so fresh and well put together! Can't say enough about this yummy place!!"}
{"text":"I came here to have a quick lunch. The place was very casual and simple. The place wasn't crowded so I got my order quick. My ordered sushi was well done but I wasn't over impressed by taste- just a regular sushi. Prices were fair.  I don't know if I would comeback, because there are so much other places to try. In other words, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I randomly happened upon this restaurant while Yelp searching the area for Indonesian cuisine. This restaurant appears to be a relatively new establishment, and a small restaurant tucked away in Brecksville.  While the restaurant does offer some Indonesian cuisine, the options are admittedly limited - there were only about 4 or 5 Indonesian items on the menu. Most of the menu consisted of sushi, with a random assortment of hibachi style dishes and Thai food.  I tried the soto ayam, siomay, batagor, and basil fried rice. The dishes overall were somewhat bland, and lacked a strong punch that I typically expect from Indonesian food. The mackerel fish cake could have used a lot more flavor, the siomay just tasted very bland a potato-y, but the soto ayam wasn't too bad. The basil fried rice was not too bad, but did not have any stand out flavors to it.  Ohiyo 68 is listed as a restaurant serving Indonesian cuisine, but I hope that they will both expand their Indonesian selection and also add to the intensity of the flavors of their Indonesian dishes."}
{"text":"Found this accidentally and I'm glad I did! The Japanese salad and lo mein were high quality with extra attention to the details. I'd like to learn more about Indonesian cuisine."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi fiend but I was disappointed.  The majority of the sushi rolls have a fried component.  \"White\" tuna, when asked, was not tuna but another fish.  My friend, with a gluten issue, ended up with the Pad Thai.  No yellowtail, no hamachi.  I would not recommend for sushi.  Probably a better option for stir fry..."}
{"text":"I had dinner for the second night in 3 days at Ohiyo and I left even more impressed than the first visit! My boyfriend and I were only one of a handful of tables dining in (although I noticed a bunch of people coming in for takeout). I am baffled! I feel like the food here is so good, there should be a line out the door!  But I digress...   The basil fried rice (I ordered a #4 out of 5 in spiciness level) was so delicious. It is probably a sacrilege to say, but even though this reminds me a lot of the basil fried rice at the amazing but now closed Cuisine du Cambodge, this might actually be slightly better, if only because of the generous amount of stir fried basil leaves right in the rice. Even the fried egg on top was like the BEST fried egg.  We also ordered a special maki roll (can't remember which one but that was amazing too) and a spicy tuna roll. Again - one of the best spicy tuna rolls I've ever had, and I probably have eaten a million spicy tuna rolls in my life!   Seriously - this place is legit!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch since I was in this area. I went here based on the review and as well as wanting to try Indonesian food which I have never had. It was a friendly clean dinning place with tables and booths to sit at. I sat at a booth and looked over their menu that had sushi options, noodle options, rice options, and also their special Indonesian menu. I started with their spring rolls as their appetizers. It came in pieces of four with a dipping sauce. I am not a big fan of sweet dipping sauce with my spring rolls but this dipping was very delicious. The spring roll itself was warm, crispy and had alot of flavor. For dinner I ordered their Pad Kee Mau which was a stir fry noodles with chicken and shrimp, Padangnese Rice which comes with rice, curry, kale curry, egg and with the choice of beef or roasted chicken. I choose roasted chicken as my protein and I'm so glad I did! I also ordered the Hibachi sandwich with beef which i thought was really interesting. It came with fries! Overall the Pad Kee Mau was very flavorful and tasty. The noodles and the meat was cooked perfectly. The Padangnese Rice was a very unique dish I have ever had. It had so much flavor, taste, and tenderness to it. The portion of this dish was large and presentation itself was very pretty. And the Hibachi sandwich was my least favorite because it wasn't any special or bad about it. The food is really good from here, the place is nice and clean, the service is very friendly and attentive, and I will definitely be back here to try more things!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I only get the Pad Thai, and it gets better each time I eat here! Also, the young lady who takes my order is always so nice!   Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"The food was great; no question about it. What made this place phenomenal however was the service. The server was extremely polite, very helpful, and knowledgeable about the food."}
{"text":"Stopped by this hole in the wall for lunch today and definitely enjoyed the experience! I ordered the chicken hibachi lunch special (with white rice and miso soup) and gyoza while my partner ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and spring rolls. Let me start by saying that I left absolutely stuffed for $12.49 plus the tip. The hibachi lunch special doesn't look like much on the plate, but when you take into account that the plates are enormous, you realize that it's quite a bit of food.   I thought the hibachi and gyoza were low on flavor, but my partner gave the chicken teriyaki bowl two thumbs up. The spring rolls were quite good and the miso soup standard fare. Part of me wishes I'd ventured out into the Indonesian part of the menu, but I really can't complain about what I got.   Overall, fairly average Japanese food, wonderful service, great value!"}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good for a how on the wall in Independence. Generally any place that offers hibachi that doesn't cook it in front of you is a gamble but this was very good. Chicken Satay was my favorite thing that I had on my visit but it was all good. It was all reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi / Asian dishes out there! Everything is so tasty, and services are super good~"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant twice, once with a friend, and once with a large group. I had a similar experience both times, and I there are some points that I think are worth mentioning. Firstly, the location I think is quite convenient. Independence is nestled quite perfectly in Cuyahoga County, and is just close enough to the center of Cleveland to make it worth the drive. In addition, because this is off of busy Rockside Road, it doesn't get quite as much traffic, and therefore seems as though it's never fully crowded. This makes it convenient if you're looking for someplace central that also isn't too noisy (as many of the larger chains on Rockside can be). All that being said, I have to say that the service here can be incredibly slow, albeit very kind and friendly. The first time I went here with my friend, we chatted for quite a while and after a few subtle attempts to hint that we were ready to order, we ended up having to physically flag the server down to get her attention. The next time I went with a large party, they were very accommodating and had the dining room set up and ready for us as per our reservation, however it was really difficult to get in and out quickly due to the fact that we had to flag the server down every time we needed something. I think this may just be a stylistic difference in service style, but I think it's worth mentioning as many folks coming here are likely on lunch hour from work or coming for a quick dinner after work and therefore will expect somewhat quicker service. All that being said, the server and chef are really friendly people and are eager to ask you how everything was and accommodate requests. You can tell that it's locally owned and that they are very invested in the customer experience.  As for the food itself, I love that they have a traditional Indonesian menu, but they also have more of a pan-Asian menu for those less adventurous, which includes things like sushi, hibachi, Thai dishes and otherwise. The first time I came, I went adventurous and ordered the Pempek Palembang, which is a really traditional Indonesian dish that is a fish cake made with tapioca, served with a hard boiled egg as well as a vinegary kind of soy sauce and noodles. This was a very unique dish, unlike anything I've ever had before, and while I enjoyed the fish cake texture, I am not sure it's a dish I'd crave to order again. The next time I came back, I ordered the basil fried rice, which I found perfectly average. All this to say, I think the food here is good if you want to try a new type of cuisine, but I don't think the pan-Asian dishes will be a great departure from other similar restaurants. However, I will say when coming here with a group, everyone was able to find something that they liked and enjoyed. Between the location, the service and the food, I would say I recommend others to try this restaurant, as I think the experience will be enjoyable and you're sure to get friendly service, however I think the fact that many of the dishes will be unfamiliar to most people and also that the service can be a bit slow might be a deterrent for people to come back."}
