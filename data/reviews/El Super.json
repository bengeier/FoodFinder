{"text":"Never again! I had to stop here because it was the closest store that was open. I waited in line for 30 minutes with a tres leches cake. It ended up melting so I left it there and left. They only had one cashier available while the rest of the cashiers were on their phone laughing at some funny video. I asked to speak with a supervisor but they kept telling me he was in the bathroom. Very unprofessional!!!"}
{"text":"Big lines to pay , be ready to wait from 25 -45 minutes to pay by the way store manager told me that express line don't open until 9 am"}
{"text":"I love the low low prices but OMG this place is cluttered and the lines are long. Also, the cashiers can be RUDE . Everytime I go, I don't get a \"hello\" or thank you for coming.. They are always gossiping with one another .. Like seriously????!"}
{"text":"Never going there again pls whoever shops there check all your fruits and veggies before taking it home. You never know what crawled in there literally  I posted the pictures on here as well so you guys can see what kind of fruit they are selling!"}
{"text":"I went in to use the restroom and I was horrified. Each stall not only was out of seat covers, out of tissue, the trash cans were over flowing and in the top of the cans were tissue with human waste on it. There was no soap or paper towels. One person was in there to use the restroom with me and it was an employee, someone who handles the food they sell. I can only imagine what bacteria is leaving on their hands to our food. Will never shop there again."}

{"text":"Nobody speaks English. Security doesn't let you enter with a Sports Bag. Cashers are slow and waiting lines are long. It's also not very Clean and the Air stinks there.  But Mexicans will always buy from them, not me."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican supermarket. (Very slight smell of rotting flesh throughout)"}
{"text":"Used to go to this store all the time. Hope to never have to go there again will drive to the next closest one. The daytime manager during the week is so unprofessional and so rude. Doesn't even greet her customers on top of she always looks pist off. If she doesn't like her job then maybe she should get a new one."}
{"text":"Hurt and disappointed by being accused of stealing by their assistant manager Francisco. It is very true when people say, \" the innocent are always the ones to get hurt.\" I will never come back to this grocery store and to make it so bad this was my first time of going in the El Super. All I can say is: Enter At Your Own Risk, and be prepared to be racially profiled."}
{"text":"Horrible servicio por parte del personal en la seccion de comida y por el joven que atiende despachando la carne, lamentablemente para ser mi primera vez en la tienda pesima impresion."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law has been suggesting that I try to check out this store if i'm looking for cheap & fresh produce.  And also told me their meat section is good as well.  It was my 1st visit today & I wasn't in this store too long as I was with my WHOLE fam bam (MIL, my parentals, my child & hubby... just a lil bit of a distraction. lol).  It wasn't that busy.  No lines @ the butcher which was a good thing i guess.  I always hear it's sometimes impossible to get through.  I didn't get to check out everything so it's only the reason why I give it 3-stars (for now).  From my observation of this store though, it seemed to be well stocked.  Everything from produce, a quick look down the aisles looked good, butcher section looked clean & organized.  I'm someone who does price comparisons a lot but sorry guys.... this time I wasn't really paying attention.  I can say some of the produce was actually pretty cheap tho.  I don't live close to this place so if I get a chance to visit this store again, I'll do a review update."}
{"text":"AVOID MEAT DEPARTMENT. Bad Service. Poor quality seafood and meats. Manager does not offer any help.  Good Produce sale on Wed.  Do not expect any customer service from Meat Dept and Store Manager."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this. I love what they have and their cakes are soooo good. However I always struggle with cake orders since most of the bakery employees don't speak English and they don't take orders over the phone. The bakers work in the morning and I'm usually at work so it makes it rough for me to order cakes"}

{"text":"I normally have no issues with El Super but today is different. They usually have sales on their produce and we brought peppers for 59 cents a pound. As we were checking out the cashier charge us 93 cents a pound and my dad told her the sign says 59 cents so she asked her manager and she said it was for 93 cents as well so as we were leaving I grabbed the sign to show the cashier and her Manger the sign with the price of 59 cents that my dad was right and all the manager said was you can't take off the sign. I told her I just wanted her to see she is wrong and should not be advertising that price. We didn't care for the few extra cents charge just didn't like they way the situation went down when they should know their sale prices and not argue with the customer when obviously it's the price that was set. Definitely not returning and is unhappy with the service when nothing was taken care of. Bad business and bad customer service."}
{"text":"El Super is gigantic and puts many other ethnic markets in the city to shame in terms of pure size and variety. There's an adequate produce section, large butcher and seafood counter, cheese and ready-made-foods section, bakery (with plenty of pan dulce) and a small dine-in restaurant with ceviches, tacos, burritos, and tortas.  There isn't really any one area here that is done very well, kind of a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" situation- but the pricing is typically very good for most items, particularly meats and seafood. They have weekly sales but I'm not sure where their circular is sent out- I live nearby but do not receive one. They are available at the door and prices appear in yellow to indicate they are temporary.  Store is still new, but is very clean and organized. Some basic knowledge of Spanish is helpful, as not all items have an English translation next to them which can be a little confusing in the deli and produce areas."}
{"text":"There was water dripping on the meat and I told em and they didn't do nothing about it"}
{"text":"I don't shop at any Mexicans stores only El Super when living in LA this is the only I would shop at. Veggies and meat Cheap prices"}
{"text":"Great place! This is a giant, Hispanic supermarket, along the lines of Winco... Smaller than a warehouse-type (Costco, Sam's), place, but large enough where you can grab all sorts of goodies you wouldn't find in a conventional market. Aisles are very spacious, it's generally very clean and organized. Excellent produce, meats, and even a killer fish department. Visit the \"deli\" for mexican treats, house-made salsas, and more. Wish it were closer to our house in Scottsdale, but I'll stop by again and again if I am in the area. This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Best Al Pastor I have ever had. Extremely clean, always delicious and affordable. Surprising place to go for a date night but we love it because it's absolutely delicious!!! Must go!"}
{"text":"I found the store well the staff to b overall very rude if u don't speak Spanish then don't go there u get dirty looks and they ignore u.i have many Spanish speaking family so I really find it offensive. They might get more bussiness if they were nicer!!"}
{"text":"I love their prices! Best time to come is on Wednesday or weekend...  really early in the morning when everybody and I mean EVERYBODY is sleeping lol.... it gets really busy so I'm just warning you. I love their bread especially their cakelike bread,  it's a huge piece. 5 for $2... I think it's the only reason i come here, and while I'm here I hurry up and grab whatever else i need and get in line ASAP..... cause it does get very busy.... they have the best tres leche cake that I've ever had too and they're beautiful at a fair price. But i love it,  I feel like I'm in little Mexico when i come :-)"}
{"text":"For what it is (a Mexican-centric market) , it's great. The produce is always clean and organized. Regularly has great sales on the meats (my favorite part about this grocery store). Try the marinated boneless chicken thigh to take home and grill up. Also the pastor meat  is really good. Can you tell I regularly have taco nights at my house? Go to the cheese/deli section and get a couple scoops of Mexican (less salty) and Central American (saltier) cream for your American style tacos or nachos, way more flavor than American sour cream. Fresh, well priced produce. Sometimes has long checkout lines :/   Good hot food/restaurant section too. I often grab an agua fresca to drink while I shop. Combo plates are good, I really like their chili and cheese tamale."}
{"text":"Love the prices but hate that management refuses to help the few cashiers they have stating they are busy. Lines were backed up to almost the back of the store and only 5 cashiers out 12 were open. Corporate needs to talk to his management here. It's not the first time I've seen this."}
{"text":"Finally, a major ethnic supermarket in the Arcadia section of Thomas. This El Super is spacious, very clean, has lots of regular supermarket items as well as an abundance of Hispanic food items, at prices that are of no stress on the pocketbook. Comparisons to the Ranch Markets are inevitable, so here's my take on it: while large and spacious, this El Super is a bit smaller than a Ranch Market (no sit-in dining area), but cleaner, less confusing, and less crowded - at least for now, and there's no problem with parking even at peak hours. And I just have to add this ... yummy cakes at the bakery section, especially my fave: tres leches  - a delight for this aficionado of simple baked goodies."}
{"text":"Cardenas light! Less crowds and easier parking are definite plusses, but the produce section is smaller, and the feel of the market is much more Food For Less style and warehousey.  Also the construction on Decatur make it hard to get here and a pain in the ass.  Their prices are right in line with Cardenas. 6 for $1 pepinos, and same 2 for $1 avocados (El Super's are larger!). Meat counter has a lot of choices, even cachete which is probably the closest thing you will find to cabeza without having to actually roast an entire head.  Still I'll most likely be fighting the lines at Cardenas rather than traffic to come here."}
{"text":"As I walked in to El Super, the appearance and store layout reminded me of Food 4 Less. As I bagged my own groceries, ready to leave El Super, I was again reminded of Food 4 Less. The main draw here is low prices, especially in the produce department. Also, the store was organized, and not too busy. The checkout lines are much shorter than Cardenas. However, they do not have the prepared foods selection of La Bonita or Mariana's. No aguas frescas, fresh fruit cocktails, burritos, or raspados. Come here if you're looking to cook dinner at home, not eat inside the market.  I was impressed by the bakery department, with a large selection of celebration cakes, tres leches, pan dulce, and other breads. This is the first bakery I've seen offering birotes, sandwich rolls typical of Guadalajara, in addition to white and wheat bolillos.  Just your typical neighborhood market, and I'm not likely to return unless I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"To be fair i like the pre made food they sell at this grocery store but apart from that...this place is the pits!   Aside from the fact that their prices are completely unreasonable when it come to anything  other than fruits and veggies but the customer service is utter garbage!   Yesterday"}
{"text":"Due to the low prices or slow cashiers at El Super, you can expect long lines. When I say long, I dont mean Wal-Mart long. This is like trying to get a ticket into a Swap meet kind of long. Try not to come here on the first of the month if possible. You will find everyone and their mama and her mama here.  The store is pretty messy, hence the rating I  gave. Everyone is just tearing apart Powerade packs stocked up in the middle of the aisle as if they were running out of Powerade on the shelves.   Anyway, I'm still stuck in this \"Express Line\" at the moment and am getting a little frustrated of waiting because I have dinner to cook. Until the next Yelp....."}
{"text":"Nice array of goods, not so great on customer service by the cashier, they make you bag your own goods... Whaaa?"}
{"text":"It is an average supermarket with decent prices. Watch their weekly ad for some amazingly good deals."}
{"text":"Although I'm not Hispanic, like most Arizonans, I love Mexican cuisine and have been shopping at El Super for some time.  I have always found the people in the store friendly and helpful, except for today when I experienced a blatant case of reverse prejudice by one of the butchers.  I wanted to purchase a 4 lb chuck roast to prepare bbq beef sliders for a Halloween party tomorrow night.  They were advertised on sale for $2.98 for the bone-in chuck roasts, but they only had three of these, cut very thin (more like chuck steaks). In contrast, they had roughly 15 chucks roasts at $4.98 lb, in which they removed the one small bone.  A sweet girl at the counter said she wanted to check with the butcher to see if she could get a larger roast (so I wouldn't have to buy several small steaks).  She went in the back and spoke with the butcher, and I could see the whole conversation through the glass window.   It was obvious the counter girl was imploring the butcher several times on my behalf, but the butcher seemed more interested in finding out who the roast was for.  They kept pointing my way, and after several times, he finally realized it was for a non-Hispanic customer. That's when he refused her request, even though she was trying very hard to convince him.  She finally came out and said she was sorry, but they don't have any more roasts.  It was obvious from watching the counter girl's conversation with the butcher, and the butcher's  great concern to know exactly what I looked like, that I was discriminated against because of my race.   I told the girl at the counter that I was going to ask to speak to the manager, because the butcher's actions made it obvious that I was being discriminated against.  When I went to the front of the store looking for the manager, I was told that he was in the (back by the butcher.)  When he finally came to the front of the store about 10 minutes later, I explained what happened.  He was the assistant manager, and didn't seem particularly interested in resolving the situation, nor did he seem to care.    When I questioned the assistant manager why he wasn't interested in going back to the butcher department to find out if they really had any roasts, he begrudgingly went through the motion of pretending to care while making excuses for the butcher's attitude.    When we arrived at the butcher shop in the back, the butcher and manager exchanged glances in a manner that suggested both had previously discussed the issue. The assistant manager was \"covering\" for the butcher, and condoning his racial discrimination toward non-Hispanics customers.  If El Super was really out of chuck roasts, why was it so important to the butcher to find out what I looked like before deciding if there were more chuck roasts available?  I left the manager, and this store, in tears. The manager, like the butcher, could have cared less.   As for me, I'm NEVER GOING BACK; NEVER SUPPORTING A COMPANY OR A STORE THAT ALLOWS ITS EMPLOYEES TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CUSTOMERS ON THE BASIS OF RACE, REGARDLESS OF THE RACE.  After all, are we not all children of God?"}
{"text":"This store has good prices on produce and meat and the produce is always rotated fresh.  They don't have a food court which is a big miss with me.  I usually like to grab a bite while shopping at the mexican grocery store."}
{"text":"Really upset about this place. Went there specifically for item on ad. They were out and i was told i could get raincheck. Decided to wait in long line for only 4 items and get raincheck. Once i got up there and paid for my items i was told i couldnt get a raincheck. I like this store and go out of my way to shop here. But this will be my last vusit."}
{"text":"From 4/28/15 This El Super just open a few weeks ago and is located in the Sahara Pavillion shopping center. They have affordable produce, I mean 7 cucumbers for $1, you can't beat that. Also, the quality of the fruits and veggies were good in spite of how low the prices were.   The Seafood section was basic, you can get a few kinds of fishes,  and shrimp. I believe they had scallops, and octopus, too bad they did not have crab legs that would have been awesome.The meat section is okay, going to their butcher might be your best bet because the quality looks good.   As for everything they seem to have a few of the typical things you can find in most grocery stores, just not a huge selection. The prices here vary from the dirt cheap to a bit over priced by a dollar or two. Other than that they have a nice bakery and a little restaurant where you can get some good Spanish eats.   I feel like I am mostly going to use this store for produce, and a few impulse buy items, but not the place I can get all of my groceries."}
{"text":"filthy dirty not one cart worked there were lines to the back of the store and the manager could care less. The coolers are not cold enough to keep the food safe. how can this stay open."}
{"text":"Poor Service the Cashiers are Rude. They have no customer service at all. A cashier charged me for an item 5 times when I only got it one I asked to speak to a manger. The manager was rude and acted like if I was wasting her time. Bad Customer service in general."}
{"text":"Not a bad visit...the store seems to be always busy...but that's usually a good thing...overall another profitable visit to get our groceries!!!"}
{"text":"I buy several dozen pan dulce, for my coworkers, every Sunday. Today, they wanted to charge me $8.00 for an empty box, to put them in. I don't mind a small charge, even though it's never been an issue before. But $8.00???? Really? I left the store, without buying anything! Sorry El Super! I'll go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! They do not place enough cashiers on duty, long lines and had to wait 30 minutes just to buy 10 items."}
{"text":"While the produce is fresh (most of the time) and their prices are reasonable (again, most of the time) I don't like this store at all.  The carts don't work. Their meat departments smells like decaying meat. Ive bought several fish products from them, only to find they are bad once I get home. The lines to pay are extremely long, and every time theres a problem with the machine/costumer (like cancellations, alcohol sales, or the cashier inputs the wrong food code) they have to call a manager to authorize cancellations/sales. Every. Single. Time. The staff is rude. Three times have I encountered a rude staff member while shopping here. Once at the creamery department, the meat department and the cashier; not all in the same day but boy! is that annoying!  If you have an emergency and need to use the bathroom, you have to find a cashier, ask them to use the bathroom, and then wait till they walk there and input the code to open it. My daughter wet herself by the time the cashier got there. Very unpleasant experience overall. Go to Fry's instead, it's next door."}
{"text":"Its really cluttered inside.  It seems like it is real unorganized and when asking where items are they seem to be clueless of where things are.   Some products are opened so be careful when putting items in your basket or buying them. The bakery is nice they have a verity of goods.  Only issue is its a bit unorganized. My best friend ordered a cake and it just didnt taste too well."}
{"text":"Fresh fruits, good produce and fairly clean.  Great prices!!!!  Looks a little shady from the outside but don't get scared off."}
{"text":"I love purchasing my produce from here due to the prices and quality. Especially mangos, nectarines and avocados.  I am also addicted to the chicken and al pastor tacos. They always run out of chicken later in the day due to popularity. The horchata and jamaica drinks are amazing."}
{"text":"Love their windmill looking chips, I love eating those with Valentino sauce. This place has great prices on some produce by the pound because I'm always trying to stretch that dollar. It's very clean and organized and they have a bakery along with a restaurant inside if you get hungry while shopping and need some pastries. Altogether I spent like $30 for two weeks worth of food not bad at all."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon shopping trip yielded much more than I expected.   Unexpected Stuff: *The floor behind the meat counter was very clean which led to the purchase of... *... my first whole chicken WITH the head still attached!!! Bwahahahaha guess who's head is getting chopped off tonight? muwahahahaha, but seriously that's the 1st time I've seen that!  Everyday Savings: *bulk chia *fresh greens *many veggies were 2/99c or 2 lbs@$1 *AA eggs less than $2  With a Goodwill, Big Lots and Harbor Freight in the same plaza you can get all of your family's shopping done right here.  Note to self: When buying fresh meat be prepared to put on your patience cap because you will have to wait in two lines, but it's worth it for fresh, organic chicken."}
{"text":"If I could give this store no stars, I would.  I have been in this store a few times.  The staff is  consistently rude and not very bright.  I was treated horribly by a customer ahead of me in line.  The cashier, Nely, thought it was very amusing.  She totaled my purchase and acted like she was doing me a big favor.  Told her to cancel my order and to have a nice day.  Left the store and won't be back.  To make matters even worse, when I parked in their lot, two slots away from my car was a dead chicken.  Shopping options in this part of town are very questionable and limited.  I will say that I do shop at Cardenas on Bonanza and the staff there is welcoming, friendly and helpful.  My Spanish is limited and they never make me feel uncomfortable with my lack of communication skills.  They actually go out of their way to help me with my Spanish.  Parking lot of Cardenas could use some paving attention, but the store is clean and well stocked.  Guess I learned my El Super lesson today.  Go to Cardenas."}
{"text":"Good experience the produce are always fresh they tend to be a little pricey but for the most part I'll keep coming back is really close from home so no one can beat that"}
{"text":"The vegetables and fruits are cheap here.  Their bulk Chia is cheap. Their meat department smells.  We buy food for the dog but nobody in the family will eat their meat. I come here because I  went vegan so Super cheap veggies are super. Oh, be prepared for nobody speaking English.  That's okay. They speak dollars."}
{"text":"I liked coming here, it is actually one of the closest Mexican market by me. I like that El Super is in a shopping center where you can get a few things done due to type of stores they have around.   Now the market was very clean and organized, I didn't notice any food with expired dates on them so thats a plus. Everything looked fresh. I ended up stocking up on some meats since I don't live near any markets like these . I got some carne asada, marinaded chicken,ground beef and chorizo. The prizes where excellent I must add. I also stocked up on some dried chilies so I can make salsas. I also noticed they have pan Mexicano which I really wanted but I had already had plenty of carbs and sweets I opted not to get any although it did look and smell amazing. They have a bakery which is always nice and convenient.  I think my favorite section was the cheese and cream section, it felt like I was in Mexico picking up those items so it was a nice little feeling. My second favorite section was there food court area. I treated myself to a torta, it was pretty good. It definitely hit the spot and better than any of the tortas they make in the \"Mexican\" joints they have by my house.   Overall everything was great here, some of the items they try to rob you on but at the end of the day you probably wont be  able to find it anywhere else which explains the price. Ill definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"On my way through Vegas and found this grocery store. Good prices, friendly staff, nice produce and meats, clean and well organised. I can't compare to other ones I. the area, but I liked this place - very much like a Food 4 Less with more Spanish."}
{"text":"Tres Leches cake is off the hook. Candied almonds shaving on the side! Great deals on fruits and vegetables.  My five stars are going to the bakery. They have lots of sweet breads to choose from and fresh tortillas. I would give the meat and cheese counters a 4. The rest of the store I would rate a 2. There really isn't much stuff to choose from product wise compared to Albertsons and Smiths. The store is targeted towards the Latin community.  Stuff like shampoo is limited to selection and the prices are outrageous."}
{"text":"Beautiful new Latin Supermarket.   We have ordered cakes from the bakery here and their great!   Also, try the cafe there.   They have great food specials and everything is fresh.  Little secret....they even have a fresh juice bar that makes all the healthy \"green\" stuff.   Wednesday is Produce sale day.  Thursday is Meat sale day."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here ! They treat you so well and help you find what your looking for ,they have the most amazing foods here it's amazing ,I loved trying all sorts of Mexican foods ,definitely coming here more often"}
{"text":"You're deli section sucks. You're employees even walk around slowly to attend the next customer. Get it together."}
{"text":"I just moved to Gilbert from Southern California and this store has the best ethnic foods that come close to the stuff you find in Mexico and Los Angeles will definitely be shopping here again."}
{"text":"This place stinks. Literally. The smell of fish is extremely overpowering. It's as if they have giant fans behind the seafood department pointed towards the rest of the store. At least the store itself seemed to be clean and I wasn't harassed for change in the parking lot"}
{"text":"So you want to eat healthy on a budget. Spent a lot of money on a vitamix or nutribullet? Bet you didnt consider the costs of those veggies until now.   Preparing healthy food is MUY Expensive. El Super to the rescue!! I must say it is well kept/organized/clean in comparison to other ethnic markets. The most I've paid for my weakly produce a week is 15 bucks!  Flexible hours as well.  Just expect long lines.  Dont forget to check out their pastry section....fantastic confections! El Cheapo"}
{"text":"This supermarket is such a great mix of all kinds of culture and it is nice to see and be able to purchase some of those hard to find foods. The veggies and fruit area is so large and fresh, but really busy. The prices for the produce here is unbelievable too. It is almost like they are giving the veggies away. We came here wanting to explore for a field trip for the twins and their many adventures in learning since they are homeschool.   On this trip we found cucumbers 4 for $1.00, and bananas 29 cents. The customer service here even hires staff that mostly speak there language where they were born, which is predominantly Spanish. My Spanish is rusty so I go to use it here with the staff in the bakery and when I checked out at the front register. The upper Mangement even walks around and greets customers so worth a look for a unique and different atmosphere in the grocery store."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Grocery Store! The sales on the produce are ridiculous! Instead of so much per pound, it's usually several pounds for a dollar....lol   Not all of the produce is top notch all of the time, so you have to pick and choose what you want at the time, and maybe buy certain fruit or veggies elsewhere, due to a bad crop.  The bakery is the next cool thing. I have a Croatian friend who has an addiction to good bread, and he is completely hooked on this place. I see him buy at least six loaves of bread every time we go into this store, and he eats them all within two days. The cakes and pastries are so cheap, and the decorating jobs on the cakes look very nice and are very enticing in a down economy such as this one.  Now onto the Meat Counter. It is very well organized and you take a number. They are quick and the line moves fast, so listen to your number, and don't be a boner and learn some basic counting in Spanish. The ass hat below couldn't understand his number being called in Spanish? He needs to culture himself and have some respect or go shop at Fry's.  You can buy almost any part of the cow or pig in this very clean meat counter. My mother has had a hard time finding seven bone roasts at Fry's and this place has them by the cow load.  They have seasoned meats, such as Al Pastor style, as well as a nice selection of Chorizo's. I love the Salvadorean style chorizo links. They cook down very nicely, and have a great flavor and texture when compared to the standard types of chorizo that you find.  They also have a a nice counter with Mexican Cheeses and in bulk, and some house made salsa's, ceviche, and other delicious items. The prices on the Mexican Cheeses are very low when compared to pre-packaged versions at Fry's or elsewhere.  I randomly tried some Central American style sour cream and it has now become my new favorite as opposed to the American Style. It reminds me of a hybrid of sour cream, yogurt, and butter. You have to try it, it's amazing!  The staff is very friendly, the store is very inviting, and an overall great place to shop.  So get out of your stupid white zone, look up some awesome Mexican recipes and go shop at El Super and make some friends.  It beats the dickens out of Fry's, especially when you hit the meat counter.   Salute! =)"}
{"text":"El Super is located off of Charleston and Lamb near Home Depot. This used to be Luckys/Rally's, so it's pretty big for a Mexican supermarket. My mom comes here mainly for good, cheap fruits.  She usually comes for papaya, mangos, cucumbers, jicama, pineapple, and watermelon.   They also have marinated meat, fresh salsa (roja, verde, sometimes they have pico de gallo), and different kinds of crema (salt/no salt) available towards the back of the store.  Feel free to ask for samples! They gave me 2 heaping scoops of crema because I was unsure of which one I wanted.   Everything is priced pretty reasonably. I always leave the store paying 20 bucks or less for a cart full of fresh fruits.   *They sell dried hibiscus flowers. Use them to make some agua de jamaica! Soo good!   *You can find chamangos in the frozen section. $8 for a pack of 4. I haven't tried it yet since the places you can get fresh ones aren't too far from home."}
{"text":"I bought hamburger here that was so fat when I cooked it it  pretty much became a pan of grease, taco beef that was super grisly and so today I decided that I would get something from the actual butcher; a t-bone steak. First of all its thinner than any t-bone I've ever seen. First bite was all gristle and the rest of it tasted pretty crappy and was marbled in gristle. Why tf do people keep shopping here? I'm done now. 3 times there, 3 bad experiences."}
{"text":"+Conveniently located in a shopping center   +Ample parking +Neat and easy to navigate store (as most el super stores are)    -stale pan dulce (like week old dried bread)  -cashier was not the nicest"}
{"text":"Grocery store was clean and the produce is a lot fresher than the other Hispanic grocery stores.    Overall, El Super is an Americanize grocery store. Nothing special."}
{"text":"El super is one of the best priced grocery stores in Vegas. I miss getting multiple bollios for the week and eating those delicious noms.   I recall that they're produce is cheaper than other local places and I believe their seafood is also."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the customers... I truly wanted to enjoy shopping at this grocery store but I just can't. I literally have been there (3) times and I come out angry! The people are so rude and thats hard to say considering its mostly a latino community and Im proud to be a part off. Unfortunantly most (Im not assuming all) but the majority of the people shopping here are so disrespectful and ghetto! There is NEVER an \"excuse me\" and or an \"Im sorry - when bumping your cart\" the kids are running around, yelling and or playing as if it where a park. On 2 seperate occassions a customer was blocking a whole section with her cart... On both occassions I said excuse me in a very calm polite way and on both occassions I got a very dirty look as if I was about to get my ass kicked. Giiiirl, I can be as ghetto as you so calm your shit down. However, I choose to be the bigger person and walk away. Why come down to their level? I don't know why people act as if they where raised by rats but to each their own. I will NEVER shop at this El Super"}
{"text":"El Súper is really far away from my house, but close to work and I will stop by every now and then to get some pan dulce.   The pan dulce stop always turns into a fruits and vegetable stop. I ask find myself going through the aisles and buying other items that I don't normally find at regular grocery stores or that are cheaper here like lechera, chocolate abuelita, café and so much more.   They have a wall section near the entrance that has a lot of cooking utensils that are used in traditional Mexican cooking, if you are looking for a corn tortilla press, a lime squeezer, or a olla for los tamales, then this is the place to go!  Last visit there was to get a Rosca de Reyes (King's Wreath) on Jan 6th. The tradition in Mexico is to share with your family/friends a king's wreath, a baby Jesus figurine is usually inside the wreath, whoever gets the figurine has to make tamales for the family/friends on Feb 2nd.   The roscas at El Súper had very good flavor, not a fan of the raisins inside the bread but I picked those off. The baby Jesus figurines were outside the wreath and I guess you have to insert them before cutting. Probably to avoid a lawsuit.   Cashiers are mostly friendly but not always."}
{"text":"This store has the worst cashiers. RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL! they work in an area where they deal with costumers but are rude. I don't know how el super train their employees but it is NOT okay."}
{"text":"I don't know how they do it, but El Super sells everything CHEAPER!  Produce, fabric softener, etc.  The one negative thing about El Super is that there are lines everywhere!  We waited more than 10 minutes for meats and decided to give up.  The lines at checkout were also long, but I guess that's the cost for lower prices.  The only other complaint I have is that they don't have any locations near my house!"}
{"text":"Good for vegetables and fruits. I don't buy meat, but the freah meat and seafood counter seems to be priced low as well.  I avoid the packaged goods and snacks and can pick those  up cheaper at other chains. I can feed myself for a week for $10. Fresh corn  tortillas are tp notch.  I should have taken a picture,  the place can get extremely crowded. In my first visit when i rounded the corner to the checkout it looked like black friday at walmart"}
{"text":"I've been to El Super about 2 or 3 times but I never check in b/c its not added online. I go to the 24 Hour Fitness that's caddy corner to this place. Although it is easier to just go next door to Liborio, I go across the way to El Super b/c I've heard good things about their items especially about their produce. Super cheap!   PRODUCE: Red delicious apples were 2 lbs for 99cents! Bradenton apples for 79cents/lb. What the? that's HALF of what walmart or most stores charge, heck less than half. I also bough Pinalinaza which last time I saw this for sale inside King Ranch Market (which is now called something else btw) it was $13.99. Maybe that was a typo b/c today I only paid $4.99 for it., oh and Tajin which is a red chile spice you can sprinkle on all kinds of produce from sweet fruits to cucumbers to pineapple to everythin in betweena and its utterly addictive. If you've never tried it, they sell fruit cups with it sprinkled on it with lime -usually for $4.00- or you can buy your won fruit here for fractions of that and cut it up yourself and go crazy. to me its a great way to start eating more whole foods again.   this is as far as I got, more updates to come soon but I'm trying to eat better and sticking to the \"perimeter of the store\" rule to not eat as many processed foods, and this place is a great place for that b/c the produce was the best deals I saw. And since I'm a broke college student I got only what I needed by not letting myself get a cart. I got 2 lbs of apples, Tajin, green tea, pinalinaza, mole, tomatoes all for $10. cant beat it with a stick.   which im sure they sell there as well!"}
{"text":"Just went for first time today No bad. Staff was nice but the meat section smelled funky. Meat didn't look very apatizing and looked like it had been setting there a minute. Great fruit and vegi prices"}
{"text":"This is a great big inexpensive SÚPEEEE(tongue roll)RRR market! How fun to see prickly pears 5 for 99¢. Avocados, jicama, spices, everything great and authentic is in fresh produce! Look at the pastries! Everything here is stacked full and fresh with tons of sweet bread and the most delicious looking cakes! The seafood section is NOT as stinky as other's have mentioned! Although everything is frozen, everything is priced right and I also found 6 lbs of amazing sized shrimp that I will be so excites to use in our shrimp boil! Also, if you make menudo or anything else involving authentic pieces of meat like pigs feet, the meat market is guaranteed to have it! I had a blast shopping here! There is also a cheese case and fresh salsa, fun times!"}
{"text":"Stefany's review was pretty spot on. You will have a good time for the most part shopping for meats and produce here. It's cheaper than Cardenas with the same quality. I was pretty satisfied that a pack of 8 chicken drumsticks came out to an avg of $2.23! However, you probably won't be able to do all of your shopping here. I wasn't able to find slow cooker liners, paper plates (only foam), and the most disappointing - El Super doesn't make their own tortilla chips (like Cardenas is famous for). Keep in mind about the produce though - if you are used to Smith's and Albertsons (expensive but great quality produce), you'll probably not like it here."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love their low prices on produce on Wednesdays, can't get cheaper than that. Keep in mind though that Hispanics love their produce ripe so this is what you will get when you buy it. They also have a great variety of Mexican products that are not easy to find anywhere else.  I hate how busy it gets, can't even walk down the isle without bumping into someone. I also hate the loud music that is always blasting. I mean come on, does it really need to be that loud? The meat department has a really lousy system. You have to take a number and wait for your number to come up. Let me just say that it gets crazy and the wait is long  I have never spent more than $100.00 on a trip an this includes both produce and meat. This is a cart full though so I am getting tons of groceries for a really great price."}
{"text":"I checked this place out with my teenage daughter this weekend.  It's big, bright, clean, the carts all looked serviceable and the produce, bakery, meat and seafood sections were amazing.  There was also another ethnic food deli (?) that was staffed with employees who were helping people with their selections.  I wasn't sure what everything was in there, but it looked like some Mexican cheeses and creams, some deli meats, and some other assorted ethnic deli take-and-eat items.  Anyway, it was really very cool.    The only three drawbacks for me was that the smell from the seafood section was quite strong, which is to be expected really when you offer a selection of seafood that big, but still, you've been warned that you get occasional wafts of a scent that can *only* be described as a 'hooker's crotch at high noon in July on Fisherman's Wharf'.  (Don't judge.  We all have our skeletons.)  The dry good aisles didn't have a large variety of different brand names.  To be clear, they have all the ITEMS that you need: cereal, cake mix, paper plates, laundry soap, soda, etc, but they may not have as wide of selection of different brands as you are used to at say, a WalMart or Fry's.  For instance I wanted some Jiffy Baking Mix, but they only carry Bisquick.  No big deal, really.  And finally, I got an 8\" ready made flan from the refrigerated bakery case that looked pretty good ($5.99) but it was utterly tasteless and had a too-rubbery texture that I didn't like.  It was just overly sweet, with no vanilla, or caramel taste to it at all.  I've made FAR BETTER in my own kitchen.  Just skip the flan. ;)   Anyway, overall this was a pleasant experience and the prices were quite reasonable, I'll be back.  :)"}
{"text":"I love this grocery store! Luigi pinatas, fresh totopos, tortilla flour mix in bulk bags, fresh produce (not organic), a variety of fresh pan dulce, La Soledad mole and more! Just like Chedraui in Mexico (only Chedraui is better but it's in Mexico so that's no surprise). Glad my in-laws live close to this mercado!"}
{"text":"Got to get my veggie and fruit fix and this place is always close with great prices. Can't be eating buffet food all the time kicking back here in Vegas."}
{"text":"El super is one of my favorite places to get the most for my dollar when it comes to eggs, pan Dulce,and produce.  However, the downside is that there will be times when your produce is overripe, too soft, and that means you have to eat it quickly. However, the deals on staple items such as potatoes, tomatoes,and onions can't be beat -especially when you're pinching pennies.  Overall, it's not a bad store but remember that this is NOT whole foods."}
{"text":"The most disgusting experience is to go to this store...its packed with pieces of vegetables all over. It smells like a food fight! The up side is the prices, but the experience ruins it..."}
{"text":"Opposed to the E.LakeMead location, this store is such a total experience! Love it, love it. Prices are the big bonus. The store is very clean, staff is so so, but It makes no difference really. Looks like the employees must be pretty happy here. This store just flows with perfection!"}
{"text":"Some of the best prices in Las Vegas.  Whenever I am on this side of town I make sure to visit El Super.  Other times I just take their ad to WalMart for price matching.    Their Wednesday produce selections are usually crazy cheap (recently there were 8lbs of oranges for a dollar, 3 lbs of Italian Squash for a $1, and even 2 lbs of green beans for $1).  Thursday meat specials are hit and miss, sometimes amazing and sometimes not worth the drive.  Recently pork spare ribs or beef ribs were $1 a pound, another time pork legs were $0.79 a lb.  BUT be warned.  The lines here are always long.  It can get dirty.  And don't buy your normal (non-Hispanic) goods here, unless they are on sale, otherwise your meat and produce savings will be negated by their otherwise high prices."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to your market. I went in with my sister and two friends, who wanted to come and shop because the friends always shop there. at the meat part, no one called the numbers in english; good thing i can count in spanish. we were getting the evil eyes..but here is the kicker...  RACIAL PROFILING BY MEXICANS!!!!  we go to pay for our items and the assistant manager, francisco, comes up to me and my sister and says that someone said they saw us put something in our purses. my sister was like, no, why would we steal? and he told her that someone had saw her put something in her purse. she asked him why would someone say something like that...she told him to check her purse and he kept apologizing and just said that he was told. and she asked him if he wanted to check her purse and he said that was not necessary. she opened her purse and he looked and kept apologizing.  let me say, that i expect this behavior from white people not people who are brown like me!!! the store stinks to high heaven and the products seem old! why would we steal?? we work and i told the manager that we work. i feel that he was expecting us to be loud and abrasive negroes; not the case! dont judge us!!!  you will not have to worry about my black ass coming back in your stores and I am going to draw attention to this happening and wondering how many other blacks this has happened to...."}
{"text":"El Super is a great grocery store if you are looking for cheap food. You can also buy several mexican vegetables such as cactus leaves and hibiscus flowers which you cannot find in most stores.   The only negative thing about them is that the store and parking lot in front are not very well-organized. You see carts everywhere and brochures on the floor."}
{"text":"I didn't realize until a few years ago that only crazy, insane people that throw money in the wind buy their produce at places like Albertsons.  I discovered Cardenas and now my strategic shopping of Costco(everything)/Smiths (meat and fish for tonight's dinner)/Walmart(for stuff I don't need lifetime supply of, like...I dunno...school supplies)/Fresh and Easy (cilantro jalapeño tortillas) includes Cardenas for ALL my produce, canned salsa and chipotle adobo needs.   But then the draught hit and Cardenas started charging something stupid for cilantro and I decided to try El Super.   It coincided with a brand new El Super opening on my Wednesday morning school drop off route and I went for it.   I still like Cardenas for atmosphere- walk into lively music, you got your pinatas hanging from the ceiling, it feels bustling and happy any time of day.  This particular El Super has an atmosphere about as lively as a morgue. Granted, I shop at 8 am, but still. It feels and looks sterile. It smells like bleach, every time I walk in. Plus I get hit with this weird thing that blasts you at the entrance with automatic hand dryer wave of air, that messes up my glamorous hair and makes me hope my skirt doesn't fly up. That doesn't invoke pictures of enchiladas in my mind and doesn't inspire me to buy avocados. And unlike Cardenas, you bag your own buys (no biggie). Employees at Cardenas always enthusiastically greet me as I thump through eggplants. Here I have one way monologues, apologizing for disturbing their cactus sorting efforts with my shopping cart.  But..prices of produce are still lowers than current Cardenas, though higher than pre-draught Cardenas. I appreciate that meat counter is open at 8 am, though I still buy poultry, seafood and meats elsewhere- cheaper and quality is better.   Overall, it will do."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and that was enough for me. it was almost impossible to do any shopping because of all the other customers swarming to and fro between the aisles. Most of the staff had difficulty understanding English, which certainly didn't help in the slightest. The prices for many of the items were insanely low, but that was the only advantage I found there."}
{"text":"Remarkably clean and well laid out market.  None of the \"odd\" smells that the other ethnic markets have.  It appears modern enough.  The cashiers also appear to have good personalities, and good customer service.  I just want to see this place be more busy.  I want them to have business and be profitable!!!  We need more markets like this.  This is the kind of market that other ethnic markets needs to emulate if they want to encourage people to venture out beyond their comfort zone, and try something different.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Even though I love their prices on produce, this is the worst managed business I've ever seen in my life. The manager should be fired immediately. You wait at least 20 to 30 minutes just to check out and you can't even stand in line because they put pallets of groceries where you should be standing. I honestly have never seen a worst manage place in my life. I will continue to go to El super but never in this location again."}
{"text":"First of all: the restrooms were very dirty and no AC in there made them smell very unpleasant. Walked up to the cashier to pay my items and I politely asked The cashier YOSELYN \"Hi do you guys take Apple Pay\" and she ignored me. So I stand in line and waited for my turn. She did not say hi did not make eye contact and just started scanning my items. I paid my stuff and she handed my receipt without saying a word. Very unprofessional will not be coming here again very bad experience"}
{"text":"Place was busy!  It was clean and they had really fresh produce.  The aisles were large and had everything we needed for a quick stop.  The lady that checked us out was friendly and nice wish I had her name."}
{"text":"While other people are fighting thru the crowds at Ranch Market, I glide my attractive shopping cart through a clean, streamlined, bright and very manageable supermarket - the fabulous El Super 22.  The produce prices here are wonderfully cheap, especially on Wednesday. They always have a large selection. I stopped going to Sprouts because the prices were too much. While being competitive with price, they blow Ranch Market for quality and freshness.  Purchasing produce at the latter was always hit or miss with the produce going bad within days ( such as sweet potatoes ).  I think their bakery is the best of all the Mexican supermarkets. Their sweet rolls and pastries are inexpensive and fresh. There is no zoo-like atmosphere and everything is labeled. They make beautiful cakes that I always stop and admire. They have an impressive cheese counter too that has everything you could want. I don't buy much meat here, but my mother says the quality is excellent and very moderately priced.   BTW, El Super really reminds me and smells like supermarkets in Mexico. Some of the most modern and well stocked stores I have ever seen are south of the border and I never miss an opportunity to shop and bring goodies home when I go.   Who needs the Fry's ?  PS. Their Tres Leches Cake is 5 stars and plus. Wow. The best cake ever. Truly."}
