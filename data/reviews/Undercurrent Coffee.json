{"text":"Waited 2 years for this spot to open. The inside looks beautiful. TV crew was there as well as the owner. Very nice gentleman.  I ordered a grit bowl and a cappuccino. I asked for milk alternatives. They only offer oat milk. I wanted a scrambled egg, they couldn't offer that. And the worst part is my cappuccino was LUKE WARM!  The espresso has a good flavor.  It is smaller than I expected on the inside. No patio either.  Apple Pay wasn't working which is highly expected for a first day.  So I do expect great things from this coffee shop such as a variety of milk alternatives and hot espresso.  Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"I was Underwhelmed with this place costs more than Starbucks but the coffee is no better to slightly worse. I also HATE that the hipster coffee shops seem to think all sweeteners must be a simple syrup. The sugar simple syrup is okay, but quit messing with honey! It's already a syrup but concentrated. Both simple syrups water down the coffee though and make a decent drink lack luster."}
{"text":"I adore this great new spot.  There's enough room for a group to meet and study or brainstorm how to solve world hunger but there are also cozy spots where you can sit alone and enjoy a book. The staff is super friendly and insanely knowledgeable not only about the coffee but also about the farms from which their goods are sourced.  I paid in cash so I can't say anything about Apple Pay other than, it's day one, maybe give them a break.  Sometimes it takes time to work through software issues etc.  I experienced no kinks and only great service, hot delicious coffee and tea and the yummiest muffin on the planet."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop in plaza! Reminds me of those you'll find in Portland or west coast. It's very modern, open and light. Love the wooden tables and open seating areas. They do oat milk , which is my favorite. I tried the gritz bowl (their signature) and it was delicious! Not overly heavy and buttery where you feel sick after. The crimini mushrooms are a must add, and add the egg! They also source food locally which is important to me. If I lived closer I'd come here to work often. The baristas are friendly and the larger bathroom has furniture that can be used as a chasing table too, which makes bringing a baby easier. Great spot and delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I used to live in PM and walk past Undercurrent Coffee like, everyday, and I always was like \"BUT WILL THEY EVER OPEN.\" I heard it was a bit of a struggle with permits, etc and I felt so bad!  Great little addition to what fills a definite void in the Plaza. Great space, great light, comfy seating, good service.  They don't offer unsweetened matcha which was disappointing. Ended up with an iced coffee and almond milk. J had an iced vanilla latte.  The glassware was nice for dining in, but kind of small.  Price was in line of other shops in town. Not Just, Hex, Trade & Lore, etc. about $12 all-in for two drinks."}
{"text":"A great spot for a well crafted coffee with baristas and an owner that are extremely knowledgeable in the craft. Solid atmosphere, design and overall welcoming crowd. Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Opening day was a crazy party of supporters and curious passers by and it was fun to see the staff do such a great job and handling all the guests, the TV crew and still keep the orders coming in a timely fashion. Super impressed! On a future more low key day I look forward to hanging out for a while to soak in the sunshine from the awesome front windows and maybe try to get some work done between sips of espresso."}
{"text":"This is my Friday morning coffee visit.  1. Interior is beautiful,  very clean lined,  almost industrial feel. 2. I got a vanilla latte that was good, portion size not so good for the price.  3. I also got a blueberry chia pudding that I ended up throwing away. Flavor was bland with little brown mint leaves on top, also portion size if it was any good small. 4. 2 stars for interior and friendly baristas. Will probably not return, to many coffee shops around much better."}
{"text":"So excited to have these folks in the neighborhood! The beverage and food options are fantastic (you are missing out if you don't try the grits!), the space is beautiful and the staff is wonderful. Looking forward to making this my go-to coffee & breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait; I'm so excited about this place! Fresh, bright atmosphere, and plenty of workspace as well as comfy seating. If you're looking to have coffee the way it's meant to be served (not a burnt Starbucks cappuccino), come support this local business. Great people and great coffee. :)"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open!  Finally got to go today, unfortunately only a few minutes before closing (closes at 5 on a Saturday).  12oz Latte with Breve ended over 6 dollars, which seems high by over a dollar. It was good. The interior was nice, plenty of seating, and very clean."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and I will definitely be back. Staff was so friendly and informative and the overall all vibe was relaxed and chilled. I highly recommend stopping by for a coffee, tea or their brunchy food menu"}
{"text":"The people are great, coffee is delicious and the vibe is amazing. Very spacious  for work and relaxing"}
{"text":"2nd time stopping by and have to say it's pretty good. I've tried the two iced lattes: vanilla and mocha. The espresso is smooth not acidic which is good. Not sure how strong the espresso is. The overall experience inside is real nice, plenty of seating for roughy 40 people. Parking might be an issue, with only a few parking spots but this is plaza midwood. Lattes might be a little expensive for the size. Maybe have 16oz or 20oz. Overall I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Second time here and came to the conclusion this is my new favorite coffee spot in CLT. Everything is delicious. The 'bacon bomblette' is good with tasty bacon eggs and vegetables! Would definitely order again. Iced latte with brown sugar vanilla syrup is not overly sweet, just plain delicious.  Wishing and hoping they'll soon offer matcha that is unsweetened though :/  Love this spot. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Undercurrent to open for a while, and it was worth the wait! Coffee here is served as it should be. If you're used to drinking burnt, too hot coffee from that Chain Which will Remain Nameless, then Undercurrent's approach may take some getting used to. They serve coffee at a ready to drink temperature that preserves the nuanced flavors of the high quality beans that they use, and they don't scorch their milk when making lattes. They have rigorously trained their employees to meet a standard of quality and consistency that is really hard to find. I was able to take a sip of the pour over that I ordered without immediately burning my mouth, and the flavors were layered and divine. Are you used to having things your way? A creature of habit? Perhaps just *try* something different and be open to the new experience. Depending on what you order, you should expect to wait longer than you would at that Chain Which will Remain Nameless, but again, it's worth it! This is not a \"turn and burn\" business model. Praise be! Relax, enjoy the beautiful interior, and let the masters do their work."}
{"text":"Everything you want from a coffee shop. The menu is filled with vegan options, they have a small selection of pastries, and a classic selection of coffee and espresso. I had the iced latte with oat milk and vanilla, highly recommend. Not many places carry oat milk so I was pleasantly surprised. I sprung for the grits bowl and it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the avocado toast which was also very good. Atmosphere is relaxing with a modern aesthetic. Worth a stop by - there's a quaint shop next door with local jewelry that's also worth checking out afterward."}
{"text":"Super cool new coffee shop in Plaza Midwood! I walked in a little before 9am on a Saturday and the place was already packed. Barely any wait for coffee, so the staff moves pretty quick.  I ended up with the Pure Intentions Cold Brew on tap. So good! They have half and half and almond milk on the side, and whole milk behind the bar.  I guess Almond Milk is all the rage now, but I'm not into it.  The first time I went, I got a good cold brew.  The second time, I got a latte.  I do love that they have some simple syrup on the side bar rather than a bunch of different sugar options.  I also ordered the Avocado Toast with an egg on top, and it literally looked like a work of art. Sliced avocado, too, not guacamole!  The ambiance is very welcoming.  There are a number of modern chairs/couches and some community tables where you can work or meet someone for coffee.  The place is much bigger than it looks, so don't be scared to go to the back!  Overall, I'm really happy with the new addition to the Plaza Midwood area. The place is inviting and you will not hesitate to just sit for a few minutes and enjoy your coffee with some latte art on the top.  If your'e looking to just run in, grab a quick cup and bolt out without making conversation with the staff, I would say this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a welcome addition to the Plaza Midwood coffee scene. The owners are lovely people with an amazing story of triumph and determination.  The variety of coffee from drip coffee, pour overs, and lattes embody a delectable twist on your average cup of joe.  The pour overs are amazing and the flavor profiles and notes of the coffee are amazing and leave you with dreaming of a second serving.  And can I say I love that they have Oatly oat milk.  I've not tried it yet, but the Golden Milk and Matcha latte seem to be popular among patrons each time I've gone. They are on my list to try!  The food menu is expertly crafted and prepared and offers something for everyone.  My favorites so far are the sour cream coffee cake, scones, avocado toast with the poached egg.   The ambiance lends to a comforting but chic environment to plug-in to work, meet a few folks over coffee, or just connect with locals."}
{"text":"Undercurrent is the perfect spot to sit down and read, do homework/work, or have a coffee date. The environment, food, and especially the coffee is fantastic. Sophistication radiates from every part of this coffee shop. From the presentation of the food and coffee, to the decor it's warm and friendly. To sum it all up, it's the place you want to be at."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Plaza Midwood neighborhood! Went on the first Saturday it opened, and as expected, it was packed.  This place got a lot of hype, and I have to admit that it did live up to the expectations.    After we got through the line, I ordered a matcha latte with almond milk (they also have oat milk!), the avocado toast with a poached egg, and a triangle shaped oat-like dessert pastry (I don't remember the name of it, but it was sooo delicious!). The matcha latte was as expected, and the avo toast was really good!  It is served on a nice thick slice of bread, with fresh avocado, and spices.  The egg was absolutely cooked to perfection!  I personally hate when I order a poached egg with a yolk nearly all the way cooked, and this was definitely not that. Would recommend, but the only downside is that it is a bit pricey, but find me a specialty coffee shop that isn't..."}
{"text":"My husband and I always try out new coffee places as that is our weekend thing. Excited to try out undercurrent but slightly disappointed when the largest sized coffee they have was no bigger than an actual sized small coffee. Paying $5 for something so small isn't quite what I was expecting. Other than the size, the coffee and atmosphere is nice. Not sure we will be back but it was worth a try."}
