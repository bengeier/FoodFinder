{"text":"We have had a great experience everyone time we've been here. We order the sesame chicken, the teriyaki chicken might be my favorite (our young kids love it), and Kung pao chicken. I can't say I love the soups but they are good. They are fast too. We tried the other local place & liked this place better."}
{"text":"It's pretty average Chinese food.  There's not a lot of selection for any restaurants this side of Gilbert, so I think it will do OK for a while.   I'd love it if they'd step up the quality of their food a notch or two."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant!! We have had several different things and are happy with them all. Fantastic lunch specials as well. Loved the moo shoo chicken and chicken lo me in!"}
{"text":"So happy my family and I found this place. The food is very good, and the portions give enough for leftovers!  We've been here about a half dozen times and the staff is always friendly and attentive. Great value!"}
{"text":"You get exactly what your looking for here when you get the craving for Chinese food. Big on flavor yet cheaper than a meal deal from s fast food joint. Service is fast, food is ready fast and tastes delicious. The lunch special had many items to choose from and portions are large. Dinner entrees are slightly more expensive but can easily feed two grown men. Give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE - though we only order take out.... Menu is a little limited but we've LOVED ALL ITEMS we've ordered so far. Lunch specials are a GREAT DEAL... about $6 1-item over rice + soup + eggroll+crab rangoo.... Plus, it's only 5 minutes away....  Like this over IRON CHEF Kitchen at POWER ROAD and CHANDLER HEIGHTS...."}
{"text":"Nice quiet atmosphere with friendly service. The kung pao shrimp and chicken lunch was excellent, the meat nice and tender.  The fried rice was cooked just right, not soggy or hard.  The waitress was very nice but doing too many jobs. Served my friend and the man behind me, then a few mins later came my plate and the lady behind me. She had to answer the phone, take orders, bus tables, serve tables and also handle the register. This made for an extended wait to take our order but she still did a good job considering her many hats. If you don't mind your plates being chipped in several spots around the edges, I would still say it was overall worth going and I will probably return."}
{"text":"I like the food at this restaurant but they do not deliver like it says! They need to change the info. Service is just OK."}
{"text":"we have been several times for lunch and dinner, and are never unhappy with the food.  Really the best chinese food place we have been to in the area by far.  Panda Express is disgusting compared to this place, it is worth a few extra miles to get good quality meal at what I think is a very fair price.  Lunch specials pricing is especially good.  Highly recommended.  Always had to-go, never stayed to eat there."}
{"text":"First of all, the price is definitely right.  So, I can't complain.  There is usually only one waitress working at lunch, and she hustles, but she still falls behind quite a bit.  If you order a beverage, you probably won't get a refill.  The food is hit and miss.  On our most recent visit, the chicken tasted a bit fishy, and the rice and noodles were very oily.  But, we've had some decent meals here before.  I think we'd move this up to 3 stars if the food was better of the waitress had a little help from somebody to keep the drinks full."}
{"text":"The bomb.com! We stumbled on this place and we love it! I recommend the Chicken Lo-Mien. Also, they have really great lunch specials. If you are in the area and in the mood for Chinese, give these guys a shot!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for a \"go to\" Chinese place. I think we found it.   Our criteria includes: good food, which has to include chinese staples for our family: potstickers, orange chicken, General Tso's chicken, and enough variety to keep it interesting if we decide to veer from our standards.   This place meets all our criteria. My wife ordered General Tso's chicken and the chicken was good quality (not scraps) and properly cooked (not greasy). The seasoning was what we expected with the right zing, but not being overpowering. My kids ordered potstickers - both steamed and fried. These were just OK. The fried ones were almost not greasy enough...the noodle shell was dry, almost as if they were baked. Not bad if you're counting calories, but it did lack something. The steamed version was enjoyed by our family.   I ordered the Hong Kong noodle dish with seafood. I knew I was taking a risk because in smaller places not necessarily known for seafood, they don't often handle this meat properly, and they don't have enough volume to turn over the inventory frequently. As a result, the seafood dishes can have old fish and can be disappointing. That is what I expected...but I was pleasantly surprised. The shrimp were almost juicy they were cooked so well. There were scallops in the dish and I am used  to these being mediocre, but they were OK. (Just OK, not disappointing).  There was Krab too (imitation crab). These were low quality strips, but their quality didn't take away from the meal. What really stood out and made the experience were the noodles. The Hong Kong style noodles were like fried angel hair noodles. That part of the presentation stole the show. The seafood and veggies were placed upon this delicate nest of Hong Kong noodles...which were very fine and delicious. Highly recommend you try this dish - or any of the Hong Kong noodle options, you can't go wrong.   The service was very friendly, prompt, and was above average for a place in this tier of restaurant. The restaurant was clean, the decor appropriate and fresh, and overall the place was unexpectedly inviting.   The portions are comparatively large as others have said, and the dishes are priced right. We not only ate a hearty meal at the restaurant, but we took at least half of everyone's order with us as leftovers. The next day, the food held up well and was snapped up for lunch over a couple days.   This location (at least) didn't serve any alcohol, which we didn't miss. Everything else was quite good, and Hong Kong II will fit the bill as our new go-to Chinese place in the east valley.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Best lunch in the area! We have made this one of our local favorites. The helpful staff make the experience overall a winner for our family."}
{"text":"I am Cantonese I exactly know what wonton noodle soup should look like. It's fine if you make a different type of wonton soup, but you should not use the name of \" Hong Kong\", Hong Kong or Cantonese wonton noodle soup should use Cantonese noodle not the north china noodle, wonton should have shrimp in it, the soup should made of some beef or chicken or fish broth."}
{"text":"The food is always very good and tastes fresh. We get chicken and vegetables and steamed pot stickers. Only takes 10 mins after we call in the order."}
{"text":"I go there almost every week. Great food fast, highly recommend it. The the four season without the pork portion."}
{"text":"Food was good and great price. Unfortunately, they do not deliver like they state here. That would have been nice to know ahead of time! Need to change on YELP. Misleading but food was done in 10 minutes and waiting for us on the counter when we picked up!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese place in the East Valley. Always great service and even better food. You won't be disappointed in the portions either. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  One of the best in the area.  Great food and reasonable prices .   It gets busy some nights, so be prepared if you're dinning in to wait just a bit for service, but it's worth it.  I usually just order for take out and the food is usually quick and delicious .  If you're looking for Chinese food in the Gilbert area, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Yum is all I can say!  Large portions and very delish!  We ordered the veggie friend rice, egg drop soup, egg rolls and sweet and sour chicken.  White meat used ONLY in the sweet and sour!  Egg drop was very velvety.  Yum!  They give you white rice automatically too and won ton chips!  Didn't even ask!  All I can say, we will be back all the food was yum!  I will remind to ask them to remove the mushrooms in the veggie friend rice!  Otherwise - A+! They don't have a menu online - but googled and found one.  Pricing is t too bad either!"}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" place for Chinese food. When every other eatery in town is jam packed with a long wait time for seating, we head to Hong Kong Kitchen for a nice relaxing dinner with no wait. Much of their business is take out. Wait staff is always very friendly. Our young son just loves their egg rolls and sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"I've been dining at this restaurant for over 7 years. The food is always fresh and fast. We are never disappointed! Particularly, I love the teriyaki chicken and our kids love the orange chicken. The servers have been there just as long as I've been a customer!"}
{"text":"Always excellent food!  Generous portions. The shrimp fried rice is awesome!  Plenty of eggs which make it extra tasty.  Great service. Fast preparation. Always tastes fresh. Favorite Chinese restaurant in this area!"}
{"text":"Took my 7 year old son here because he loves Chinese food. He was hesitant about egg drop soup until he tried it and said it was the best! We even took some home. The teriyaki chicken is really good and great portion size. The food came out quickly, cooked well and excellent service. Our meal was under 20 dollars and my son wanted to leave the waitress a 10 dollar tip because as he said \"everything was sooooo good!\" We will be back again!"}
{"text":"After last nights' visit I have to drop my rating massively. Food was pretty dismal, didn't taste fresh, varied in temperature and meat was tough. Sauces were greasy and overly salty, and just drenched over everything. Pancakes with the moo shu were stale and dry, inedible really. Meat was chewy and the pork actually tasted off. As someone else mentioned, egg roll tasted of old oil and was soaked in grease. It's also worrying that the food arrives so quickly, probably sat in the back in a large vat and quickly reheated in a microwave or something.   Staff are friendly ish but clearly offer a quick in and fast out sort of experience- best to find alternative Chinese food in the area!"}
{"text":"We tried out Hong Kong Kitchen based off a co-worker's recommendation and it did not disappoint!  The restaurant is nicely kept and the service was excellent!  Started off with the crab puffs (which were substantial) and the potstickers (the dipping sauce was delicious).  For entrees we tried out the house special lo mein, beef and broccoli, and the garlic shrimp.  I was surprised at how much meat was in the noodles and the shrimp were perfectly crispy.  Sometimes there's so much batter and hardly any shrimp, but these were the opposite - plump and juicy shrimp, lightly battered. My only criticism is that the dishes were a little too saucy for my liking, but otherwise everything was great!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a little hole in the wall from the outside but the food is awesome.  I would highly recommend. Large portions at good prices.  The flavor is great and everything is so fresh."}
{"text":"Nothing great about the food. Don't get me wrong, it's good but not great. My beef broccoli had little flavor and the sauce was watery. The chicken chow mein however was pretty damn good. The hot and sour soup had a good flavor but was not the thick consistency I'm used to. Definitely not a deal breaker. We got take out so I can't comment on the service. My food was ready in five minutes which I don't know is a good thing or bad thing but since I was really hungry at the moment it was a good thing."}
{"text":"My place for Chinese foods mostly because a few minutes drive from my house, like it could be my lunches or dinners when my wife out the town or traveling! I come here often and it is my favorite place for Chinese foods! It was small and very nicely place with cleanly space where you felt comfortable sat and enjoyed your meals lunch or dinner! The price is average, the services good, the waitress wry friendly, and the manager very willingly if you needed to talked! I love it, place! I highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food at a good price. The portions are huge enough to share which makes it super cheap. I had been here several times and the only complaint I had was the iced tea, it was terrible. They could also add a little more heat (spice) to their dishes, but not a big deal.  The last time I went in was a really negative experience. I ordered the orange chicken with white rice and an extra order of the white rice. All was fine until they brought out the orange chicken with no rice at all. They said they didn't have any white rice. I'm not sure why they didn't tell me that from the beginning especially since I asked for an extra order of it. The problem was this, they had plenty of white rice but since so many people call their orders in and pick it up, they gave the rice to them. They had the rice that I ordered, I know this because my sister-in-law (whom I turned on to this place) actually came in when my food was delivered to the table without the white rice. I ended up just leaving the place after paying for my crab puffs and I text my sister-in-law to see if they got white rice. Yep, they sure did.   It is not good business to do that sort of thing. They are a Chinese restaurant...you would think they would have enough white rice, but I guess not. It didn't seem like they understood the problem. They said sorry and that was the extent of it. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Today I ate at Hong Kong Kitchen and I am definitely planning on coming back in the future. The atmosphere of the restaurant had a calm and welcoming environment. It wasn't too busy or crowded. Overall the setting had a relaxed ambience.  The service was excellent and made my experience there that much better. Right as I sat down I was immediately greeted by our waitress. Our drink orders came out right away and our food was on the table the next minute, it was the shortest amount of time I've ever had to wait for food.  They had many options to choose from I almost couldn't decide. I ended up ordering the egg drop soup with crab puffs and sesame seed chicken. The food came in large quantities so I was able  to bring home lots of leftovers. I enjoyed all the food I ordered, my only complaint is that the chips that came with my soup were stail and burned. Other than that I loved the food and service at Hong Kong Kitchen and I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"The thing that bothers me is why can't they have a website like any other place? They take pictures of the menu and post it on line?? Really! what's with that?"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch for under $6. I have never been disappointed with their dishes. My favorite is the Chicken with Vegetables, add a little bit of spice. 2nd on my list would be the Mongolian Beef... You must like onions to appreciate that platter. But again, I have not been disappointed with any of their dishes."}
{"text":"Been a customer for years, at least once a week. Took another couple in for dinner and two of the four dinners (sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken) were very over cooked. You couldn't penetrate the chicken with a fork, it was hard as rocks. We called the server over and showed her. She said she could replace one meal with \"Exact same price meal\" but not both, and \" No refund-just replace one meal\". So, you served two poorly cooked entrees but will only replace one. Not how I expect to be treated, so we won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is just okay for us, I wish I liked it more.  We've eaten in the restaurant and placed a couple of orders for take out.  Last night they did a great job getting our order ready quickly, and it was packed up well in a box to go which made it easy to transport in my car.  The portions seem pretty generous, I over ordered and we had plenty of leftovers for today.  It's probably just the style of cooking, but the chicken always seems too squishy for me and leaves me wondering if it's cooked enough.  Maybe it's a communication/language issue, but the employees didn't seem very friendly or helpful."}
{"text":"HKK is close to my house. The food is very delicious and the portion is very large."}
{"text":"We order Hong Kong Kitchen for pickup 1-2 times per month, and we have for about a year and a half.  It's consistently delicious, hot, and between the call and being ready takes an absolutely consistent, and incredibly speedy, ten minutes.   We have ordered take-out from this restaurant approximately 20-25 times and we've never had to wait.   Our faves:  Teriyaki chicken Sweet & sour chicken (or pork) ALL of the lo mein dishes Egg rolls are to. die. for. Fried rice -yum."}
{"text":"Our favorite local Chinese restaurant. Don't miss the chow fun (we like it with beef)! Their dinner for 2 is an amazing deal and very good."}
{"text":"Very good food, great lunch menu and affordable all in one.  Had a meetup here with four other guys for lunch today and two of them eat here constantly and kept raving of it.  Nothing short of wonderful here but nothing extremely out of the ordinary from a Chinese restaurant to bump it to a five.  Service was excellent and timely, place was very clean, located far south east but I hear there's actually people that live out there these days so that's cool.  Lunch menu was pretty large - lots of choices and everybody mentioned that theirs was exceptional food as well.  You get the typical egg drop or hot-n-sour soup prior to the main dish coming out.  Food comes out pretty quick (crackin the whip back there).  Price was pretty cheap - good deal :)  Not sure I'll travel that far south just to eat there but if I'm around that area or need to have lunch meeting with the S.E. SEO boys again - it'll be in my mind to return and try some more good food :)"}
{"text":"Read the bad reviews but wanted to give it a shot.  Egg drop soup is actually good and I'm picky, add soy sauce and it's even better.  Service was prompt and she was nice.  We got orange chicken and honey chicken, it was the best honey and orange chicken I've had to date. The fried layer wasn't soggy but crunchy. That's one thing I hated about most Chinese places. Food was very fresh. 5pm dining."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered for a family of 4 and it was done in 5 min!! It was very good and fast service."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese places in the area.   They know how to make some really good sauces.  The veggies and meat are very fresh and have great flavor.  However, avoid the Egg Foo Young here.  It is fake, not real eggs...it is disgusting!  I will go back"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I was happily impressed. Ordered the House Lo Mein, House fried rice and Orange chicken to go. The cashier was friendly and my order was ready within 15 mins. I was so hoping it was going to be good as I haven't found too many Chinese restaurants near my location. My family and I all agreed it was delicious. The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating is because the fried rice was a bit on the bland side and a tiny bit hard, not as soft as I would've liked. Overall, I will definitely be returning and so happy I found this place!!"}
{"text":"I've only had take-out from this restaurant, so I can't comment on the dining area.  The food is delish.  Very good sized portions and freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout for the first time tonight, it was decent.  Next time I'll dine in to see if they are going to be our go-to place."}
{"text":"One of our new regular spots for chinese food for dine in or take out.  Good service, good prices. Food is always fresh, flavorful and hot. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Quick enough for lunch. Chicken teriyaki skewers were too dry to eat. Service was friendly and overall cleanliness was good."}
{"text":"Good take out at affordable prices.  Not any better than Pei Wei or Pick up Stix, but very convenient if you live in the neighborhood since there isn't anything else remotely close.  I can recommend with a clean conscience."}
{"text":"When my family visited Hong Kong Kitchen II the first thing I noticed is that the family dining area can be moved around to host a large group of people. Its also very clean while we were there for the 1 1/2 we noticed constant cleaning. The bathrooms are also spotless and smell nice.   The Food: (Hunan, Mandarin Hong Kong Style)  No M.S.G All the food that we ordered tasted fresh and was full of flavor. During our meal the wait staff stopped by often and paid attention to see if we were looking at them in a way that says, please come here I need something. Often Chinese food tastes over salted but this was not the case. My wife had the sweet and sour chicken because our children 2 and 4 could dip it into the sauce, it was not over done and the vegetables were also fresh and high quality.  I ordered the wonton soup and I have noticed that not every place makes it the same. The wonton's were solid and tasted good but the  chicken broth of the soup was weak and lacked other meat such as shrimp or pieces of chicken. The best wonton soup in the city is hosted at \"PF Changs\" which has pieces of pork and shrimp.    I had the chicken Lo-Mein and I always expect the slightly greasy noodles but they didn't taste that way or like paste. The amount of chicken in the lo-mein plenty and I felt it was a good meal  This is a family business (I asked) and they seem to have a good flow of position and were polite in teaching my children a work in Chinese. I will always visit a family business over a standard eats in your all to common strip mall.   I will visit this place over and over again as I would like to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Actually really liked this place, the reason they received the 3 stars is because the chicken that I got was not that great.   Decor was really nice, very clean and nice chinese decorations.  Bathroom was really clean.   Lo Mein noodles were seasoned really well. Crab Ragoon you can tell were premade however were made fresh and super yummy.  The rice that I got was good as well.  The problem with the chicken was that it was over cooked I think.  I almost believe that it was recooked.  The ends were super crispy and not juicy at all.  I ordered General Tso's chicken.  I have yet to find good Generals chicken in the valley so I will have to keep looking."}
{"text":"So, pretty dang impressed by this place for sure.  These guys took the food quality to the next level compared to all the other places serving the same style of food.  I had the veggie lo mein and it was fantastic ... cheap prices too - the lunch menu was big, lots of choices and I think mine was like 5.95 ... super cheap and so much food.  Great service and I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu....everything that all the rest of my group got looked amazing too and smelled so good.  They all said it was top quality and taste too.  MUST GO BACK SOON!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is HORRIBLE! I ordered orange chx with fried rice, got home and had \"candied\" hard as rock chx pieces and white rice. I called in to see if this was a mistake and the guys tells me, \"We ran out so we gave you what we had\"! So he couldn't tell me that when I picked it up, or offer me any substitution? I guess I just get what he wants me to have. This is the worst chinese food I have ever eaten. Chen's on Chandler Height and Riggs is MUCH better...."}
{"text":"Well, unlike most of these reviews I found this Asian restaurant by far the Worse in the Phoenix area.  In ordering a bowl of egg drop soup, it came 1st with a large chipped bowl I asked that they give me another, and they did it was tasteless and I mean without ANY taste whatsoever  it was barely warm - definitely not hot!!  It had a bag of corn in it which was absolutely awful.  I then asked if I could have their won ton soup....BAD mistake that was like warm water without any broth taste at all.  We had egg rolls (full of grease) The pot stickers were not even warm their food is AWFUL !!!!  But, their service and servers were rude (not friendly at all) and that was before I sent anything back.....  There is NEVER anyone in the dining room (dinner time) and we've been there 2 times....This being the LAST !!  SAVE YOUR MONEY...........GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"}
{"text":"Delicious, East Coast style Chinese food. Always fresh meats, vegetables and delicious sauces. Prices are fair and the portions are quite large. We order out from here at least twice a month. Have never been disappointed. You can't go wrong with any dish! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service wasn't as on point. They give huge servings and lots of really well cooked rice. The food also gets out really fast. It's a really cute and cozy atmosphere. Our waitress seemed very disinterested in taking care of our table, and wasn't very polite, but overall it was decent and I'll probably go there again, but just get take-out."}
{"text":"We ended up trying this place because everything else is closed, it's Christmas Day. We are so happy we did! Absolutely delicious food. Definitely fresh!  I got the Mongolian beef and an order of lo mien. We loved it, even my kids enjoyed it!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was the closest Chinese restaurant to our house so we decided to give it a try. Very friendly staff and quick to take our order. Soup was good and really hot. Egg rolls and crab puffs were also very good. I ordered teriyaki chicken with broccoli. Chicken didn't taste like teriyaki (could have been their own recipe) and broccoli was cold. Over all a good experience. I will try it again for the service, soup, egg rolls and puffs. But will try a different main course. Hopefully it's better than the teriyaki."}
{"text":"The first time I visited the HK Kitchen I was not impressed by any means with their food but the dinning area was very clean and the staff were friendly. I even said to myself that I would not return. What a liar I turned out to be. In the mood for soup and house lo mein all while trying to stay within a five mile radius, I decided to return to the HK Kitchen. It is literally two minutes away from my house, walking distance no less.   I walked in and was immediately greeted very warmly. I already had a notion of what I wanted so I headed straight for the counter and quickly viewed the menu. Looking for Soup section I did not see westlake so I opted for the bowl war wonton soup and then I confirmed with myself on house lo mein. I must have waited about 15-17 minutes tops before my order was ready. I paid and as I was walking out clients slowly began to pour in. Filling the place to half capacity.   I arrive home and immediately started with the soup naturally. To my surprise the soup was good and loaded with meat and veggies. Then I attacked the noodles. Again I was shocked as the noodles were much better than last time. I mean they weren't awesome, but they were good. Seems like something changed at the HK Kitchen. After this experience I am likely to return."}
{"text":"Great egg drop soup, amazing kung pao. Generally I don't care for sweet and sour but I actually enjoyed the sauce here. The lunch meal is great and includes soup, spring roll and crab Rangoon"}
{"text":"If you are looking for awesome Chinese food at a great price then look no further than Hong Kong Kitchen!! I am a frequent take out orderer and love this place. You cannot beat their lunch specials for $6 you get a full meal with soup, egg roll and crab puff included. Staff is very friendly and accommodating also. General Taos chicken is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"Argh.  The first time I ordered takeaway food here it was not ready when I arrived.  I arrived 5 minutes after it was supposed to be ready and ended up waiting for 50 minutes longer.  The food took 70 minutes rather than the 15 they quoted on the phone.  Argh.  But the food was really good.  Argh.  I would have just left but we were having a conversation with someone else in line.  The line of people waiting to pick-up was all the way through the restaurant.  Argh.  Good business practices would have been to offer everyone a discount or something, maybe even serve up some munchies and drinks for the crowd waiting and growing irritable.  But no.  Argh.  But the food was really good.  Argh.  The food was so good we decided to order from Hong Kong Kitchen II again.  Argh.  This time they said 20 minutes.  I arrived 30 minutes later.  And waited an additional 15 minutes.  Argh.  And one of the two entrees was beef and not chicken.  Argh.  I may go back to Hong Kong Kitchen II but only if I'm in a patient mood.  If I had caught the mistake in my order I have to wonder, would I be there another 30 minutes or more waiting for them to get the right food?  Argh.  Serious organizational challenges here.  Tasty food, reasonable prices and a possible good location for an episode of \"Kitchen Disasters.\"  Argh."}
{"text":"Honestly, would not order from here again, I regret to say.  Ordered over $110 of food, a variety of dishes and no one in my party enjoyed any of it.  The egg rolls tasted of old grease and that is probably the best thing I can say.  Do yourself a favor and take this place off your list."}
{"text":"Still looking for a good Chinese place in Chandler/Gilbert. From the reviews I'd hoped I'd found one, but...  My first impression as I walked in was a strong odor of fried noodles. I ordered the Broccoli Shrimp lunch special. The egg drop soup came first. It was decent & the bowl surrounded by very dense, fried wonton chips. I had just about finished the soup when my meal arrived. My first bite of veg, though, was cold. The dish's temperature varied from cold to hot throughout the meal. The rice was quite average, but dry, and there wasn't enough sauce from the shrimp dish to moisten it. Overall, very disappointing.  I'm convinced I'll need to go back to Lima for chifa...Best Chinese food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We get takeout from here all the time.  Always fast and delicious.  We have tried lots of menu items and they are all good."}
{"text":"This is about the best Chinese food I've tried around this area. It has great flavor and fresh ingredients. I love coming here for lunch because of the lunch menu"}
{"text":"This is a really good fast and typical Chinese restaurant. Very clean and doesn't seat too many people. Expect good prices and a large serving of food, lunch prices are cheaper and slightly smaller but great value. The service was fine but didn't actually stand out and they messed up my order slightly. To those who like Egg Foo Young, this is one of less recommended ones I would say. Sauce isn't strong enough and the egg is more starchy than other ones. Lo mein was very good!"}
{"text":"The last three or four times I have called to place a take-out order, the woman taking my order had an awful attitude, like I was bothering her. On these last several occasions when I have arrived to pick up my food, I was not greeted as I entered the building, and the female employees hanging out in the front of the restaurant rudely continued their conversation in an Asian language as I stood there, waiting to pay for my food that was sitting on the counter.   The food tasted all right, but the portions seemed to shrink again and the food was not the freshest it could have been (and I even arrived within the ten minute window, as instructed by Grumpy on the phone).  I'm not in any rush to return here & have since begun frequenting Iron Chef in Queen Creek.   Work on your customer service skills, please!"}
{"text":"Food is some of the best Asian food I've had in the valley. Service was fast and the staff is awesome. Prices are very reasonable and the menu was very diverse. Portions were large and the food was of good quality. I left full and happy and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Just moved to Gilbert and out of the four Chinese restaurants we have tried this is by far our favorite. It doesn't matter what you order, Rd going to be good"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening just sure that I would have to wait a while for my food to go.  Not so.  I had my order within five minutes and I was not disappointed in the food at all. The shrimp with lobster sauce was scrumptious and the portion was huge.  Definitely worth the price!  I am making Hong Kong Kitchen my favorite for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Always good and fresh.  I love the shrimp fried rice but my son loves the low mein and orange chicken.  I have tried other dishes and never have been disappointed."}
