Id come back over anajehos or native tounges. 
Next time ill try something else off there menu"}
{"text":"We've walked by this place so many times while spending time on 17th ave, we decided to give their taco Tuesday a try. First, the hostess, can't crack a smile, not a good start. Server comes along, wow stone cold, we've never had a server so unfriendly. It was like it was a nuisance for her to be serving us, hello, it's your job. Obviously it's not just us as other's have described a similar experience on this place. I was hoping the food would make up for this extremely poor display of customer service, sadly it did not. The tacos, although it had a lot of toppings, it was so bland that the side of salsa and hot sauces couldn't even save it. It actually worked out with how bad the food was because we had lost our appetite from the service and just wanted to leave. It's clear that it's not just the one server and hostess, but overall management. Time to clean house!"}
{"text":"Poor service, bland food!

I tried Blanco Cantina for the first time tonight for their half price Taco Tuesday special, but I won't be going back due to the service. Our waitress was borderline rude from the second she approached us. On observing some of the other staff with patrons, it seems this wasn't an isolated experience.  One of the wait staff almost chastised a family who had just walked in. 
I ordered the pork, chicken and pulled beef tacos. The chicken taco was pretty good, however the other two were very bland and the corn taco shell fell apart quickly as the filling was so wet and runny.  All in all, super messy to eat with not much flavour."}
{"text":"Came in for halfy hour and was not disappointed. Excellent margaritas and nachos. Great staff and service despite a full restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Blanco a couple of times since it opened... both not great.  The food was \"meh\" for Mexican style, but the service was absolutely horrendous.  The most recent time my party ordered drinks and did not have anyone come back for food orders for 40 mins... not ideal at dinner time.  When someone did come take food orders, and I turned to glance at the menu to confirm the name of the dish, the waitress responded with \"have I done something to offend you or something?!\".  Overall a very uncomfortable experience for everyone at our table.  I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have eaten at blanco a handful of times so far and every time it has been better than the next, I love the cantina feel they have created. The burritos are exactly how they are described (BIG ASS!!) and delicious, the watermelon marg is definitely a must. This place has a vibrant energy so if you don't like people or noise maybe you should stay home and be grumpy by yourself.  If you are a day drinker try halfy hour from 3-5 everyday for 5$ margs and half price nachos, poutine and tequila. This will be my go to spot for delicious Mexican"}
{"text":"Last time we were here a couple weeks ago and it was busy we were told to seat ourselves. This time we waited at the front 5-10 mins and no hostess came by so we did the same only to have the hostess find us and give us a lecture a couple minutes later. We still got a table and other than that the service was ok. Food and drinks were good as usually. A little loud for a sit-down place. Probably would have been 4 stars if not for the patronizing hostess."}
{"text":"This was stop number 2 for my Calgary Taco Fiesta crawl. Their taco offering was a \"chipotle confit pork belly\" with apple slaw and I figured out I was officially Team Pork Belly.

Service was friendly and my order came out very quickly. With the description, I wasn't expecting pulled pork but that's what I got. The pork was well cooked and they didn't pull any punches with the heat. It was spicy hot! I normally expect the slaw on a taco to balance or compliment the meat. This slaw did neither and I wasn't pleased about that. The slaw seemed to have been mixed with the same sauce as the pork so it didn't have an independent taste of its own. 

Decor was pretty cool. While I have no major complaints, I also did not have any wow moments and a return trip is doubtful"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and good patio. Food is decent - nothing fancy or too adventurous. My go-to here is the regular-sized veggie burrito, which is a MEAL and is very reasonably priced! I can eat as much as the next guy, but the burrito comes with two sides and after that, I am stuffed. I imagine some people could share one between two people. If you can make it for their happy hour then you are winning. Pass on the nachos unless you're going to load them up."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic night here, with my husband. The staff went above and beyond, in terms of providing professional and friendly service. We felt very welcomed. Our server did a great job of going through then menu and helping us make selections. She was knowledgeable and knew the menu well. You can tell that the staff and management, take a lot of pride in their place of work. Food is consistently great. I highly recommend Blanco and I look forward to going back, again. Thanks for a great dining experience ."}
{"text":"First time to this new establishment! I would say the ambience is great, great for all occasions but the food ok not great. The waitress we had was awesome! Definitely would come back for the good service we had!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, greeted promptly, seated within a few minutes. Staff were obviously new but very friendly. Food portions were great, Watermelon Margarita the best (they creep up on you so dont be tempted to have too many).
Will be back again with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"You guys, EVERYDAY from 3-5PM is \"Halfy Hour\" at Blanco. That means 1/2 price tacos & nachos, tequila & rum and $5 margs & beers. How can you NOT take advantage of this?

When we arrived, our waitress said we had 5 mins to get our orders in, but seeing how I had already studied the menu before we arrived we didn't panic. A couple watermelon margaritas, a cerveza, tacos (fish, chicken & beef) and platter of nachos and we were ready to party.

The breaded basa fish tacos were aH-mazing! The mango salsa gave it a nice sweet balance to the salty fish. I didn't love the chicken tacos (just preference, I don't like pulled chicken/pork) but it was still pretty decent. The watermelon drinks cleansed our palettes and were quite refreshing! And the thick cut tortilla chips in the nachos were perfect for holding up all the toppings (no soggy chips here!)

I really liked the food at Blanco. However, it was eerily empty the whole time we were here which is odd since it's in a prime location. Maybe it was an off day? Guess the only way to find out is to head back again, which I will absolutely do :)"}
{"text":"Overall I was impressed with this new place which is in the location of the old Brava Bistro on 17th Ave SW. I think the restaurant is owned by the same group as the Anejo restaurant in the Mission area. This Mexican inspired restaurant is perfect for a casual get together with friends. I liked the laid back feel of the restaurant with the TVs, booths and high top tables. The passion fruit margarita is a must try! It wasn't too sweet which I appreciated. The Mexican poutine was a hit at our table and a friend of mine was also really impressed with the fish tacos . The food and drinks came out fast and perfectly made. The server was friendly and able to answer our questions on the menu. I recommend this place and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"In the old Brava Bistro location on 17th Ave (single tear) sits Blanco Cantina, a fairly authentic Mexican place.

On a sunny day this spot has a great patio for a casual lunch. Good food in Americaesk style portions will leave you feeling full.

Service was a touch slow and the 'people watching' area of the patio is right at street level with little to no barrier (ladies watch your bags) but a decent enough place in an excellent location.

{"text":"This was my worst tex mex experience ever!! The food was bland & the carne was hard!!"}
{"text":"After the Russia vs Canada rugby match I came here with some friends.
As we walked in we were asked would be be finished by 8.00pm.  This put us of a bit because what it is really saying is the money that might show up later is more important that the money  we are spending now.

We then ordered a we drinks and the nachos.  WARNING DO NOT ORDER THE NACHOS.
When the order arrived it had sour cream all over it and I someone that does not like sour cream was a bit confused as to why this was done and why we were not told.  

The sever then point to the order form saying that is how is comes.  Again thank you for being so polite.  The wording they use does not say we will smear sour cream on top and if you don't like we really don't care.

I was then told if you don't like it you can talk to a manager a guy by the name of Jess came over very helpful but this had gone on to long and as a group we decided to leave.

Note if I was offered new nachos with no sour cream I would have been happy and would have spent more money."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and polite staff.
I loved the nachos. Maybe one of best nacho experiences!
Also I had the raspberry beer which was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Super bad costumer service and the food meh! Normally I'm the kind of guy that if I don't have anything good to say I reserve my opinion but in this case I won't as I have never been treated so bad in a restaurant. The owners of this place are the same owners of AÃ±ejo. Food is terrible in both places. The only decent choice in their menu is the guacamole and you just need to pick a good avocado to prepare a good guacamole. The service... I don't know where to start but overall really bad. We were a group of 12 people. We got to the place around 10pm and the place was semi full. The managers of the place were two of the owners. One of them (Cliff Harvey) treated us really bad since we got there. Half of us got a table and the other half we sat at the bar. We ordered food and drinks and I have to say that Jacob our server and bar tender was amazing, he was really friendly and a very customer service oriented guy who enjoy what he does for living. After an hour or so one of the tables besides our friends got vacant and we asked the manager if we could take it to join the other half of the group. His response was NO. He said you guys are all settled at the bar so we will keep serving you where you are and he gave the table to other people who were just arriving to the restaurant with no reservation just like us. Bottom line he only cared about getting people in the restaurant to spend their money but he cared less about offering a good customer service. Bad food and bad service is the worst combination ever so I will never go back to that place again."}
{"text":"Probably best to order an appetizer only. Main dishes were disappointing and I actually think I feel sick from the disgusting burrito."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I waited a full year to write a review for Blanco! 

I have to say, yes...that's right people it's not Anejo, but it's not suppose to be. Blanco has it's own charm and charisma. I like how when you walk in you feel like you left Calgary and are somewhere else.

The food I had previously (tacos, gauc, fajitas, nachos) have all been tasty. I of course prefer when the gauc is made at your table like at Anejo, but it tastes the same so whatevs.

I found the service to be standard and the drinks to be delicious. I like that you can get an iceberg with a radler... super refreshing!

Atmosphere is fun and they have a cute dÃ©cor, I like Blanco for what it's trying to be... a \"tex mex\" similar to Julio's, but BETTER."}
{"text":"When I was on a poutine crawl for Poutine Week we changed destinations and came to Blanco Cantina instead.  They were super generous with letting us all in at the last minute and their poutine for the week was a Poutine Burrito with sides.

I'll start with the sides that I tried.  The cornbread was fluffy and delicous with big bits of corn throughout and the fries were crispy but could have used a little more flavour.  The corn salad was nice, very fresh with a hint of spice.

The Burrito itself had shaved skirt steak, cheese curds, spicy Mexican gravy, house cut fries, and coriander scented onions.  The steak was the best part.  The marinade and cook of the meat was perfect, the cheese was nicely melted.  The onions were mixed in nicely, but I think the mushy fries didn't work too well.  Honestly just the meat and cheese would be fantastic if they ever make something similar again.

We were in a back corner so the noise from the kitchen was pretty high but for a last-minute arrangement it worked out really well."}
{"text":"There is something I love about this space and then in equal parts somethings that totally threw me off the love. Here are the hi's and low's to help you decide yourself.

Service was very prompt and quick. Considering how quickly they filled up on a Saturday night feel we were lucky to come when we did and get a table without a wait. Server was very friendly but not too pushy, giving us time to catch up with a drink before deciding on food. One of the ladies at the table has this weird drink order she loves and the server took it in stride and produced as requested. One star for that alone.

They also have a board with 50 tequila and 50 rum choices on it - you will not be disappointed if you like either one. Menu notes Halfy Hour has having some pretty awesome deals daily from 3-5pm. Love that the weekend made it into these times, even if we missed out being there just after 5pm.

Food wise...
She had the 1/2 Carne (pulled beef) burrito with side choices of coleslaw and fries. Was warned the beef is a little spicy and had no problem with the heat on that one. Beef was deliciously tasty and tender. Fries were crispy and still hot coming out. Said the coleslaw was pretty good. For 1/2 size it is pretty big so she was happy not to have gone the whole 1lb size.

The boy had the Jefe Pable burger with side choices of fries and guacamole. For a side portion the guacamole was pretty massive - I have seen smaller sizes as an extra charge with nachos at some places. Was big enough for the boy and friend to share. Burger comes with 3 different chillies on + chilli gravy + queso (cheese sauce). Thought it could have been hotter for the amount of chillies but he is crazy that way so figure if you like heat this one is a winner. Downside? The burger was super salty. Now we are people that love the salt. So if he could only get 1/2 way though before it got to salty there is a problem,. Not sure if someone got seasoning measurements wrong or if the ground beef just wasn't mixed well enough but had one sad boy who couldn't finish his burger. 
- note the burger and sides were still big enough that he was 90% full
- second note, when we told the server she was very apologetic and promised the tell the kitchen. No discount on the bill but as he was 1/2 way though I can understand that.

I went with Pollo Loco Fried chicken, cause who doesn't like fried chicken? Sides were corn bread and refitos (re-fried beans). Normally I am the biggest fan of re-fried beans, but these were spicy. now I get that we are in a Mexican restaurant but why the spicy beans? They are there to be mild and delicious and cool the mouth as you eat chillies. Or is that just me? Chicken was tender and most with a lovely crispy outside, with chopped up jalapenos scattered over it. Asked for the chilli gravy on the side, had great flavour and was completely devoured with the fries. Queso sauce kind of looked like melted Velveeta on top. Corn bread was quite tasty and thankfully not spicy so that helped with the heat. All in all tasty but started getting too hot mid way through, but I don't like too much spice.

No space for dessert, and of the 3 options none grabbed us enough to share either.

Food gets us to 3 stars. Not blown away by anything and not entirely disappointed. kind of left somewhere in the middle. 

Love the decor though so would maybe rather just come back in for a drink or 2 next time. Also appreciate that they had the music on but low enough we didn't have to shout to hear each other."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in the city. 3-5 everyday. 1/2 price nachos and tequila shots - seriously how can you go wrong."}
{"text":"So I love Mexican.  And the food here was pretty good. But I have to give a 1 star because the waitress was so terrible that it left a disgusting taste in my mouth. 

She started off service with complaining about the previous table she had. She ended off service with arguing with me when I didn't tip her. 

She was missing most of the evening we were there and I had to repeatedly order my drink from the bar and bring it to the patio myself. 

When I brought it up with one of the other staff members she came over and began another argument with me. 

I paid for dinner, not a show."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised that this restaurant only has a 3-star rating. Last night a group of four of us went to Blanco for their 1/2 price nachos, after we saw an ad on Facebook stating simply they had \"1/2 price nachos everyday.\" When we arrived, we were disappointed to discover the nachos were not half price. We asked our [unhelpful] server why they weren't half price, showing her the ad we saw on Facebook. She said she had to ask the kitchen staff and returned about 15 minutes later to share that half price nachos are only available during the happy hour. When I saw the ad, I thought it was maybe a May promotion or something; I had no idea it was only available at a certain time of day. We expressed our disappointment in the misleading ad, but the waitress didn't care at all. We ended up ordering the nachos full price, along with some margaritas. The food was ok - nothing to write home about. The margaritas were yummy. But overall, the service was subpar. We ended up getting a different server for the remainder of our stay by fluke, which made an improvement, but the false advertising was very misleading. Blanco needs to alter their Facebook and Instagram ad to include the hours of availability. We felt as if they should've honoured the discount for their lack of clarity in the ad."}
{"text":"Great friendly attentive staff and the portions are really good as well. Good selection of everything on tap and behind the bar. will be back again and again."}
{"text":"What a great place. We went yesterday for the first time. The food was good. We took advantage of \"Taco Tuesday \" and wernt disappointed. Fish, Pork & Chicken was fantastic. It was $7.00 for 3 tacos. Great patio and nice staff. Booze was pricey but it's 17th Ave so whatever."}
{"text":"So I'm conflicted because I love the food here, and have had some great servers at night here. However I brought my friends here for happy hour after our server mentioned it last time. It was a bit of a different experience.  I felt a bit embarrassed because I had raved about the place. Our server was not pleasant at all despite my efforts to be nice. My friends are less accommodating. They hadn't been there before so got confused when ordering the nachos, but rather than explain it to her she got mega rude and condescending. I was in total shock. I picked up that my gf wasn't understanding so took the time to explain how the ordering system went, but that really shouldn't be my job. The rest of the experience was just awkward...like I just wanted to leave right away."}
{"text":"I went with a friend a few weeks ago. To start, we ordered the guacamole, then a variety tacos  and drinks. I was surprised when they brought over the guacamole. It literally only had avocado, nothing else. Not even salt! When our waitress came over to see how things were, I expressed my concern about the lack of ingredients and her reply was \"this is the same recipe as AÃ±ejo's. I pointed out the lack of onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lime, salt, jalapeÃ±os and the fact that I'm latina and I know what guacamole tastes like. She did take it back to the kitchen and they added very few things to it. So their guacamole gets a -1 rating. The tacos were good, especially the fish. Drinks good, service good."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite because at Blanco Cantina size is everything and their food portions are MASSIVE. 
Well over the size of a hefty 'American' portion, it's questionable how they can even make money. 
They are seriously OUTRAGEOUS! 

The menu contains Burritos, Burgers, Poutines & Nachos.... All with a Mexican flair. 
But the list doesn't end there! 

50+ Rums & Tequilas, drafts and even Red Bull slushies, Blanco is a place you'll go for one and end up staying the night.

And with there $5 margarita & draft happy hour and 50% off nachos and poutines happening Everyday Day(yes, weekends included) between 3-5pm, you'll end up starting early and ending late! 

An amazing concept and a very welcome addition to the popular 17th ave!"}
{"text":"Third visit and below mediocre. Drinks are acid like bar lime mix is over used. Nachos were burnt on top, uncooked in the middle.  Fish tacos deep fried to almost charcoal. Can't tell it's fish. Server even commented on nachos, shrugged and walked away. Such a fan of Anejo but can't give Blanco a 4th chance.

And just realizing that for Halfy Hour we got charged full price. Damn it."}
{"text":"Came here for some nachos, wasn't expecting much, but damn were they delicious! The serving size is crazy big, definitely worth it! The chicken was good as well!

Only thing that was wrong was that we chose to not have olives in our nachos but unfortunately there were olives... Server was nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great drinks that packs a punch. Their Tres leches dessert is also a must.

But their fish poke in tostada should be skipped. Our dish was bland and tasted like it was left out for a long time. Probably because no one orders it enough- perhaps it's best left out of their menu entirely."}
{"text":"You can hands down have a 5-Star experience at Blanco Cantina if you do it right. 

In their court: Service. Luckily, out of the two times I've been here, they've had it dialed! I'm really impressed with how our server managed to help us out with our orders, make good suggestions, friendly conversation, and still manage a jam packed restaurant. Kudos!

In your court: Expectation. Why are you coming here? If it's for halfy hour margaritas in the sunshine, you're gonna have a good time! I probably wouldn't throw Blanco into a \"Best/Most Authentic Mexican food\" category, but they're really not trying to be that anyway. They've taken awesome things like rum tequila and tiki bars and given it a local, 17th Ave feel and I think it works. 

They also have a \"Halfy Hour\" every day, including weekends. I tell you, at half price, those hand crafted Mezcalaritas taste extra good. In fact they taste like another, and another, and a full day of sitting on their amazing patio. 

The patio gets a lot of shade, but they've got plenty of heating so they can keep it open well into the evening. Two large garage type doors open up almost removing the front wall entirely, adding to the relaxed Tiki feel of the place.

I've so far only tried their special menu items created for Poutine Week and AB Burger Fest, but both of them were definitely good enough have me wanting to come back again to see what they're regularly up to."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is very inviting and the service was exceptional. The food was outstanding, I recommend the fish or pulled beef tacos. The flavours were amazing and not over powering. Beef was really juicy and not salty. The fish taco was perfect we were given some jalapeÃ±o ranch to put on the fish taco and it was so good. You could taste the jalapeÃ±o but it wasn't spicy. All night we were continually asked if we wanted anything else and if we were doing okay. We continually asked about what tequila we should get and kept getting great advice. Our server Cole was fantastic . He knew everything about tequila and was super friendly definitely coming back the next time I come from Edmonton."}
{"text":"The place is consistently dead. The drink deals suck. And the service isn't great. I enjoy Mexican food and love going to places like Anejo. The food here wasn't fantastic and was incredible over priced for very small portions. The draft beer was also excessively over priced for a place most people go for a casual meal and drinks. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant! The patio is strung with lights and bar seating faces onto 17th ave where you can partake in plenty of people watching!!

The menu is Mexican- fajitas, tacos, soup, burritos. We started with the guacamole which is made in their sister restaurant. It was delicious! The chips were thick and baked and sprinkled with a chilli powder. Gave the dish a nice little kick. 

The tacos must be ordered in 3s so I ordered the pork tacos and my friend ordered the fish tacos. The fish tacos were over-deep fries and has few toppings making for a sub par taco. The pork was a little better. Lots of meat and well seasoned. Overall I have mixed review. Great place to maybe go for drinks and snacks rather than a full meal."}
{"text":"$2.50 tacos all night long on Tuesdays!! The tacos were tasty and the service was excellent. My favourite here are the pork tacos and the fish tacos. We also enjoyed chips and guac and salsa to start. Lots if delicious drinks to choose from including the spicy sweet pineapple sorrento margarita which is my mom's favourite!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the deck... Service was decent, food was excellent and the drinks delicious."}
{"text":"Yum!  The nachos are the must try item on the menu.  The margaritas run a close second.  Nothing fake here - all good - all the time.  The staff is very friendly and helpful with the menu.  They also have a LARGE selection of tequila & rum.  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The guac was made with brown avos which taste terrible, the service was slow, the food is overpriced and tasteless.  The tacos are literally dry battered fish/meat, raw onion and a small amount of cabbage and a few pieces of cilantro wrapped in a dry tortilla. We told our waitress how bad they were and she got us some sour cream which at least made them edible (and admitted she can't even eat them without sour cream).  The only pro here is that the margaritas are tasty - although the service was so slow we ended up having to spend more on drinks than dinner.  Do yourself a favor take your $75 and buy corn flour, frozen fish, avocados, tequila, a blender and host a taco party at home."}
{"text":"I have been twice and both times found the food Soso. Nachos were very bland with not enough toppings.  Chicken quesadilla was very salty and also bland.  My friend had fish tacos that weren't very good."}
{"text":"Went for the happy hour and was very happy. Everything tasted great. Very good salsas. I think at full price I would have been complained a bit about portion sizes etc."}
{"text":"Blanco has a great location right in the middle of 17th Ave. They have great decor and ambiance throughout the restaurant and a great patio for the warmer summer months.

Their nacho happy hour is a great bang for your buck and you can really customize the order to your preferences and requirements. On a recommendation from our waitress last time we also ordered the wings which were on special and they were delicious, I was impressed. Chips and Queso are another solid offering. I mostly come in to share appies and drinks so I can't speak to the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went there Friday evening, had the Fish Tacos, they were so good, went back Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon. 
So, Friday I ordered Fish Tacos, my wife had the beef tacos, we swapped one of our three with was other to get a taste off going. The beef tacos were superb, but the Fish Tacos were out of this world, Breaded Basa, perfectly cooked with fresh, zesty topping and a side bowl of salsa. Three delicious tacos for $15, or \"Haffy Hour\" between 3-5 is half price. 
It's really nice inside there, it's around the corner from home, but I would travel without hesitation to eat here GIVE IT A TRY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood, Blanco Cantina inhabits the former Brava Bistro. Inside has been transformed into a tequila wonderland and the promise of a killer patio had me already looking to next summer. 

Bright and airy with whimsy throughout, the decor sets the mood. TVs wrap around the bar to show the games and ambient music plays overhead.

But who cares, you want the dirt on the food. Well, here's the nachos and poutine that Calgary deserves. You can choose between big and frigging huge, and from there you pick from unlimited toppings, then add your protein and extras. You can do the same to the poutine or choose from pre-built options. 

The menu is large and the tequila plentiful. You would be foolish to skip this place if you're a fan of Mexican food and good spirits!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good food, ease of booking a group reservation, location
Cons: Got overcharged, then got a condescening attitude when we started questioning what was going on. Worst experience ever. 

If I could give a 0.5, I would. 

I wanted to wait a day to write this review. I hoped time would ease the disappointment I felt yesterday for my birthday brunch. Nope. Still makes me angry. 

We were a group of 14 out for a joint birthday celebration. Reserving was easy, it was a simple phone call and all was sorted. A majority were a little bit late getting there but there were some of us that got there on time (I called to let them know we were going to be late). When we did though, it was very easy to order food, and the food got out on time and was tasty. We did not get our waters refilled (I actually didn't get a water, period, but I was the last one to get in.) The server never checked up on us and how the food tasted or if we needed anything. However, she was nice enough to get us some candles when I ordered desserts. It was a birthday, after all. 

This is where the pleasant part of the lunch ends. 

I asked for our bill and got a huge bill for all of our orders, with gratuity already added. That part wasn't mentioned in our reservation or when we got the bill. While it would have been nice to get separate bills, we weren't even given an option but that's understandable because we are a big group. As we were slowly settling our bill, we kept getting new printouts of how much we owed. Which is fine if the totals stayed the same. The total went up by approximately $80 and we had multiple copies of the bill going around. One of my friends took a picture of the original printout and it didn't match with the new ones, but seeing as we were a group of 14, there was another clump trying to make sense of it all. Some of us just resolved to pay more than our share to settle the bill. Throughout all this, our server was nowhere to be found, and we just had the manager telling us how much we owed. When it was clear there was a discrepancy, I asked to cross reference the receipts and was refused, saying the computer accounts for it. One of my friends and I went across the restaurant to find the server and the manager to express our concerns, only to find out another table's orders were put on ours. We asked for the server to come out to our group to clarify things but she would not. When we got wind that some people overpaid, I simply decided to leave along with some of my friends. I felt frustrated, drained and exhausted. Some decided to stay to try and figure things out, but got nowhere. 

When speaking to the manager and server, I felt irrelevant and small in their eyes - I felt stupid. Way to make a birthday celebrant feel special, Blanco staff.  

While the food is decent, the service we got was enough to turn us off from this establishment and anything to do with it. 

Thank you so much for ruining my birthday brunch. I do not recommend this place whatsoever."}
{"text":"I had the best Miami Vice ever at Blanco Cantina!

However, the ceviche tostadas were bleh. I don't think it was made fresh, it lacked flavor and most importantly did not seem to be cured in citrus juices to give that acidic flavor I was craving. It was not a ceviche. It was just raw tuna/partly cooked salmon on a board. I guess I'll only go here for drinks in the future.

I did enjoy the tres leches because it reminded me of bread pudding, one of my fave desserts. But there was almost too much cream cheese icing layered on top. Scraped off half of it. Unless you love sweet, you'll want to do the same.

At least the Miami Vice was great!"}
{"text":"If I ever had children and one of them died, I would have a hard time deciding between attending the funeral and making it to halfy hour for tacos at Blanco. This is why I can never have children."}
{"text":"Incredibly sadden by this place. I wanted to give this place a chance again but it just saddens me. I ordered from skip the dishes. My partner and I ordered burritos. My partner ordered pulled beef and I ordered the veggie burrito. In my opinion the veg burrito is way over priced and it doesn't have cheese or sour cream. Beans and rice are cheap, but the veg burrito is just overpriced. The salsa packaged in it was for some reason sweetish which doesn't compliment the burrito at all. They should reconsider the veggie options. Saturday I ordered from skip the dishes, my food was warm and I was hungry so I was excited. I started to eat my burrito and I was surprised how good it was, until I saw the beef. I was incredibly disgusted and my partner thought maybe it was seasoned jackfruit. I called the restaurant 3 times no one answered then we realized that they put the burritos in the wrong box. They put the veg in the beef one and the beef in the veg one. I understand people make mistakes, but they need to be more cautious. If it was someone with some kind of allergy they'd possibly have some kind of lawsuit. Please reconsider your menu I know authentic Mexican food and texmex food and this is definitely not that. I do appreciate the vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Service was not great.... drinks took a long time and were meh, food orders taken.
My food arrived wrong, I asked for the pork tacos with no tomatoes and no cilantro, chicken tacos arrived with tomatoes and cilantro... rather than apologies both servers blamed each other and went back and got me new tacos....The new tacos were crazy spicy.. which was not advertised, like inedible spicy, so the server brought me some sour cream... when i told her I could not eat them, she brought me a take away box. . . . .thanks?
I'll stick to Anejo"}
{"text":"Oh dear - cute tex mex decor and ambiance was ruined by poor service and poor food! 

I was recently in the mood for Tex Mex, and I walked by this place on 17th and thought I'd give it a shot. I love the decor and styling of the place - looks hip and happening despite the lack of customers on the Saturday afternoon. 

We got the Poutine Burrito as well as a the classic burrito. I thought the Poutine Burrito was pretty good for a gimmicky choice - the steak was done rare (excellent) and the balance of flavours was good. The Classic Burrito was not good at all - the flavours were completely bland and it didn't taste much like anything. 

As far as sides, I got the mac and cheese (+$3 upcharge), which was the biggest mistake of the day. Granted some may say that I'm asking for it, ordering mac and cheese at a \"tex mex\" place, but man this iteration of Mac and Cheese was brutal. The pasta was completely dry, tasteless, CHEESELESS, and also sauceless. I 100% was going to send it back, but......


The service was poor. After serving the food, the waitress did not check on our table, not once, despite my attempts to flag her down. Our water glasses were not refilled either. I couldn't even find the waitress to send back this awful mac and cheese. 

I hope she wasn't surprised when I left a significantly reduced tip. 

Mexican food in Calgary is generally disappointing, but this experience was especially so - what a missed opportunity for what could have been a hip and trendy spot on 17th, that could have had excellent food."}
{"text":"The service and drinks are so great here that I wish I could give it a higher rating. Unfortunately, the food is underwhelming. When I think tex-mex, I think sizzle and flavour- not so at Blanco. Unless you order something coming out on a flat iron, the food is lukewarm or down right cold. Their meats and fish are void of any spice blend to awaken your taste buds. Go on Tuesday for half priced tacos and give things a try if you are tempted!"}
{"text":"Guacamole, tuna poke and grilled fish tacos....such an amazing night to share great food with an open patio and an amazing waitress who took great care in recommending my watermelon margarita and the churros that ended our meal.  Everything was deelish!!!

Fish came out on a fajita skillet with spicy grilled onions, rice and beans.  You build your own taco rather than getting the usual flour tortillas with slaw on a stand up plate. The soft, warm shells were perfect for holding the ingredients. Guacamole is the same as at Anejo; so light and airy with thick  lightly spiced chips. 

Music was upbeat and just loud enough that we could talk at a normal volume. Decor was relaxed and exactly what an after work summer night should include...

A lot of construction on 17ave and parking was hard to find but other than that, I can't wait to return and try some other items! Sorry Yelpers, I was engrossed in convo and forgot to take pics. Next time!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their margaritas and nachos! Their guac is delicious!  The ambience is fantastic and it's a great place to go on Sundays!

Their patio doesn't get much sun exposure and their main course food is rather flavourless. 

If you want good drinks, good vibes and good nachos, hit this place up!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the killer happy hour special daily.  All tequilas and rums are half price making it very easy to make your way through the list and trying some I've never had the pleasure of tasting before.  The only food we were able to try were the nachos which were delicious!  Note to self- make a reservation because the whole joint was reserved by 6 pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Not only was this the worst Mexican food I've ever had, but the worst food period. The fish taco I got was a dried out tortilla shell with dried out fish falling out of it. I ordered a taco salad and got a box of lettuce without a shell, however the cardboard box was the tastiest part of the meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Blanco Cantina.  I cannot really review the interior and the staff too much as I only ordered for take-out.  Although I had no issues with the staff (they were quite friendly) my review is only regulated to the food portion of the restaurant.

I ordered the El Demonio 1lbs burrito.  It came with two sides so I chose the biscuit and the corn salad.  First, the sides; the biscuit was nice and moist and they were nice enough to wrap it in saran wrap for me to keep it warm.  It had a bit of veggies and cheese in the mix.  The creamed corn salad was interesting.  It lacked a bit of flavour but was a nice palette cleanser.  And now onto the burrito; it's HUGE.  The 1lbs is almost all soft and tender beef brisket.  I found the beef to be a bit bland but the texture was all there.  Another thing, it had 3-chili symbols beside it on the menu so I was aware it would be spicy.  It had A LOT of heat.  I can usually handle spice but it was a bit too much for me (now I know for next time).  I ended up not finishing 1/5 of the burrito because of how spicy it was.  Along with the brisket were fries and a salsa wrapped in together.  I didn't think it was that great of a combination and at $21 for the dish I don't think I'll ever get it again.

I had a bit of a higher expectation and perhaps it was a case of just ordering the wrong thing.  I will be back to try out other items (sans the chilis)."}
{"text":"I just tried this place out since I live across the street and I'm glad there is a Mexican restaurant close by now. I like the decor and the drink choices and menu are good. I got the tortilla soup and El Diablo Burrito which was the size of a small child. Both were pretty good (not amazing) and I like the hot sauce choices (Valentina is soo good). I would like to see enchiladas on the menu though."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us decided to give it a try since it has a central location. Unfortunately theres nothing to rave about in regards to the food. The good: chips/guac, the prompt service and some of the drinks. The bad: most food items we tried including the fried chicken, fajitas, burrito and pescado tacos. All the food was a bit bland and did not excite any of our taste buds at all. The rice tasted a bit off and the beans also had no flavour. Not good mexican food at all (and we compared with a couple other friends who went on different nights). Los Chilitos is a bit better if you walk down a couple blocks. Or if you want better tacos go check out Native Tongues (another new spot)."}
{"text":"We have been to Blanco a few times, and the food has been what brings us back, the service is always not nearly as good as the food they serve.
Tonight, we got there at 8pm, without a reservation, but fully expecting to wait for a table. We put our name on the list and we're told the wait would be 45 minutes. We left our phone number and they said they would call us.. over 45 minutes later we went back and they said it would be ANOTHER 40 minutes. We told them we would wait and again they would call us when the had a table for us. It is now TWO AND A HALF HOURS later and still no call for a table. We ended up going to another restaurant for dinner and drinks. 
A previous time we went with a reservation because it was going to be a large group. I called and let them know it would be for ten people, a week in advance. Then three days before I called and let them know that it would be thirteen people instead. When we got there we were crammed into a table that wasn't even big enough for the original ten people.
Unfortunately the food there is really good, but not worth going back because of the crappy service and overcrowded space."}
{"text":"Another place on 17th that allowed my little guy at lunch.   Lots of complaints of poor service, but we came during the week at lunch time and it was dead so hard to say - the service was obviously good since there were only a few couples in the whole place.

I had the quesadilla and a beer and it was very tasty, the flavours were great, I loved the salsa.  
Will definitely return."}
