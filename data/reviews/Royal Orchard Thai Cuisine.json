{"text":"I been here a number of times and have enjoyed it.  Last night not so much.  The bbq thai steak was mostly gristle.  When I pointed it out they said so sorry, but there was no offer to select another item.  When the bill came I was charged the full price, when I questioned this the reponse was so sorry.  I wont be back"}
{"text":"A nice quiet spot to dine out for Thai.  Portions are good, staff is friendly, food comes out quickly and it's never too busy that you can't hold a conversation.  Also plenty of free parking if you want to have a group dinner here.  Fave dishes include the soups and pad Thai :)"}
{"text":"I've been to better Thai places but not in Toronto.  There are a lot I haven't been to though, particularly downtown.  All the standard plates are done well.  I haven't strayed too far beyond the typical thai dishes though so..."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I tend to always get the Tamarind Chicken with rice and it never seems to disappoint. However, they have the BEST coconut chicken soup ever. It's so delicious.   A little bit on the pricey side, but it's pretty good.   Oh and I love that the waiters and waitresses are in traditional clothing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch recently and was disappointed once again. It's not your typical Thai restaurant and what I mean by that is that the food really lacks flavour and spice, perhaps it catering too much to the area rather than catering to the people who know authentic Thai foods. Where's the heat and the amazing aromatic ingredients?The service is good and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food in Thornhill or Richmond Hill. Been coming here for more than 10 years and never been disappointed. The Pad Thai and Curry are some of our favourite items."}
{"text":"Just went here tonight with my wife. Unfortunately this has to be one of the worst Thai restaurants in the Toronto area. I suggest if you are considering Thai food, you look around elsewhere."}
{"text":"Dropped by one night for a quick dinner. I honestly think that they make their pad thai with ketchup, and use frozen spring rolls from the Food Basics next door. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Thai food tasted good but portion size was surprisingly small for the red Thai curry and for the price.  I came here from a previous review saying the portion sizes can easily feed two.  Either that person is anorexic or an elf... It left me and my partner hungry still after our two dish order."}
{"text":"Very, very good, but a little pricey. The cashew chicken is delicious. Pad See Yew and Panang Curry are very good. Slightly more formal ambiance, so somewhat less family-friendly than some others. If the prices were lower, I'd give it an extra star. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"An impulse stop for Thai food netted a great dining experience. Very friendly staff, quick service, and tasty food.   We will return here."}
{"text":"My family has always loved this place, as the service is friendly and the food is great. It wasn't until recently that we realized that a tip was automatically added to our bill. This would normally be fine, but when paying with debit/credit, the machine prompts for a tip. Who knows how long we were double tipping for! It has made us reluctant to return."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai. Order the shrimp chips, green mango salad, appetizer platter, Pad Thai, cashew nut chicken and green curry beef. Service is very friendly and one of the best Thai places uptown"}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant experience at Royal Orchard Thai cuisine.  Yes the portions are definitely on the small side and not necessarily great bang for the buck per se but the flavours are very good.  The green curry, pineapple fried rice and Thai basil eggplant were highlights"}
{"text":"It's called Royal Orchid Thai because that's where it's located and has been for some time.  Probably the first Thai in Thornhill, definitely the longest lasting.  They have transformed the place over the years, but keep certain memorable items, like the unique wooden stemmed utensils.  Food is good quality and I love their red curry chicken.  Great atmosphere, lots to look at.  There's usually a bunch of seniors here, so may not want to bring screaming kids if you want to avoid the stares.    I just wish they would start delivering again."}
{"text":"The STREET name probably made naming this Thai restaurant easy as it is called Royal Orchard Boulevard.  Inside a Strip Mall off of Yonge st., look for the Mango Yellow Sign with Chili Red Letters.  Thai Shrimp Sashimi [Goong Chae Nam Pla] ($8.00) - Not as flavourful as I wished when Thai Chilis plenty more than Garlic and Cilantro.  The Fish Sauce mixture settled to the bottom instead of coating the Butterflied Shrimps.  Cool dish nonetheless.  Satay Chicken & Beef($10.00) -Standard Satay except the skewered Meats were not cubed but rather extend the length of the skewer meaning it made sharing a harder task.  Definitely taste the marinade offering enough flavour even without Peanut Sauce.  Thai Iced Tea($3.50)  -  I  l i k e  i t  Please read RAFI N's review for following:  Basil Chicken($12.00) A-OK Papaya Salad($8.00) Meh Thai Iced Coffee($3.50)  I noticed other interesting($$$) Menu offerings too...  Simmered Pork Hock (Kar Moo) House Special Lamb (Geag Yang)"}
{"text":"Royal Orchard Thai seriously has one of the best Pad Thais I think I've ever had. I'm pretty big on Thai food, and have been to a lot of restaurants in and around the city, but this is seriously one of the best.   It is a huge portion, could possibly share for 2, and comes with chicken and shrimp. We also got beef skewers, a cashew chicken dish, the mango salad (which was just ok,) and hot and cold spring rolls that were also really good.  It's a little on the pricey side, not too over the top but I've definitely had cheaper.   If you're ever north of the city and are in the mood for great Thai, this is your place."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 15 years now. I was invited to their grand re-opening when they renovated almost 10 years ago. I used to eat there at least once a month every month for either lunch, dinner or both some weeks. I have noticed a huge decline in their quality & even their service. 4 out of the last 5 times I ordered take out - my order was wrong. The quality of their curries has changed, less vegetables & meat and very watery. Satay appetizers, meat is not as tender as it used to be, cold rolls don't look fresh - bean sprouts are translucent and the flavor is just not there. Pad thai has no taste to it, they used to add a sufficient amount of sauce to the noodles. Used to be my favorite place to eat Thai food. At one point I thought maybe the ownership had changed - but it hasn't. Service & quality has changed and gone down in the last 5 years so much. After the last take out mess up, I haven't eaten there. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I've tried only a couple of items on the menu, not bad. I would probably not go there for dinner, but lunch is okay, restaurant offers lunch specials. Some other restaurants provide a more authentic cultural food, here it is more american thai, in my personal opinion, but there are positives in that, depending on what one is looking for. Restaurant is clean, waiters are nice and dont make you wait."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant in this area! Worst service! Don't ever go there! OMG, the server gave us her attitude!"}
{"text":"It's run and staffed with Thai people and the food is authentically Thai. The lunch specials are good prices too but the portion size is a little smaller.  For a thai place, it definitely fills a craving. It's delicious with a very nice freshness to it from top to bottom. Decent dining room with that \"it's a Thai restaurant\" theme going on.  The food is really what I want to talk about because I've had Thai from other places and this one really tasted \"authentic\" at least to me. whether that's me eating bad Thai food or I'm just too generous.  Their lunch specials are about $10 and come with 2 spring rolls and a soup or a salad. the portion size is definitely a lunch portion and you will finish it if you're hungry and want and probably crave more.  had their green curry which was just the right amount of heat and creaminess and their pad thai off the lunch menu and both were delicious.  I've ordered off the dinner menu as well and portion size is a little bigger again had the Thai spicy noodle and yellow curry and both were delicious. A little pricier than I'm used to for Thai food but great and happy to return here.  my advice, skip the lunch menu if you're hungry and go for the dinner as you'll get more and won't be disappointed.  fast too. came our fast but still super fresh.   4.0 out of 5.0."}
{"text":"Locked me out. Hours on Google & Yelp say open till 10:30, sign on door reads 10:30.  I came last week at 10:05 it was already locked.  Nobody came out to even acknowledge me or ask if I would settle for take out or explain why they locked up half an hour ahead of time.  I was sick and really wanted a hot Tom Yum after work. I went out of my way to get here based on their posted business hours. I would have taken it to-go if they really couldn;t give me 5 minutes to finish it in the restaurant.  Disqualified from further consideration."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want some proper Thai food. Some people posting reviews saying the food is bland.. I'm guessing they had some very hot green tea and burned their taste buds off because the food is very flavorful :)"}
{"text":"Dropped in with a fairly large group on a Saturday night and we decided to try ordering a bunch of dishes and share them all. The good thing is that this allowed me to get a sample of a lot of the different dishes. The bad? Well, it left me largely unsatisfied.  The serving sizes are so unbelievably small here. If I was hungry enough, I could probably eat two entrees (with the exception of the pad thai), an order of rice, and perhaps even an appetizer. Doing this will put my bill easily above $30. Too much for Thai food, regardless of how good it is. And the food's decent, but nowhere near justifying the cost.  Mango salad - pretty standard, nothing special, flavour on the lighter side, I've had better Deep fried tofu (appetizer) - meh, skip it, don't know what possessed me to order this, I was hoping for something a bit more unique like the stuff down at Khao San Road Basil Eggplant - tasty, but again pretty standard as far as eggplant dishes go (eg what I would be able to get at pretty much any other Asian resto), would have preferred a bit more basil flavour Green curry - good, creamy and flavourful, maybe could have used a bit more content rather than just the curry sauce, interesting that this is the most spicy curry they have listed but yet I could barely feel the heat and I am by NO means a spice addict.. must be to cater to the tastes of the local clientele (cough.. the geriatric crew.. cough..) Spicy tofu - tasty, fairly flavourful, hint of heat Pad thai - it was decent as far as Thai places go, definitely better than your standard imitation non-authentic Thai resto's  -Coconut rice - this was very delicious and unexpectedly probably the highlight of the whole meal  Service was pleasant. The restaurant was not very busy for a Saturday night, just right from a customer's perspective (a fair amount of tables occupied for a decent bustle, but a few unoccupied so that you don't have to wait and for a bit of space here and there).   Overall it was a decent experience. Not one that I'd find myself necessarily looking forward to in the future, but I wouldn't mind being back here on the odd occasion if I happen to be in the area looking for something different."}
{"text":"Not bad, but overpriced compared to many Thai restaurants with similar, rather standard Thai menue.  Atmosphere was pleasant and service reasonably good.  The food was well prepared, though the spicy basil noodles were unusual in that they were not the broader style ones I am used to with this dish.  An appetizer platter was good but overpriced.  While it was okay, I probably would not be back as there are cheaper and better Thai options to be had."}
{"text":"They have raw shrimp salad!   Not many places have this, and the last time that I had this dish in San Francisco, I have been craving it.   Can be spicier, but I have a high tolerance to chili."}
{"text":"Having recently traveled to Thailand, my fiancé and I are always on the lookout for great Thai restaurants that emphasize good, authentic food. We found it here - decor straight from Thailand, friendly Thai-worthy service, and flavourful food.   The curries' spice level cannot be modified - that's one way to tell that they make their curries the traditional way. After coming back from our trip, we were baffled at the number of establishments who would let you order extra-mild green curry (not that we ever did). But I get it - they have to cater to the Westerners.   Anyways, if you want great food at a very reasonable price, check it out!   On our recent visit, between the two of us we ordered: grilled squid, cold spring rolls, garlic shrimp, green curry chicken, and the basil beef."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service  I go there all the time for take out ...I usually get the veggie and tofu ceamy curry. One time I wanted shrimp so I ordered shrimp and paid $2 extra for veggies and tofu because the shrimp dish only comes with green beans. I got a tonne of colorful cooked veggies and it was amazing.  Today I ordered the same and paid $2 extra and it did not come the same as last time. They normally fill 2 small containers loaded with a variety of veggies. This time I got one container and it had  shrimp, tofu, a few broccolis but mainly green beans...it lacked all the veggies that I have had in my previous orders.   I always find the staff not overly friendly but this time was beyond unfriendly...they looked at me like I was from outer space. When I asked to speak to the owner she would not even listen to what I had to say...she asked if I wanted the order and when I said no I paid $2 extra and got green beans and no other veggies...I want what I got last time she told me she doesnt know who helped me as she gave me back my money and told me she only deals with \"happy customers\" and if Im  not happy she wont deal with me... I was speechless...that is not the attitude you have when running a restaurant.  I walked out of there in shock ..I was not trying to be rude to her...I was simply  trying to get what I paid for and what I have previously been given.  I am very upset at the treatment of the owner and her staff and what a shame because I really enjoyed the food there but her customer service was horrible. I hope people read this and do not give her business....very undeserving.   I dont want to give this place 1 star because it deserves 0 but for this review I have to rate it."}
{"text":"Royal Orchard Thai Cuisine the last place I would have expect my yelp buddy would want to go for dinner! Spicy Thai food?!! Who would have thought..   Thai Spicy... according to my Thai yelp buddy.. there is no Thai Spicy... For me, I would have rather rephrased that as how a \"Real\" Thai cook would have serve the dish to real Thai people in Thailand! :)   Our guest of Honour tonight Rafi N is all for any spicy food... so I decide to invite him to share our Thai Spicy dinner...   Thai Shrimp Sashimi (Goong Chae Nam Pla) ($8)  - Special request for the night by yelp buddy  - I can see the fear in his eyes when I was admiring all those fresh Thai chili on the uncooked shrimps... while the other one making a pass... yes those shrimps looks raw and alive.......  - I was a little disappointed as the marinate is really one dimensional... fish sauce and more fish sauce... maybe some fresh lime juice and more herbs will make the shrimp tasted better   Papaya Salad (Som Tom) ($8)  - Big disappointment... Papaya was soggy didn't have any bite at all  - Not even any Thai Chili mixed into the Salad...(she did bring me some fresh one on the side)  - no peanuts, no dried shrimp, fish sauce tasted bland...   Satay Chicken and Beef ($10)  - Rafi seems to love this... he practically ate the whole thing... and we were happy that he enjoyed his meat!   Basil Chicken (Kai Krapao) ($12)  - Good portion size and has tons of veggie...  - white meat was used, so it is healthy but chicken was a little dried..  - not a pronounced basil flavoured... more fresh basil leaves would really make this more tasty   Thai Spicy Noodle with Shrimp ($12)  - Really generous serving of good sized shrimps... and they were perfectly cook and fresh  - not too spicy... but have a nice rounded taste   Thai Iced Tea/Thai Ice Coffee ($3.50)  - good photo op.... and I like the Thai Iced Tea better because the Coffee is just a tad too sweet for me... sweet to a point with that coffee taste... (but you are talking to someone that always drink her coffee black...)  - Love that orange coloured Iced Tea... anatto is the spice that give it the colour and the little nutmeg flavour  We all survived our Thai Spicy menu at Royal Orchard. Overall, it was a solid Thai experience in Thornhill..."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai Restaurant! If you're looking to try thai food the way you'll find it in Thailand, this is the place to be. I can say that, saying I just came from there. This place has the BEST PAD THAI I've ever had! Been going here for years and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is quite the treat. It has some of the best Thai food I've had and the service is constantly great. I really enjoy the following order:  Appetizer Platter Regular Pad Thai  Garlic Shrimp = Very tasty experience.  The only problem is it's pricey which may stop some people from coming in to try the food.   Still, enjoyed once in a while, it's a real treat."}
{"text":"Popped into this nondescript spot for a quick lunch.  Ordered the basil beef lunch special. Yuuuuum-meee!! (It comes with a couple tiny spring rolls and a mango salad.)  The pieces of beef were perfectly cooked - nice and tender.   I really don't know what else to say. Other than I can't think of where I would go in the city to find a better basil beef dish."}
