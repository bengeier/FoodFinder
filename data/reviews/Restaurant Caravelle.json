{"text":"Who said food court food can't be good? Me. I said that. I said that BEFORE Caravelle. Their Tonkinese soup is delicious, hot, and the service is FAST. How many people do you need behind the counter for this tiny place?! Apparently just enough so you can join the line and get out of their before you can even decide what you really want.   You want the Tokinese soup. Join the line."}
{"text":"Best downtown Montreal food court restaurant by far. Your typical Vietnamese combination plate\Tonkinese soup menu, done  properly with fresh ingredients. Great bang for the buck. Don't get scared by the huge lineups, it moves quickly and you are served in a matter of seconds. Bon app√©tit!"}
{"text":"If you're around Ville Marie specially on a cold day, you should give their soups a try. There is a reason why there is always a big line. For the price the portion they serve are very good and the service is very quick. They also have viet sandwich and rolls.   Note:  I have been going to this place for years and the special of the day NEVER changed."}
{"text":"If you work in or near PVM and the Eaton Center you know that Caravelle and Atti are the 2 best food court options. The pho soup here at Caravelle is so cheap and it's fresh and taste delicious."}
{"text":"If you're a little office bee like me working downtown, you're probably also on the lookout for little food court gems that stand out against your generic Thai Expresses, Franx Supremes and Sushi Shops.   Caravelle is a little Vietnamese joint in Place Ville Marie. I know. \"Caravelle\" doesn't sound Vietnamese, but it is. They serve pho, vietnamese sandwiches (that I hesistate to refer to as banh mi because they're not really authentic, but still tasty) and grilled meats served on rice or vermicelli noodles.  Look, it's not Pho Lien, but for a food court, this place is pretty damn good. You can even find some of the more adventurous pho fixings here like tripe and brisket and the soup isn't just \"passable\". It's probably the best pho option in the Golden Square Mile, and very cheap to boot!  This place is very popular at lunch time, so mentally prepare yourself for a long wait in line. The only reason I don't come here more often is that I work right upstairs and prefer to spend my lunch hour avoiding running into my coworkers like the antisocial hermit that I am!  And no, you shouldn't throw your bowl into the garbage, you asshole. It's a real bowl that's not meant to be disposed of. Give it back to the ladies at Caravelle, they'll appreciate it.  Bonus: Caravelle now accepts debit and credit cards!"}
{"text":"If I ever feel like having Vietnamese but I don't want to go out in the cold I turn to them. The portions are pretty big for what you pay. Their soups are to die for."}
{"text":"I work in a building connected to Montreal's underground city and occasionally will journey into the Place Ville Marie shopping mall during my lunch.  It is located on the outer edge of Place Ville Marie's food court somewhat close to the entrance the Central Station (Gare Centrale). During lunch time there will usually be a line-up at this place, however, the line moves surprisingly very fast.  When I am in the mood for soup at work for lunch, I will normally come here and have one of \"Vietnamese\" soups since I don't have to worry about the weather conditions outside as this place is within PVM and PVM is one of the buildings connected to the \"underground city\". The soups aren't as good as a place like Pho Lien but I find it good nevertheless. Not that it makes any difference to me but this \"Vietnamese\" restaurant is run/managed by Cantonese speaking workers (it might also be owned by them) so you won't get the variety/authenticity of a place like Pho Lien for Vietnamese soup.  The bowl size for the soup is decent. When eating at the food court, they ask you to bring back the bowl after you're finished.  They accept credit cards and debit cards. If paying by card, the cashier will show you the amount on the machine and ask about whether she can use the tap to pay feature.   I eat here a few times a month especially if I am feeling under the weather or feel a cold coming along.  I rank them 4.5 stars which like all my reviews, I've rounded the 0.5 up since I don't want to shortchange the restaurant. The only thing that could make this better is to have more variety in the soup but I feel that their soups are catered to non-Asians (so you won't get things like tripe in the soup or other exotic pieces of meat like you will find in a place like Pho Lien)."}
{"text":"This is hidden jewel in the food court.  Some big line ups but quick.  My favourite spot in the area."}
{"text":"PVM worker bees unite on a daily basis in the never less than 20 people deep queue, but do not fear, the ladies will get soup in your paws pretty quick! Every once in a while, I will splurge and get myself a super yummy vegtarian spring roll as well. You cannot beat the price for what you get and it's hands down the best thing in the entire PVM food court, no contest. Also, don't be a dick and throw your bowl into the garbage, it is not styrofoam and they wash and reuse them, so bring it back! They take credit and debit cards now which is a serious bonus if you ask me."}
