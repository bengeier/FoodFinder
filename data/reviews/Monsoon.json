{"text":"Four stars, again, might be stretching it for the overall package (IE. the abandon parking lot at night , the tacky menus both take out and dine in and the price point for all of these lovely features) Having said that, the fried rice (Kow Pud) gets four stars for sure! And they have this special sometimes it's crispy chicken and scallops that is fabulous! The coating and crispness of the chicken and delicious scallops covered with a yummy sauce is an awesome dish. 
*Hey General TSO (flippin him the bird)* 

I am thinking of boycotting Chinese fried rice for the rest of my life.There is so much more flavor with Thai fried rice. And many other food choices on a Thai menu for that matter, that are similar to Chinese dishes. 

I love Calamari. Though sometimes a little tough here, the \"sweet and sour\" sauce they serve it with is good. It has a nice little kick to it but still very sweet at the same time. I want to Sharpie (a Sharpie pen seems fitting for the tacky menus) the sour part off of it and replace it with spicy so it reads sweet and spicy sauce. 

If you do not ask for a spice level here most everything (I have had) comes mild meaning no spice present what-so-ever. Dare I say almost everything taste kinda sweet. Mainly the Pad Thai. So be sure to tell them how spicy you like it. Kick it up a notch will ya! Hell, give me another reason to down a Singha! 

The poultry and the fish that I have ever had included in the dishes were good. 

Service is good but like someone else mentioned it was pretty empty on those visits. 

They must be doing something right they have been here for 16 years I believe. Maybe everyone that dines here enjoys \"packing heat\" 
HA! Pun intended! HA!"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 - the most authentic Thai food we have had in CLT. Their #43 Pla (fried Red Snapper fillets) with red curry sauce is to die for. 
Service: 3/5 - while the servers are friendly, sometimes service can get a bit slow if there are more than 3 tables for one waitress to look after simultaneously. 
Ambience: 2/5 - when we went for lunch today, walking in to the restaurant, my eyes took a while to adjust to the dark and dimly lit interior of the restaurant. The sunlight seeping through the edge of the blinds were brighter than the lights inside!

Enjoyed their food very much, and will go back, but it would be so nice if they could do something to brighten up the interior."}
{"text":"the one dish i order the most from monsoon is thier fried rice. it the freshest version of fried rice oi ever had. you can get it vegatarian or with meat, it makes a great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food. For a city of our size, Charlotte is somewhat lacking in restaurants, especially Thai and other Asian cuisines. But Monsoon is an exception and worth the trip and any construction traffic. 

My wife had the Pad Thai, and I ordered Green Curry and we both remarked how the dishes were the best we've had in Charlotte. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I met up with my friends here for dinner on a random choice selection. Everything about this place was iffy! From location, service and food. When we got inside there was no one there. The floors in the ENTIRE restaurant was sticky. Your footsteps stuck onto the floors every time you made a step and you can literally hear it. I wonder how long its been since they have mopped this place?

We all order a variety of different food, all very tasteless. The egg rolls/spring rolls were bland. The stuff chicken wings were bland, it tasted like chicken cooked in old oil. Pad thai and curry were both also bland. Then after a disappointing experience, we finally look at the sanitation grade hanging on the wall. It was a low 84%!!! Go figured! I will never go here ever again."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors ... This has to be the best Thai Restaurant in Charlotte. The staff and service were great ...

Tip : Ask the hostess for a spice level recommendation .... Hot in this place is really hot"}
{"text":"I've tried all the Thai restaurants in the Charlotte area, and I have to say this is the most authentic tasting. All of their basic Thai stir fry and noodle specials are spot on - even beating out the ever so popular Thai Taste (on East Blvd). 

Favorites:

Appetizer: Mee Krob, which is classic chicken lettuce wrap. Other places give you noodles with a tiny little bit of chicken. But Monsoon's can be eaten as a whole hearty meal. Their version has a lot of savory gravy (so if you are into the dryer stir fried chicken wraps, this may not be for you) 

Stir Fry: Pud Prig Pow, which is the classic thai basil stir fry. Nice flavor, with good amount of basil.

Noodle: Lard Nar. This one isn't always available at some of the other Thai places around town. So seeing it on the menu, I had to try - and I was delighted.

Aside from the good food, the staff is friendly and the service is fast. Price point is comparable to other Thai places around."}
{"text":"Overall: not good.
The pad thai sauce was ketchup-based.  The pud see ew was bland.  The fresh rolls were over 50% shredded lettuce.  The steamed dumplings were just gross; might have had canned chicken and mayo in the stuffing.
Would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"I was delighted to find this Thai restaurant. It's kind of easy to miss, but it would be a shame if you miss it! It's tucked away among the construction and new/up-and-coming restaurants in Southend. There is nothing special about the exterior and the interior is dim, not very fancy with a very much old-fashioned aesthetic.

I tried their Pad Thai and it is the best I've had in this area so far. I had a craving for Pad Thai one day and their dish really hit the spot. I plan to come back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai place in Charlotte. I've been probably five times since I've moved here earlier this year. 

I tend to stick with Pad See Ew and spring rolls, but my partner gets something different every time we visit. We've been happy with our food. Large portions, nice flavors. Good quality for the price.

I actually like the interior. Definitely has a hole in the wall feel. 

The staff is wonderful. I've only had helpful and friendly interactions. They recommend the best sauces for whatever dishes we're having - love that personal feel! Once I went later in the evening and didn't realize they were closing soon. No one rushed us to finish (except for me!) and everyone was really kind and patient with us.

I'm giving Monsoon four stars because it has yet to really wow me. I'm happy with my experiences there, but I wouldn't categorize this has exceptional. For Charlotte Thai restaurants, it's the best."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for dinner around 7 pm on a Friday night. It was super quiet and we were probably the only customers there to dine in besides one other lady at another table. We didn't mind this; it was pretty peaceful and the low lighting made for nice ambience. The restaurant is also a little smaller than I envisioned, but this did give it a cozy feel, especially during the evening.

I ordered the Tom Yum soup with the seafood combo (hotpot) while my friend ordered the chicken Tom Yum soup (also hotpot). I tried to be brave and ordered the Thai native-level of spicy and it was super hot! No joke, I was biting into small peppers left and right, and tearing up during intervals. The flavor was pretty good and I was quietly impressed at the \"hotpot\" they brought out, complete with a small open flame. I loved the shrimp in the soup; I might try ordering just the shrimp version instead of the seafood combo next time.

Our server gets 5 stars for being so attentive and refilling our glasses. She never let our drinks go below half-cup, and I think she recognized how we were so far out of our league when it came to our entrees' spicy levels. The melon candy that she gave us at the end was a nice touch! Very refreshing.

Overall, pretty good food and although the restaurant was a little empty, the staff was very kind and accommodating. =)"}
{"text":"Delicious shrimp pud khana! Clean place, very friendly servers. Good portions. will definitely be back to try different dishes."}
{"text":"best Thai restaurant in town!
I personally prefer curries and love all of them. I don't need trendy decor to enjoy a fabulous meal. This place doesn't try hard, they consistently have great food, service, and are reasonably priced. Works for me!"}
{"text":"Great food, service much improved over the years, spacious, relaxed dining room.  I will continue to eat here often."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on my way out of town after a two-day business trip to Charlotte. What a find! Excellent friendly service, and easily the best Panang Curry I've ever tasted -- and best of all, served with a very generous portion.  Honestly blown away by how good this place is, and heartsick that I don't live closer so that I can come back often. Next time I'm in Charlotte, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Attentive service and friendly staff. Food is good. But this is my fallback... only if I cant make it to Thai Taste on West Blvd. Great lunch prices."}
{"text":"Great restaurant , lovely decor very Thai , food was very good and the service was also very good"}
{"text":"I love Thai food! One of my favorite things in life is to find new 'hole-in-the-wall' Asian gems. Punch prices are reasonable but the service is incredibly slow, the curry is bland and although I'd like to tell you how delicious the Pad Thai is... It's been 40 minutes and I have yet to receive it."}
{"text":"We hit up Monsoon and tried the fried dumplings, the satay, and of course.. the pad thai. The fried dumplings and satay were average and not much to write about.

Ella's pad thai was traditional and some of the best she's ever had. The serving size was so big she was still eating leftover two days later. I added pineapples to my pad thai and requested they make it 4 star spicy. Much to my surprise it actually came out spicy and I would recommend the average consumer start at a 1 or 2 and work your way up depending on your tolerance.

Monsoon is our pick for the Queen City's top Thai."}
{"text":"Monsoon Thai is, as the pop-up said when I clicked 3 stars, \"A-ok.\"

The food was pretty good.  Not the best Thai I've had but definitely authentic.  The young Laotian waitress was friendly.  Service was timely.  Food came out quickly, was piping hot and tasted good.  (I had the Red Curry Chicken.)

So why was I left somehow disappointed?

It's the second Thai restaurant I've tried since moving to Charlotte two weeks ago and both have left me basically unimpressed.  Sure, the food was fine; even good but... the prices seem really high for Thai.  Monsoon Thai is anything but fancy, but it was $13 for my Red Curry Chicken.

I had a similar experience at another Thai restaurant a few nights ago (I'll review it separately) and came away feeling the same way.  That place was beautiful so perhaps they could argue for higher prices but let's be honest, both are strip mall eateries; hardly \"4-Star\" restaurants.

Sigh. I doubt you'll be disappointed with your food.  I can recommend going there and I'd order the Red Curry chicken again but still... it wasn't \"outstanding\" and the prices are annoying.  I moved here from Nashville where I had found several really incredible Thai places with much more moderate prices and far and away better food.

PS - My yardstick is a street vendor at the head of Khao San Road in Bangkok.  To say that his food is incredible is an understatement AND two can eat for less than $3.  OK.  I don't expect two to eat for $3 bucks in the USA, but my $3 bucks got us 3 or 4 small entrees, rice and bottled water.  In Nashville I could eat for under $10 bucks for one, for dinner - less for lunch and the food at least was close to my little street vendor.  So far, I'm still searching for something close in beautiful Charlotte.  Wish me luck."}
{"text":"Okay, Thai food is my favorite so my goal is to try all the Thai places in Charlotte, and believe me there are a bunch! I just stumbled across this one earlier in the week and knew I had to try it (the recent reviews were pretty good)!

I'm SO GLAD I tried it. 

I do take out at lunch because my job is far away from all the good food so I spend most of my time driving there and back. I always get Pad See Eu (Pud here) to try out because it is a basic dish that is hard to mess up but still can give a good read on what the rest would be like. My order was done ridiculously fast and the ladies at the register were so sweet and happy! Not only that but I got an egg roll with it - which I didn't know - and it was delicious! I also always ask for my dish at a 3, also very indicative. My main dish was delicious and the spiciest I've had yet, even after ordering it Thai hot at another place. Top it off with the least I've paid for this dish EVER and you've got one happy girl here!

I found a new lunch Thai place! No more driving uptown and paying to park just to get good Thai food! Definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Monsoon before now, given how much we enjoy dining here - not least because it's within walking distance from our home, which makes for a nice last-minute dinner option when the cupboards are bare and we don't feel like driving to the store. 

The staff are always very sweet and willing to accommodate special requests, like my insistence for extra vegetables in whatever I'm ordering. They WILL make it super spicy if you are specific about asking for it - one time I received a dish of curry that looked like half a jar of chili pepper had been stirred into the sauce. Yowza! 

Their entree offerings are flavorful (anything with basil or Kaffir lime leaves is especially worth getting), varied, and typical for what you expect from a decent Thai place. I love pretty much any of the curries, and the option to order squid as your meat of choice is a nice addition to the usual beef/chicken/shrimp/scallop lineup. The Thai Iced Tea is a big winner with my husband - too sweet for me, but I always steal a sip regardless. Serving sizes are substantial - you could easily split a dish if you and your dining partner wanted to eat the same thing, but it'd also work very well if a group of friends wanted to order a few different things to serve up family-style.

Prices range on the slightly higher side for dinner fare (again, typical for what I've seen in other Thai restaurants), but their lunch menu is really bargain-priced. Most of Charlotte seems to know it, too, because it's always HOPPING during the times I've visited mid-day. Later in the evening, business seems to slow down - several times, my husband and I have been the only people in the restaurant. 

Honestly, we've not tried any other Thai restaurants in Charlotte yet, because we like this one so much and it's so close to home. Maybe we're missing out...but it sure doesn't feel like it."}
{"text":"The food was great.  However, at the end of the meal I looked over at my boyfriend and he was just staring at his plate with only a couple of mushrooms left on it.   I asked him what was wrong.  His response was, \"well I don't want you to freak out, but there is a grasshopper on my plate.\"  Sure enough there was a whole grasshopper stir fried into his meal.  It was the same coloring of the mushrooms.  We told the server and she took the plate away without really saying anything.  She returned a few minutes later and told us that in her country they eat grasshoppers.  Needless to say she didn't apologize or offer us a discount on our meal.  I'm sorry but in this country we don't eat grasshoppers.  We will not be back again."}
{"text":"As an out of towner, I was excited to find a Thai place.  It was very clean inside and the wait staff was very attentive.  I took the liberty of ordering for my friend and I since he was new to Thai food.  We had the vegetarian green curry and pad thai noodles with jasmine rice.  Let's just say that the dishes were empty!  lol!!  Everything was great, reminded of the places I frequent back home.  You have to try this place, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pad Kee Mow. Delicious! Great place for lunch! Had to give it 3 stars due to the sanitation score of 81. Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"Good food for takeout. Big portions. Rice was fluffy. Spring rolls were the bomb!
Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome food here. I have tried one of their Stir Fried dishes as well as one of the Curry and they are excellent all the way around. I'd probably rate this place as just a bit better than the Thai house. The staff is super friendly here as well. Also, the prices are very reasonable for a lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I worked on that side of town my co-workers and I would head to Monsoon once a week for lunch. Anytime I was in the area I took my hubby!

Soup is great and I LOVE the curry. Haven't been able to go much since I changed jobs, wish I was closer."}
{"text":"Thai is my new thing. I love this place.  The prices are great and staff is friendly. I wishthey were open for lunch longer because i would probably go twice."}
{"text":"Dine in or Take Out this place is great!!

The Pud See Ew with Beef is my Favorite!! The spring rolls are good too!! The ladies are all very sweet and will definitely guide you in the right direction!"}
{"text":"I have to unfortunately amend my review, especially since I boasted the fastest service in town. The ownership must have changed because the people are all different and they have NOT figured out the whole service process. You can sit there now for 20 minutes and might not have a menu or silverware or water or whatever. 
I like the Gang Dang (insert joke here) and Pud See Ew still. 
The food is still exactly the same, but this is no longer a fast meal anymore (at lunch). I would recommend getting it To Go."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my first visit here and I've got to update my review. 

I'm a fan! 

This place has really grown on me! I've tried several different dishes and they packed just the right amount of spicy! 

One of my new favorites is the Kang Mussamum which has coconut milk, carrots, potatoes, fried onions and a peanut sauce. I always add chicken and get it with either a 3 or 4 level spice. It's delicious. And very...VERY spicy. 

I enjoy trying the different dishes and the lunch specials. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Used to eat here about once a month but finally got tired of being disrespected by the staff, the service is always slow and they don't really care. The lady owner however is nice and does care. But I wont be back. Mee Krob"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte. Yes, the inside is a little dingy and it's located in an outdated strip mall on South Blvd, but don't let that keep you from trying this place.

The service is always phenomenal and helpful when navigating through their extensive menu and I've never had to wait on food when ordering takeout.

The portions are huge, especially for takeout and have lasted 2+ meals on occasions. From their Curry's to the Pad Thai, everything I've had here is delicious. My favorite? Massamun Curry!"}
{"text":"This is a great Thai food restaurant. Food is fresh and deliciously seasoned. they will make it to order and are very polite. I love this place! prices are good, too."}
{"text":"I really, really, REALLY want and have tried to like this place. One of my close friends works down the road and has named Monsoon her go-to place for Thai food. 

1st experience - We were all contemplating the difference between the different curries (Red/Green/Yellow). We figured the spices were different, but what else? What spices? What ingredients? Maybe the way they're cooked or the duration of how long they're cooked.. oh the possibilities! After much debate, we finally asked the waitress.  Her reply was \"The red curry is red and the green curry is green, but the red is more popular\" .... *Moment of awkward silence insert here*

2nd experience - I was craving Tom Kha Gai soup. I ordered the hotpot so everyone could try some (plus, this way I can have more than one bowl without judgement - it's one of my favorite dishes!). The soup came out WHITE. I'm used to Tom Kha Gai soups that are more of a red-ish or yellow-ish blend. I understand that different places may have different methods of preparation, but the waitress did not ask for preferred levels of spiciness. Thus I had a feeling the Tom Kha Gai soup would not be spicy at all and nope.. it was not (very disapproving for a Thai dish!) 

I've been back a few other times, mainly out of convenience. The other dishes I've tried (papaya salad, pad thai, pad kee mow) were decent, but not very consistent in flavor and quality (thus resulting in a 3 star review). The main element of Thai cuisine is the bountiful amounts of herbs, spices and flavor. Thus, that is what I look for when I enter a Thai restaurant. I wouldn't say Monsoon is bad, but it's just not dependable. If I'm craving Thai food, I rather go somewhere consistent that I KNOW will satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"Monsoon is not my normal go-to place for Thai, but I was in the area around lunch time, so I decided to stop in with a couple of co-workers.  We were served a soup to start with which was a bit on the bland side. I noticed that my co-workers soup had tofu in it, but sadly, there was none to be found in my bowl. Oh well.  The spring roll was small but pretty tasty.  So, onto the main course.  I decided to get the Penang curry and it was a-ok.  Not the most flavorful & delicious Penang curry I have had, but it was serviceable.  On our visit, the service was pretty fast and I thought the prices were reasonable.  Overall, the place was a-ok, but not my favorite Thai place in town."}
{"text":"Food and service are great! A hidden gem of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Well done! Stopped in for a quick lunch (thankfully a non-fast food option for many blocks) and found a clean space, great menu selection, friendly staff, and extremely affordable prices. The lunch special included a rice & chicken soup (simple but hit-the-spot), perfectly sized entrees with a crispy egg roll, rice and fresh iced tea. Portion sizes were appropriate, leaving not a morsel of food to waste. All food was DELICIOUS! Meats were tender, vegetables crispy, and the flavors were spot on. They will also adjust the spiciness to suit your liking (and we went for it hot!) Our server had a great sense of humor and was pleasantly attentive. We left thoroughly fulfilled and not over-stuffed. Thrilled to have found a new little gem!"}
{"text":"Boo, I was really excited for some Thai food today but this just did not satisfy my craving. They have a decent lunch menu priced well for $8 to $10 you get soup and an egg roll. The food was just mediocre service was just ok...they delivered the wrong food but they were nice about getting us the right order. 

Unfortunately Monsoon you will not be added to my regular lunch venue list... the place was really busy so who knows maybe it was just one bad lunch and I should give it another try...I'll let you know."}
{"text":"Delicious! This was my first time here but I'm a fan.  

The Tom kah soup is great - it surprised me as it had onions, tomatoes and some other items in it (in addition to the typical mushroom and chicken). At first I was skeptical but it tasted so good!

My boyfriend and I both had pad see ew and enjoyed it!

Service was okay and the ambiance isn't anything fancy but the food won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I go to Monsoon when I want decent, inexpensive Thai. I don't go for ambiance or sexy decor. I either grab takeout, or eat here solo, because it's quiet and the staff doesn't hound you every 2 minutes. My go-to dishes are the vegetarian fried rice, which is a huge serving with lots of veggies and egg, and the Peah Kai Yas Sigh (stuffed chicken wings). I've had a couple of the curries, but I keep it simple with the fried rice and an app. Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Never again. I should have known not to stray from Thai taste, but I figured if give them a shot since I live between the two. First of all, they took my order over the phone and I had to call them back to give them my payment and spice level. They arrived with the food pretty fast, so I was willing to forgive the initial interaction. My boyfriend said it seemed light for what we ordered. We opened the bag and a LIVE BUG crawled out of the bag! The we realized they had forgotten half of our order, not that we had an appetite after the bug. After not being able to reach them by phone, we jumped in the car and sped off to take to food back and get our money back. They were closed and unreachable. The food now sits in my car waiting to go back to its home tomorrow. Yuck, gross, ew."}
{"text":"I will agree with everyone else... Four stars it is! 

The food is outstanding. I had one of the most delicious veggie red curry dishes I have ever eaten. The vegetables were all perfectly a la dente, the tofu was fried nicely, the sauce was a perfect balance between curry paste and coconut milk, and there were unexpected vegetables, including squash, zucchini, and peas!

Service was outstanding. Waitress was very friendly and attentive.

So you may be thinking... Why not five stars? The ambience. There is no other way to describe it...it's just the pits. Imagine your parents' 1980s basement.  There was a little bit of a musty smell, the floors were a little dirty, and it was dimly lit.  It's also in a very nondescript, sad shopping center. 

The big question of course is, would I visit again? Absolutely! The food and service more than make up for the lack of ambience."}
{"text":"I have to second Lee Ann D and add that the Pud See Ew with Beef is the best available in Charlotte.  It beats most of the Pud See Ew's I've had elsewhere too, even fancy New York City and DC!  Bold statements, I know.  Their spiciness scale runs from 1 to 4, I opted for 3 which was just right for me...hot enough to make you sweat but not so bad that my mouth was burning.  I wasn't too impressed with the spring rolls however.  My SO just had Tom Kha soup which was pretty good.  But she don't like the spice, so I would have to order it spicy to truly judge.  I want to go back or order some Panang curry for take out.  Or maybe that crispy chicken and scallops special Paula G was talking about."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Julia S. recommended this place! Don't judge a place by its location or empty parking lot, but it sure helps when recommended by a reliable source. I wouldn't recommend hanging out in the parking lot or storing valuables inside your car for everyone to see; however, I do recommend going inside and eating some tasty dishes.

The Pad Thai was very good...and enough to split and order an appetizer to start. The atmosphere was clean, simple, and what you would expect from a family owned restaurant. They give you an assortment of spicy sauces...some of the hottest I have ever smelled (no, I didn't try). 

I think I'm making this my new Thai spot and I hope you do too...I'm sure they would appreciate more customers."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my Monsoon visit. While prices seemed fair I felt the food was lacking. I called in a to-go order that was ready quickly. No complaints there.

We sampled the fresh rolls. It must have been a bad day for their shrimp order because these did not live up to their namesake. They were huge and to my dismay actually tasted kinda rotten. The peanut sauce paled in comparison to the sauce served at Doan's.

Also sampled was the Tom Yum soup. It had large chunks of tough lemongrass and no subtle flavors or really any flavors.

We enjoyed the old stand by Kang Panang Curry: Panang curry in coconut cream with peas, carrots, bell peppers, chopped lime leaves and sweet basil.

I wouldn't go back just for that though when other restaurants are the total package."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. The restaurant has a very good feel/environment."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte for Thai food. I got the Pad Kee Mao and it was delicious. The service was good and everyone I went with was raving about their meal. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Lunch Review:

What an awesome spot for lunch! Their lunch menu is quite expansive and an awesome deal! All the items are prices between $8 to $10 and include soup, an egg roll, main entree and an iced tea. I ordered the beef pud see ew at a 4 spicy (scale of 1-5) and the beau had the chicken massaman curry at a 4 spicy. Both dishes were freshly prepared and very flavorful. They definitely brought the heat! We are both spicy food fanatics and Monsoon delivered! The service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at very affordable price. Service was quick. Very basic restaurant but some of the best authentic thai food. Pad Thai , red curry and thai tea are the best options for us."}
{"text":"#26 3 spicy.  This is just as good as Viet Thai in pineville. The staff is super friendly fast service. Clean place. The rice soup is really good."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food and Cheap. My only complaint is that they have weird hours and their parking lot is a bit sketch at night."}
{"text":"This place rivals Thai Taste for the best Thai food in Charlotte.  Monsoon has a huge menu that offers pretty much anything you could want to eat, and even options for picky eaters.  Monsoon is large so you rarely have to wait, and they have a number of people working so the service is quick.  The mee krob here is some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Green curry was so-so.  Nothing worth getting excited about.  The 2-star rating is a result of a staff member doing something that should NEVER be done during open hours.  

I came in toward the end of lunch.  Still had ample time.  Wanted to enjoy a nice, quiet meal.  Only one other table with customers in restaurant.  I was seated as close to the kitchen as possible so the waiter wouldn't have to walk far.  I didn't mind that.  What annoyed me was the staff member that proceeded to wrap silverware in cloth napkins at the booth behind me.  Every 5 seconds, a loud \"clink, clink, clank\".  Totally silent in the restaurant except for that.  No music.  No conversation.  Just listening to silverware. 

Wait until you are CLOSED and ALL the customers are out before you do that."}
{"text":"I came here hungry. I left still hungry, as I didnt have enough food to fill my stomach. I ordered the pad kee mow(drunken noodles). I do have to say it was delicious, on the other hand I felt I paid good money for insufficient food."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai and red curry ever! The staff SO helpful and kind!!! Loved every second there. It was the first time my husband liked any Thai food. Very relaxed, casual place to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love Thai food. We recently moved and we were looking for a place in our new neighborhood. We loved this place. I got the pad see ew with shrimp and he got the pad Thai with chicken. We will be back! Probably once a week. Great service."}
{"text":"This little strip mall thai joint was a good choice for a Friday night spot without a wait of any kind. The inside has a pretty plain feel like an old folks diner/country kitchen joint with 'thai' decorations on the wall (nothing like the Thai'd out Thai House). Ordered #46, Kung blah bleh something. Wide noodles, chicken, assorted veggies, yes including some baby corn. It was pretty good, probably would've enjoyed the Pad Thai that 3 others ordered. 
Half of us requested spice level 3, the others spice level 2...the consensus was the spice levels got swapped since my 3 didn't seem too spicy, but the 2's were burning. The meal left enough for a small lunch the next day.
Service was fine and the drinks stayed full which is always nice when you're eating something with spice or that's supposed to have spice."}
{"text":"My New Favorite for Thai in Charlotte!  Fantastic Food! Great Service!  A Psycho Analyst referred me to this place!  

Impressive Pad Kee Mow!  They included just the Vegetables I wanted:  Napa, Red Peppers, Onions, Summer Squash, Zucchini, Mushrooms Tomatoes, etc. and three Spicy Level seemed PERFECT!

Tom Kha Gai Soup the one with Coconut Milk, Lime Leaves, Lemon Grass, Thai Basil, Chicken (Gai), RED Onions (they did not need any extra points - I LOVE Red Onion), Mushrooms, Tomato and Ganglia!

After eating here I did fell better about EVERYTHING so I'll thank the Psycho Analyst in case he is reading!"}
{"text":"If you are going for lunch do NOT, I repeat, do NOT trust their menu online. I just got completely burned on that - they only publish their dinner menu online apparently and the numbers are NOT the same. (For the record, I have a lot of food allergies so getting the wrong thing isn't just disappointing, it means I literally canNOT eat what was served to me, as it could kill me.) 

Anyhow, the food itself is good, the restaurant inside is not indicative of the ambiance outside, and the curries are great. 

Definitely recommend if you're going out to eat if you're not feeling like paying the Uptown surcharge and just want some good Thai."}
{"text":"From April, 2013:

We enjoyed the atmosphere here, the prompt and friendly service, and the excellent food, accompanied by a Thai tea. We had shrimp and scallops in a curry sauce with vegetables, and sharing one allowed us to save room for dessert -- sticky rice with an egg custard on top. We would definitely go here again.

-----

I had a second visit in July, 2015. It maintained the same level of food quality and excellent service. I took co-workers who hadn't been, and they really enjoyed themselves -- even the one who hadn't eaten Thai before, and just pointed to a picture on the menu and asked for \"that.\""}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! I have a high tolerance for spicy and this has been the only place that has brought me to tears. So stick to saying 3 or below and you will be safe."}
{"text":"Locally owned, Mom and Pop Thai food. 

Whenever we try others anywhere, this is the one they all get compared to. Interior looks like it was handmade, with lots of touches that only happen in a place where a human (not a corporate MBA) is decorating.

I've tried most of their menu, and have yet to have anything I wouldn't recommend. Our true weakness is the Me Krob. Favorite quick meal is a Me Krob appetizer and a Sticky Rice dessert."}
{"text":"Curry is very good. Usually go with smaller groups and they are very prompt. The lunch menu is a great deal (soup, entrée, and a cold tea) for $10. I went recently for a work lunch however and it was very disorganized. There were 10 of us and 4 of my co-workers got dishes placed in front of them and then taken away and switched with others on the table multiple times. There was also about a 15 minute wait between when the first plate went down and the last plate was put down. Luckily we all waited for plates to be put down or multiple people would have ended up either waiting longer or with half eaten meals. Main take away... great place for a good priced Thai food with a friend, not such a good place for large groups."}
{"text":"I tried this place because I was in the area (normally Thai Taste is my default for Thai) and it was good, Thai Taste is def still my favorite. The red curry was delicious, probably what I'll order if It go back. The Pad See Ew was alright, Ive had better. I ordered it with extra veggies like everyone recommends. I think I actually prefer it with just broccoli- but besides that it just wasn't as tasty as others I have tried. I was excited they actually had fresh rolls bc some Thai places do not, and I was sooo disappointed. The worst fresh rolls I've ever had. First- they did not have the yummy peanut sauce that goes so well with them- it was like a vinegar based version of peanut sauce with crushed peanuts in them. I basically used the spicy red sauce they gave me (which was NOT Sriracha, it too was more vinegar based with some chili peppers in it, the lady at the counter didn't even know what \"Sriracha\" was when I said it. So I just asked for \"spicy sauce\") instead of that sauce bc I didn't like it at all. And even worse was that the fresh rolls had little to no shrimp- it was basically a bunch of lettuce and noodles. By far the worst I've ever had, don't order you will be disappointed. ANYway- It was decent food- definitely not the best Thai I've had- I would recommend going to Thai Taste since it's not that far away but does the trick if you're really craving Thai."}
{"text":"Love this place..great location and their papya salad is spicy and cheap."}
{"text":"First time trying this place on a recommendation via a co-worker. Looking for a restaurant in the south end area on Friday night, that isn't extremely busy seemed like a tough feat. We walked into an empty restaurant, which was a little concerning at first. However, the mood was broken when the friendly waitress greeted our table. She wasn't afraid to admit she was just helping her sister out, and was a hair dresser by trade, so it made it entertaining and humorous when trying to order from her. The atmosphere was quaint and was what I would have expected for a Thai restaurant. Which is great considering the strip mall it's located in - as many times as I've driven by and not even noticed it?!

Of course we had to start with the fresh spring rolls. These were nothing special, but cured the craving I'd been having for them nonetheless. If you like spicy, they had a delicious house hot sauce, which mixed really well with the peanut sauce served with the fresh rolls.

The Veggie Pud Thai was my selection for entree, which challenged my favorite pud thai dish in Charlotte. Spicy #3 had great flavors and a decent kick, but I'd step it up a notch next time. It was great how the spice was actually cooked in the dish as opposed to just sprinkled on top after the meal was plated. Everyone I dined with enjoyed their meal as well, so definitely worth going back and trying something else.

Oh and you have to try the mints that come with the check; I've never had anything quite like it!"}
{"text":"We live close to Monsoon Thai and enjoy going there for dinner occasionally.  In the evening there is seldom a crowd, maybe just a few other tables. We find the service is ALWAYS prompt and friendly.  We went recently and I ordered one of the specials, Soft Shell Crab in red curry sauce. I have to say it was the best dish I have ever had there.  There were 3 crabs, all fried perfectly in a very light crisp batter.  Plenty of vegetables - peppers, broccoli, squash, corn, snow peas in a nice light curry sauce.  I had enough left over to take to lunch the next day.  We also ordered the  Mee Krob as an appetizer for 2 - enough for a meal in itself.  We have always enjoyed our meals here, but this was something special.  

They have spruced the interior up with some new furnishings and the place looks much nicer.  My only suggestion here is to LOSE all the plastic plants and maybe change the wall color from Maroon to something lighter, more updated and appealing to the eye."}
{"text":"My heart is broken that this place has closed. I've travelled all over and have had Thai food everywhere from Europe to Southeast Asia itself. THIS was by far my favorite place for Pad Thai and curries. Their customer service standards have decreased these past few months and now I know why. Charlotte has lost a gem!"}
{"text":"Visited this place on a Tuesday night for dinner. Cozy warm atmosphere inside - much needed in the cold this time of the year. Not many visitors - probably because of the week day. We started with veggie spring rolls which were okay. Not too good not too bad. We also tried the Thai ice tea. Out of all the Thai ice teas that I've had, this had least flavour. We the. Moved on to main course which also was overall okayish. We ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken (din't remember the exact name) and Panang curry. We also ordered a tonight's special dish (again don't remember the name), but, it was quite good and it is the only reason why this place gets a 3star rating. The dish was made of fried noodles & veggies. Would recommend trying that!"}
{"text":"Tasty dinner, good service. We will be back.  
They had a good selection of beers on the menu and good price for imports. We enjoyed the tom kha gai soup which was  flavorful but the slices of lemongrass in it were a little woody and hard to eat.  The stuffed chicken wings (peah Kai yas sigh) were pretty tasty also. Made me wish there were more than two. 
Dinner was the kang ped which was a creamy coconut red curry duck with pineapple and peppers, bamboo shoots, lime leaves and basil. My wife and I enjoyed it. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The Charlotte Agenda rated this as one of the top five Thai restaurants in Charlotte, so I went to check it out. I have always been partial to The Thai House in Pineville, so I really wanted to see if Monsoon was better.  My first impression was that it was eerily quiet inside. There were not a lot of customers and not even any music that was playing, or at least audible.  For the lunch beginner, they served a bowl of chicken and rice soup, which was tasty.  For my lunch entree,  I had something called \"Gang Dang\", which had chicken and curry and some vegetables.  It was very good.   Unlike the Thai House in Pineville, they didn't offer brown rice, just white rice.  Also, their iced tea was plain tea, not the jasmine tea, found at The Thai House.  Our food came out fast, but then the service became disappointing.  At The Thai House in Pineville, the service is definitely better.  The atmosphere at the Thai House is better than this, with their music and impressive wood carvings.  I would say that the food is comparable between the two places.   Overall, I think the Charlotte Agenda got it wrong when they didn't pick The Thai House as one of the top five Thai restaurants in Charlotte.  It really makes me wonder what their selection criteria are.  I am glad that I went to Monsoon. It was a quiet space for a great conversation with my friend, Jeff and yes, the food was quite good.  I just wish the service had been better and that I would have found something special about it.  Nothing special here, but a solid choice for Thai food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had Tom Kai soup, spring rolls, red curry, pring. We both got spicy two stars and that was perfectly hot for us (we usually get a 3 or 4 at other thai restaurants) We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit for Monsoon but somehow my previous review is missing.  Oh well.  I gave them a 2nd chance but my 2nd impression was about the same as my first.  

It's sad to say that the best thing I tasted this visit was the cool refreshing water that I had with my lunch.

The soup, if you can call it that, was bland.  It was water with rice, a couple bits of chicken and cilantro.  Occasionally you tasted the cilantro but besides that it tasted like something you'd get at a hospital.

My lunch was a mixture of chicken, veggies in a red curry stir fry sauce.  Again, there wasn't much flavor here and the chicken was over cooked.

Even the egg roll had no flavor at all.  

The service was rushed and I didn't think anyone was really friendly here.  

So I don't think there will be a 3rd impression.  There are plenty of other Thai restaurants around Charlotte that have exceeded my expectations that will get my future business."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Charlotte. Everything I've had here has been excellent and fresh."}
{"text":"I heard that Monsoon was authentic Thai food.  I placed an order for pick up and it was ready when I arrived.

I ordered the pud prig pow.  It was a healthy blend of veggies, chicken, and red sauce with a generous portion of rice.

We will order again!!!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the upscale Thai places and hit this up instead.  I have yet to find a better dish of Pad Thai in Charlotte.  My next adventure is to somehow sit down and order something other than the typical Pad Thai order.  Recommend lunch because the pricing is better and it's the same amount of food.  It's $10 vs $15."}
{"text":"Not in the most easy location to get to, as they are in a heavy construction zone (for the moment anyway), across from the old Pepsi plant. But they have been here forever. Once all that settles down, it is certainly possible that they will continue to be here forever longer. Or perhaps this whole strip center will be torn down for even more apartments/condos/whatever.

Regardless, the interior of the place hasn't changed much in the last decade or more, and that is not an entirely bad thing. The menu is fairly typical Thai, with noodles and such, and you pick your option, give it a spice rating and you are off to the races. Reasonable amounts of spice here, as with a medium (2.5? 3?), it generated a decent amount of heat, but those who want more will likely want to go higher.

Service is a bit on the slower side, but all in all it is a serviceable option if you are in need of a Thai fix."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good Thai food. I was really pleased to find this in Charlotte. A friend who lived in the area dragged me and my skepticism out to eat here one night and I was pleasantly surprised. Don't be fooled by the shoddy exterior or the strange interior decor. It doesn't have to look pretty to have good food! 

I had a green curry, which is probably my favorite of all the Thai curries. The tastes of each are hard to describe. Green just seems smoother to me. My companion had the phad thai. Now, I have never liked phad thai. The texture or that weird sweet flavor or something is always just really meh to me. I tried some of hers and found I really liked it. I don't think I'd ever order it because THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE, but I'd definitely be open to splitting it with 2-3 people.

My curry was excellent. The ingredients were fresh and tasty and not overcooked. Nobody likes a mushy carrot. I would definitely order it again. They gave me chicken at first when I ordered vegetarian, and they promptly replaced it. This was very pleasing to me. The vegetarian curry seemed chock full of veggies, so I was really happy. 

The downside? They don't have brown rice. That's it. Everything else was great. :)"}
{"text":"This place is excellent for lunch or take out dinner. The Pad thai is the best in Charlotte, the green curry dish is also excellent. 

If you like spicy food (really spicy), you need to try the Sum Tum Salad... it is made with green papaya, tomatoes and lettuce. It is fresh and flavorful. On a hot day, I can't think of something better."}
{"text":"I've always wondered about Monsoon...

Living just a mile or so away, this Thai restaurant always bewitched me in their green and white strip mall. Thus, there finally came a time to pull over and try some of South End Thai. Service was solid overall, as it is in many Thai restaurants, and the inside is a bit nondescript but clean and simple nonetheless.

Hubs and I tried a smattering of dishes and here's how we fared:

1) Fresh Rolls: 4/5: Fresh, indeed. Each order comes with 2 large fresh rolls stuffed with the usual suspects - mint, basil, vermicelli, shrimp & lettuce served with a peanut dusted hoisin sauce. 

2) Satay: 3.5/5: Perfectly cooked chicken on a stick with a tasty but very oily peanut sauce. The flavor was great, but there were many mini pools of oil on top of the peanut sauce. 

3) Pad Thai: 2.5/5: Not my favorite Pad Thai I've had. While the portions are super generous, the sauce was way too sweet for my liking - almost a sweet and sour/ketchup taste. The noodles were a a bit overdone and that combined with the too sweet sauce didn't really do it for me. However, I think it's more about what you're used to with Pad Thai - I prefer a non-soaked, drier noodle. Spice level 2 was just fine, but from what I hear there is a big difference between 2 & 3! 

I definitely want to come back and try the pud see ew and see how I like that one. Considering this is the local Thai spot in my 'hood, I want to support them!"}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker. It didn't let me down. I'm used to eating Thai food in California and I think Californians do it best but this place did justice as far their curries go."}
{"text":"Sorry friends, but I have experienced much better Thai cuisine in Charlotte than this.  

We started with the fresh rolls wrapped in rice paper.  It was mostly stuffed with noodle and barely any shrimp or basil.  Majorly lacking in flavor.

I ordered a salad, I do not recall which one, but I asked for grilled shrimp in lieu of the fried options.  I got a soggy salad with dressing that smelled like dirty feet. $20 later, I really wish I had stuck with the leftovers in the fridge!

My friends' food looked soggy and over-sauced as well.  The service was friendly, but that alone cannot make up for bad food."}
{"text":"This is a good go-to Thai take-out place.  I had a bit of slow service when dining in, but the food will certainly appease your Thai cravings.  Lard Nar is tasty, as were many of the other options.  
Alcohol selection is a bit weak, with only 4 beer options.  This and the service are probably why I suggest just getting take-out here for a quick meal on the go when you don't feel like cooking.

Overall would recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to this place on a weekday for dinner with  high expectations as it had really good ratings. We ordered a couple of chicken entree's. The taste was kind of weird and I've eaten at many Thai restaurants, but this was a really bad experience. We felt that the food was stale (especially chicken) and we couldn't eat more than a couple of spoonfuls. I did a lil research after coming back home and found that this restaurant was rated very low in terms of sanitation (it scored 85 on 9/19/17 according to wcnc.com). I also realized that all the reviews were at least an year old. Will never visit again. One positive - good service"}
{"text":"Had been meaning to hit up monsoon for a while now. I love Thai food and had more than 3 people recommend this place to me. Came here for lunch. Their lunch prices arent that bad varying from 9 to 13 bucks and you get your main dish, rice, soup, spring roll, and ice tea. I ordered the #8 with a seafood mixture. The food was flavorful and not suoer spicy even though i pucked 3 hot. Service was a bit on the slowside and they forgot my spring roll as you can see in the pic. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Monsoon is a block away from my house and I somehow hadn't been there. That all changed today and I was definitely missing out. I had the Pud Prig Khing, which was delicious and had an amazing curry sauce. The flavors of the stir fry ingredients were so bold and worked great with the sauce and chicken. For dessert, I had a sticky rice dish with a nice cream sauce and mango slices. I'm not sure if that's on the menu all the time, but I'd go back just for that.

Overall, an outstanding experience. Great food, good value, and a very nice staff."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 dishes.

Green Curry Chicken - tasted okay, quality of food was good.  overall good, but i didn't like how expensive it was.  maybe its because there aren't many thai restaurants that they can charge a lot, but i've had much better elsewhere for much cheaper.

Basil Beef - I've never had basil beef that was served with ground beef!  I usually get pieces/slices of beef, but this place served it with ground beef.  after i realized it was ground beef, i had only a little bit since it didn't taste all that good.

advice: don't order beef dishes, go with the chicken."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai I've had in Charlotte.

I would be more excited if the prices were a bit lower-- there wasn't an option under $11 on the menu, including vegetarian mains. But when I asked them to make my curry \"thai spicy\" (their menu refers to that level of spice as \"native thai\" spice) it came out almost as hot as I'd hoped, but also managed to maintain a deep level of flavor. There were a number of vegetables in my green curry that had not been advertised for on the menu, but they were all cooked perfectly (even the canned baby corn ! ) and added to the end result. Tom Kha soup was good, if a little bland, and the two noodle dishes my buddies chose were awesome (but if there's curry to be had...).

Service was attentive but not annoying. It was very empty, and I hope for their sake it isn't always like that... saw a number of people come in to pick up orders, however, so they must do a good take out business."}
{"text":"Love the food and the papaya salad.(make sure its the sweet and sour juice dressing though). pretty authentic food"}
{"text":"Wowie wow wow!

I have a cold and haven't been able to taste much the last couple of days.  Fortunately the food at Monsoon was so full of flavor today that it wasn't an issue.

I got #23 - Pud Pring Pow!!! The name along got me pretty pumped, but the ingredients called out to me - Thai basil, mushrooms, red be peppers in a roasted chilli pepper sauce?  Yup. Done.

I'm no expert but this was some of the tastiest Thai I've experienced without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town on business and searched for Thai. Monsoon had good comments so I tried it. Great choice! It was very clean, kind staff and excellent presentation.  The portions were very large and tasted great. I had Pad Kee Mao. Excellent. I did have to tell them spicy but it was with telling them. Try it! You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This is a very quaint, little restaurant that LOOKS as if it may not be that good, but THE FOOD is extra delicious. Haven't had a disappointing meal yet. The SAUCES they have are soooo tasty. 

I usually get the Crispy Chicken & Scallops and the Shrimp Royal and it is always delicious.

My mouth is watering and my stomach is grumbling just-a thinkin' about it. Yum. 

4/5 stars. The only reason I give 4 and not 5 is because the menu is really confusing sometimes and the descriptions of the food aren't plainly clear, BUT they give you a good idea of what it is. Your food will be tasty, even if you can't necessarily understand exactly HOW you're supposed to eat it."}
{"text":"Strip mall restaurants always scare me...but it's Charlotte so there aren't many options. The \"Spectacular\" Factor died along with any soul this place could have had when they decided to set up shop next to a bank. 

It's not really a horrible joint, but it's underwhelming. The service is blah, the food is blah. There were tons of blue-hairs eating in there when I went, it was like a cafeteria at the rest home. The owners seem authentic enough, but they just don't seem to give their food that extra oomph. It's almost like a diner, but with Thai food."}
{"text":"So I had the strangest lunch here at this restaurant. I have to give the food 5 stars for sure. The service there was amusing. I know how it is to work in a restaurant and they seemed very understaffed today. So I understand that they couldn't refill my boyfriend's tea 20 times because he thought he could handle 5 star spice. After lunch we ordered 2 more appetizers (because my boyfriend couldn't eat his dish due to spice level) and when it finally showed up it was packed to go, the server said thank you then cleared our table even though we wanted to eat it there. We had a good laugh about that but then decided we should just go because they were busy anyways. When we got to the car to eat the rest of our food we realized it wasn't what we ordered at all. Then I also realized that we didn't pay. So we went back inside and everyone surrounded us saying, \"is it the wrong order? We're sorry. We'll make it for you no charge\" which was a nice gesture. But we didn't want to wait so we paid our tab and left. Pretty amusing time we had. The service was entertaining. I'm glad it happened to us and not other people because I know that others would've given them a bad review. This is a nice little place. Very entertaining. I'm still laughing as I write this review. Just one thing that made me uneasy is the 77.5 sanitation score. But I'm sure they'll work on that for the next inspection. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Lunchtime favorite among my co-workers, my first time here. Lunch includes soup and a spring roll. The soup was too salty for my taste, it was some sort of broth with rice (my knowledge of Thai cuisine starts and ends at Chicken Pad Thai), the spring roll tasted nice and fresh,  I cant tell you what I ate except it was #23 on the lunch menu and it was tasty. I ordered with chicken, it had a lot of veggies - peppers, snow peas, carrots, broccoli, onions, thai basil in some sort of brown sauce with wide pan noodles. I was nervous the sauce would be similar to Chinese brown sauce (sweet, sugary) but this had a nice light flavor and the dish was not downed in it. Service was good, food came out fast and hot. I would try again and explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Food was delicious & service was fast & friendly.  Pan fried noodles & curry #22 were very tasty!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here during the lunch hour (oddly always in the same booth), and I've been happy with it every time.

The lunch \"combos\" ($8-10 depending on your protein/veg choice) are served with a spring roll and soup which will forever remind me of Campbell's chicken and stars. Some days it's well made, some days all the starch has seeped out and it's like a porridge... edible either way.

The Pad Thai reminds me a bit of the one served around the corner at Thai Taste. Not a bad thing, I like both- not too peanutty. Lately, the Pad See Ew has become my usual order. Last time I asked for extra veggies (a few carrots, mushrooms, something to up the vitamin count) in it and after a little confusion I got it - a lot of it. (I don't know if adding other veggies no longer makes it a see ew, but I didn't really care) Carrots, baby corn, mushrooms, green beans, squash, zucchini, and cauliflower in addition to the standard broccoli. AMAZING. (and they didn't even charge extra)

Let's talk about the spice level... most places around town it's on a scale of 1 - 5, here it's 1 - 4... and 3 eventually triggered the waterworks. (for reference, a 4 at thai taste barely makes my nose run) surprising- but so good, and so spicy. Plus, the food already comes out of the kitchen mouth burning hot (temperature wise).


Good portions and attentive service, though the after you get your meal part can be a bit slower than the before. They're very efficient at taking your order and bringing all the food, but if you need a to-go box you might have to go hunt one down yourself. Most of the time they end up bringing the check to the table instead of you having to get up and pay - but it kind of depends on how busy they are."}
{"text":"Good food and amazing customer service.  If you order takeout expect it to be ready in about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"My lunch buddy suggested we hit up Monsoon as an alternative to Thai Taste on East Blvd.  Great call!  

The soup was a sweet/savory mix with melon and green onion, really well done.  I had a red curry, which lacked heat, but I was able to add some in later.  Also came with a fresh spring roll, which just crumbled due to its freshness.

The decor was meh - and let's face it, it's location on South Blvd isn't the best place to bring your in-laws - but all of that takes a back seat to delicious food, which is what this place serves!  

My lunch buddy went with the green curry, and had only good things to say about that as well.  I will be back to this place to try some different dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Traveling here on business, and not a huge fan of Thai but this was truly excellent and made me a fan. The food was so fresh with fresh picked herbs and spices, the combination of flavors was outstanding. The location was not bad at all. And interior was very clean with great service. Give it a try no disappointments."}
{"text":"Very disappointed....would not go back.  Should have been able to tell by lack of customers on a Thursday night.  Tried two of the more popular dishes and neither really struck me as something I would come back for.  Hardly any meat, very small portions and the large bug on the wall behind me didn't do anything for my appetite.  Would rather pay more at Basil or head to Cuisine Malaya for my fix"}
{"text":"My husband and I had ordered-in once, out of sheer laziness and the desire to try something new. We had the red thai curry and rice and were pleasantly surprised with how delicious it was. So we made a lunch visit & had 2 options from the stir-fried menu. For starters, the restaurant is a small cozy one, almost homely. Service is excellent, and this coming from me (read, stickler for good service). Our server was a young cheerful girl and not only helped me choose between a few options (read: good knowledge about the food), but was pleasant, engaging, yet non-interfering. For $9 each we had a sumptuous meal of an iced tea, warm non-heavy soup, and just the right size for a side of chicken with veges, white rice and a golden crispy egg roll. My only complaint was the size of the plate was a tad small. But nothing that spoiled our experience. My husband & I are new to Charlotte and eat out a lot. Monsoon Thai, we both agreed, is a GOOD discovery!"}
{"text":"So I ventured to Monsoon on the kind recommendation of Hailey H. -- I'm glad I did. Also, it's super close to work and I had to work late last night and missed the CYME!!! 

Anywho, I stopped in to get some Tom Kha Gai, a Thai beer, and I also opted for the Fresh Spring roll. 

The soup, now this tasted a lot like what I am use to from my old fav San Diego spot... And they had a nice fish sauce to garnish my soup with. 

The beer... why do I do this to myself... I can never, never, never, eva never drink Thai beers... ever since I was in my early 20's -- but still to this day I think otherwise... burp! Oh excuse me, how rude of me. But, nonetheless, I do love their beer. 

Now the fresh spring roll... hmmmmmm... yes indeed fresh it was... but lacking. It was more fluff than substanance. The peanut sauce was yummy. 

I also enjoy all the condiments, they were fresh and tasty. 

The restaurant needs a good dusting... I couldn't stop staring at the dust pile on top of all the fake plants... people dust the fake plants--- that crap is floating all around the room and landing on my plate of food!! YUCK! AHHH CHOOO

Also, besides the dust, the prices really bothered me. For the location and city - I really felt the entree prices were way too high - In San Diego I never paid for over $9 bucks for veggie curry... really? 

I will go back for the soup and maybe lunch, but for dinner, only if a date is buying! ha!"}
{"text":"I love the snapper fillets, I have tried the soft shell crab which was very good.
chicken satay
fried dumplins
thai tea.
Very friendly staff.
dont let the little strip mall and the lack of a large crowd scare you away!
a nice and quiet meal awaits you!"}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood spot for a casual meal with great food, and friendly service. Beer list is solid, with traditional options available."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I got take out from here for the first time and I couldn't believe how disappointing it was. I have been craving Pad Thai for days and even though I had never eaten here before, I figured that was a hard thing to mess up - I was very wrong! The sauce was so acidic and sour tasting. I've never had a Pad Thai sauce that tastes like that. Even so, the noodles were dry and the dish lacked spice and flavor. I even had a side of peanut sauce that was SO acidic, it didn't help make the dish rich or creamy at all.  Very disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite before a movie, we decided to try a new Thai place. Located in a smaller strip mall right on south blvd on the out skirts of South End, we actually passed this place on the first attempt. Circling back around, we found it, parked and made our way inside. We were greeted right away and sat in a cozy booth. The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, which was a little worrisome. Our waitress with cheery and we ordered some Thai food staples.  Spring Rolls, Pad See Ew, Pad Cashew. Our meals arrived very fast, while presentation wasn't appealing, the food was tasty. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a great authentic Thai. Service is attentive and friendly. Food is delicious. Great portions and reasonably priced. I had green curry and Tom Yum soup both were great. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Fabulous tasty food and grest service everytime.  Ive eaten here 25 times over 5 yrs its always a great dinner.  I love the chicken n scallops with broccoli.  Also love to he duck dishes.  Wife loves green or coconut curry.  Loves it !!!!"}
