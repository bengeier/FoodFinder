{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday and it was the most mediocre food I've ever had. The fact that they think selling  microwavable pancakes is okay it's just disgusting.  I couldn't even finish my breakfast.  Save your time and go to Dianas or somewhere in Lakewood for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love the food, service and environment. Never let me down. My friends and I will stay loyal. Three four times a month we meet for breakfast so this is our regular spot and theirs as well. Delicious homemade food."}

Kristina's has all of the usual diner perks like forever flowing diner coffee in those iconic brown diner mugs. There's that awesome mix of Clevelanders in and out of here. A great diverse mix of black, white and hispanics from what looks to be all spectrums of backgrounds (these are just broad statements to further the point of how diverse the crowd is). This is a great Cleveland diner, period. 

The place is tucked away on Lorain Ave. with ample street parking. When you walk in Kristina's you're greeted with a friendly hello and instructed to sit anywhere you want. The diner is a mix of traditional 4 man booths and large tables that can fit at least 6-8 hungry Clevelanders. The biggest thing I noticed in comparison to a lot of affordable \"greasy spoon\" diners is how clean and put together Kristina's is. There's signs and knick knacks with different pictures of superheroes and actors along the walls. The furniture has charm but is not run down. Too many times I walk into diners that have broken booths with holes and springs popping through them. But Kristina's is a great example of how it should be done.

Now to the food! The food on the menu doesn't stray from your usual diner specials like omelettes and home fries, pancakes and French toast and any combination in between. I can say there biscuits and sausage gravy are a step up than most diners that usually use a crappy powder mixture. Overall it's fresh diner food that is not caked with butter and oil. One thing to note is they don't mind you asking to hold the mushrooms or other ingredients you may not want in your dish. 

Top of the list for a great cheap breakfast"}
{"text":"Drove by this place a million times and decided to try on a Saturday and I have to say we enjoyed it. My daughter and I Botha got a skillet breakfast which was as good as homemade. Service was warm and friendly. We will be back"}
{"text":"Rude service and the meatloaf was gross. The burgers, however, aren't bad. Asked for well done home fries and the waitress argued with us blaming it on the owner. She showed us the receipt to prove she wrote down well done but she probably just wrote that in afterwards to appease us. The pancakes at breakfast were dry and gross too"}
{"text":"The look of this place reminds me of the restaurant Patsy's Pies on the Showtime series Shameless! 

It's only open for breakfast and lunch, but  what makes Kristina's cool is that you can get a meal and drink for around $7 + tip.  You can get a solid breakfast for about a dollar or so less.  I used to live in this neighborhood and still work in the area, so I try to hit this place up from time to time.

Today I had the patty melt which comes with fries and a cup of soup (soup of the day was chicken and rice) washed it down with a can of Diet Pepsi. 

It's  your typical greasy spoon diner in the City.  Good prices and decent food.  Probably why its been open for as long as I can remember."}
