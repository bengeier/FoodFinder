{"text":"On a vécu une mauvaise expérience dans cet établissement. La qualité de service est vraiment horrible !  
 
Un bon bol de ramen est censé de nous réchauffer le corp et le cur. Mais ici ca nous fait que refroidir! 

C'est dommage qu'ils traitent leur clients si mal. On retournera plus jamais."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout stir fried beef noodles for take out. Hardly had any meat and equally few  strips of pepper and carrots. Only plus probably I guess the noodles where hand made. Season was nothing special either. Not sure about visiting again with quite few Chinese  restaurants near by which serve better protein and veggies portions and tastes similar or better for similar price."}
{"text":"The best noodle soup in montreal. The noodles are so tasty and the beef broth is so rich and flavorful. When they put the beautiful bowl of soup on the table the smell is so irresistible that you want to dive into the hot bowl and eat it all. I tried different places for a nice soup and none of them can beat M.Trois. The price also is low. You get a big soup for 10$. Go and try it right NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup is authentic and tastes pretty good. And you can customize your noodle by choosing the shape and thickness of the hand pulled noodle. I also tried some of their appetizers and really enjoyed them. The servers are nice and the food came fast. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to get a taste of authentic Lanzhou noodle:)"}
{"text":"Considering the price, this spot has OK value. Tables and room could be cleaner, but waiting staff was smiling and pretty professional. Quantities are appropriate. Seasoning was balanced and noodle texture on point (both stir fried egg noodles and thick noodles with broth were \"al dente\")"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food served here. 1 star for the service - apparently not enough waiters/ waitresses serve customers, and almost all of them are overloaded with the work here. My friends and I waited for more than half an hour to have all of our dishes on table. Manners are poor with some of the waiters. :( All in all, you may come here to have a taste of Lan Zhou noodles, however, don't expect more of the service here."}
{"text":"Great place near the Concordia area for hand-pulled noodles (you can see the guy pulling them in the back of the restaurant, too). I'll agree with the reviewer who said that the soup doesn't have an impressive depth of flavor, but regardless, it is damn good. You get to select from a bunch of different noodle widths, I like the second widest flat ones. The portion sizes are generous so don't feel the need to get the large. I would also recommend the meat sandwiches (as a side dish).

Service is fast and friendly, and there is lots more seating in the back area of the restaurant. I do like the lan zhou noodles at the restaurant in G&D in Chinatown better, but the space is so small, it's often hard to get a seat and even when I do, everyone is seated so close together I feel like I'm going to get hot broth spilled on me. At M. Trois, I can go with friends, have a conversation, enjoy my noodles in peace."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Cheap price is reasonable, however the restaurant could be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"Went for the hotpot. Very ordinary. Selection of buffet food was ok, but the sauce was ordinary and the meats quality and cut was so-so. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Their top dish is beef noodle soup and it is quite good, prices are fair and lots of place to sit in the restaurant. Good potential if they expand menu"}
{"text":"This is a mini review. The strength of this place are the noodles which are top notch. But the weakness is cheap ingredients. The meats were dried out and tasteless.
The beef noodle broth and noodles were quite good and
the stir fried noodles with chicken good too but the chicken tasted like garbage. A real whole in the wall but not bad for such cheap eats. More like a 2.5"}
{"text":"M. Trois now serves authentic Szechuan hot pot in an all you can eat format.

The base is prepared from scratch in house with imported spices and beef broth is used as the foundation for the soup.

The owner went to her wife's home town in Szechuan and trained for 3 months on how to make authentic spicy broth and brought back dozens of spices from China.

You can have the spicy broth, non-spicy broth, or half and half.

I guess the only potential shortfall is that they only serve hotspots in a large format for now (which is the traditional way), but that means that you'll have to be ok with everyone dipping their chopsticks into the same boiling pot."}
{"text":"The noodles are great here! The traditional beef noodle soup is really good, and i love how you can choose the size of the noodles. I got the cold sesame noodles. I wanted a vegetarian version without chicken, and they replaced the chicken with lots of freshly chopped veggies, which i really appreciate. The place is really big with lots of seats."}
{"text":"Hands down one of our favourite places to grab Lanzhou noodles. We would even say that this is better than the ones in Chinatown! The noodles are varied by thickness and you can choose to add various toppings too. The broth is flavourful and very authentic. Besides noodles and other traditional Chinese dishes, this place is also a hotpot place! They serve regular hotpot and the traditional nine-grid hotpot. For those who like to challenge their palate with some spicy broth, M Trois is the place to go. :)"}
{"text":"Just order braised beef with rice . i had 2 pieces of beef eatable when the rest of the meat was only fat. The price is good but at the end it's not worth  it. 11$ for rices"}
{"text":"This is a newly opened restaurant Hand-Pulled Noodle?Noodles are very good. Very authentic feel and taste .Beef is very tender and fresh.The noodles are good?Next time I will bring friends!"}
{"text":"Large bowl of noodles costs 10$ and is pretty filling if you drink all the soup.

The soup itself doesn't have an impressive depth of flavor, but with the right addition of chili oil and vinegar (both available on the table), the soup tastes rather good.

There are 7 types of noodles from which you can choose from. I tried the largest flat noodles (as illustrated in the photo), and the triangular cross-section ones. 

The large flat noodle had a good chew, but was difficult to pick up with chopsticks because of its dimensions and lack of friction.

The triangularly cross sectioned noodle, on the other hand, had a very soft texture as it almost melts in the mouth. Due to its shape, more soup hung unto it per unit area, so it tastes better (or rather, tastes less like flour).

With this harsh Montreal Fall/Winter weather, I find myself enjoying a nice warm soup more than any other food.
So the next time I'm around Concordia, I'm definitely trying their other selections of noodles."}
