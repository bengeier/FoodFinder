{"text":"This place is infuriating and needs to close down. Tacos need not cost $4.75 a piece. If you want a shrimp taco or crab taco, it's an additional $2.50. Am I reading this right? $7.25 for a fucking taco? If you want cheese on ANY taco, it's an additional $.50. You have got to be fucking kidding me. And they are small! Anywhere else, they would be referred to as taquitos, or SMALL TACOS!!!!! Gringo bullshit. Anyone who eats here and thinks that salsa and chips should be included before the meal need to instead go eat at any of the run of the mill cheddar cheese mexican joints. Lettuce comes on tacos if you order them at Taco Bell. Anyone who eats here and thinks that this modern mexican food is cool and hip needs to instead go eat at Momocho (2.5 stars). This place represents obnoxious dining at it's finest.

Press the crosswalk sign and grab a dog across the street at Happy Dog. It's delicious, $5 and not trying to be anything that it isn't."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The hostess, server, and the guy who poured out water could not recommend a drink or a meal. Our waitress hadn't tried ANYTHING on the menu. I orderd the strawberry basil margarita that didn't taste anywhere near what the name was. Our salsa came before the drinks and there weren't enough chips for the salsa and our server never came back to see if we needed more. So we really didn't get to eat the salsa. I ordered the lobster tacos. The lobster I am pretty sure was canned and it was loaded with cabbage. The sauce tasty like ranch with a taco bell mild packet mixed in. I also had the hangar steak taco which included two tiny strips of charred chewey steak, loaded again with cabbage. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for \"Taco Tuesday\" happy hour and had a pretty good time.  

The \"2-for-1 draft beer special\" was great!  The selection of draft beers ranged from PBR (which ain't all that bad!) to very tasty wheat beers.  I ordered 3 tacos; Duck Confit, Roasted Pork and Potato and Hanger Steak...all with soft shells.  They were all very tasty, the meats were all tender, juicy and full of flavor.  The Pork taco also had these great, salty lardons of bacon that should just be made into it's own \"Bacon Taco!\" Very good.

Just a few, minor complaints.  First,  I like to pick up tacos and eat them.  They're meant to be eaten with your hands.  The soft shell tacos are more of an open-faced sandwich/small salad, very hard to eat \"out of hand.\"  Secondly, is that the soft shells appeared to be just normal, soft flour tortilla shells.  I could be wrong, but I'm not sure that they weren't just store-bought flour tortillas.  Sure hope i'm wrong on that one. Finally, I'd like to see a read, dedicated website with a menu posted, as opposed to a Facebook fan page.  That's just kinda lame...

Previous reviews were critical of the staff, so I was braced for bad service.  They've clearly made changes in this department.  The hostess was very friendly, while our waiter, Antonio, was very helpful, offering suggestions, and was attentive without being \"TGI Fridays\" annoying.

All around, a pretty good dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been to roseangel once, about a month after it opened, on a Sunday evening.  I believe my group comprised all the customers in attendance throughout the entire meal, and the staff and owner could not have been more attentive or congenial.

Everything was good, and most things were great.  I had the Duck Confit (crunchy shell) and Seared Tuna (soft shell).  The duck was delicious; the tuna was nice, but not mind-blowing.  My table ordered one of the salsas (unfortunately, I don't remember which, but it was heavy on avocado and garlic, if that helps), and it was incredible.

My biggest disappointment was my drink.  I really enjoyed the cocktail I had had at Luxe a few weeks earlier, and was looking forward to a creative combination of flavors.  I ordered the Perpetula, a \"Cucumber & Lemon Mojito with Bacardi and and Fresh Mint,\" which had a lovely cucumber and mint flavor but did not really taste of alcohol at all, and not in a good way.  As far as cucumber and mint-infused water goes, it was great, but there was no way I was getting a buzz off of that drink.  Maybe it was a bad night for the bartender, because with drink descriptions like roseangel's, I'd expect drinks with a kick.

The decor is rich and beautiful, in my opinion.  Definitely very festive and trendy.

I'll definitely be back for duck tacos and guacamole, and I look forward to getting their happy hour prices ($4.25 a la carte for those tacos is already really good)."}
{"text":"While the Chef's Whim meal at RoseAngel appears to be a great deal ($18 for 4 courses) it is neither well-planned nor scintillating, as a Chef's menu should be.

The service was not very good - first we received only one salsa (the same type that the others at our table had ordered separately) and then a few minutes later the waitress came back with guacamole and other salsa. I'd say that the salsas are the best thing about this restaurant - the peach-mango was very good.  
For our second course, the waitress brought the \"taco salad\", which has bacon in it. Now, my dining partner and I had selected the fish option for the Chef's menu, so we did not expect to get bacon in our salad. At Chef Martin Kaplan's other restaurant, Luxe, each course in the Chef's menu is chosen according to the diner's choice of meat, fish, or vegetable.

For the taco course, my dining partner and I expected to have a medley of fish tacos. Instead, we got only fried catfish. yuck. Fish tacos are meant to be light and refreshing, not fried. The corn tortillas are delicious.

The other diners at our table who ordered a la carte tacos were more content, except for one of the meals which was only lukewarm. When that patron asked the waitress if it was meant to be that temperature, she just shrugged off his concern.

Dessert was ok - some more corn chips with nutella, cinnamon and marshmallow (only on the top layer of chips, most were totally dry). The mango cheesecake was good, though."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews of Roseangel so I was hesitant to try it even though the menu looks appetizing.  I happened to be on Facebook and saw a post on the Roseangel page advertising half off the taco platter after 5pm on Sunday so I figured it was a sign and talked my boyfriend into going.

We arrived and after being seated I mentioned the special to the hostess.  She returned a minute later to tell me the special is only from 5-7pm.  That it says that on the flyer from the Capital Theater. I reminded her that I saw it on Facebook and on there it didn't specify an end time.  She just smiled and said, \"we'll make sure someone changes that,\" and walked away.  I was floored.  I mentioned the special to my server who said he would check to see if he could honor it but when he returned to take our order, never mentioned it.  So I let it go but it honestly bothered me that they weren't willing to honor their mistake.  I even saw the hostess approach a man who looked like the owner, from the pictures I've seen online, who told her in no certain terms that it ends at 7.  Great service from the start!

When our server told us they were out of the duck tacos, one of my main reasons for wanting to eat there, we should have just left and gone to Happy Dog.  They had the duck nachos but no duck tacos.  Riddle me that!

Despite all signs pointing to leaving we ended up staying and ordering the white sangria, the pineapple jalapeno margarita, guacamole and two tacos each.  I wish I could say the food made up for the poor start but it really didn't.

The guacamole was tasty and fresh but it wasn't outstanding.  If anything I think it had too much lime juice.  For $8.50 I would expect more.  More flavor, more guac, just more.  I love guacamole and would much rather pay $14 for the amazing guacs at Rosa Mexicana or Dos Caminos in NYC than $8.50 for Roseangel's run of the mill fare.

My white sangria was refreshing and strong but I think a lot of people would be overwhelmed by the amount of tart lime flavor.  I happen to love lime so it wasn't an issue but my boyfriend tried it and regretted taking a sip.  His margarita had no spice or kick to it and the bottom was filled with so much pulp it made the last sips undrinkable.

Now let's talk taco.  I get that when you add \"modern\" to a restaurant we can expect some kind of twist but I still want to be able to eat my taco as it's intended, with my hands.  The tacos at Roseangel are so overstuffed that it's an impossibility.  I would have to remove everything that was good about the taco just to pick it up and then I would be left with a huge pile of cabbage.  Seriously, they can hold the cabbage.  Yes, it's a cheap filler and makes the taco look impressive but what a waste.  My suggestion, take the same amount of ingredients in one taco and split it into two.  

As far as the flavor combinations go, they were hit and miss.  I ordered the Tuna and Eggplant tacos.  The tuna was delicious on its own but as a taco there was no flavor or punch to make it unique.  It was pretty bland with the exception of the artichokes that really overpowered the other flavors.  I ordered the crispy eggplant taco on the suggestion of the server and I'm so glad I did.  He said it was reminiscent of eggplant parm, a fave of mine, so I went for it.  The eggplant was perfectly prepared.  Crispy but not overcooked with a great blend of cheese and salsa.  There was avocado on the taco but I didn't discover it until I was halfway through.  It was just one giant chunk buried under cabbage so it wasn't until the end that I was able to taste the taco with all its intended flavors.  It was quite delicious but poorly executed.

My boyfriend ordered the perch and pork tacos.  The perch was bland and boring even with the cream sauce.  He was extremely disappointed.  Though he did order that in a hard shell taco, I got all soft, and it was a tiny bit easier to eat after he removed some of the insides.  The pork taco was outstanding though and the one true highlight of the meal.  I tried a bite and instantly regretted not getting one.  The pork was delicious and garlic cream sauce mixed with the soft fried potato chunks was amazing.  The garlic was very strong though so don't expect to be kissing anyone afterward.

I must give it up to our server for being so helpful and attentive even if he didn't fight for us regarding the special.  He was a pleasure to chat with and very helpful with navigating the menu.  

I can honestly say there is nothing that would get me to return to roseangel.  I had high hopes for the restaurant but outside of one exception menu item, it was a bust.  Tweeting my thoughts about it later only confirmed that we aren't alone in our thinking.  I hope they can find a way to turn it around because the location is ideal and the decor is beautiful but that can only take you so far."}
{"text":"Great salsa selection and  the three I tried were great. The margaritas were just okay. Same with the tacos .I ordered the spicy chicken taco (which wasn't spicy) and the roasted pork and potato (but there was no potato on the taco). I would recommend just going for drinks and chips and salsa, not dinner. The tacos are just too pricey for nothing special."}
{"text":"Had dinner at RoseAngel last night and it was OK.  I tried a few tacos: Grilled Pork, Hangar Steak, Tres Queso and Crispy Eggplant.  All were OK but not worth $4.75 each.  The pork and steak were both too chewy, I don't even remember the tres queso. The crispy eggplant was the best,  but the spicy tomato sauce did pack some heat.  The black beans and rice were tasty and the came in a large portion that could have been split between 2 people. The Rice Pudding dessert was no bells and whistles plain old rice pudding and overpriced at $7.00.  I didn't have any problems with the service, Antonio did a nice job.  The food at RoseAngel doesn't warrant a return visit.  They did say that the menu was changing 1/1, maybe there will be some improvements??"}
{"text":"Nothing Special, mediocre at best. I went with about 12 friends the other night. For starters, it was Saturday Night and it was very slow. 

The service was absolutely horrible. Screwed up orders, slow getting drinks, forgetting to get drinks/food. I understand we had a big table, but there was only one other 4 top in the restaurant. 

I tried the Hanger Steak and Pork Taco's. The Pork was good, but the Hanger Steak sucked. The Chips and Salsa selections were not much better than Chipotle or Qdoba. I also thought Roseangel was a little overpriced. 

I guess its up to you if you want to try RoseAngel for yourself! However, its not that great, but that's only my opinion."}
{"text":"This review is going to be tough to write, roseangel. 

First of all, I think you're trying to be something you're not. Upscale, mod-mex? Is that what you're trying to accomplish? If so, you lose. Momocho you are not. (It's probably assholey of me to compare the two of you -- but whatev.) 

Second. Your prices on most items are far too high for what you're presenting. Fish tacos. Two of them. With bland, sludgy beans and kinda blah rice. $14. To be frank, that's BS. That price wouldn't bother me had your food not looked and/or tasted like typical Americanized Mexican slop. A few dollars less would be more appropriate. I won't go so far as to say everything was bad or poorly priced. The chips/salsa were enjoyable as was the cactus salad. My margarita was pretty darn good too. 

Third. I did enjoy the ambiance. It was slightly romantic, the lighting was soothing, really cool polka-dot tables, deep red walls -- only sucky thing was the wallpaper was peeling off in certain spots. Yes. I noticed. I'm a freak. 

Fourth. Your staff was wonderful. Our server was sweet and attentive. Perhaps a tiny bit TOO attentive? Maybe she's been reading your reviews and feels she needs to compensate for something. I won't fault her on that. 

Fifth. Gosh, roseangel. I really hope you can get your act together and do a little bit better. You're in a great neighborhood. You have a really cool space. You could be so much more than this. Seems like wasted potential.

*insert big, whiny sigh HERE*"}
{"text":"We had been meaning to try out roseangel for quite a while and decided to give it a try last night.  Heard mixed reviews but figured the new menu might be worth checking out.....boy were we wrong.

The evening started out really nice, walking by the windows there was a office party in the back room and a swing dance group in the middle room, leaving the front room open for diners.  Liked the decor, was seated fast and orders were taken in a timely manner by our nice server.

Drinks came, their marg choices are a little adventerous and we tried 3 of them, pineapple-jalapeno, banana-chile and apricot-rosemary....the first couple of sips of my pineapple-jalapeno were good, but around half a glass I just didn't want any more.

Also ordered the guac as an appetizer, guac was pretty good but the \"warm\" corn chips that were served with it were not salted at all, and avocado deserves a little bit of salting!!

Pulled pork tacos....now, maybe the salt shaker on the table should have been my first clue to run, you don't see this at restaurants where the food is properly seasoned, but there it was, sitting front and center in the middle of our polka-dot table......and the tacos needed it desperately.  NOTHING was seasoned on the plate, except the bacon, and that came to the chef pre-seasoned.

Now, this is where I feel this review may belong in Matt's \"Quality vs. Quantity\" thread....there was so much food on the plate that I definitely couldn't finish it (but I didn't want to take home leftovers either, ick).  Two tacos, fully loaded so you couldn't even pick them up and eat them.  Refried beans that were also very bland and then a blob of white rice (was this supposed to be anything similar to a Latin-style rice??) that had absolutely no flavor.  When you mess with someone's rice and beans, you mess with their mind.....this stuff wasn't good at all.

At this point of the meal, I was all ready to give them 3 stars....and then the bill came....$60 for 3 drinks, an app and 4 tacos.....it was so expensive that I actually asked the waitress to bring over the menu again just so I could double-check the prices.  uh, thanks but no thanks, I'll be taking my business over to Momocho, and you should too....and no, I'm not going to wait until they \"improve\".  It's obvious that the problem with this restaurant probably wasn't their menu, it's the palate of their chef....."}
{"text":"Roseangel takeout - 

Roseangel has a disability that many small and new businesses suffer from; a lack of obvious web presence. I ordered take out the other day but not after spending ample time searching for their menu. The first results that appear for Roseangel are Yelp reviews and various aggregate sites, only scrolling further down does their Facebook profile appear, but it is exceedingly difficult to just get their site to appear in search results. Enough of my social media rant; we're here to discuss food.

Anything on the menu is dine-in or carry-out and despite a price point that hinders a lot of dining out budgets, the food is worth the dent. A good way to experience the menu is trying one of the homemade salsas and fresh chips ($2.75) and 3 tacos, hard or soft shell, ($11.75). There are a variety of salsas and tacos to choose from, including veg-friendly options.

The food was ready when promised, a variety of tacos ordered. All were made with ample, fresh ingredients. From chicken to shrimp to black beans, each taco was delicious and filling. They had no issue when I asked to take off an ingredient, and it was removed as promised. The pineapple chile salsa was also fresh. The chips hot and clearly freshly made were a little underdone. Orders of rice and black beans ($2.0) were large, spicy and delicious. The hostess even called back after placing my order to check how spicy I wanted my rice and beans, so happy there were no assumptions. 

All in all, the meal was fantastic. Despite the chips being a little chewy, everything else was on par. This is only my second trip to Roseangel, the first being shortly after opening, and they have proven themselves consistent. With a few more minor tweaks and awareness that, for a taqueria, the price point is high, this could be a lasting restaurant in a spot that has seen its share of turnover."}
{"text":"I saw Mr. Kaplan on a local television show stating he was leaving the warehouse district because he believed that Gordon Square is the place to be. He said roseangel was adding to the diversity of this district and similar to Happy Dog was offering a limited menu with many options. 

The local news has shown he is ahead of others in exiting as the Warehouse District is suffering from problems. The bar owners were required to attend racial sensitivity training. Since then two murders have taken place in the district. 

Just as businesses moved up the hill from the Flats they are now moving to Euclid and East 4th. Mr. Kaplan heads to Gordon Square. 

Somehow Gordon Square has done what no neighborhood in Cleveland has been able to before. In a few short years it is a PLACE. One can live here, visit here, dine here, drink here, see a play here, go to a movie here, attend a gallery opening or simply drink a cup of coffee. If the city administrators had a drop of interest in the future of Cleveland they would put Matt Zone in charge of economic development and do everything he suggests. 

Mr. Kaplan was a pioneer in the warehouse district and in the frontier of Gordon Square. Thanks for people like him who take a chance and attract others to join in the gamble. 

Roseangel is an example of stick to your knitting. I went with my friend Lydia to this tacqueria a few nights ago. We first tried to go to Happy Dog but there was a line waiting for tables. We walked across the street into a room with not one person there. Lydia stated she had to see a dog or a man or some kind of horse and disappeared. I sat at a table in the next room. Across from me were four rather bored looking women sitting at a bare table. In front of the room's large window a youngish woman was slowly twisting and turning to music. 

Lydia came from somewhere, took a look at the room ,grabbed me by the shoulder and rushed me to the patio. The patio is pleasant as patios can be in cities that enjoy so few days of good outdoor weather. We seated ourselves along a lighted fence covered with heavy vines. Only one other table was occupied. 

The server could not have been more attentive or polite had I slipped a $100 bill in his mouth upon saying hello. The menu includes all the usual Mexican style dishes. The drink menu is more original. Lydia had the pineapple jalapeno margarita and since it was a very hot evening I tried the sangria. She loved her drink. I found mine fair and would not order it again. 

The chips and red picante dip were very good. Although some made comments on the need for more salt I seem to lack the need for highly salted food. The rest of the meal was disappointing. The tacos were messy and ordinary. I had the tilapia but since that fish is rather tasteless it disappeared in the toppings. Lydia said the steak in her tacos was tough. I am in complete agreement with all the reviews that found the pricing far too high for ordinary fare. 

Mr. Kaplan needs to stick to his knitting with upscale restaurants and high prices. He would do well attending McDonald's Hamburger University before he attempts to open another downscale establishment."}
{"text":"we went last tuesday for a spin on the taco tuesday thing. we sat on the patio. the lobster nachos were great (house made chips, nice pieces of lobster, and a soy glaze instead of a bunch of cheese), similar to the ones that were at one walnut (RIP). i agree that the tacos had too much coleslaw on them. 

regarding service, i think that it is key that all wait staff know about drinks and food, the water boy couldn't make a drink recommendation because she said he missed the demo and he lives an hour away, and the server could not give me the pros's and con's lobster vs. duck nachos (i wanted to try either a duck or lobster taco and not repeat it with the nachos) 

tip: educate wait staff, otherwise food was really tasty, and too bad they were all out of the coconut ice cream sandwich for dessert."}
{"text":"First - There is a new menu!  They added more fun, so it's not just taco's and black beans.  

I will admit that I was scared to try this place because the reviews weren't the best, but it's definitely worth trying!  Everyone else is correct - the prices are a little high, but once they actually get it right (just give 'em time to get in the groove) it'll be worth the price! 

We started with a pitcher of the White Sangria - little too much peach flavor, but I didn't have a hard time taking it back! 

To join the sangria, we ordered the chili garlic salsa - and WOW - it is wonderful.   It took all my restraint to not ask them to wrap up the tablespoon or so that we had left so I could take it home with me.  It was that good! 

Their taco options were reduced to 5 total, and I selected the hanger steak and the chicken.  I'm not normally a fan of corn tortilla's - but this one wasn't dry!  The meat was a little overcooked, but the flavors were great! 

Overall - it's not the best ever, but somewhere I'd go again for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate on the patio last Saturday night. She had a Margarita and I had red sangria both were excellent."}
{"text":"This place serves tacos with unique and delicious fillings. We ordered ours with homemade soft corn tortillas. However the flavors were overpowered by the huge mound of cole slaw heaped on every taco. They were too full to pick up and eat so we ended up picking at them with a fork, defeating the purpose of enjoying the mix of yummy toppings and tortilla. When we did manage to fold them closed enough to pick up, the slaw dressing streamed down our hands onto the plate. Not pleasant.

We also ordered a spicy rice and beans side dish. Black beans and rice arrived side by side in a large bowl. Neither were spicy. The rice tasted like Rice-a-Roni with Old Bay dumped all over it. Quite forgettable.

The real superstar was the chili-garlic salsa we ordered from the huge list of salsas on the menu. Together with the home made tortilla chips it made quite a tasty appetizer.

The service was great and the waiter was quite attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Let me be perfectly clear about one thing. Roseangel is not good. At all. 

Unimpressed, underwhelmed and disappointed. Not yet open for an entire year, it's pretty evident the public has spoken loud and clear and Roseangel seems to be grasping at straws to save it's failing operation. 

\"Bu, bu, but, restaurateur Marlin Kaplan is in charge, it has to be good!\" the foodie retorts. To that I say, \"Doubt it!!!\" 

If Marlin Kaplan, owner of Luxe and a recent consultant to the new menu at Dragonfly is also responsible for Roseangel, I suggest he spend more time in the kitchen and/or consulting another chefs palate, because what I was served at a recent visit was bland, uninspiring, sloppy, overpriced and frankly, unacceptable.

In a desperate move, Roseangel recently revamped their menu. Gone were the tapas style tacqeria options. Replacing them were more traditional entrées, sandwiches and a much smaller selection of tacos, all of which come with a plate of fillers (beans and rice).  It's too bad their original concept didn't work out. Upon first reading about it last year, Roseangel basically sounded like a less expensive alternative to Momocho. What I'd soon find out though is that the two aforementioned tacqeria's share absolutely nothing else in common. 

We started with a few margaritas. A pineapple-jalapeño for the lady and an apricot-rosemary for me. After finishing my marg, I switched it up to a frozen banana-chili flavored one. The drinks were ok. Probably the highlight of the night. But they seemed to lack any sort of punch. I could barely pickup any sort of tequila flavor, which may be a good thing depending on your love for the dangerous Mexican sauce.

Next, we opted for the tortilla chips and guacamole. Meh. Unsalted corn chips served with bland, unsalted guac. Nothing that would leave any lasting memories or have me ever desiring this again.  

For entrée, we both got the pork tacos. Two heaping tacos topped with unseasonal imported tomatoes, a few cubes of bacon and served along side a heaping pile of beans and rice. Again, I was underwhelmed. Everything on the plate was so under seasoned, it was comical. A can of Bush's baked beans had more flavor than these poor things! The rice? Although not dried out or anything, so I give them a passing grade for technique, were also lacking in flavor. So much so, they remained unfinished, sitting lonely on my plate as I regretted my meal here. 

Then the bill came. $62+ for THIS?! Ugh.

The review may seem harsh and some have a difficult time being so critical of a local venture, but with so many alternative options out there in this great city of food, I just don't see how the food served here can be acceptable. Roseangel, I have news for you; it wasn't your original menu or concept that didn't work. It's your food. It's bland. Salt isn't a bad thing. Really, it isn't. It's the most basic and widely used method of seasoning things. Learn how to use it. Or get out of the restaurant business and go back to culinary school."}
{"text":"Oh Roseangel, I had such high hopes for you. Your claims of being a modern taqueria combined with your wide selection of taco offerings had me hoping - could this be as good as Momocho?

We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night. There is absolutely no room to wait, so several diners were smooshed up near the door waiting for a table. There were lots of tables available but we still waited a few minutes to be seated. Not a huge deal, but again, no waiting area.

We were seated by the window at a small two-top. We were poured water and our waitress took our drink order. About 15 minutes later our waitress stopped back to let us know our drinks were coming from the bar and she could take our food order. I asked about the duck nachos - they were out of duck. I should have taken that as a sign. I had come for the duck. For a brief moment I looked longly out the window at Happy Dog and wondered if we should cancel our drinks. Instead we ordered two chorizo corn dogs, and three tacos each - hanger steak, braised pork, spicy chicken, grilled pork, grilled walleye and spicy lobster.

Finally our drinks came and ten minutes later our appetizer. The chorizo itself had a lot of flavor but the batter was very lacking. It needed some salt or honey or something to give it some oomph. The hot mustard was neither very hot or very mustardy. I can say this with all honesty because I hate mustard and I was able to eat it. As a trio of flavors, they were underwhelming. There was nothing tying all three flavors together. The corn dog was just okay.

I think it was probably 45 minutes to an hour after we finished our appetizer before our tacos arrived. We started keeping track of time by how many times the girl across the street at Happy Dog went out for a smoke break. The tacos looked pleasing enough - I wish I could say the same for the taste. Bland, bland, bland. Bad flavor combinations. The spicy lobster was not; neither was the spicy chicken, unless you consider char to be spicy. The hanger steak was overcooked. The walleye and pork were walleye and pork. Everything was just so underseasoned. Bland grilled pork was matched with bland potatoes. Cold non-spicy lobster was paired with what could have been cooling cucumbers - had the lobster actually been spicy. I rarely reach for the salt in a non-chain restaurant but the food so desperately needed it here. And hot sauce - PLEASE put hot sauce on the table. 

On the bright side, the strawberry basil margarita was fantastic. It's just too bad it takes 25 minutes to get a drink from the bar."}
{"text":"I definitely will go back to this place and I actually did. This place is great if you just want to get a small meal for some tacos and drink. The tacos are very delicious. We had the eggplant one and the spicy chicken one. Both were pretty good. I also had a red sangria which is quite strong. I guess for people who do drink it's a good place to go:)"}
{"text":"Save your money and time...speaking of time, you better have a lot of it...A group of us went last satruday and spent almost 4 hours. service was horrible. waitress kept mixing up the dishes. the food was cold and just ok. The desert was good and thats about it.  If you want good Mexican food try El Jalepenos on W117th.   Great food and cheap."}
{"text":"Quite honestly, Happy Dog was our first choice destination. But my friend and I didn't know there was a show going on, and wanting to avoid the hipsters, we crossed the street to Roseangel. 

The Bartender/chef was super nice and informative, I really enjoyed the chips and salsa (pomegranate mole and a garlicky salsa). The Pineapple/Jalapeno Margarita was delicious, not too sweet and more on the spicy side. No complaints about the pork taco or strawberrychocolatey/cinnamon cake either. All in all a good time!"}
{"text":"The place is owned by Marlin Kaplan who was behind now-defunct One Walnut and also Luxe Kitchen and Lounge. His partner is Rosita Kutkut who was behind La Boca which was in the same space that roseangel now occupies. Now that we have the background out of the way, let's talk food.  I had heard the place opened and was super eager to try it, and usually for my birthday, my family and I always go to a Mexican food spot... because I love it soooo much!  Back in the day I used to always get a ice cream cake from Dairy Queen.  As I got older, I traded the brain freeze for the bubble guts, lol.... Looking back i'd still make the same choice. So it's my mom, brother, sister and I and I say that we're on the way to roseangel because it's Mexican, it's new, and it was my 1st choice. It's a beautiful Saturday afternoon, and we head across the river to the west side (oh no!).  We park and walk up to the place. As we step inside, some older dude literally yells \"WE'RE CLOSED... WE'RE NOT OPEN TILL 5!\" and immediately I wanted to punch him right in his fucking face. That's no way to greet customers whether you're closed OR open so I want to tell whoever that was to fuck himself. Absolutely and unequivocally.  I don't know your fucking hours. I'm not glued to the paper or my computer looking who's not open on mondays, or who is only open for dinner. I'm simple.... buying food at your establishment should be too. It's a fucking Saturday at 3pm, why would you NOT be open?

But I'm a nice, forgiving guy so I decide that I'm going to give the place another chance at a date to be named later.... So a few days ago, later became the present and I took my friend Michelle out for her birthday. We walk in and everybody is super nice. We had the option for the patio, the lounge or the dining room (vaguely conjuring memories of Luxe). We chose the dining room. Our server was very nice, but not the welcoming type I like when I go out to eat. She never told us her name, or made any sort of small talk whatsoever. She was very robotic and EXTREMELY available. As in kept checking in. I'm missing the word I'm looking for, but she came back so many times, I'm surprised she wasn't wiping our mouth after every single bite.  Looking at the drink menu, there's definitely an array of options... All sorts of wines, bottles vs draft beer (including seasonals and fan favorites like Schlitz, lol), a bunch of specialty cocktails, margaritas with fresh fruit (plus) and of course sangria.

We are both starving, so appetizers are in order. We decide to go with the lobster nachos to start. We're talkin about lobster, guacamole, lime, and sweet soy. Sounded fantastic.  Tasted even better.

In the end, there was a ton of guacamole on the plate, and I was thinking \"hey, this is a mexican joint, where's the salsa?\" So I ask the server if there would be some salsa and chips coming, she said we could order some. What kind of Mexican place doesn't give you chips and salsa to start? Even Luxe gives you bread before your meal.  I remember looking at the menu and seeing all the different types of salsa you could order. I would think they might give you some simple pico de gallo or something. Caost about $1 per 5 lbs, lol. Whatever.... so I ask for some extra chips (which I got $1.25 for. I could have ordered salsa and chips for like $3, huh?) because we had a ton of guac on the plate. Sneaky way to get ppl to buy more I say.

Lobster nachos out of here, here comes the main course. I ordered the battered perch, spicy chicken, and tres queso tacos with a side of rice and beans. Looking at the menu now, I see that you could order 3 tacos for $11.75 or order a la carte for $4.25.  I didn't see that before, but looking at my receipt, she charged me 3 a la carte prices instead of giving me the plate for $11.75... Wow, having revelations just writing the review.... sneaky sneaky strike 2, robot server.

Now I will say, all of the tacos tasted great, but my first bite made me realize that they used cabbage instead of lettuce. This is not advertised on the menu. I fucking hate cabbage. So basically it's like a taco Panini. Tons of cabbage, some sauce, and a bit of meat.  I'm not exactly the happiest dude out there at this point, but I eat it anyways. I didn't even notice any cheese in the tres queso, it was a cheese sauce or something.  Either way, I could barely discern it. For $4.25, that's unacceptable. Sneaky sneaky strike 3.  So all of this going on and our server is coming back ever 2.5 minutes, I'm kind of getting over this spot. Finish the food, got the hell up outta there."}
{"text":"I went to Roseangel tonight based on promotion from Happy Dog and the Plain Dealer. Yes, I went here with my Wife, Morgan, who already did a review, but I feel pretty strongly about this and wanted to add my own thoughts.

It was a little busy, but not overwhelming for a Friday night. Despite empty tables, it still took a few minutes to get seated. We didn't catch our servers name, but we later learned that she was recently hurt on the job, resulting in stitches in her knee and a week off from work.

It took somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes for our first round of drinks to show up, our waitress did keep apologizing. After ordering it took another 10 or so minutes for our Chorizo Sausage Corn Dogs to show up.

The corn dog was okay, but something was off about it; the combination of the mustard, chorizo and batter just didn't meld well. The \"hot\" mustard was barely spicy, while the chorizo did have some heat.

Our drinks ran dry and our entrées were held up, leaving us sitting there starring out the window at Happy Dog across the street. There were several moments where I thought about walking over to get a beer. Our waitress did keep apologizing for the delay.

Between conversation and keeping track of the socialized media on our phones, we people watched the Happy Dog patrons. The girl in the grey jeans stepped outside 6 times to smoke before we got our tacos.

I ordered the braised pork, hanger steak and spicy chicken tacos. I think they mixed up my order with the flavorless cabbage slaw tacos. Each taco came on a separate plate, which consumed our two-top table very quickly.

The completely unseasoned Spicy Chicken taco wasn't spicy at all. My Mom, who thinks plan tomato salsa is hot, could have eaten the chicken. In place of the spice was char, to the point of being crunchy and a little dry. The Pico de Gallo was pretty good, at least it was seasoned. I can't comment on the green peppers or grilled onions because they weren't served on the taco. The crunchy shell was already falling apart when it got to the table.

The Hanger Steak, which was recommended to me by our waitress was utterly flavorless and again covered in charred. The cabbage was a prime player here, even overriding the onions and mayo. The soft shell seemed homemade and was pretty good, although it too broke quickly.

The Braised Pork was the best out of my three tacos, as well as having the most well composed plate. That said, I make better pork at home and the green chiles must have ran away with the green pepper and onion.

Nothing  tasted like it had been seasoned before, during or after it was cooked, the plates were hastily and sloppily composed and the flavors just didn't work. Despite cautions about the hot plates, none of my food came to the table hot; striking due to our long wait.

I hate to just outright bash the place, but this was one of the most disappointing meals I've eaten since I visited One Walnut for lunch three years ago.

I completely agree with Morgan that we should have got to Momocho."}
