{"text":"I must say I am AMAZED! They have the Beyond Burger (plant based). They also have whiting fish sandwiches (Oceanliner). Great food"}
{"text":"Now this is what I'm talking about! Not many places where you can get great food at good prices. And they have vegetarian dish too! Recommend highly. Good for meet and greet over coffee, lunch and dinner too. No more Starbucks! Safe and secure as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience and the meal I purchased. I was pleased to see whiting fish on the menu. It doesn't seem to be a popular choice in these parts.
The fish was fresh, tasty and the sandwich came with enough pieces for a second helping.

The restaurant serves a unique honey mustard sauce instead of tartar. I was pleasantly surprised. It was so good with the fish.

Bean pies are on the menu, however they didn't have any on my visit. The restaurant is conveniently down the road from my job, I'll pop back in soon for my pie.

The music playing was just my taste and the owner and staff were kind."}
