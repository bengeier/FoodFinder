{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times now for both their lunch and dinner buffet and the food is always fresh and delicious, both for the dinner and lunch buffets. I find that they are one of the cheapest, more affordable buffets in the area yet the food is even better than any other restaurant nearby. Great selection of meat and vegetable dishes, noodles, rice, seafood, salads and desserts so there is plenty to choose from no matter what your taste. Every single visit to this restaurant I have found the food freshly cooked, hot and steaming and the food is well maintained and replaced during the time the buffet is open. The staff are always very friendly and make you feel very welcome at their restaurant. The restaurant itself is clean, warm and cosy yet has a big area to the side so that larger events can be hosted easily. Dining here is always a pleasant experience and I cannot recommend them enough if you want an affordable and filling Chinese buffet that is delicious and great quality for the price."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch buffet which was about $12 per person.  Pros: Very cheap buffet.  Reasonable food choices.(salads, fruits, main dishes and desserts).  Cons: Although their dinner buffet is more expensive(about 15$) but the foods were almost the same (just some seafood added). Food was not super tasty but it was acceptable considering the price.  We might go again to this place for lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I am writing a review about this restaurant as the service that we received tonight was discusting and the worst we have ever had. When we arrived at the restaurant we were left to stand at the front door and the cashier did not even greet us or offer us to have a seat. Once we were sent to a table we did not receive any form of a drink until they brought us a glass of water at the end of our dinner. all of the food trays were empty and they were not replenishing them to serve the customers still in the restaurant.   And to top it off when I went to pay the bill I told the cashier about the bad service and asked to speak to a manager and she just laughed at me.  She thought it was amusing.  I do not reccomend this restaurant to anyone and they have lost my business and will be passing it along to everyone I know that the service was terrible.   My wife was looking forward to this dinner as it is her birthday today and she ending up feeling bad as she was the one who picked this restaurant for her birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Well, its affordable and...hmmm, that's about it. Nothing special and the food is average. Try not to look at the dirty air ducts right above the buffet, it'll throw you off."}
{"text":"Came here at 7pm on family day, 2 hours  before closing. Not only where there was barely any food left, they refused to refill the food and while that was maybe alright on a dead night, without any customers. People where still coming in, it isn't fair for people to pay full price when there is barely any food left to eat and when I confronted the owner, he said he's been checking the amount of food available but in reality he walked around and ignored the empty buffet. Not worth the money and the food wasn't all that great. Honestly spend your money somewhere else, it might be cheap here but it isn't all that great, you don't have to trust me just check the bathrooms and you can see how dirty it is ."}
{"text":"Fast yes and some of the food was even tasty. However how do you serve Cantonese Chow Mein and the noodles are rock hard and where isn't rock hard is burnt to a crisp?  There has got to be a better Chinese food place in the SE!"}
{"text":"Checked their hours,  and it says they're open from 11am - 10 pm.  Fine. We got there at 2pm go in and are informed that they will not put out any new food until after 4. Really? Why are you open then?? They need to either do their job or close if they don't want to. It's pretty simple. Also it wouldn't kill them to deep clean the place."}
{"text":"We started going to ND about 15 years ago and at that time the food was quite good and selection plentiful. Through the years the quality has diminished to the point that we will no longer return. Flavor is practically non existent, meats are chewy, soups are watery, rice dried out. The only consistent aspect is sizable selection but if the food is substandard then selection is a moot point. We are going elsewhere. Sad."}
{"text":"Wow! After reading the reviews for this place I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.   We stopped in for dinner and were very impressed by both the price and the food. It was very quiet and there were only a few tables other than us. The food was hot and fresh, it was not over salted like buffet food normally is, and there was a great selection. I do have the sneaking suspicion that they still add MSG to their food but I cannot confirm that.  The decor is quite outdated and the bathrooms are pretty creepy and dimly lit, but that's not what matters. The food was fantastic and I will definitely make this my regular buffet place."}
{"text":"had a few selection but rice and chicken wings are the best. overall salty and no ice cream for dessert."}
