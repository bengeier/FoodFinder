{"text":"Don't go. Just don't!!! There are so many better places in the area to spend your hard earned money. Some proprietors have pride. This one may have in the past but it is not reflected in the food. Gordon Ramsay, here is your Canadian Kitchen Nightmare!  Still thinking about it, well you should chew on this instead.  1. A roast beef dip sandwich should not be served on a hot dog bun. 2. Hamburgers should be juicy and flavorful, not dry enough to be a coaster.  3. Grilled chicken sandwiches on soft hamburger buns should be served at Wendy's or McDonald's not at a bar & grill. Oh, and the chicken should be edible. 4. Service should be friendly not offensive."}
{"text":"Terrible service on a good day, stupid beer prices.  $7.35 for a pint of domestic is nuts. This isn't downtown Toronto.  Lots of better places with better priced in the area!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now & I have to be honest with you.  I can't really complain about the service, my beer was never empty & the food is your stereotypical \"bar\" food.  But this place is more \"professional\" than \"friendly\".  The staff does NOT look like they want to be here, and they are just not having fun working here at all.  That attitude transfers to the table & it's not the server's fault, it's a by-product of the environment that either the management or the bartender is creating.  The blonde bartender is professional but not outgoing at all, & the staff here just feels tense & uptight.  It's not like I'd never come back or anything, but I'll definitely look for alternatives first on my next trip here."}
{"text":"We had lunch here last week and the food was good. I had the Cajun Chicken Sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised (given the grim reviews this place has received from others on Yelp). The fries were fine and everyone else's meal seemed to go gown easy.  The place was about 1/4 full and the service was average. The food came out fairly quickly and the orders were all correct (which always amazes me when you have a server who refuses to write down your orders).  The place could have been a little cleaner... the bathroom wasn't great.   Overall, this place was fine for lunch (although it appears to be more focused on it's evening bar business for the locals)."}
{"text":"Ranch sauce belongs on quite a few things. More than I can number quite honestly. It doesn't however belong on calamari. Ever! The flavors are all wrong, unfortunately at this suburban pub they had no idea. Not only was this calamari paired all wrong, but it was primarily a tasteless mess. For $14.00, value was not really an ideal here, between the three of us we had three beers, and the calamari, almost $50.00 later my visiting friend now thinks that Toronto has worse food than Calgary (travesty) and that it is exponentially more expensive.   I can't really give them an \"Eek. Methinks not!\" as there was nothing really terrible, everything was just mediocre, service, patio, etc. etc.  Bottom line...this place seemed good for middle aged mustachios, and freakish families, but less so for this city gal. Suburbia you can have your tasteless mush, I'm going downtown."}
{"text":"Extensive menu, with no standout items. Very pricy compared to the quality you receive. Some questionable ingredient combinations... I think Gordon Ramsey has the right idea, simplify the options and you'll have higher quality menu options. We were here as part of a group of 7 and had difficulty conversing and hearing each other across the table. The music was quite loud, and they were unable to turn it lower. We eventually moved to a quieter section near the pool tables to avoid shouting at each other for the remainder of the evening."}
{"text":"We had just flown in from Atlanta and were staying close to the Toronto airport and wanted to grab a good meal and a beer at about 9:30pm. The immediate vicinity of the hotel looked pretty desolate, but the Wild Goose Bar & Grill looked promising.  We were immediately impressed by the attentive, friendly staff and the cheery decor. We were also very pleased with the extensive menu that included veggie burgers, thai noodle bowls, pizza, vegetarian fajitas and other veg-friendly fare despite the fact that it was \"wing night\" and much of the traditional bar menu was targeted at meat eaters. The beer we had was quite nice (a nice amber ale from Creemore) and the food was better than we expected. We were also very pleased to discover that Wild Goose stayed open until 1:30am, so we had plenty of time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere.  In all, I can't imagine you could do much better in the airport area especially if the hour is late. If we're ever in this neighborhood again, we'll definitely come back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was close to our Hotel, so we checked it out one night.  Sign out front read, \"best wings\" so I ordered a dozen of their \"suicide\" wings.  When our apps and the rest of the food came out, I asked what kind of wings they were and the server said \"suicide.\"  Our beer was replenished and the food was bar quality, but the wings were not even close to average.  Having worked a fryer station at a younger age, I knew that the wings were double fried and after a couple wings, my nose didn't even run.  It was karioke night and their was a small crowd, seemed like a bunch of friendly locals.  If you are out on vacation and looking for new exciting places to eat, skip this place."}
{"text":"This is only place in Etobicoke I can think of that you can get a drink on Eglinton until you probably go all the way down to B Mall at Burnhamthorpe.  It's funny because it's still in Toronto (Etobicoke) being on the south west corner of Renforth and Eglinton but if you cross the street north you're in Mississauga.    This place is a place to get beer and drinks, not to eat.  If I'm judging it by being a bar it would get a 3.  If I were to rate it based on food it's probably a 1 but 2 would be generous.  Average it out and you get a 2 star rating this time.  Some food is passable at best.  Some of their happy hour specials are really tiny and the food overall isn't great like the \"happy hour wings\".  They are like 2 heavily battered wings, yes battered, not breaded  The best item is probably fries or nachos while everything else is sub par.  Wings are frozen, from Sysco who they blamed when this place was in the news for serving a chicken head instead of a chicken wing.    http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2010/09/13/15338131.html  Why do I know so much of this place if I don't' go here for the food?  I've been here about once a year every year for probably the past 6 years because it's where we meet up annually a bunch of friends... why here?  It's sort of neutral to our location I suppose would be the best answer.    It's an ok place to drink but just don't eat here if you can avoid it.  There's a McDonald's across the street on Commerce and Eglinton.  If you are truly looking for decent places to eat there are lots of chain type places where the hotels are on Dixon Rd or go to the mall at the north west corner of Eglinton and Dixie.  There's like 10 or more places  to eat just in that mall alone."}
{"text":"Have been coming here from time to time for 20 years and disappointed to see the steady deterioration of service and food quality. Stopped here for a business lunch today and had a Pad Thai. The shrimp was clearly off an inedible. When I mentioned this to the server (one of three that served us) she appeared indifferent and did nothing to appease nor did she apologize. I paid the bill and asked for a manager, who was sitting at the adjacent table and heard the whole interchange without feeling a need to speak to us. I informed him that we would not be returning and he seemed even more indifferent than the server. This plus the fact that they only serve one Canadian owned beer. I'm done with this place. Too bad, used to be a great place."}
{"text":"Lost its magic over the years..food use to be great here..the menu is massive.... Could really use a makeover..not much has changed since it opened years back I think the regulars at the bar are still the same"}
{"text":"I got a little nostalgic walking in here, knowing that my dad drank here 25 years ago.    Good little spot.  Went for after work drinks and food.  Normal pub grub -- but still delicious.    Right beside the go station -- so if you get too loaded to drive home -- you have a ride."}
{"text":"This sports bar is a tuck in a little plaza by Eglinton and Commerce blvd. My first impression was that it had great friendly staff and a huge space with loads of tv an pool table. It's great for a hangout or a group party. Unfortunately, the place felt empty due to it's size and lack of tables being filled. Not a great feeling, let's face it, it food taste better when you have to wait for a space just a little bit.  I've heard of people from work that they make a mean fish and chips meal. So why not get that right? That's exactly what I got!  It was a huge meal! Fairly reasonable price, wow! Will make this growing boy satisfied? Not really...the fish batter was bland and missing ingredient that gave it a slight kick. I was eating a tasteless fish, although the texture was great. I can give them that. The fries were fresh but can't grade a restaurant based on their side unfortunately.  I will recommend for other to try this restaurant but stay away from the fish and chips. The vibe is amazing and the food is priced well. The staff are great and was on point in terms if refilling our drinks."}
{"text":"It's seems like a cool bar. Some televisions, pretty big, alcohol and beer.  As for food, i just changed the rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. In fact the entree i got should be about 0. It was the Thai peanut chicken and honestly, it was yuck. But my coworkers ordered pizzas, and those were good. As the cook cooked the wrong pizzas, we had 2 extra pizzas that they gave us anyway (it was raining and they were not expecting a crowd i would think). So i think you should stick to the pizzas. The salads seemed really like bar salad, type of pre-prepared. But it's a nice decor and the pizzas are ok."}
{"text":"first and last time at this place. food was mediocre and over-priced. $17 for a dry philly cheese steak on a hot dog bun?!  only good thing was the quick service and clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Being pressed for time, my boyfriend and I decided to grab a quick bite from The Wild Goose this past week. The restaurant/bar is huge, the wait staff seemed pretty friendly and what we ordered was surprisingly better than what we had anticipated (Veal sandwich w/fries, and a mexican salad).   I found their menu to be very expansive and very pricey for bar food (a plate of 8 mozza sticks shouldn't cost $10.99)."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice in total and both of my experiences were average. Firstly I found the prices lil over pricey ( like calamari is $19). They do have good happy hour menu but the servers will try to sneak in full prices quoting I did not mention happy hour order - wth. Taste and quality of the food are overall average too. The owners seems to be very nice however I think they need to up their food quality and train servers not to cheat."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment a grand total of two times.   The first time, I was here with my colleagues for lunch. It was in August 2016. I drove my two co-op students and our manager over here. I remember doing a not-so-legal left turn. I told my students to not follow my example, which made them laugh.  We were a huge bunch then. There were twenty of us. We sat outside in the patio at one long table.  I had ordered a Diet Coke. I liked the lime wedge. I love lime with it.  I ordered a roast beef dip. I love a good beef dip. This one was okay. The beef was good. The dipping au jus was too salty for my liking. I left most of the fries on my plate. They weren't yummy.  Ever since that lunch, I haven't been back until recently.  My manager asked if I wanted to go out for appetizers and a drink after work. I was game. He suggested going here because apps were half price. I took a look at the menu and said yes.  What caught my eye on the menu was coconut shrimp. We ordered it, along with chicken quesadillas, Louisiana chicken wings, calamari, a Mill Street Organic beer (my boss), and a Creemore Springs beer (me).  Our server was helpful with recommendations. We originally wanted to get the taco pizza. She flat out said that it wasn't good and suggested getting the quesadilla. The difference is that the taco pizza does not have any meat. The quesadilla has chicken in it. Sold!  I loved the coconut shrimp. So good! The coconut is real and unsweetened. The dipping sauce screamed tropical. The chicken wings were good, spicy, and tasty. The calamari was perfect and not greasy. The chicken quesadilla was fine. I would have liked some guacamole. That's just me.  The beer was good. This visit changed my mind about this place. I'll come here for apps!  There are plenty of parking, especially after work.  (234)"}
{"text":"I am lost with words for this place. This is a bar - not a grill place. I came here two and on both occasions, this failed to impress me. My first visit I had a pasta (fail) and the second time I had the steak sandwich (miserably fail).   The food is adequately tasteless but the beer, I would assume, is the same beer you'll get. If you're a sports fan, there are TVs around the bar that plays different kind of sports. You will like it.   The location is ideal for those working in the far away land of Etobicoke .... you can come here, chill and go home when traffic has gone lighter.   Other than the location, I can't think of any other great things to say about this place. Maybe the beer? Dang, I don't drink."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews have been tough here. We had lunch there today and I have no complaints. The wrap was made with fresh ingredients, the sweet potato fries were hot and came with sauces. We had a party of 15 or so and the food arrived promptly and was correct. The staff were courteous and efficient. The place is cavernous with large screens for sports but we opted to sit on the patio which was also spacious.  On the whole it delivered what was promised. Unpretentious, uncomplicated, reasonably priced simple bar & grill type food. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming food for the price.  I had a \"Mexican\" salad.  Their idea of Mexican was a few sliced jalapenos, and a handful of crumbled chips.  If i hadn't been with a group of friends I would have returned it.  Second time I have been here, and second time not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is huge, and easy to find a seat, although they insist on seating you rather than finding your own place. Service is efficient and friendly, so can't complain about that at all.  The menu is extensive, almost too many options to choose from. It's amazing how much they cram on to two sides of paper. The food itself is ok, somewhat typical of what you would expect from a sports bar. Although for the life of me I can't understand why the \"Philadelphia Cheesesteak\" is served with sliced roast beef, and not actual steak. Fries are a little soggy, but not too salty, so ok in that respect.  Overall, I would come here again because of convenience to where I am, but wouldn't go out of my way to come here solely for a bite to eat."}
