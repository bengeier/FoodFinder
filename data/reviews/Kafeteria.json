{"text":"Brand new cafeteria-style restaurant in the Huntington (BP) Building. Prices are a little high but lots of options, most made-to-order, with fresh ingredients. Espresso, pizzas, burgers, salad bar, smoothies/juice bar, sushi, hot entrees, soups."}
{"text":"The food is good and prices very reasonable.  The service is a bit uneven.  I ordered a pizza the first visit.  As I waited with my tray, pizza was handed to the man ahead of me (also waiting with a tray) on a plate with a cheery, \"Thank you\".  Mine was handed to me in a box with a, \"Here you go, honey\".  The next time, my friend and I ordered baked potatoes at the same time, standing next to one another.  Her server offered her all kinds of toppings to choose from.  My server offered none and put on the toppings as described on that station's menu.  No problem with the food here.  It's quite good.    Service needs a bit of spiffing."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times before but came in at 2pm last Tuesday and have been meaning to review the place. It was by far the best loaded potato I've ever had, and probably in the top 50 meals of all time. Who knew a freaking Idaho potato could be such a knockout! The hot sauce they use is amazing and they aren't shy on the butter. The guy who served me was professional and fast. I even had a quick conversation with him about how Cleveland needs more pizza, while he was cooking for a few others. I had 30 minutes total to get in and out and it wasn't problem at all! This is my go to spot! I could care less about big time Cleveland food names but this made me want to check out Albatross. It's just so far away from everything."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time the other day. Lines were long so I opted for the green smoothie with kale, Arugala, spinach, cucumber, mint, banana. Very tasty, enjoyed the hint of mint.

Went a Second time yesterday - got the grilled cheese with tomato and basil and fries since it was a Friday and lent. Went around 1pm, lines were dying down. Zach was working the noodle line - I would definitely be interested in trying that next time.

Overall a very refreshing and enjoyable alternative and very reasonably
Priced as well compared to other restaurants, I.e the Market. Highly recommended - a little walk from my workplace but definitely will be hitting this place up much more during the spring and summer months."}
{"text":"I used to eat lunch here regularly, but went this past Wednesday (August 24, 2016) and was told by a security guard that it had been closed down for some reason. Too bad, the food there was really pretty good!"}
{"text":"A great addition to downtown lunch options.  The food is much better than what you can get elsewhere for the same price.  There are many options - freshly made pizza, sandwiches, pasta, salads, sushi and entrees.  The fries are unbeatable.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Kafeteria."}
{"text":"I will probably give this place another shot in the future, because it has been highly recommended to me, but my initial experience was sub-par.  The pad thai recipe is just off.  The sauce was way too acidic, and there was way too much of it.  No bean sprouts. Some of the shrimp were under-cooked.  I found that out the hard way (eating one), and checked the rest carefully; I found another one that was underdone.  I did eat everything but the under-cooked shrimp, because I was super hungry. I definitely wouldn't order this again.  I love pad thai, and I'm not usually super picky, but this was just not what pad thai should be.  The salad bar looked amazing though.  Next time I think I'll try that or the pizza."}
{"text":"I would be hard pressed to eat here again.  I am shocked that Zack attaches his name to this place because I like his restaurants.  If you look the bulk of the high reviews for this place they are from 2014, not new like this one.  We each ate from a different station.  My salad ingredients tasted like chemicals, and there was not one single organic ingredient to be found. Heinen's has a better salad bar.  Braised meat was dry and the green beans tasted off.  To boot, the trays were dirty, the tables had not been wiped down, and the chairs had crusted - on food.  Won't go back.  Needs a major overhaul."}
{"text":"Today was probably the 4th or 5th time I've been to Kafeteria and it has not disappointed me yet! My biggest problem with this place is that it's SO HARD for me to choose something to eat because it all looks and smells delicious! While I've had many of their menu items now, today's review is all about the soup, salad and greek yogurt parfait (wait...did I just say GREEK yogurt? Why yes, yes I did). 

OK let's start with the soup: I went into Kafeteria today knowing I wanted something WARM and this soup definitely hit the spot. I had the Southwestern Chicken soup, made with fresh tomatoes, black beans, shredded chicken and a mix of a bunch of yummy spices. I topped my cup with a little bit of the freshly grated cheddar cheese and grabbed some oyster crackers on the side. This soup was delicious with just the right amount of kick to call it a Southwestern soup. 

I was going to grab one of the premade side salads from the cooler but opted to make my own instead. I may not have said this before but Kafeteria is a great spot for carnivores, vegetarians, vegans or whatever else your little heart (and tummy) desires. Today I opted to fill my salad container with spring greens, shredded carrots, marinated mushrooms, quinoa salad, red potato salad and sunflower seed kernels. 

OK now let's talk about the most amazing thing I had there today: the Greek yogurt parfait. I know it sounds odd to have that be my favorite thing, but if you've ever had a too-sweet, nasty, chemical-tasting parfait from anywhere else (ahem...McDonald's) then you can appreciate the creamy amazingness that is this parfait. It's hard to go wrong when it's made of natural whole ingredients like: molasses, oats, dried cherries, fresh raspberries and blueberries, vanilla and honey. Like seriously? I wish I had the patience to recreate this for myself every day. 

The ingredients at Kafeteria are so fresh that it's hard to go wrong.  
Though these three items above are only what I had today, I also strongly recommend the freshly-made sushi (omg...the Dragon Roll...heaven) and the hot sides. I have yet to try the noodle bowls, smoothies, grille or pizza, but rest assured...I will. :)"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it sounds like, a cafeteria, but minus the mystery meat. It is another Zack Bruell masterpiece of a restaurant. If you have ever been to a Bruell restaurant, expect all the great flavors and fresh, wholesome ingredients within the $8-15 price range. The first time I went the lines were pretty long so I opted for the selections in the grab & go cooler. Even the PB&J was fancy as it was topped with banana mousse! I might ask for just a cup of that next time... Definitely go for an early or later lunch to avoid the lines. The friends I was with tried the pasta station and thanked me after for taking them here. Hoping to try the breakfast menu next, but so far I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great food. A lot of options for being gluten-free and vegetarian. The people working there are extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Kafeteria is just that. A cafeteria style lunch spot where you grab a tray then make your way to one of the several stations. They have pizza, grilled items, sandwiches, you name it. I usually opt for the sushi or salad bar. They also have a great juice bar, the green smoothie is deeeelicious. They have a pretty expansive seating area, but I usually take mine to go.  It can be a little pricey for lunch, depending on what you get, but I'll pay the extra if I don't have to leave my building!"}
{"text":"Tucked away up 3 escalators in the BP building, Kafeteria is unassuming and delish. As the name implies, it's cafeteria style, if your cafeteria has the talented Zack Bruell as your chef.

There are several stations to chose from: entrees, pizza, noodles, smoothies, salads...

I enjoyed the BBQ chicken and veggies, and let me tell you, tasted exactly like my Aunt made when I was growing up. (She was lifetime chef in NOLA and Atlantic City.) The chicken was so tender and juicy with a perfectly balanced sauce. I've tried for years to have BBQ that good. I almost went back a second day to have it again. 

My coworkers had bratwurst, a smoothie, and meatloaf. They were also pleased with their choices as evidenced by the complete silence except for the sounds of meals being devoured.

I do wish they would add a longer counter to set tray down while waiting in line to pay. It got a teeny bit heavy and I also didn't have any hands free to get my money ready. But really, that's my only complaint and it's not even a complaint, it's a nit pick. It's certainly not affecting my choice to return to Kafe often for lunch (oh btw, it's lunch only.)"}
{"text":"I made a salad at the great salad bar. Items like roasted beets, wheatberries, lentils, tofu, and so much more along with the usual offerings. Note that I didn't care for their tofu, but everything else was great. They also have a wide selection of other dishes, including noodles, pizza, BBQ. My friend had some amazing Mac n cheese. Great place to go with a group if you can't agree on a type of food for lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Kafeteria.   I am a huge fan of anything Zack Bruell, so I've been anxious to try this place.   I work downtown and always looking for something different.   I had visited the previous place (located in the same space), prior to its closure.  I met a former co-worker for lunch.  She opted for the noodle station, I migrated to the salad bar.   The salad bar has 2 sides, with the same ingredients.  There is an option for take-out container or bowl for eat-in.  There were 3-4 different types of lettuce, to include spring mix and spinach.  There were also loads of fresh veggie/protein options.  The standard such as cucumbers, tomatoes, cheddar cheese etc., but there were also some nice additions such as feta cheese, marinated mushrooms, roasted zucchini, diced roasted chicken etc.  There were also a number of pre-made salad options made with wheatberries, quinoa and chickpeas.   The salad bar is priced at $7.99 per pound..  I had a nice, filling salad with a yummy lemon herb dressing for just over $7.00.   There were a number of different stations to choose from in addition to the salad bar and noodle stands.  There was a grill, juice bar, soup bar and sushi stand.   All in all this was very good, not somewhere that I could eat everyday....gets a bit pricey, but nice place with fresh options."}
{"text":"Had the fresh mixed berry smoothie and Thai coconut curry. Both were really good. I'd probably go back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Yesterday, Mr. Bruell himself made my meal. Coming from the tower across the street, with our awful Sodexo cafeteria, this is a wonderful treat. They have an awesome choice of salad bar options and their dressing are so good. The sushi taste just like parallax. I had pad thai yesterday that was super fresh and tastey. Granted the meals are around 8-9 dollars. However, I spend that much at Sodexo for pre-boxed Sysco food. This place is fresh, made in front of you, with very good ingredients. Give it a try if you are interested in Kafateria style food :)"}
{"text":"It's a cafeteria that's true. And in that it's quite good. As I was standing in line I asked a local what was good from the noodle bar and they told me the Pad Thai was consistent. I tried it and was not disappointed. Made to order with lots of veggies and little protein, I did not mind this mix. The sauces were flavorful too. For around $10, this is a good value for a downtown Cleveland meal. 

The only downside of Kafeteria is that there are birds that fly around in the atrium of the building (huge open space). They tend to be a bit of a pesky nuisance - as sparrows sometimes are."}
{"text":"I used to love Kafeteria but, like all of his restaurants (except L'Albatros), Bruell let this one slide down the drain as soon as he turned his attention to other ventures.  If he ever learned how to hire a quality manager, the guy could go far...
On my most recent visit (5/20/16), the salad bar was stocked with rotten lettuce.  The toppings, which used to be uniquely seasoned and carefully prepared, were thrown together.  For instance, the beets, which used to be seasoned with citrus zest and an amazing, light dressing, were just unseasoned, roasted beets.  And the salad bar looked like it had been mobbed.  This was despite the fact that I had come in early at 11:40, to grab my salad before the lunch rush.  The whole place also smelled very strongly of old food.  I recommend people eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"been coming here a year plus, averaging 4 times a month. I have yet to be disappointed with the high quality of the food and the pleasant people working there. Always a smile. 

I don't understand people that say they love it, but only give 4 stars... this isn't Noma. This is a great cafeteria putting out fast, consistent and solidly performing food for a lunch time office crowd. 

Best Sushi downtown... period. (I wish they would do more daily specials)
Perfect and non-boring Salad Bar w great choices of house made dressings. (and the weigh charge doesn't include the weight of the dressing if you put it on the side!)
Braised items are home cooked goodness.

Nice dinning space overlooking the atrium or walk to the Public Square side for an exceptional view of the Soldiers & Sailors Monument. I like to take my food across the street to the Eastman Reading Garden or Mall C for a real Cleveland experience for lunch."}
{"text":"Is there anything that Zack Bruell can't do? Kafeteria is definitely a cut above your typical corporate watering hole. My first visit was shortly after opening, so there were some missteps which I will chalk up to being new. Missing barbecue sauce, slightly overdone falafel, a little too much oil in the pad Thai. Nothing that can't be ironed out. Its strength lies in its variety of appealing choices (including good vegetarian options) at reasonable prices. This will be in my lunch rotation for sure, and I look forward to seeing it get better."}
{"text":"Seats outside the food court area were nearly full when we arrived at 12:30, but the lunch crowd thinned out by the time we got our food and sat down. 

I enjoyed the sushi station, and the two guys behind the counter were plenty funny and pleasant to make the wait for my roll go quickly. Also enjoyed watching the lady at the juice bar make my Kafeteria Blend juice (kale, cucumber, carrot and apple) and man oh man do they throw some serious chunks of fruit and veggies in there right before your eyes! 

Zack Bruell himself was serving people at one of the stations with a nice big smile! 

Juice was $5 and sushi was like $9...a little pricey for a regular lunch though, so won't be a daily thing for me but more of a nice little treat!"}
{"text":"This place is basically a big cafeteria with tons of options. The sushi looked amazing and they had a grill and pizza section. I got a salad from the huge salad bar which is 7.99 per pound I believe and I got a 12oz cup of soup for 5$ (??). The soup was way to expensive. But the salad bar is definitely worth it. I'll be back to check out the other options too and I'd love to come here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love the bianco pizza, sushi, green smoothie, and meatloaf w/mashed potatoes & brussel sprouts. Salad bar is cool, though I'd prefer additional veggie options to things like wheatberry salad.  For dessert, the mini cheesecake or rice crispy treat with rosemary are both fantastic. In a hurry? Grab a pork bahn mi from the case- they're great, and so is the bread it's served on!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and scoped out all the offerings.  There are many options to choose from, several of which are made as you wait.  I chose to order a tofu and veggie noodle dish from the booth aptly named, \"Noodles\".  The cook tossed some veggies and tofu in a hot pan and began sauteeing them.  He asked if I wanted them spicy and I said \"Yes\".  He put some noodles on a plate and poured the contents of the pan over them.  When he handed me the plate, it looked tasty and hot.  I grabbed a bottle of water and paid $11.25, which I found to be pricey.

When I tried a bite of the noodles, I couldn't get my fork through them.  For a moment, I was bewildered.  I thought, \"why can't I penetrate this noodle fortress?\"  Well, it's because they were hard and stuck together.  I had to use a knife to cut through them and it still wasn't easy to separate them.  I guess this is how the dish is served, but I prefer my noodles cooked, hot, and soft, which these were not.  The noodles were crunchy, but there was no indication of this on the menu that I recall.  Anyway, it was tasty, but I won't order them again.  There are many other options that I would like to try some day, if i feel like parting with 30% more money than usual for lunch."}
{"text":"This isn't my first rodeo with lunch at the Kafeteria but today I ate there for lunch so I figured I would review. Kafeteria is the creation of the great Cleveland Chef Zack Bruell which has a cafeteria style operation with higher quality foods. It's great that you have variety of choices from pizza, sushi, sandwiches, noodles and a juice bar. They also have a HUGE salad bar and also serve breakfast in the 200 Public Square building, which I work in.
 
The food is a nice sight to see and the familiar faces of the staff that work there make for a nice lunch. I don't frequent it often as there are cheaper options downtown for lunch but is nice to have something right in my building. The food for me has been hit or miss but it has all been very fresh from my experience. I enjoyed the breakfast sandwich I have had along with the pizza and quesadilla from the sandwich station. I wasn't a huge fan of the noodles when I went.
 
Today's option for me was the Za'atar Chicken Pita with french fries. The pita is stuffed with seasoned chicken (flavored well), pickled onions (not my favorite but they accompany the wrap well, with the crunch), herb feta (nice touch, could have used more) and spicy cucumber dill yogurt (tasty, not spicy in my opinion), no roasted tomatoes for me. The sandwich overall is very tasty but mine was a bit soggy. I wish the cook would have put the pita on the grill a tad longer. The fries are awesome and crunchy. I recommend dipping them in the parmesan ranch dressing from the salad bar (so good!).
 
Kafeteria is a good staple for the building and for the lunch crowd in downtown Cleveland. Yes, there are cheaper and better options downtown but this is a place I would recommend. With how many options, there is bound to be something that suits everyone. I look forward to trying the sushi or the juice bar on my next visit."}
{"text":"It took a few visits for me to warm up to it, but now I'm loving lunch at Kafeteria. It's definitely a much better experience if you go at 1 p.m. instead of noon, so that the lines are shorter and there is more available seating. 

While I have not yet opted for a salad, I LOVE that the salad bar offers big bowls instead of little plates. 

The sushi is surprisingly and ridiculously delicious. Fresh lettuce is one of my favorite sushi roll ingredients, and there was lots of lettuce in the Caterpillar roll. Awesome.

I've had the balsamic Brussels sprouts a couple times - so delicious!

The only things I've tried that I didn't care for were the mashed potatoes (maybe it had truffle oil?) and the falafel was just okay. 

It is a great option for group lunches."}
{"text":"Though I only ever have time to make it over to Kafeteria for breakfast, I haven't been disappointed yet. Their blueberry orange muffin is perfection and they have a fresh squeezed juice bar, which is unbeatable. 
The breakfast options are all on the same level as your average pastry shop or smoothie place and it's a perfect grab-and-go spot."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go so far as to say Kafeteria is a glorified cafeteria, but the food sure is above the standard of any cafeteria I've eaten in whether it be in high school, college, or at a museum somewhere. 

The structure of this place reminded me of The Market Cafe on E 9th St. if you are familiar with that establishment. The point is that there is something to meet most all tastes so it's a great place to go with a group of picky eaters. Not only can you mix and match sides, but there are various stations to choose from whether you want soup, salad, a juice bar item, pasta, pizza or a grilled or braised item. 

Choose one or more stations to get your food and then pay just once on the way out. There's also a beverage cooler - but there is free water hiding nearby so look out for that. 

I tried something from the Braised station: Rosemary Thyme Meatloaf with a sherry tomato sauce. For my sides I chose the roasted red skin potatoes and garlic green beans. The portion size was satisfactory. The flavor of the meatloaf, especially the sauce, was really good, and the green beans were cooked just right. 

As the cafeteria experiences usually goes, this is a self-service place, but the set up was very structured from signage leading you upstairs, through to the payment process, seating and tray/plate disposal area. 

A neat spot for a fast lunch with options to please most. Also open for breakfast. Weekdays only. Closes at 3p."}
{"text":"I used to work in this building and really enjoyed eating here. It's pricey but it's also downtown. They offer breakfast which I would get. Scrambled eggs, meat, fried potatoes. At lunch they have really good bbq chicken but only a leg, I prefer other pieces of chicken. They also have a good fresh sushi bar. You can have pizza, salad bar, juice bar, burger/fry station noodle station and a cooler with pre made sandwiches, salads and snacks."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, reasonable prices, delicious lunch options! I can't even choose a favorite - I always switch it up. The salad bar or pre-made salads provide great healthy options with super tasty dressings like champagne vinaigrette and balsamic. If I'm in the mood for a heartier meal, the grill has numerous sandwich options with awesome hand cut fries. The pasta bar offers items like pad Thai and green curry coconut noodles (Mmm!). There's also soup, pizza, sushi, other entrees, and fresh juices and smoothies. Each section typically has a daily special as well. Everyone will find something they like and you can be in and out quickly, which is often a must during a busy work day."}
{"text":"I don't know what's yummier the men that eat here on their lunch breaks or the salad dressing. Either way, I enjoy coming here and is the highlight of my long work day. Food is great, the atmosphere is professional, eating area is clean and very sanitary with no cross contamination at the salad bar. I wish I could give more stars."}
{"text":"Exactly as my rating, I thought it was just okay. Now I will say, the omelet I ordered was pretty good. It's funny how I automatically have to grab salt and pepper but I got a taste first and didn't even need it...seasoned perfectly!  I wanted to get a fruit smoothie and for some reason I can no longer eat bananas (don't know why, for some unknown reason I just can't eat bananas anymore-maybe an allergy or sudden intolerance) so I asked the lady if I can get one without bananas (no trace of it) and she said that the smoothies are prepackaged...basically \"no smoothie for you\" lol. 

The employees are pretty much in their own thing, kind of not in the mood to be friendly and/or talk or even crack a smile."}
{"text":"Didn't really care for my first experience here. The entrees are way overpriced in my opinion, and the dishes aren't creative or unique in any way to justify the price. You do have a lot of options and it's great that you can grab lunch relatively quickly, but the service was subpar. Again, why am I paying such high prices to carry my own tray and be served by a snotty girl at the counter. Another reviewer mentioned she noticed disparate treatment from the workers here and I definitely experienced this as well... I suppose they just treat the regulars a little better. I will mention that I love the seating area and would definitely come here just to enjoy the atrium, not necessarily for the restaurant itself. The food was okay, I won't go into details, but again nothing special. I might come here again if I was in the area and needed something quick, but I certainly won't be rushing back."}
