{"text":"This Bojangles is a fucking joke. The dine in line is always backed up to the door and the drive thru line wrapped around the building. There is usually at least 7 employees working behind the counter every time I go in there and you will still be in that line for 20 damn minutes. When you finally do get your food, if you haven't walked out by then, your food will be wrong 80% of the time, tables are fucking disgusting, and there is always someone sitting in the dining room on a laptop in a Bojangles shirt doing what I'm assuming is a job orientation to be hired. They need to just get rid of the whole crew and start over because incompetent is an understatement with this cast of characters working there. By the the way I've written this entire Yelp review while being blocked in by the ridiculous drive thru.    *update 9/8/17*  This Bojangles hasn't gotten any better since I originally posted. Just went through the drive thru and ordered 2 Bo Berry biscuits that you could throw and knock someone out with. Went back through a 2nd time and ordered 4 cinnamon biscuits and these were actually fresh except I was charged for 4 and only got 2 biscuits. This place needs serious help because everything from my earlier review still hasn't gotten better along with this new update."}
{"text":"2 words for you..... BoBerry Biscuit   OMG are these things the bomb! Soft, flaky, proper southern biscuits w/ lots of blueberries baked right in 'em & drizzled w/ tons of icing   I had to wait a full 5 min for them to come out of the oven - as if that would be any kind of sacrifice! But how nice of them to ask me if that was okay as I was placing my order   Hot, *super* soft, fresh-out-of-the-oven biscuits?? Are you even kidding me?!   And if you're torn between the Cinnamon or the BoBerry, do what I do & just come 2 days so you can enjoy both.....   ...... cause I sure plan to be back tomorrow for the Cinnamon Biscuits!"}
{"text":"Oh Bojangles, your Bo Berry biscuits sing a siren song to me every day I pass by you yet I only indulge every now and then. If you're cold and passing by, step into the Bo, this place is like a sweat box and will keep you warm for a few minutes. Bo Rounds are my choice of hangover food and while there is always a line, sometimes you get lucky when you can step right up and order. And you gotta love their world famous ice tea which I can slurp down in a few sips and sometimes I get saucy and make an Arnold Palmer concoction. Their hours confuse me though, they close around 5P on week nights yet open on the weekend so I think if they stayed open later, they would definitely get some after hours business. Even though their commercials are way  \"interesting\"  (meaning that I think their marketing exec is on crack after seeing some of the ads that come out with) I always come back to Bojangles. When I need a finger licking fix or something to soak up the fun I had the night before-this is my place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location often. It used to be hit or miss but they seem to be getting better. The \"morning rush\" as I call it.. I was waiting a good 20 minutes inside or outside of the restaurant in the drive thru. However, I've always received quality customer service and being that it was always so crowded, my food was always hot."}
{"text":"Great Biscuit & Decent Chicken For the Price.  I ate here every morning prior to going to work & I would order their biscuit breakfast.  I tried their ham & cheese; bacon, egg & cheese & their cajun filet biscuit.  All three were just okay.  The biscuit is very soft & flaky, but with an extra layer of grease!    I even tried their dinner menu (leg & thigh) & the chicken could have been more flavorful & less oily.  I'm not sure if there were more than one variety of chicken, but the one we got was their original.   I must say, the chicken was pretty crunchy & crisp.  I had it w/a side of dirty rice, which i really like and a large mash potato & gravy...nothing spectacular.  For some reason this place really reminded me of Popeyes, but maybe its because they have the same theme colors.       Overall, decent chicken, but perhaps I'm being too harsh on it because i had chicken from Price's Chicken Coop & that place has delicious chicken!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to see the woman manager with big white stud earrings do something disgusting! Visit date, July 29th 2017, 11am. She dropped a potato round in the front heated serving display, which was clearly nasty and no food goes in that section of the heated display area. She picks the potato round out with the tongs, places it on the board as to throw it out, and then when she thought that no one was looking, she put it back into the fresh pan of potato rounds.  I am APPALLED that a manager OR even a worker would do that.  I guess she didn't go for her safe serve class.  SMDH.  NASTY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hello Friends,   This BoBo's (Bo'Jangles) is located in the Old Ivey building, beside (Qdoba). This is a carry out only location. Very hot on the inside. The place is so small you really can't comment on much. But, this is where I come for my greasy biscuit fix. They have specials that a lot of other BoBo's don't have. Go try em out."}
{"text":"I went to the drive through and waited, and waited and waited.  I watched 2 cars leave.  It was not Sunday after church.  It was mid day... I continued to wait.  Finally,  Me:       I would  like a two piece dinner, legs with Them:  I'm sorry we don't have any chicken. Me.      Excuse me. Them:  we don't have any chicken.  We have steak biscuits or a pork biscuit.  I drove away  This is the 3rd time this has happened in the last 2 months.  There must be new staff because this particular drive through used to be spot on.  Someone needs to tell them:  1.  This is fast food, and 2.  You are a chicken restaurant and should have some when it's ordered  When they do have chicken, it is delicious"}
{"text":"I always enjoy it when everything is fresh. The iced tea is good. The Boberry biscuits are a must have."}
{"text":"This Bo's is always busy. It happens to be at one of the busiest Gastonia intersections. That makes it hard to get in and out of.  If you go thru the drive thru...prepare to wait."}
