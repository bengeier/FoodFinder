{"text":"Awesome food, great bartenders, and affordable drinks. I'll most likely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Pool tables.  Affordable grub.  I'm afraid of giving this bar too good of a review, because before you know it, too many glowing yelp reviews might lead to Alan Glazen buying this place and turn it into another hipster joint, adding PORK BELLY to the grilled cheese and jacking the price up 8 bucks."}
{"text":"Dive bar with cheap drinks and great, greasy food. $10.50 plus tip for a burger & fries with 3 cans of PBR.....delicious. Bar tender/cook was very friendly too."}
{"text":"B and G is a total dive bar, my favorite bar in Ohio City. Love their chicken wings, their food is good and extremely affordable. If you are looking for a more hole in the wall type of bar this is the place for you."}
{"text":"B and G is nice place to drink for a low price. There is a Spuds MacKenzie glowing statue at one end of the bar. I recommend coming here."}
