{"text":"I'm trying to think of something positive to say about Toppers but I really can't. We tried it after getting their flyer in the mail and I can't even say it was 'ok'. We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza and their parmesan garlic boneless wings. Both were just ehh.. neither items were even hot when we got them and the flavor was just bland. The wings looked as if they had been sitting for awhile. I had high hopes because their flyer and website really got my interest and I was hoping to like it.Totally not worth it and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pizza was terrible, made me sick. 
I was staying at a nearby hotel and asked the front desk for a recommendation for dinner to be delivered. They suggested Toppers and a Chinese food place. I decided I was in the mood for pizza and ordered mushroom and olives. Pizza tasted good, I ate a few slices.

Not even three hours later I was throwing up my whole meal. It was awful, something in or on the pizza was bad. Ugh. First time I've used this chain and the last."}
{"text":"I ordered three pizzas and a dipping sauce. After waiting 40 minutes my pizza arrived semi warm. I opened it and discovered instead of the mac and cheese pizza I had a pizza covered in hot sauce and chicken. Also.. no dipping sauce. No big deal. I call the store to sort it out. I explained what happened to The gentleman who Answered and he replied with \"ok\" then said nothing. I had to say hello to make sure he was still there. He then said um yeah hold on. After holding another gentleman answered. He told me they had gotten a ton of orders for different things so they got mixed up....? Ok fine. 25 minutes later he shows up with my correct pizza and sauce. Now our other pizza is cold. Overall taste of the food was bad. The mac and cheese pizza we were able to eat fresh was decent, but the rest is in our trash. Will never be ordered from toppers again."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza twice and it's been really good both times. I gave 4 stars because of inconsistency. I ordered the same pizza both visits and it was outstanding the first time, and just pretty good the second. Not complaining, just missing the flavor explosion of the first visit! Overall, I'm loving the unique pizza options. Great place for late night eats!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza for delivery and take out, easily better than more popular brands.  Crust and pizza sauce are awesome, and there are more than enough toppings to keep everyone happy.  Toppers unique version of cheese bread and wings are great sides or alternatives.  Very friendly and helpful customer service.  My family loves it!"}
{"text":"Great customer service is not what I usually expect when I visit a pizza place but that is exactly what I got when I walked in there for the first time. I wish I remembered the name of the gentleman at the counter. He was very courteous and helpful. Something extremely rare to find on most pizza chain restaurants. They have a very reasonably priced lunch combo for around seven dollars which includes a personal pizza and a drink. It was plenty of food. I really like their pepperoni and overall the pizza was great. Will definitely be back to try some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in Toppers.  We've had it a few times and liked it.  The sauces tasted a little weird, but besides that everything was good.  Last night we ordered 2 pizzas and stix online for delivery.  We got a call about 30 minutes after we ordered with a man asking if the pizza was delivered yet.  We said no and it was hard to understand him, but he ensured us that our pizza would be delivered.  1.5 hours after we ordered, our pizza still hadn't come. We called back and told them our pizza hadn't come yet. The man said they were closed... So we never got our pizza. Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I love toppers! It's cheap and good pizza! My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza, but their cheesy bread is easily the best thing on the menu (get it with asiago omg). Delivery and takeout, it's fresh either way."}
{"text":"I ordered online two pizzas. One meat and one supreme. It said it was gonna be ready in about 15 mins. I got there right at about 15 mins and the girl at the front station helped me with my order. She kept mumbling and I couldn't understand what she was asking and I kept saying \"Excuse me?\". I finally understood she was asking if I paid already. I told her no. She made a comment about how she thought I was trying to scam her. She was dead serious. No smirk or joke. 
 
I picked up the pizzas and went to the car and checked it. The meat pizza was correct. The supreme was not. It only had meat on it so it was missing peppers, onions and mushrooms. I went back in and there was another girl at the front. I told her about the pizza. She didn't say sorry but she did say the pizza would be ready in about 8 minutes. I said that was fine and sat down. Right when that happened my husband walked in and I told him about the wait. So we waited together. My husband was standing and that same girl went up to him and handed him the pizza that was made incorrectly and told him he can keep it since it was an error. At that very moment, the girl that originally helped me walked up and snatched the pizza from my husband's hand and said \"No, because I'm going to eat this!\" and walked to the back. It didn't matter if we kept the pizza or not but really? We finally got our pizzas and went home. They weren't even that great. 

Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte for pickup & delivery!  Dough made fresh daily.  Very fast delivery by friendly and courteous drivers.  I give \"Toppers\" my highest recommendation for quality, unique selection of pizza's & the Toppers Stix are delicious.  It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Poor Service! We waited for 30 mins when they said 10! Two other people were also waiting as well, one for 40 minutes and they hadn't even start making it. His order. The employees were not organized nor did they have any customers. We will never be back!"}
