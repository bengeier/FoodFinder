{"text":"I've been getting flyers for Big Guy's for quite sometime now. I've been wanting to try them, but their prices are a little bit higher than other places we go to for pizza (ie. - Amili's). However, after getting so much praise from Lizzie D., we decided to order from them one night. I'm so happy we did!

We've ordered from them twice and both times the food has been awesome. Their pizza is huge and reminds me of Chicago deep dish. The cheese and sauce go perfectly together. The wings are great. Not to dainty and they definitely aren't cheap when it comes to the sauce. We've also had two hoagies from them. My favorite was their \"Pittsburgh Hoagie.\" It was very much like a Priminati's sandwhich but waaaaay bigger. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. It's on the pricey side ringing in at $10, but it's well worth it for the amount of food you get. 

The only negative, aside from their pricing (look for coupons, though!), is service. I don't know if it's because they're always super busy or what, but every time I call I'm put on hold for three to four minutes. Everybody is also friendly, however maybe they should put more people on the clock to just take orders rather than having customers wait on the phone. There's times the phone even rings busy! 

Even with the phone issue, Big Guy's is a great local pizza place and I know we'll be ordering from here more often!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see they had nachos and delivered to me since I was craving them.  The grilled chicken reminded me of those Tyson chicken strips you throw in a microwave.  They tasted like them and had the grill marks like them.  I had to take a ton of the lettuce off and the tomatoes and onions where big chunks not pico de gallo that I am used to at all.  There's a little bit of cheese on the nachos underneath all the lettuce.  They should think about putting the cheese in a cup like they do with the sour cream so the nachos don't get soggy.

I also got a chicken gyro and again so much lettuce.  Barely any sauce on it so it was dry.  The meat really didn't have a gyro flavor."}
{"text":"Big Guy's Pizza & Pasta is small restaurant that carries numerous dishes from pasta, calzones, and salads to wings, hoagies and pizza. I just recently ordered the caprese salad now that I'm trying to implement healthier choices into my diet and it really packs a lot of punch for how natural it is! Big, juicy, thick sliced tomatoes with fresh mozzarella packed in 2 rows of 4 slices (tomato/mozzarella) and a ton of basil and some drizzled olive oil will leave your ferocious appetite satisfied without pounding down carbs. I would recommend this dish to the health conscious and not health conscious alike! It is great! I've ordered the Sicilian white pizza and it is absolutely phenomenal! It was a really fresh tasting pizza, minus the pounds of grease on traditional pizzas. Garlic butter sauce, Romano cheese and marinated tomatoes? Yes please! So good. Now, onto ... their bread \"sticks\" ... mm mm mm! They are these breaded, braided little sticks made of magic. Obviously, I am a foodie and get excited about foods that are awesome and these breadsticks are all of that and more! And the price! $3.99!? I'll take it! The marinara dipping sauce is good. I have ordered the cheese sticks and they weren't as good as the regular sticks. They were the regular sticks with some cheese thrown on top, they weren't baked into the stick. Their traditional pizzas are pretty good (My family is obsessed) but sometimes it can be a little salty for me. Overall, this is a great place to get your appetite and palette satiated!"}
