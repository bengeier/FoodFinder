{"text":"We had our first meal here and it was definitely worth the trip. We have been driving by this place for months in anticipation of it opening. We ordered traditional dishes that we enjoy at other Thai restaurants and Kanlalya easily climbed to the top of our Thai list. Looking forward to trying many other meals here."}
{"text":"I am very excited to have a Thai restaurant not far from home. The beef salad is good but not the best I have had. All the dishes I have had here were very good but portions are a little small although I have never left hungry. I'm just used to getting larger portions at other Thai restaurants for better prices. However I will be back, the food and service are good."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area!  Delicious food! Friendly and attentive service!  Will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today for lunch and it greatly exceeded my expectations.    I was a little worried going in because they have yet to remove the Uptown Diner sign outside (despite apparently being open for weeks) but the decor inside is updated and on par with other suburban Thai places I've visited.    I ordered the chicken pad thai and it was excellent.  The portion was generous and it contained a fair amount of chicken.  It was served with fresh sprouts, carrots and shredded cabbage, which was a nice touch.  I asked for medium spice and it contained the perfect amount of heat.  The customary spring roll appetizer was crisp and it's dipping sauce was really flavorful (unlike many others I've tried around town).    I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This new place has potential.  Pad thai was good.  Asked for spicy and we got it!  Nice!!  Waiter was great.  The only reason 4 stars wasn't given...  If you ask for shrimp pad thai - you should get more than 3 shrimp in your \"SHRIMP\" pad thai.  Buddy that was with me got 4 shrimp in his - lucky bastard!  It would be good to remove the tails from the shrimp too.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING here. The staff is super friendly. Happy there's a good Thai restaurant around me now. I had the seafood red curry fried rice and it was pretty good. The tum yum soup is great as well. If you're not sure what to get pad thai would be the best option."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great menu! I enjoyed the Chicken Pad Thai....you can order it spicy if you like( on a scale of 1-4) I went for 3 on the spicy scale and it was perfect for my taste. The balance of sauces in this dish was spot on. Happy to have Thai food in the area and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today.  We have not had Thai food as good as this since visiting NYC.  Nice young man helped us navigate the menu.  We had a sample of crispy wonton for app along with cup of Tom Kha for myself and fresh spring roll for my husband.  We both had seafood drunken noodle for entrees and green tea.  Everything was superb.  Will be back and telling friends about this new place."}
{"text":"Great pleasant staff. Will accommodate custom orders. Thai food superb  I have tried several different selections, all great. Menu diverse and prepared to order."}
{"text":"Wow.   Ordered take out from here 2 weeks ago and it was awesome.   Dined in 1 week ago and again was great.   Unfortunately stopped in last Friday and was really disappointed.   The fresh spring rolls we got 2 weeks ago had changed completely.    Looked like they took Giant Eagle salad bag to use inside and a piece of tasteless chicken on the bottom.    One of our party had a hair in his food.   They were nice enough to replace the meal but no concern.    When asked about our experience I explained my disappointment.   Response was 'Hopefully next time you come it will be better experience'.    Sorry, first 2 experiences were awesome.   What could have possibly gone wrong so quickly.   Like a completely different place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, and you definitely need to check it out!  My family and I have been waiting for this restaurant to open for quite some time now, and we were not disappointed!  I went with my family for dinner late on a Friday night (around 8pm), so it was not too busy.  We ordered the Veggie Crispy Spring Rolls ($4.95), Shrimp Fresh Rolls ($5.95), and Shrimp Cheese ($5.95) appetizers to try out.  They were all very delicious - fresh, flavorful, and piping hot (except for the Fresh Rolls, which are served at room temperature).  You can customize the amount of heat you would like in your food.  Their spice scale goes from 1 to 4.  I'm not one for spicy food, but the rest of my family enjoys it.  They tried out levels 2 and 3 in different dishes and found that 3 was very spicy but 2 was just right.  We also ordered the Tom Kha soup ($4.95).  Now, let me tell you, my family and I have developed an obsession for Tom Kha soup.  We've been on the hunt for a delicious bowl of the stuff close to home, and this hit the spot!  The coconut broth was AMAZING - very flavorful!  I had mine with tofu, which was very soft and well-prepared.  Be sure to try a bowl of this soup when you visit!  You won't regret it!  For the entrees, I had the Pad Thai with chicken ($12.95).  It came out very hot and was well-presented on the plate.  The noodles and chicken were cooked well and the peanut sauce was super yummy!  This dish was definitely the favorite for my family!  Another member of my family ordered the Green Curry with chicken ($12.95) and thought it was very tasty; the sauce was full of flavor and the veggies were fresh and abundant.  Kanlaya Thai Kitchen is a great addition to the community!  The food was all very fresh, high quality, and well-presented.  The level of service easily matched the quality of the food.  If you're in the area and looking for something new to try for lunch or dinner, be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great to see a new restaurant in the area! We came here for lunch the week it opened for lunch and the food was excellent. I think there are a few opening week hiccups but the service and food had no issues. A good place for traditional Thai dishes. Don't be thrown off if the sign from the old place is set up!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Been here 4 times in 2 weeks!! Had the green curry and Thai basil  both yummy.. Crab Rangoon are excellent as well"}
{"text":"Man the food is making me crazy this is my second visit to this restaurant from just two days ago and the taste, service and price  are competing with each other. Today Pennsylvania Judge came to eat and she came all the way from south and came to eat here. I felt OMG this is going to be big in Allison park."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Kanlaya for dinner. We started with the Crab Rangoon appetizer which was good, but nothing set it apart from other places. We each ordered a different hot tea which was funny because they were Lipton tea bags. Then came the Tom Yum soup which was excellent. I've never had a soup with more flavor. I will warn you that I ordered spice level 1 out of 4 and it was really spicy...and I like spicy but to me that was like a 3.  Then we had the Drunken Noodle with chicken ordered at a 2 and it wasn't as spicy as the soup, so the scale maybe a bit inconsistent. If you don't tolerate spicy well, I would stick with 0-1 here. The dish was really good and very filling. Everything was cooked perfectly, and priced reasonably. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Prices are very fair. We had crispy spring rolls and crab rangoon for apps. Both were very good, but the crab rangoon really stood out. For our entrees we ordered the Pra Ram Long Song and Pad See Aew. We loved both, and will definitely order from here again. The mango sticky rice was the best we've ever tasted. Very happy to have this gem in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and they gave us the house special chicken fried wontons. I ordered drunken noodles #2, moderately spicy, and crab rangoons. Good service, food was well prepared and there was a decent weekday lunch crowd."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Thai restaurants in the area yet!! It's right up there with Nicky's Thai on the Northside!! Tom Kha soup on point and Pad Thai best I've ever had, the noodles were actually made correctly. Great service and good atmosphere. If you haven't been, what are you waiting for?!?!"}
{"text":"Since my first visit, I have been coming back at least once every week to a week and a half.  Great service & wonderful food. Very fresh.  My typical go to: Tom yum soup & beef pad Thai.  All of the desserts are very good as well, my favorite is the fried cheesecake."}
{"text":"I am not an Thai food aficionado, but I got pad Thai for takeout one afternoon for lunch.  It was great!  Generous portion sizes, and the staff was very quick and friendly.  I cannot tell you how impressed I was with cleanliness of the dining room.  I am familiar with the location and the previous two restaurants that were previously there, and they have made significant improvements.  I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was awful. Environment was blah. I really hope they work out the kinks in the service. Too much running, literally, by staff and still slow service. When drinks came we immediately ordered appetizers so not to lose our waitress' attention. When she came back to take our orders 15 min. later, I asked if the appetizers were up yet and she told us she hadn't put the appetizer order in yet. So much for trying to get things moving by ordering expediently. Eventually one of the two appetizers came out another 15 min or so later. The next table seated after us received the other appetizer we ordered. When asked, another waiter brought out our order slip from the kitchen to show us we didn't order the second appetizer. I told him we did but it apparently did not get placed by our server. He offered to put it in and he said it would only take a couple of minutes. Given the delay in getting our order in and waiting time for the food so far, i just asked that they bring out our entrees without any further delay, assuming those orders were placed. Food was good but just took too much time and chaos to finally get it.   My family suggested we consider the place for take out only next time."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today with a neighbor who has eaten in Thailand.  This was my first foray with Thai food.  We started with a small salad that was very good and made fresh.  I did not get the name of salad.  I ordered Tom Yum soup with chicken and Pad Thai with pork.  The Pad Thai was very good, it was number one on the heat scale of four.  Not too spicy, but had some zing.  The Tom Yum soup was excellent, but it was too spicy for me too finish.  Service was excellent and gracious.  Price was fair.  My neighbor said his selection was ALMOST as good as eating in Thailand.  I will go back, but will stay away from the Tom Yum soup"}
{"text":"What a gem for the Gibsonia area! I was able to stop on the second day they were open and had a wonderful lunch!  We were greeted quickly and seated just as fast. Drinks came quickly and we ordered lunch. I had chicken pad Thai at a spice level of 4(1 to 4 is your choice) . Lunch came with a free spring roll, which was a surprise! Super fresh and crispy. My pad Thai didn't take long to come after that and was absolutely delicious. It was spicey but wasn't overly spicy. Just right! The bean sprouts on it were sooo fresh and crispy!   The service here is very quick and nice. I can tell the owner and worker I saw really cared! We were in and out in less than 45 minutes!  I am so happy to have another option in the area and will be coming back for more! A good, quick, and super yummy lunch option! A must try spot in the area"}
{"text":"Good service excellent food! Best Thai food I've ever had in a quaint little place :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm so happy to have a great Thai restaurant in the neighborhood! I've only gotten takeout here, never ate in, but it appears to be BYOB. I'm a big fan of pad Thai and they have GREAT pad Thai. Takeout is always ready quickly and they get the order right.  Update: They have a sign up now. When you see it, stop in & enjoy!! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredibly friendly service.  This is the best Thai cuisine we've had in the 17 years we've lived in Pennsylvania.  The only thing I'd not miss is the music - it's a bit jarring and repetitive, but I'm an Aspie so maybe it's just me.    Try this place out - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Great new option and needed spot in Hampton! Staff goes out of their way to accommodate orders and service is friendly and efficient. The menu shines with unique items all delicious and FRESH . Not much ambiance inside but clean and byob. Take out good option too. Delicious panang curry and wings. Pad thai was perfect for those unfamiliar with more \"exotic\" choices."}
{"text":"Great service and incredibly tasty Thai.  We are new to Thai but thoroughly enjoyed.   Ordered level 3 spice, if you like spicy, a 4 would be fine.   Overall a great little place on Rt.8"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food for a very reasonable price! We drove 25 minutes to eat here and were very pleased.     We started with the shrimp cheese and fried spring rolls.  Both were crispy and fresh with very good flavor.  I had the cashew chicken level 2 spice as my entree. My wife had the Thai basil with chicken at level 1 spice, while my daughter had the drunken noodles and my son-in-law Thai basil chicken at level 2 spice.  The flavor explodes in these dishes with all of us being very pleased with our dishes that come out quickly and are piping hot.  The service was good, with the only problem (which was minimal) was that the dishes come out one at a time, but follow quickly.    Food quality - 5 Stars - Really good Thai food with your choice of spice level ( note 1 can be too spicy for those who like their food mild and I suggest going at level 0). I loved it with the dishes having great flavor.  Service - 4 Stars - I would like to have all the entrees come out at the same time, otherwise attentive.  Atmosphere - 3/4 Stars - Nothing special but nice and clean. Price - 4 Stars - Good value and serving size is plenty for someone.   Overall - 4/5 Stars - Very Good place and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is a great new Thai restaurant.  The ambience is very nice, the service is quite fast, and the food is delicious.  We had the Pad Se Ew, and Pad Thai, with Tom Kah Soup, and Spring Rolls, and of course, along with a small delicious salad that came with the main courses.  For a really nice and delicious local Thai restaurant, IMHO, it can't be beat!  Oh, too, also the servings provided us not only with our lunch, but enough to box up and take home for supper!  Neat-O!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Had green curry with shrimp, and chicken pad thai. Both excellent. Had 2 spice level on 1-4 scale and that was plenty spicy."}
{"text":"I love the authentic Thai food here. The drunken noodles and mango sticky rice are my favorites."}
{"text":"This may very well be my new favorite Thai restaurant in the Pittsburgh area! We ordered takeout for the first time, last Friday, and couldn't get over how great everything tasted, not to mention the perfect portion sizes! Can't wait to get more, this Friday!   If you like Thai food, do yourself a favor and give them a look...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch several days ago with my co-workers.  While the interior seems to have been recently updated it appeared rather bland inside. However, you come here for the food and it was great!  We had noodles and pad Thai that was spicy to our choice of between level 0 - 4. The waiter was very attentive and courteous.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good solid 4.5 out of 5. Ordered Pad Thai noodles with chicken at a spice level of 2.  Would order again, and might kick up the spice to 3 to see where that goes.  My only complaint were that the rice noodles were a little bit gummy for my taste.    They did a great job of remodeling the place inside to remove the remnants of the previous bad karma.  Very clean and the waiter was very attentive.    Recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I am impressed, to say the least... I am a frequent visitor to other Pittsburgh area Thai restaurants (once a week regularly) and this one blew my socks off!  I'm beyond excited that they are only 5 minutes away!    I got 2 takeouts this past week and took my friend to try a dine in today.  I gauge how good a Thai restaurant is based on their curry and Tom Kha soup... here's my review:  Both takeouts were Green Curry (one Veggie and one Tofu) cause that's my favorite dish and tells me whether this restaurant is any good or not... I basically put myself in a food coma both times because it was amazing and I couldn't stop eating it!  Portions were perfect.  Word to the wise... Curry is already spicy so don't overdo it with a higher spice level.  I ordered a 1 out of 0-4 and it was plenty hot for me.  I was definitely feeling it   Today, arrived at 11:30 am with no wait, picked our table and were well taken care of by the waitstaff.  Ordered Tom Kha soup (spice 2) and Thai Basil with Tofu (spice 1).  Tom Kha was on point... it was definitely fresh with a stronger lemongrass flavor which made it more bright. I also enjoy Nicky's Thai Tom Kha because I literally feel like it's giving me a warm hug from the inside.  This one would boost my spirit with it's brightness!  I LOVED it!  Thai Basil with Tofu was amazing as well... I was stuffed when I left and am positive I will return.  Next time I will order a 2 or 3 spice for regular dishes but stick with 1 on the curry.  Drink was Thai Iced Tea which was also very delic!"}
{"text":"Would give 4.5 stars if I could.  Excellent Thai food, just a notch below Nicky's (and to be honest, hard to decide if the ambiance at Nicky's has something to do with it).  Had the Tom Yum soup, which had excellent depth of flavor.  Same with the Basil Chicken.  My wife had the Pineapple Rice, which was great - loaded with pineapple, raisins, and veggies. Shared Crispy Spring Rolls, which came out piping hot and were loaded with chicken and veggies.  All the veggies were cooked spot on.  And there were a ton of fresh veggies in every dish.    I love spicy food, went with a 4 on both the soup and Basil Chicken.  Perfect spice level for me.  The couple next to us went with a 1, and commented that they should have chosen a 0.  Saw that they had Mango with Sticky Rice on the desert menu, although seasonal.  Didn't think they would have it, but the waitress said they did.  Five minutes later, she told us that the chef could not prepare the dish, as the mango was not ripe enough, and comped us a desert (Fried Banana, which was also excellent).  We were not upset at all, and were happy to know that the chef would rather not make the dish than send out below-par food. Excellent sign of a restaurant that cares about its food and guests.  Only knock I have is that they seemed to be short-staffed.  The poor servers were literally running between tables and handling the take-out orders.  There were 10 take-out orders during our meal, so they need to hire a dedicated staff member to work the front counter and handle take-out.  That said, even though short staffed, our server was attentive and we didn't feel like we were forgotten.  Don't let the outside of the place fool you.  The inside has been reconditioned, and the food is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant.   For those who are familiar with this area, please don't let the ghosts of restaurants past dissuade you from eating at Kanlaya. The owners have completed transformed this restaurant from a sad, worn, and dismal place, to a very clean, updated, and lovely venue. The wait staff is helpful and incredibly friendly and attentive. It is never crowded here (which is a shame for the owners but good for diners) but the constant stream of take-out orders indicates that people have discovered how good the food is here. My husband and I are almost addicted to the fresh rolls with shrimp but everything we have tried is delicious and fresh-tasting. I used to be one of those people that sticks to the the same-old, favorite thing at an Asian restaurant but given how good Kanlaya's food is, I have begun to experiment. So far, everything has been delicious. This place deserves more business!!"}
{"text":"This is a new Thai restaurant in the Allison Park/Gibsonia area and it is really terrific. I went for the first time on Saturday and ended up going back again on Monday because we wanted to try more of their food. I had the Pad Thai and my wife had the Red Curry and both were well prepared. I also had the Tom Yum soup which was SO good. I ordered it at a spice level of 2, (0-4 scale) and it was mouth warming  but not overwhelming which is exactly what I wanted.     Our second trip I tried the Larb and my wife had the Green Curry. Both were wonderful. The atmosphere is cozy and quiet, but that may change as people try the food. Highly recommend!    The service was friendly and attentive but started to fall a little behind when the place started getting into the dinner rush. (Likely a function of being a new place. )  BYOB (They had wine glasses). If this place gets a liquor licence I may move in."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! Highly recommend the Tom Yum, it's top notch! Love the spices! Great food!!"}
{"text":"Ate in one time and take out a week later.  Green Curry was good.  Better than most. Not quite caliper of Nickys. No pumpkin curry. Had a 4 on a 1-4 range. It was spicy but could use a bigger range. Veggies were perfectly cooked.  Crab Rangoon were excellent.  Service was great. Had take out and had veggie only red curry.  Good taste but not as hearty without protein.   Will continue to try dishes.  I wish the brown rice was the darker almost red/ black rice and wish it wasn't an up charge.   Now if they delivered ?!?"}
{"text":"Sssssooooo good! We ordered the chicken pad Thai and the spicy basil fried rice with chicken and both were phenomenal. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Foods are great, service is good. One of the best Asian cuisine in the area. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Thai food!  Very welcoming atmosphere and the family that runs it is very friendly.  Awesome food!"}
{"text":"I went there maybe a week and half ago for lunch and they weren't even open even though their sign said they should be. Went back for supper and I felt the food was mediocre and price too high for a smallish portion of Penang Curry Tofu. Prices, portions, and prices are better for the same item at Asian Kitchen in Shaler, my favorite place for curry."}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge flavors, super fresh veggies, smiling and friendly workers. We have ordered takeout from here at least once a week since they opened. Every single thing has been fabulous. Our favorites include the chicken satay appetizer, pad prik king, and pineapple fried rice. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool You.  This is an authentic Thai restaurant.  I decided to give it a try weeks ago with my daughter and have been back repeatedly.  Please give this one a try and support a great new restaurant in Hampton."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my Thai food and I'm always reluctant to try a new place because it usually doesn't meet the quality of my favorite Thai restaurant in the city (unnamed). I went with my parents since this is close to home, and was thoroughly impressed. We had the Chicken Fresh Rolls which were exactly as described- fresh, with juicy chicken and enormous in size with a spicy, tangy peanut sauce. For dinner I had the Pad See Aew, 2/4 spice with beef. While I would have liked a little more broccoli, the beef slices were large and tender with little fat, the brown sauce was spicy and sweet and not overpowering, and the noodles were perfectly pan-fried with the egg. My dad had the basil entree with seafood and despite being out of the squid, he said the seafood was fresh and had great flavor. This place is a little gem- and extremely affordable, with most entrees coming in at $12.50. I'm not sure why the restaurant was empty- the food itself warrants a full dining room nightly! BYOB is a cherry on top."}
