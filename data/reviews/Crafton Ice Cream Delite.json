{"text":"Fantastic little ice cream shop. On my first visit, I ordered a malted milkshake, and it actually had a good amount of malt in it unlike other similar places I've tried. Second time around, I ordered the peach cobbler sundae, and the half I ate was AMAZING. The soft serve was so creamy and the toppings were rich and crunchy. It was so huge that I had to put the other half in the freezer for later. I just moved to Crafton and I'm sure this will become a summer staple!"}
{"text":"Good food for a great price. 
Fast delivery 
Huge banana splits.  Too much for one person so I learned my lesson and got a half banana split. 
Their burgers are pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"This is a great place. They just added hot food recently and honestly, it is so much better than a lot of bar food places!. Great little shop in the community"}
{"text":"Always very welcoming. The food selection is surprisingly large for being an ice cream shop. I had the Pittsburgh hot dog without the ketchup. It's like primantis meets a hot dog shop. It was delicious. I always get a snowstorm here(there version of a blizzard.) great little shop."}
