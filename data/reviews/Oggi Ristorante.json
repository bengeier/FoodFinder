{"text":"Make sure you get her tomato salad now while its in season. Elegant in every part. Hurry! Ask about limoncello."}
{"text":"Our monthly dinner group of 8 had dinner on a week night.  We had several bottles of wine, which were reasonably priced.   I had the Osso Bucco and my wife had angel hair pasta and chicken parmigiano.   Both were absolutely delicious.   The service was excellent and the pace for dinner was perfect.  Carmella the owner and chef came to our table to say hello and was very gracious.  Outstanding dinner experience!"}
{"text":"We are always enamored with Oggi's Restaurante in Broadview Heights and we had the most amazing meal there this past Saturday.  We rarely eat out because we usually are disappointed but this restaurant did not disappoint.  From the beginning to the end, it all was a 9.9 (nothing is a 10).  Food meticulously prepared with the freshest ingredients.  The special appetizer was a sizzling pork belly with a red wine/raspberry reduction...crispy savory with a touch of sweetness...YUM!  We convinced two other couples that sat near us to order it .  Grilled romaine salad beautifully prepared with a balsamic vinaigrette.  A special entree was a Crispelle, the lightest crepes filled with the tastiest Italian sausage and a hint of fennel, creamy Italian cheeses, sautéed mushrooms with a light velvety cream sauce and topped with shaved Parmesan Reggiano, AWESOME.  The other special entree was a crispy red snapper over pureed cauliflower with roasted vegetables with a drizzle of basil oil; it was so succulent I could have licked the plate, but too many people in the restaurant.  Prices were exceptionally reasonable for the quality of the preparation of the dishes and the service we received.  We would like to say thank you to the chef-owner, Carmella, for our absolutely perfectly prepared meals.  Also a thank you to Miss Lauren who is always happy to help with any questions we had about the food. 

A great evening of exceptional authentic Italian food....Cindy W."}
{"text":"My husband and I were caring for his sick mother and we would always pass Oggi Restaurant on our late rides home. We sat at the bar, and was met by our friendly server Lauren, who took her time explaining specials and suggestions.  We were blown away by her entrees, desserts too. 
Carmella cooks with her heart and soul and she will always come out and talk with her customers after a hard night at work. The homemade pasta, especially her lasagna is my favorite.  Summer brings the abundance of fresh vegetables from her garden which makes the experience even better. Her zucchini blossoms are heavenly.  We try to dine there weekly or more. You won't be disappointed. 
It's like going to mom's for dinner. A hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was very happy.  I had the Osso Bucco and was very pleased while my wife had the Mannacotti which was truly special.
I very much look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Extremely disfunctional. No manager. Servers are overwhelmed. Bar is dirty. Meatballs were not hot. Tall blonde bartender looked like she was on crack. Had to ask for water. Had to ask for cheese. Complete mayhem."}
{"text":"Have had such great fun at the Oggi Bar. The bartender was entertaining, drinks were spot on, atmosphere very nice (not anticipated from street view) and the food very fresh and homemade!! The calamari, fried zucchini blossoms and margarita pizza all to die for! A miss on the seared tuna but that might have just been a one-time thing. If you are in the area and craving truly homemade Italian cuisine go see Mama. She absolutely does it right!"}
{"text":"If your palate is craving Italian and you're lamenting Northeast Ohio's lack of authentic cuisine in that category, lament no more.  Nestled far off the road in a Broadview Heights shopping center is Oggi Ristorante. Olive Garden it's not. The owner is the chef and you will get food that is prepared fresh and with flair.  My personal favorite happens to be dessert - the cannoli is just to die for.  Pistachios on one end, dark chocolate chips on the other, and a filling that is simply divine. On a recent visit for my birthday, mine was on the house!  But whether it's personal sized pizzas (mine had potato and pancetta on it) or a very fresh spinach-fennel-lemon dressing salad, or ravioli with wild mushrooms that you desire, it's worth a trek to Broadview Heights to see how it can be done."}
{"text":"Great food.  It will make you think that your Italian Grandmother is in in the kitchen cooking the dishes.  I have yet to have something here I didn't enjoy.  Don't be afraid if the restaurant only has one or two other tables full when you enter; I have been here once when we were the only people there and another time when there were only two other table with diners.  Other times the place is packed. The quality and flavor of the dishes is excellent."}
{"text":"I went to Oggi with two friends.  We sat on the patio on a beautiful fall evening.   We each ordered a salad (apple walnut looked wonderful), I had the grilled romaine salad and it was very good.  Our bread was forgotten until our entrees came out and then produced once we reminded the waitress.  The bread was wonderful, Italian and a foccacia, served with olive oil herb mixture for dipping.  For our entrees we all ordered the Mahi mahi.  It was a generously sized piece, although overcooked and dry.  It was served over a wonderful selection of vegetables and they gladly sustituted homemade pasta for the potatoes it was supposed to come with.  The side of pasta and sauce was very good and left me wishing I would have just gotten a pasta dish rather than the dry $26.00-28.00 mahi.   Dessert offerings were slim: cannoli, creme Brule or chocolate gelato.  We all opted for the cannoli.  It was very good but small.   I would visit again but stick with the Italian specialties on the menu that have been perfected.  Don't rule it out....I went due to so many rave reviews on yelp....there are good things here."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fabulous!   High quality, fresh ingredients, simple, exquisitely delicious recipes.   Many pastas are made fresh in house.  I love the linguini pescatore, the veal Marsala, their Caesar salad and house salads are crisp and tasty.   I have tried nearly every meal on the menu and have yet to be disappointed and portions are large enough for to-go boxes.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The real deal
 We called to make reservations as we finished our hike in the Cuyahoga Valley Natl Park. We explained we were hiking and wondered if we could dine with them. The host was very accepting, so we arrived in hiking pants and tennis shoes. 
Our table was set and fresh glasses of water awaited us. Our Cesar salad was delicious !! As was the pasta special and lasagna. The bread bowl featured focaccia and ciabatta!! Yummy. 
Even tho we came from the park most diners were there for a special dinner, several tables of 2 couples and 1 table with 2 older women and their adult children. The waitress and kitchen made a lot of effort to accommodate one diner's very restrictive dietary needs. 
We didn't linger at our table but we certainly could have. We're glad we followed other Yelp reviewers' advice."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is outstanding! Homemade pasta. I had the chicken parmesan and it was delicious! Carmella came out of the kitchen and talked to all of us. What a wonderful lady! We will definitely be back. Next time I'm saving room for dessert! :-)"}
{"text":"Outstanding dining experience! Truly authentic italian cuisine . Who doesn't love homemade pasta and great sauce? Oggi's is a hidden gem in Broadview Hts we have lived here for 12 years and we have never gone until now we have truly been missing out on excellent food. I had fettuccine with prosciutto it was fresh, light and very satisfying I also had a summer salad with very simple ingredients the vinaigrette really made it tasty and savory. I recommend you visit Carmella if for no other  reason the bread!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Prices a bit high. Service average. Restaurant was dirty.  Crumbs all over bench seat, into cracks. Not recently cleaned. I hesitate to go back. Is the kitchen clean?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our dinners - had very high hopes after reading all of the reviews. Service was very slow - very limited menu, pasta was over cooked and clumped together. Manicotti dish lacked flavor.  Limoncello martini was excellent."}
{"text":"Ahhh, so this was a bit of a disappointment.  The Wife and I had been looking forward to coming to this place for some time now, drawn by the great Yelp reviews and so we checked it out last night, making reservations beforehand.  It is located on one of the ends of a strip mall.  When we came inside, there was no one at the wait desk, though there were waitresses around, so we stood for about a minute or so waiting before someone noticed us and came out.

They brought us into one of the rooms on the side at a table for two in a darker corner where there was a light burned out in the ceiling.  There were other tables available- I'm not sure why they chose to place us there.  At least they lit a candle so we could have some light.

Our waitress took our orders, calamari for our appetizer and then pork ossobuco and the seafood pasta dish.  We requested that they switch the linguini from the pasta with some of the home made fettuccine that we had read so much about, which they did without complaint.  After about 15 minutes, she brought out some bread and butter.  The bread, especially the foccacia was freshly made and delicious, though my wife thought the butter had a bit of an off flavor to it.  I didn't mind it.

The calamari was ok- thickly sliced, it was pretty chewy compared to what we are used to.  Had a nice crust on it and the aioli was tasty- appreciated how the banana peppers offset some of the richness of it.  I like the calamari at Cantine, down the street, better.

Our meals took a really long time to get to us.  There was another set of guests seated next to us arrived about 15 minutes after us.  They were nearly immediately given some of the bread, even before they had ordered, which struck us as a little strange, and they were halfway through with their entrees before ours even got to us.  I also noted that the waitress offered to shave additional cheese on top of their pasta but didn't do the same for us.  It was a little bit strange to be treated so differently.  It would have been nice to have the fact that it was taking so long to be acknowledged by the waitstaff.

The pork ossobuco was ok.  The risotto was well flavored but underdone- you could taste the grit of the granules of rice as you chewed.  The pork was slightly overcooked but had pretty good flavor.  It would have been more passable if there was more sauce or gravy on it to cover up some of the dryness.  The seafood pasta was also ok- the home made pasta seemed a bit soft and flabby, I know that it's not going to be al dente if its made fresh, but I expected at least some bounce.  I wonder if it had been sauced beforehand but then sat around while the ossobuco was finished and so became soggy.  The seafood was a reasonable portion and tasted fresh, though they weren't the best scallops.  

We decided to give dessert a try, since we figured that given our experience, we might not come back to this place.  Cannoli was what we settled on and it was definitely the highlight of the evening.  Two crisp and well filled cannoli's came out, with pistachio and chocolate chips on them.  For $6, they are a bargain- probably the best cannoli's that we've had, and we are not usually cannoli people.  Very smooth delicious filling.  

Ultimately, though there were some bright spots in our meal, our experience at this restaurant was disappointing.  We probably will not come back, unless it is to get take out cannoli's, if it is possible to do that."}
{"text":"Carmella was wonderful as I held my wife's birthday party there and we had a small gathering friends and relatives.  A diverse crowd but all were very happy.  can't say enough nice things about Oggi."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  I'm not sure why a previous review said the portions were small, the portions were more than adequate.  This is not Golden Corral.  This is fine dining.  The prices are what you would expect from a fine dining restaurant.  Also,  I saw no evidence of uncleanliness the place was immaculate from top to bottom."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have returned to dine here, but I am glad to see that Carmella is still in the kitchen and Lauren is still out front.

The classics are still on the menu, homemade pasta, Pork Osso Bucco, scallops,etc.  But there are also some new seafood items and specials.

Keep in mind that Carmella has a limited kitchen staff and she serves meals in the true Italian style, in English this means slowly.  This isn't Olive Garden, this is a place where you come for the evening, sip some wine and talk to each other.  What is your hurry?  Yeah, they sometimes seem disorganized, but it all comes together in the end--more proof that Carmella is a real Italian.  

The atmosphere is cozy and dim--save for the obnoxious flat screen TV in the bar area.  Must every bar have a TV?  

If you want a relaxing and unhurried dining experience, then this is your place.  And you must have a cannoli and Limoncello for desert, both are homemade and out of this world."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends bday dinner, she raved it about it before hand and was so excited for everyone to try it.  Let me count the ways this place sucked: 
1. The server had no idea what was going on in regards to menu or wine/drink.  Couldn't answer simple questions about the specials, unfriendly, just plain awkward. 
2. The menu was 'ehh' (friend who dragged us there said there were lots of delicious things not available for whatever reason?) 
3. At some point the server left and the stand-in bartender took over, who told us repeatedly she was only filling in and didn't know anything about the menu or wine list.  
4. There was music on when we entered then abruptly stopped.  We asked if they could turn it back on, they didn't.  So the bday dinner was eaten in silence.  Woo hoo! Super fun! 
5. The food came, and it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't memorable.  All of the pasta was overcooked (who orders a $24 bowl of hand made pasta to have it cooked to mush?) 
6. When the checks came it literally took 30 minutes to separate.. by couples! We didn't move or do any sorcery, it was just a disaster.  

Apparently --according to my friend-- this place was amazing when she was there, but I found it to be an all-around disappointment.  And at that price? Forget it."}
{"text":"Nice locally-owned place. The chef Carmella grows some of the ingredients in her own backyard, then brings them in to put into your dish. She is awesome. Straight from Italy, her and her staff will make sure you are taken care of. I suggest the lamb shank, it's my favorite thing on the menu. (But honestly it's all good)

They offer cooking classes, so I have been in the kitchen and it's spotless! The class was really fun, just get into it and get your hands dirty. My family and I had a great time!!

My parents threw my 5th anniversary party here and it was wonderful!! They have 2 semi-private rooms for dinner parties. Since it is locally owned just negotiate everything with the person that owns it and it will be fantastic! Every guest had nothing but good things to say.

My family comes here in a regular basis and you should too :)"}
{"text":"Cute place with a nice interior. Went here for a date night with my boyfriend and we were both happy with our food. The bread is unique and really good. Overall, our food was very very good, but portions were a little small. Waitress was very very nice and attentive! I would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"One of best ACTUAL HOMEMADE Italian in the Cleveland area. Carmella makes the sauce, noodles, desserts etc herself.  I can't honestly think of anything on the menu that isnt delighful. The prices are reasonable. You must try the specials and homade desserts. I must warn you, if you are on a time limit, you may want to come another time when you have time to spare. 

Lastly- they have happy hour on drinks and appetizers!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Oggi!  It took us a long time to discover this little hidden gem 20 minutes down the road from us!  It is officially our new favorite Italian place around the Cleveland area! Carmella is so sweet, and one hell of a cook! My husband had the osso bucco and I had the shrimp on  our first visit.  Since then we've tried other pasta dishes, and everything was wonderful! Everything is so fresh and real. All are cooked to order, which gives you time to enjoy the plentiful bread basket, complete with real foccacia bread. Carmella also makes her own limoncello, which of course we need to have at the end of each meal.  The desserts are heavenly as well. The cannoli will make your eyes roll back in your head!  Lauren at the bar serves up the best drinks, and is a sweet young gal.  We always arrive a bit before our reservation to enjoy a cocktail (or two) before we are seated.  Looking forward to visiting again next month with good friends!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place doesn't have better reviews. My corporate office used to be located nearby this restaurant and I made a point to eat here during every business trip to Cleveland. I have lived in NYC and Dallas and can tell you that this owner puts a lot of love into her homemade pasta! She uses fresh produce out of her own garden to create her dishes. Get the mushroom ravioli!!!!! Hands down! They seriously melt in your mouth. I could eat two portions if not one would judge me for it! My only critique would be that service could have been more consistent. Sometimes good. Sometimes not so much."}
{"text":"Really good. 
All reviews 4 and 5 stars are accurate
Come and try the home made pastas."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite Italian in the Midwest! Always fresh homegrown ingredients, homemade pasta, the best veal, salads and soups. I could go on and on! My parents go at least three times a week and whenever I am in town from LA, we have to go at least once. We love Carmela, Lauren and the entire staff who make it feel like home. Love Oggi!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get.  Everything was of good quality but portions are small and the price was not commensurate.  My friend of Italian lineage thought his meal was the cat's meow but the rest of us were not impressed, so YMMV."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars because while I'm sure there are better places around nothing compares to Oggi for the dollar value with respect to the quality and quantity of food.  I had the reasonably priced special of salmon over vegetables.  Very healthy and a very large piece of perfectly grilled salmon.  The vegetables included perfectly ripe avocado slices.  I recommend this highly and found it to be a much better food value than any other Italian place for miles around."}
{"text":"I visited Oggi on Friday, 10/3, as part of a large group. While the food was excellent, and clearly homemade, an otherwise lovely experience was marred by sub-par service. We were split into two tables. The table at which I was seated had been given only one menu to share. However, this wasn't a problem because we were seated approximately 30 minutes before our drink orders were taken. So we had plenty of time for the menu to make its rounds. Unfortunately, when everyone else was served their drink, my glass of wine was forgotten. It took me several minutes to get the attention of the server. I finally got my wine, however due to their earlier delay I only had one glass, when I otherwise would have had two.

I had the lasagna, preceded by the grilled romaine salad, and followed by the cassata cake. The lasagna was superb, although portioned much smaller than you'd get at most other restaurants in the area. The noodles would never have been mistaken for boxed, or the sauce jarred. Both were very, very good and fresh. The only other time I've had lasagna that compared was in Tuscany. The grilled romaine was a nice change from a standard caesar salad. The cassata cake was very good, but not the best that I've ever had. We were offered two types of bread - foccacia and italian. When the first round was brought out, the piece of foccacia that I took was cold in the center. That was disappointing. Also, they were beyond very skimpy with the butter. There was barely enough for one person, and yet it was supposed to serve four.

This is a lovely looking restaurant, with a superior lasanga. I wanted to give it two stars based on the service and the fact that we had no say over the automatic 18% gratuity, which was absolutely not deserved. However, the quality of the entree, even in such a small portion, swayed me to three stars. I can't imagine that I will ever visit there again as it's far from my home. However, if the opportunity arose to go with one or two other people, it wasn't so awful that I wouldn't give it another try."}
{"text":"The best place in Cleveland bar none. If you want good homemade food by a little Italian lady, then this is the place. We eat there twice a week minimum."}
{"text":"The best Italian dinner we've had since we returned from Tuscany 2 years ago. The pasta is fresh and unbelievable tasty. The appetizer Zucchini blossoms with Ricotta cheese might be the best appetizer we've ever had! Our waitress (I wish I remember her name) was personable, professional and did nothing but add to our dining experience. Atmosphere- excellent. 
We will be back frequently and share with friends both in town and those visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Zuchini blossoms(from the owners garden!)  were awsome and the home made pasta was seriously so good. We had lasagna and manacoti and loved both, as well as our waitress! Very much recommended. A little gem I never would have tried without yelp, thank you!"}
{"text":"Hit up this little Italian gem with my sister and a friend - I was really excited to give it a shot. I don't think this was the best Monday night spot, service was incredibly slow and really spotty. I'm talking we didn't see the (only waitress that night - doubling as host) waitress for 15-20 min between each check in with us.  The dining room is simple and classy, minimal decor. 

Despite the slow service, we remained patient and ordered a few different things on the menu. Their pasta is made in house and divine.  It's light, delicious, and worth every hip clinging carb.  We also tried the chicken parmesan, which came in a huge order. I had a full serving left over to take home.  Overall, this was a good place, but no where I would return without a good reason. Prices were a little high for a casual weekday meal, but fit a night out if you're looking to have one complete with delicious italian meal."}
{"text":"The food was so, so good! It came out fast. The chef came out to check on us and get our feedback- very cool. He told us that they are rebranding and amping up the menu, which is good because it's pretty limited. I highly recommend the creme brûlée! There was only one waiter working, and I felt bad because she was stretched to her limit. She was awesome, but management really needs to get her some help! Despite being the only person taking care of everyone in the restaurant, she did a great job. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. We will definitely be back!"}
