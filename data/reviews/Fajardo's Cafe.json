{"text":"Excellent and authentic Mexican food! Hands down, best menudo in town.  Service is attentive, friendly and fast.  Fajardo's is off the beaten path but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Excellent mexican food. We go here almost every Sunday. I love how the food is consistently good, no matter what you order. My husband loves the menu do and gets the biggest bowl they have. This is a family run restaurant and they are super sweet."}
{"text":"So delicious, total nana home style cooking! Chorizo breakfast super flavorful, cheery service. Setting is not at all fancy, very low-key, but comfy and casual. Strong Chicano vibe, feel-good kind of place. Next best thing to Nana's house!"}
{"text":"This is traditional mexican food that my family has been eating for years.I have been eating at this place since I was a kid. Fajardo's serves up the same great food as Lily's did. Their green chile is delicious and I love their salsa. However, the location is a bit hidden.

The one thing I have never liked is their chips. For having such great salsa, it's a travesty to serve grocery-store chips. 
We also miss Zip and Zip's service, but the Fajardo's are doing a spectacular job keeping the legacy going."}
{"text":"The best menudo in town! Friendly service, great food and awesome micheladas too. If you want authentic Mexican, this is the place."}
{"text":"Food was great...service was AWESOME and the price was perfect....would go back!! Only down fall is that they are closed Monday and Tuesday, but well worth the wait to go another day!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to eat here for at least 15 years now. As stated in the other reviews, this was once known as Lily's Cafe. When it reopened as Fajardo's the restaurant had some remodeling and updating, which it greatly needed. The food stands the test of time. My daughter and I love the Green Chili and Eggs breakfast which they serve on the weekends. I have had just about everything and it has always been good. The servers have always been friendly and accommodating to whatever my kids come up with for them to make. This is a great for those who are sick of chain restaurants but still want consistent, quality food."}
{"text":"Best homestyle Mexican food in town. And YES, they do still have the Sunday morning porkchop, just like Zip did, and YES it is just as good. Same recipe, same cooks. The family goes over and above courteous. For your best bet, go for the real food- rellenos, enchiladas, the albondigas on wed is awesome, weekend menudo even better."}
{"text":"Good Solid Mexican food. I had Menudo with a Negra Modelo. Menudo was spot on. Wifey had an echilada and taco combo and is was great. Good service and solid food. Plus it has a legit feel being in a small house tucked away off of 59th ave. Felt like I was at my Nana's house."}
{"text":"Authentic, great food, great service, affordable, friendly, and clean."}
{"text":"Decided to try a New Mexican place today and this is one of the reasons why we drive far to our favorite spot.
This place isn't horrible but it's didn't really wow me on the flavor. The salsas they have tasted like a marinera sauce the chips were ok didn't taste stale or anything. The service was good, everyone was very nice and they took care of our table. 
The menudo was just ok nothing too special about it. 
The quesadillas was not good according to my niece. She did eat it but she said was not good. 
The beans were good but the rice was bland and looked mushy. If you are looking for good service but mediocre food then come here."}
{"text":"Authentic as it gets north of the border.  Little cafe that doesn't try to be anything it is not.  The waitress was lovely and nice, even as her daughter was in the table in front of me doing her homework eating soup.  I ordered the chicken burro and it was fresh.  Flour tortilla was hand made and not store bought... spanish style rice was homemade.  salsa was fresh and home made.  Refried beans are def. NOT from a can.  

The only thing that I believe was store bought were the chips... but they were amazing!~

Food was great.  9$ for a plate

Tip-  This place is not in a well known area .  It is somewhat hard to see and find, even with my gps on my phone, I had trouble.  There are no other businesses around. 

Seriously, some of the best Mexican food I have had in a while.  I am a pretty tough rater, so 4 stars from me is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"They are starting to charge for everything,  menudo is good but before you used to have your choice of tortillas or bread,  but because it's more popular to eat with bread they are now charging extra for it! They also charge $2 extra to have your eggs cooked separately when you order chorizo.  Sorry but I'll be going to  Mixteca for my menudo now."}
{"text":"This place is SOOO GREAT ! My friend brought me here swearing the albondigas were good since I know of no place anywhere that can make them good and she was right ! Its like being home! I also tried some of their green chili burrito which also was great! It is just a little hole in the wall mexican place.. but its hard to find a good mexican place - it really did not disappoint and I look forward to going here over and over!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great. We ate at 2 other Mexican restaurants on this trip and felt as though this was the first that knew how to make spicy salsa. We had the green chili burro enchilada style and the chicken chimichanga enchilada style, both were awesome. The chips were warm and tasted homemade. The michelada was good. 

The only complaint I have is that when we pulled up at 6:55 on a Thursday night we were the only ones in the parking lot and it felt like we could possibly be in a shifty neighborhood. That feeling went away as soon as we entered the clearly family owned establishment and were greeted by the most gracious hosts who both spoke perfect English (which is important for those of is who know zero Spanish)."}
{"text":"Went for posole but they where out so I settled for menudo ... 

Well it's was a bad choice... But hey the chip and salsa was great ..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.real down home mexican food .i was really surprised by this place good food good service and good prices.my wife and i will be back for more ."}
{"text":"Second time here. Little hole in the wall place on two side streets. Very good food. Decent prices. Friendly staff and homey atmosphere. 
Had the relleno special. Was a shock when it came out didn't expect a cheese enchilada on the plate. Was just enough food for lunch. One down side is their hot salsa could be hotter. Worth the trip even if your not in Glendale."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here. My colleague picked it and raved about the place. Typical Mexican food here. I understand that the recipes are generations-old, but it's not special. Decent service."}
{"text":"home style cooking. it looked very authentic but the burrito was the same quality as garcias or macayos."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town!!!!  They also have the most amazing salsa!!!  Great place for Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"I guess green chili is not their speciality. I didn't see or taste green chili at all. The sauce was more orange than green (see pic), mostly due to the cheese."}
{"text":"This is the best chimichanga in the Phoenix metro area.  Hands down.  If you are a chimi fan, you owe it to yourself to go try one here.  You'll agree with me."}
{"text":"Fajardos is what was once know as Lily's Cafe.  I have been going there since the mid 80's and still love this place. 
When Zip the chef and owner died in 2006 we not only lost a great friend but we lost our favorite restaurant.  When the Fajardo family reopened the place it was really like a dream come true. 
I still really miss Zip but I know he would be happy that the restaurant lives on without him. 

The food is still the same and wonderful. The Salsa is great and I find myself eating a few bowls of it before i ever even get my food.  

My suggestions are the green chile soup and the special burrito (once called the Zip burrito.  I do admit though i have never had a dish there i didn't like.  

This place is one that you must check out."}
{"text":"Kind, courteous and helpful are always things that my mother taught me when I was a kid. So when I took my mother here for lunch it was apparent that there was someones good mother present. 

The staff was so incredibly sweet, helpful and courteous it made up for the average Mexican food the kitchen was sending out. While my Taco Salad ($6.50) was pretty good, it wasn't anything special beyond the fact that it didn't have the usual soggy fried tortilla bowl. Mom had the House Special Nachos ($6.75) which were pretty tasty from what I could tell. Since I'm low carbin' I couldn't fully experience their crispy cheesy goodness. 

Perhaps in the future I will return when Im having an \"off\" day to try the delicious looking burrito's and enchilada's. Until then I get to use my own good values that my mother taught me so well."}
{"text":"I finally found a place with REAL MEXICAN FOOD in the West Side. The service is friendly and their food is delicious! The menudo is just like my Father in-law used to make. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I want to give zero stars but the minimum is one. I don't understand how this place has a high rating. The food , the service, and the cleanliness of this cafe is horrible in each case. My daughters food literally had a bug in it and was completely uneaten yet we were still charged full price for the food. 

You can absolutely tell the food all comes from cans from the sauces including the salsa and the red chile and green chile to the meats. Yup they use canned meat here. We paid close to seventy dollars for quite honestly close to the worst dining of our lives. Do not waste your time or money this place needs to be shut down."}
{"text":"Very delicious Mexican food.  I'd give it five stars except I taste two cooks in this kitchen, one makes magic happen and the other is a novice.  So it's hit or miss  but when you hit, I'm confident it's one of the best Mexican spots in the Valley."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place a few times, the last being a member of the local fire dept. who happened to come in for lunch just before I was finished.  It is well out of the way and I am not sure I would like the neighborhood at night.  It seats more than you would think from the outside in 3 rooms.

The round corn chips I am sure come from a bag.  Both salsas were pretty good, although after a sample of the hot one I stuck with the mild.  I had the lunch special 2 chicken and spinach enchiladas that came with rice and beans ($8.95) and a horchata ($1.75).  The enchiladas were different and good and the beans and rice were well prepared.  As Alexander noted the food is good but not special.  

The service was very good even though it was Friday lunch and the place was over 1/2 full.  It is a definite add to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Service is friendly. Some of the waiters/ waitresses speak to you according to skin tone, however. I speak perfect Spanish, but it's not appropriate when the waiter is helping others around you in perfect English, then when she comes to your table she switches to Spanish without knowing you. It's kind of a statement that I interpret as: \"You look like the typical person who doesn't speak English.\" That, my friends, is called profiling."}
{"text":"Okay a little annoyed with myself that I haven't gotten to this place until today.  A little mom and pop operation on a residential street. Formerly Lilly's Cafe, I Was told bought out by the cooks. 
I had the special for the day soup with a choice of burrito. $8.95. Dang that soup, it had some green chilies but not hot, potatoes, corn, cheese it was soooooo good. Then I chose a bean and cheese burrito to go with, also yummy and couldn't finish. 
Went with a group all pleased.  Chips and salsa great and the service great. Little bit of a place, but I loved it."}
{"text":"I have coming here for over 25 years. Food is as good as when Zip had it. It is always good and fresh and you won't find a cleaner place. Soup and burro lunch special is awesome."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if possible. Horrible service the last 2 times we have came. The servers are rude and walked past our table multiple times after we asked to put in our order. We finally ended up walking out after 30 minutes of no service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We've been  going here for years, back when it was Lily's. Went last night for dinner and it was absolutely awful. The salsa had no flavor, I could make better. I had tacos, rice & beans, which weren't good. The meat had an odd flavor, the beans tasted like they came from a can and the rice was bland. It's been awhile since we've been, and I won't be going back anytime soon. Plus, they raised their prices and are very expensive for a mediocre at best restaurant. It's too bad, as I always enjoyed going on the weekend for the egg special (green chili, eggs & meat). Pedro's or Popo's are much better choices for a small, family-owned Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Came here last time and the menudo was delicious!! 2nd time here small hole in the wall good seating good music and hospitality."}
{"text":"I went with some colleagues this morning for breakfast about 10am and we were greeted promptly and service was fantastic.  If you like local and family owned restaurants then this is the place for you.  Food is great and the homemade tortillas are amazing."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was little with my parents. When you pull up its kinda crazy but don't be scared it's a house. 
The service is always quick and everyone makes sure your drinks are filled. I haven't been here in a coupe years so it was nice when my mother decided to invite me for lunch it was a walk down memory lane sorta speak. 

It was a Sunday and lunch time so I decided to order the red menudo. They have the option of small or large bowl , I went with the small bowl and it was a perfect lunch combo that came with a choice of corn or flour tortilla. 
The menudo was nice and hot and had a great amount of perfect flavors.
The restaurant is family owned so you know your service will be excellent when they are all striving for the same goal under one roof."}
{"text":"I just arrived here about a week ago from Virginia to visit my mom who lives in Glendale.   I simply love places like this.  Cozy, friendly, inexpensive, and good food.  Waitress was very friendly and the salsa is very good.  I had the shredded beef burrito with red chili sauce and is was so good!  After reading some of the reviews I realized I missed out on the horchata!  :(  Next time!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. Used to be the go to place every Sunday but the last several times we have experienced very rude staff. Decided to try them a few more times but it's the same issue. Asking waiters to put in an order and get ignored. I would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I teetered between 3 and 4 stars and gave them the benefit of the doubt.
I was just here recently but prior to my last visit I had not been there in YEARS. It was still Lily's last time I had been there (the Lily's sign is still out front below, and slighlty more noticeable, than the Fajardo's sign).
We went on a Sunday. The chips were warm (but store bought) and the salsa was fresh and good! I ordered the pork chops and eggs. The pork chop wasn't grilled as I had expected, but instead had been cooked in a crock pot (i think). It just had a different flavor and texture that I wasn't expecting.
My dad tried to order the cocido (not available) and then the albondigas (also not available). I don't remember what he wound up ordering, but along with everyone else, we all agreed the food was good but not really mind blowing. We may be back but not before we go to La Perla's just around the corner.
The service here is definitely worth mentioning though! I think thats what pushed me to give them four stars"}
{"text":"Wow. Havnt had authentic mex since my move from Cali. It made my weekend. You just need some more mex drinks like horchata etc. We had menudo...yum! And huevos rancheros"}
{"text":"My family and I visited on Christmas Eve and I was so pleased to see the spirit of Lily's carries on. The food was terrific to include the House Special Burrito. The hot salsa is terrific and as important the two ladies serving us were pleasant, friendly and available even with a full front room. We used to visit Lily's quite often years ago and had lost track of it since Zip's passing. Great job to the new owners/family. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant when seeking homestyle food. Intimate yet fully functional for the menu items. The relleno special is my favorite dish. Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of most relleno's. This special offers a combination of a relleno, enchilada, rice and beans. Plenty to eat and some to take home. The green chili tamales are a treat during the holidays. Yes, I prefer green chili but don't let that sway you from the red chili. Spicy but not bitter red chili is rare but they did it. The prices are reasonable and you will be glad you made the effort to make the trip."}
{"text":"The menudo is the best!!  Can't go wrong. The place is in a neighborhood.  I grew up around the corner.  I remember this place when it was Lili's Cafe.  If you're looking for great Mex food then this is your place."}
