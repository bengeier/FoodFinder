{"text":"I have used Sumi's Cakery twice to order a medium strawberry cake and red bean pastries. Everything was delicious! The strawberry cake has a light, fluffy whipped cream that compliments the fruit and prevents the cake from feeling too heavy. The red bean pastries are tasty, hearty, and would serve as a filling snack. The store, like the employees and packaging, was neat. The woman who helped me was very kind and courteous. She took notice that I was waiting outside in the snow and came out to ask me to wait in the warmth of her store."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a small treat and the second we walked in we were hit with a wonderful smell. We ended up sharing a butter cream bread and a small bubble tea. Both were quickly devoured by the kids, barely leaving any for me! We will definitely be stopping by again next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Sumi's is our favorite bakery! Like others have said, nothing is too sweet or too heavy, so it comes regret-free. It's a very pleasant place, too: If there's a free table, it's worth it to sit down with a bun and a cup of coffee to enjoy while you visit. Everything here is worth trying, with my personal favorites being the mocha cream bun and the cheesecake slices. It's a perfect little slice of cheesecake topped with fruit. The cakes are light and intriguing, and the red bean buns are a staple. Our only regret is not going there often enough."}
{"text":"The thing I like most about asian bakeries is that the pastries aren't too sweet. I tried the red bean bun, along the chocolate cupcake. Both were very good. There are a bunch more flavors, so I'll definitely have to come back and try the others. I love the care and attention the owner took when packing up my cupcake. No more having to worry about smashed cupcakes after a ride in the car!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked goods. Tried the blueberry bun, it was light and flavorful. 

Bubble tea is a little overpriced ($4 for small, $5 for large) but taste was decent."}
{"text":"I've been to Sumi's Cakery 4 or 5 times now, and I always get the buns with buttercream filling. I love how light they are and the buttercream isn't overly sweet. I also love how inexpensive they are at $1.50, they make the perfect little snack. My friends bought me a fruit cake from Sumi's for my birthday and everyone loved how light and fresh it tasted. This was the first cake I've seen that was gone within 5 minutes of cutting it. 
Overall, I love this place. I just wish they opened a little sooner and stayed open a little later, because I could see myself stopping there for breakfast or dessert after dinner."}
{"text":"For $8 you get a good sized shaved ice dish in 1 of 3 flavors. I chose green tea and am glad I did. The combination of cold shaved ice with condensed milk, green tea ice cream, sweet bean, matcha, and mochi (?) were delightful. The dish was large enough to split between 4 for a light afternoon snack. If you don't like matcha (a little bitter), consider a different flavor.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Red-Bean Buns were outstanding!! The Red Bean with Shaved Ice is a must!!  Will make you forget your ice cream sundae. You can't believe how good this is."}
{"text":"Early on a Saturday, I promised my daughter we'd eat out for breakfast. Little did she know we'd be freezing our butts off at 11 in the morning eating Red Bean (Pat/Pot) Bingsu, and buying Red Bean buns. (Our first trip to find Sumi's was a disappointment because I wasn't sure where on Murray Ave., they were, and when we found Sumi's, it was closed). Being in town this weekend, we made our way to Sumi's with success! 
We grabbed our spoons, and worked our way into the pile of sweet red beans, two scoops of red bean ice cream, pineapple, chewy rice cake pieces, and shaved ice covered in sweetened condensed milk. The goose bumps, and shivers were so worth it. 

The red bean buns weren't too sweet, with the perfect ratio of sweet red beans and chewy bread like bun. Definitely yummy.

The space was clean, and modern, the cake case filled with perfect round frosted  cakes. The cashier was friendly, and patient, and we got to chat with the owner, when she came to ask if we liked the Bingsu!! So much better than boring doughnuts, we're already looking forward to more goose bumps, and something new to try next time. 

*cash only, and you can get vanilla ice cream in your Bingsu instead of the Red Bean ice cream, just try it!"}
{"text":"I love this bakery. I've only tried their buns (which are great), but I finally got to try their bingsoo today! Got the green tea one and it was amazing. The portion was big, so it was perfect for sharing. The staff was also very nice, and offered to give us extra matcha powder. I also saw her giving a cup of corn tea to a customer for free. I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Love their pastries very nice experience. Their cafe decor is also nice and (sort of) fancier than other bakeries. Worth to stop by and try their green tea bun."}
{"text":"I've ordered cakes from them several times, and they are always delicious and feel a lot healthier than your average birthday cake - the icing is not very sweet but really creamy, and the Asian flavored cakes (like green tea, sweet potato) are perhaps not to the average American's palette but they are AMAZING, and the 'normal' fruity flavors are also really good. 

Only one request: PLEASE start using the Square or another payment system like a lot of other local businesses that don't take credit cards otherwise (East End Brewery, Commonplace Coffee, etc.) - the cakes are $$$ and it is a pain to pay that much in cash these days, and there are so many new options for small businesses. I am willing to pay a small extra fee for the convenience!"}
{"text":"I go there often for their delicious Korean pastries even though I do not live in the neighborhood. The Cakery is a must if you want to try out some authentic Korean styled breads! They also have cakes decorated elegantly with many kinds of fresh fruits! I would suggest their white chocolate cake series - with raspberries or blackberries - and my all time favorite red bean paste bread."}
{"text":"It's good. I personally really like the maple syrup bread, the twisted doughnuts, the rosewater buns, and patbingsu. The twisted doughnuts and rosewater buns tend to be all gone by the time I get there, though... maybe it's just my luck. Anyway, it's very nicely set up inside too."}
{"text":"I got a red velvet cupcake and it was horrible to say the least. The icing tastes like straight margarine...almost to the point where I forgot it was a cup cake. It turned more into a dinner roll experience for me and I'm more so just mad I spend $3.00 on a dinner roll. Service was good, that's about it."}
{"text":"This is a cute little Korean bakery with unique pastries. We got the red bean shaved ice (patbingsu) and though it was pricey at $10, it was enough for three people to split. We will definitely be back to try the other flavors and I'm already dreaming about a rainbow cake for my next birthday."}
{"text":"This place has always been on my radar but since I'm not a huge sweets person I never rushed to try. Had a friend mention that Sunmi's had patbingsu and needless to say I was all over that. 

ATMOSPHERE;;
Atmosphere is great. Very quaint and quiet with two window tables and a larger table in the back. The breads are arranged in the left wall and the counter situated to the right with a small cake display in front of their menus. I went in on a Sunday afternoon so it was quiet except for the owners or managers? When I walked in the door I was greeted by a gleaming baby and I'm a sucker for babies. He was so adorable. I love the family bakery feel it makes the place way more cozy and inviting.

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS;;
GREENTEA CAKE ---
I've never tried any of their breads, but I have had their matcha cake and it is amazing. The flavored are so good, not too sweet and the green tea flavoring is not overpowering. The cake is also a kind of cream based, and it's...I dare to say...perfect. I'm dying to try their other cakes as well as their breads. Reading the other reviews it doesn't seem like I'll be disappointed at all. 

PATBINGSU ---
I will say I was disappointed that my shaved ice came out to $14...but I understand why. The fruit shaved ice is typically served with what I'm guessing is vanilla ice cream perhaps? But me trying to be a major FA and be all fancy, decided that I wanted the red bean and fruit combined...thus $14. The size was really good with 2 scoops of ice cream a nice serving of the pat, fresh...yes fresh...strawberries, kiwis, mangos, mochi and more! Not sure of it was worth $14, but I didn't leave complaining at all. If I will say one thing it is that I wish the red bean ice cream was slightly softened a bit. I waited a few minutes before I dug in so that the ice cream would be easier to eat. The fruits were a bit on the sour side as well, but let's face it it is not primo fruit season just quite yet. All in all I'm happy I found a place with Korean shaved ice. I will not be fancy next time and ask them to combine two different types. Let's not fix something that ain't broke. 

OVERALL;;
A promising little bakery nestled on a busy and bustling street. Their selection of breads seemed a bit more expansive than other local Asian bakeries. They keep it very simple and they seem to do what they do very well. I recommend this little bakery. I will be back to try more and give an updated review."}
{"text":"Sometimes, I get really odd cravings for specific things. A few weeks ago it was adzuki bean paste. So, naturally, I yelped for \"red beans\" in Pittsburgh. And that's how I found myself at Sumi's ordering a red bean bingsu. If you've never had bingsu before (I hadn't), it's shaved ice with condensed milk, topped with ice cream, mochi, and red bean in this instance. I paid 8 dollars for it and, upon seeing it, understood why. It could easily be split among 3 people. I'll be back next time I'm craving red beans or a cold treat. 

My friend also recommends the red bean bread. She was impressed with the bean paste to bread ratio."}
{"text":"Came here towards the end of the day. There was only one piece of cake left that was so so delicious, fluffy and moist. So far, it's been the best cake I've tasted in Pittsburgh.

The only downside to this place is it's very tiny inside and seats are limited. 

I'll definitely come back earlier to try to snag a piece of green tea cake."}
{"text":"If Sumi's patbingsu is what all patbingsu tastes like, I don't know why regular shave ice (or even filipino halo-halo) still exists. I'm normally not a huge fan of red bean desserts--if you've never had red bean, consider trying it in bread before trying a whole red bean bingsu--but this was amazing. And you can easily share this with 3-4 people. I'll be going back to try the other flavors for sure.

Tip from Sumi: Bingsu is meant to be mixed up completely so that you don't end up with plain shave ice at the bottom.

The bubble tea is nothing special. They use powdered flavoring (as most places do) and the boba is a bit on the hard/chewy side. You can also tell they don't soak their boba in sweet syrup which can be good or bad depending on your preference--it's not that noticeable unless you're really into bubble tea. Now if they made bubble tea smoothies out of the red bean or matcha ice cream they use in the bingsu, that would be good.."}
{"text":"Best in Town for Curry bun (deep fried bun with curry filling), which is very poplar in Japan and Korea, Cakes are also good because they are more subtly sweet than their American counter parts."}
{"text":"Love the cream bun, light, creamy, and not very sweet.  Mocha cream has a tint of coffee bitterness, perfect to those who do not have sweet tooth.  Red bean paste is fresh and smooth, with bits of walnut inside, but a little too sweet to Asian tastebud.

Definitely a decent Asian bakery."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but I'm a huge fan of Sumi's! I love all of her dessert buns and pastries! The dessert buns are reasonably priced and so many varieties to choose from. I personally love the butter cream, mocha cream and crumbs buns. The fillings aren't too sweet--exactly how I like it. 

I also ordered a small whipped cream strawberry cake from here and it was perfect. I'm usually really reluctant to try cakes because most of the time they tend to be too sweet and sugary. However, the cake from Sumi's is so creamy with the right amount of sweetness--just enough to leave you wanting more. 

I highly recommend Sumi's Cakery for your sweets cravings. If you do decide to buy a cake though, make sure you let her know a few days in advance so she'll reserve one for you. The ones on display are sold fast."}
{"text":"The best cakes in Pittsburgh!  I don't like the American super sweet sugary cakes.  

Sumi's cakes are light and fresh and elegantly sweet.  Favorites are: green tea, strawberry, and sweet potato!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, Coming from NYC where Korean and Chinese bakeries are littered on every Asian neighborhood, I was so relieved to find sumi's Cakery! Their breads are so soft and fluffy and my roommate and I loved everything we bought. I'm a sucker for simple Red Bean buns and they are delicious and have ample amounts of filling. The breads are also very balanced, not overly sweet but hits that accent of comforting. We bought quite a selection and they were still great the next day!
-Chocolate Bun- Not overly sweet despite it's apperance. Baked chocolate bread and inside is just lovingly soft.
-Condensed Milk Bread- Interesting flavor! Super soft and great with jam!
-Mocha bread- Perfect companion with any hot drink!

We also ate one of their Mango Bingsoo's! Super refreshing on a hot day and can feed up to 3 people! The Bakery itself was clean and comfortable and at a good temperature and the Customer service was excellent. I highly highly recommend this bakery as a dessert spot after having dinner in the neighborhood.
Since there's very little competition in pittsburgh it's still Fantastic quality! I'm dreaming about what the cakes must taste like."}
{"text":"I stopped by Sumi's for an afternoon snack and decided on a strawberry cream bun. It was a white bun sliced in half with light, fluffy, strawberry-flavored cream sandwiched in the middle. The cream was the perfect amount of sweet.

I will definitely be back to try the other items."}
{"text":"This is the best asian bakery in pittsburgh. Pink box is not as good. Her prices are OK. I have high standards coming from the West coast and also East coast experiences. She is also very nice. 

Breads: very simple breads, standard. Nothing fancy. Taste is good
Cake: very korean. not too sweet, and unique. I love the sweet potato one. She uses the purple kind. The cake prices were a bit pricey. I got a medium cake for 10 people. Cost 65 dollars.

Boba/bubble tea: hands down the BEST bubble tea in pittsburgh/oakland area (vs rose tea, vs. everyday ramen, vs.  asian place in schendly park)
She also has interesting flavors including Lavender/Rose."}
{"text":"I had two little pieces of strawberry cake which cost total $10. For a small portion of cake I expected to have more strawberry inside. The cake is good, but I think Whole Food's cake is better."}
{"text":"Fantastic little bakery! I was lucky enough to get a strawberry cake as a walk-in and it was wonderful...reminded me of a firmer angel food cake with a very light but fluffy cream frosting. The strawberry flavor came from fresh strawberries scattered throughout the cake and each piece left you wanting more. My partner didn't think the cake was sweet enough but he likes that sugary dense frosting you get at the grocery store so...

When I was in there they also had a sweet potato cake and a rosewater cake. The rosewater is a newer offering and I'm eager to try it in the future. The staff is very welcoming to first-timers and answered any questions I had."}
{"text":"Broke down (it wasn't that hard) & bought a $20 strawberry cake & at first, was a little upset over how small it was (could feed 4 adults max.), but looks are deceiving & this was one of the best cakes I'VE EVER EATEN. 

Upon first bite, the 10,000 Maniacs song, City of Angels (about going to Los Angeles & being shocked at the contrast between the have's grotesque glamour, waste, & consumption & the squalid living conditions of the homeless have-not's) went through my head: Heaven, is this Heaven? O Heaven, is this Heaven...Where we are?

It was in a word: Heavenly, & I'm not a guy that throws that word around lightly.

Moist cake, light frosting...the only thing keeping it from floating away was the generously given, thickly cut, fresh-as-can-be strawberry halves inside the cake.

The cake was full of grace & I could imagine Sumi quietly making it fresh this morning. I could taste the whole thought process, the Genesis / fruition of it from start to finish. I may have tripped out, but it was totally Biblical, maaaaannnnn!

Each bite was a revelation & I was full (& thankful) w/ one quarter slice. It lasted the whole weekend, way longer than I expected it to, & it was a nice treat that taught me a lesson...

Simplicity, elegance, silence, grace & beauty are the easiest things to achieve, yet we choose the opposite so many times to our detriment. We want things but believe that we have to go about getting it in the hardest, loudest, crudest ways possible (U.S. Healthcare, politics, Wall Street, reality TV, etc). If we would just let our objects of desire be, they would come into being.

I am frequently accosted by beggars in Squirrel Hill asking for a dollar or any spare change. I usually shun them but in the future, I may buy them a piece of cake (pun intended) from Sumi's so that they too may experience an early taste of Heaven...

(this is the Eden)."}
{"text":"I'm agreeing with Laura, I was not expecting the Red Bean Cake to be quite as sweet. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but still delicious. 

Sumo is unique, there are lots of baked goods to choose from, some small, plus some larger cakes. 

The cafe area is inviting and comfortable. 

So many new things to try, I'm sure to be back again."}
{"text":"This place may have just earned my favorite to go place for Asian pastries. Freshly made each day to go, there is just a bunch of yummyness and win with each one. Can't really go wrong with any of them. Also, if you are into desserts, please get the Green Tea Ice Cream Shaved Ice combo ... you will so not regret it!"}
{"text":"Excellent and quaint place !! i ordered my favorite soboro bread (korean peanut bread) and the coffee bubble tea. The coffee bubble tea was perfectly sweet and it tasted just like ice coffee :)) would definitely recommend !!"}
{"text":"The buns are buttery and delicious. You absolutely have to go around 11:30-12 when the buns come hot out of the oven. They also have the best bubble tea I've had in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I would not hesitate to give the place five stars. If you are korean or Asian who knows  the delicate taste of red bean paste, get the red bean paste Bun. This small shop makes better red bean bun than major chain bakeries like Paris baguette or tous les jour of Korea. Even my mother, who was traveling from Korea, admitted that sumi's red bean bun was excellent. If you don't know the taste of red beans, start with buttercream bread. My american friend was reluctant to try it at first, but she fell in love with it once she did. Their mocha(coffee) buns are great too, especially when hot. They bake everything on premise everyday. Cash only, and they aren't open on Mondays! (I walked all the way to the bakery last Monday to find it closed :( but this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Sumi for a longest time but they don't open on Mondays (and that's my day off!) so it was just hard to get in for me. Finally I got to try it about a few months ago and oh my goodness, it did not disappoint! Sumi is so different than all the other Asian bakeries that I've been to in Pgh. I absolutely love their coffee, blueberry and matcha green tea buns. All of their pastries are not overly sweet and I appreciate that so much. I've also heard so much about the yummy cakes that I want to get my hands on one day! If you like Korean pastries or sweets in general, you have to give this a try! You won't be disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday after hearing about it throughout college! It's very nicely decorated on the inside and the people working there were really nice and helpful! 

Got the taro cream bun and it was great! Good ratio of cream to Bun and the cream wasn't super sweet or too rich. They have a great range of sweet, savory, and plain buns, including coffee, green tea, and chocolate flavors (to name a few). Serving yourself is easy, as they have a stack of trays near the door for you to easily begin compiling your inevitable multi-bun purchase."}
{"text":"I had the green tea cake which the lady said it was a favorite, when I got it home I tried the cake it was OK it has a moist cake on the inside and a bean paste filling, with a green tea icing.  It is certainly different from your normal cake."}
{"text":"I'm going to write the honest truth. I don't care if it's libellious. If you don't like it, feel free to Sumi.

What to get: Bubble Tea... the amazing black milk tea and the perfect honeydew.
What not to get: Sued
I thought you said you didn't mind getting sued: I changed my mind. So Sumi.

Let's start with the mediocre elements of this Korean bakery. I'm not as impressed as others by the cakes, or the expensive Korean ice.

My experience with Sumi was at first a one-star-type-thing. The young girl (not the owner) was so put off that I came in 15 min before closing. She didn't want to make the shaved ice, and was complaining in Korean to another young employee. She made the ice but wouldn't give it to me because she had no box to put it in (what? I can't even). She begrudingly gave my money back. Said yes to makign me bubble tea instead, but then no because she had no tapioca. Wtf. 

I shouldn't have gone back, but I did. I'm glad I did.

I got the chance to try the ice on my second visit. It's bizarre, indescribable Korean shaved ice, which will set you back $10 but it's the size of a house so it's worth it... maybe. Except I don't really like it. Can't they make it in a smaller size? It's a lot like Taiwanese shaved ice, or a Halo Halo in some ways (from the Philippines). It's an experience, for sure. Not one that I will repeat on a regular basis, but it's well worth a try just to say that you had it. I can't really describe what's in it, it's a little of everything from fruit and ice to syrup and jelly to sweetcorn and bean paste. Bizarre.

While the dessert is just ok, the Bubble Tea is so good I went back for a Honeydew which was also excellent. The Black Milk tea is phenomenal. Tastes like heaven. Very good job. Right up there at the top of Pitt ones. It takes a lot for me to really enjoy a bubble tea, and while Pitt doesn't have the best selection, for me to put this on a level with the excellent teas at I Tea Cafe really shows how highly I regard it. I'm obsessed with bubble teas, and Sumi's has one of the best, if not the best, I've had in Pennslvania. So if you love bubble teas, give these a try.

And if they sold footwear, they'd be Shoe-me Bakery. If they were a cow-milking farm, they'd be Moo-me Bakery. If they were a public restroom, they'd be Loo-me Bakery (or Poo-me I suppose. Ew). If they were a plastic surgery centre, they'd be New-me Bakery. And if they were a singles/hook-up bar, they'd be Do-me Bakery. And I'd visit even more often."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Sumi's on Easter Sunday, and I was shocked to find them open.  Every time I come here they seem to be closed so it was the perfect opportunity to test the store out!

After seeing pictures on Yelp, I knew i needed a fruit tart, and I ordered a blackberry and raspberry fruit tart ($4).  Sumi's makes a whipped cream based fruit tart, which is typically not my favorite type.  However, the whipped cream was light and amazing, probably the best I have ever eaten.  The berries were delicious as well.  The price, though, is even higher than Pink Box across the street.

I have never been to a Korean bakery so I decided to also test out a mocha bun ($1.50).  It tastes almost like a dinner roll filled with mocha flavored whipped cream.  It was different but delicious.  The bread was good, and the filling was very strongly mocha flavored.  I am really looking forward to testing out other kinds of Korean desserts.

I don't know if this was a holiday thing, but the selection was very very small.  There were only two kinds of fruit tarts when I went it, which was fine but smaller than I thought.  Just fyi!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this bakery!! Not only are the pastries delicious but the atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming. The first time that I came here was in the winter. The three of got some buns and a red bean shaved ice. The shave ice was delicious! The owner gave us free barley tea as we were really cold. She was really nice and accommodating. We also got a green tea cake for a friend's birthday.  The cake was small but delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Sumi's for a long while, and I finally stopped by on Sun.  As a counterpoint to the Chinese bakery across the street, Sumi's specializes in Korean baked goods, which are more subtly sweet than their American counterparts.  The format is similar in that the goods are set out, and you make your selections and bring them up to the register for purchase.

During my visit, I selected a matcha bun ($2) and a red bean cake ($2).  I ate the matcha bun immediately, given that it wasn't packaged and the red bean cake was.  As a fan of matcha flavored sweets, I was pleased with the balance between the slight bitterness and sweetness of the matcha coating.  The bun itself was brioche, and was quite fluffy yet substantial.

I tried the red bean cake later and was less pleased with it.  Having visited East Asia a few times, I'm quite familiar with red bean desserts.  My issue here was that I found the amount of red bean paste overwhelming, making the dessert sweeter than I expected for an Asian dessert.  Also, the textures of the cake and the filling were both very similar, and I would have preferred more differentiation (e.g., crispy exterior with soft interior).

Service was friendly, and the interior is much more spacious than it appears from outside, with chairs and tables for those wishing to enjoy their sweets on site.  Like the Chinese bakery across the street, I found the price point to be a bit high, but not totally unreasonable.  I'd return, but I'd get something different than the red bean cake next time.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've tried many of the sweet rolls, and I've never been disappointed.  My favorites are the green tea bun and the larger bun with almonds on top and the cream strip in the middle. everything tastes very fresh and not too sweet. 

The bubble tea is also great, my favorites are mango and lavender. The staff is always super friendly, and it's never too busy."}
{"text":"Having a Korean bakery across from a Chinese one can be a nice thing, since here they make some things not found across the street, like the shaved ice. I've tried some of their cakes, and these have not failed me. The green tea cheesecake is sweet with a good soft consistency and a strong green tea taste. The rosewater cake is probably one of their more unique ones, and it comes with a strong but sweet floral flavor.

On the other hand, I've tried one of their green tea pastries, and that was a bit less memorable. For buns, I do think the ones at Pink Box look a bit more appealing.

I do wish they have longer hours since they do desserts in the form of shaved ice and bubble teas!"}
{"text":"We had the green tea shaved ice and it was the most delicious thing ever. Its a bowl of shaved ice topped with condensed milk, sweet bean paste (which i normally hate but on this it worked so well and was so good), tapioca boba, green tea ice cream, corn flakes, and green tea powder. The perfect balance of textures and sweet without being overly sweet. Its creamy, smooth, crunchy, crispy, chewy, and melty? So much to describe, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Perfect bakery for the typical Korean college student that misses his or her local Paris Baguette or Tous Les Jours. The pastries can get a bit pricey (they start from about $2 and can go up to $6), but that's usually what they cost back at home as well. I always come about thrice a semester to share some shaved ice over good conversation with my girlfriends. The lighting is a little dim, which sets the perfect atmosphere for a little catching up with old friends and the owner is super friendly and sweet as well. 10/10 would recommend their cakes and shaved ice desserts!"}
{"text":"I've grateful for Sumi's because sometimes I want my Korean pastries, and not the French or Chinese kind.

Sumi's offers your traditional Korean buns filled with red bean, but for those accustomed to places like Tour Les Jours or PB, you'll notice that Sumi's bread is a lot more sophisticated and she packs the red bean like no other. Sumi's does similar iterations for other items with the similar bread base with green tea and their cream/mocha cream buns. The selection is not as large as your typical Korean bakeries, but what they do, they do well.

The atmosphere is nice- few tables, high ceiling, and never any crazy bustling. They offer Korean shaved ice, assortment of drinks, and also cakes that light and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!
Everytime ive been there its always a nice atmosphere and a good place to chill!!!"}
{"text":"We tried the green tea bun and condensed milk bread, both of which were great. The waitress suggested us that the bun tastes best when it was warm, and she was right."}
{"text":"Korean bakery
I really like the fresh red Ben bread, butter cream bread,and cake! 
Mocha and strawberry cake are really creamy and soft! 
You must try it*"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday after getting dumplings as I was in the mood for some shaved ice and bubble tea. After a pleasant hour at the cat cafe downtown, my friends and I stopped here for some desserts.

This place is a bakery and a dessert place, all in one. The baked goods are solid, though I wish there was just a bit more variety. As far as the shaved ice goes, it's actually a really good deal. It costs $10 but you get enough of it to feed 2-3 people. We came as a group of five and shared the mango patbingsoo and the red bean patbingsoo. Both were incredibly tasty, although I liked the mango a bit more. The mango was very sweet, and also came with some mochi and red bean itself. Both patbingsoo also had scoops of ice cream and condensed milk, which helped add to the flavors of the dish. I also had a sip of my friend's matcha bubble tea, which was very tasty and had a strong green tea taste to it.

Solid dessert place, definitely worth visiting if you are into shaved ice and bubble tea."}
{"text":"Ok yeah, reviews are right. Pastries are not overly sweet by any means. Super butter creamy no icing. I am very extreme in my sweetness so I love icing. Wasn't a fan of the buttercream pastries, although the bread itself was very good. HOWEVER, the chocolate bun WAS TO DIE FOR. TO DIE FOR. If you've ever had super soft Mexican bread, I.e. conchitas or conchas, THE CHOCOLATE BUN HERE IS THE TAIWANESE VERSION but probably 100 x's better because in assuming they always make them fresh here and are always super soft and ohhhh soooo good. Plus, in Pittsburgh you won't find any Mexican bread so just fill those cravings HERE. :) love, love, love it. Don't sell these out ill have your head. I couldn't wait to take a pic so sorry bout the almost devoured chocolate bun. They have other flavors too like strawberry, green tea, mocha, yeah."}
{"text":"I went to Sumi's Cakery for the first time today and picked up two buns: a mocha cream bun and another that I forget the name of. I didn't think much of the mocha cream bun at first: the flat, nondescript bun wasn't very eye-catching and didn't seem to have much cream in the middle. However, I was proven wrong. It was So. Freaking. Good.

The bread is so soft and fluffy and the cream is smooth, silky, and has just the right amount of sweetness. There's not a lot of cream, but it still packs plenty of flavor and the overall bun is not too sweet. I finished the entire thing in about two minutes--it was that good.

I'm leaving this review at 4 stars until I can return and try some of their other offerings! Will definitely be back (to buy all of the mocha cream buns, that is).  Meanwhile, it's going to take all my willpower not to immediately shove the other bun I bought into my mouth right now."}
{"text":"I loved the desserts here and would definitely go back for more! I had a peanut butter crumb cake sort of dessert with a green tea bun and a sugar twisted doughnut.  It's comparable to the Asian bakeries that Philadelphia has - maybe a bit pricier, but well worth the money! 

I love the interior and the cashier was really nice in explaining what was what. 

The pastries were perfectly fluffy but as usual pastries aren't very filling so it's easy to just scarf down 10 of them. Which I will."}
{"text":"I've gotten a strawberry cake here for my friend ($30) and multiple shaved ice dishes ($10-12) here. I'm always satisfied. 

The cake was light and filling, had a lot of frosting and whole strawberries in the middle layer. The bingsoo is always too large for me and my friends to finish. It's definitely a summer treat that'll cool you down real fast. It's shaved ice in a large bowl topped with ice cream, rice mochi, fruit, sometimes red bean or corn flakes. I've tried the green tea one and that one has all of the above except for fruit with green tea ice cream. The mango one only has mango as its topping. They're also covered in condensed milk as well to give the ice some flavor.

I suggest coming here with an empty stomach and a serious sweet tooth. Whether it's cake or shaved ice or bubble tea or baked goods, you're bound to find something you like."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I just love it! I always stop when I am in Squirrelhill. My most absolutely favorite thing is the bun! It may sound strange to newcomers but it is so delicious and you must try it! There are many different flavors which vary from time to time. I recommend getting there early because they will go fast! The only other thing I've tried is the cheese bread which is also good. I highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. I look forward to returning and trying other items, especially more buns! The prices are pretty average for any bakery I think and the staff is always polite and helpful. Shop is small inside as could be expected from this type of establishment, but there are a few tables to sit if you want. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came here while visiting a friend in Pittsburgh, the place is delightful!!  The owner and her daughters were super friendly and super helpful.  

They helped me pick out a few buns and also helped me pick out their version of a strawberry short cake.  The butter cream that they use is AMAZING and everything was so fresh.  It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like most places and it was light and fluffy, which is hard to come by.  

I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh.  This place is simply AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Small Korean bakery. Love the bulgogi and sausage bread. Beautiful cakes and cupcakes. Limited amount of baked goods each day, come early! They also have binsoo, the Korean shaved ice with red bean and Mochi!"}
{"text":"Sumi's is literally my favorite bakery.The pastries at Sumi's are unique, fresh, and better than a lot of the pastries that I've tried from standard Korean bakeries like Shilla Bakery. 

My favorite bread is the coffee bun and the green tea buttercream bread. I recently tried the raspberry tart, and it was light and tart, and the fruit on top was fresh. That first bite that I tried melted in my mouth. Writing this review is making me crave a Sumi's pastry right now!"}
{"text":"Cakes are the best! Green tea cake and blackberries cake were very good."}
{"text":"The prices were good ($1.50 to $2 per pastry). 

I only had two things: the red bean and the taro cream bun. The red bean was amazing. The taro cream was not, because it simply tasted like it was filled with whipped topping.

I'm giving this an average rating until I return and try the other pastries."}
{"text":"This is a very unique and cute little Cakery! I got the red bean roll from here and loved it. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I work by here and have been wanting to try this place forever. We tried the green tea shaved ice, which was great! My boyfriend wanted to try the green tea flavor and I'm not usually a huge matcha fan, but even though the powder is scattered all over, you can mix it in with the condensed milk and ice, which makes the flavor not as strong. That being said, the fact that I don't really like matcha powder and I still really enjoyed this dessert says a lot, right? They put a lot of condensed milk, which I LOVE, a good amount of azuki bean, green tea ice cream, and a good amount of ice. Service was fast and super friendly, they saw that we were going to sit at a table someone got up from and ran over to quickly wipe the table, which was super nice of them! 

The only thing is I think $10 is a lot for the shaved ice dessert, but they give a lot of it, so I would recommend splitting it with a bunch of people.

I'm definitely coming back to try their bubble tea and various desserts!"}
{"text":"I just cannot describe how awesome their buns are. Even though I have been to Korea, I have to say their bus still stand out. I tried green tea/coffee/cherry flavors and all of them are pretty good. They r very fresh and tasty. But be sure to go early. They won't have anything left after 6p.m. especially on weekdays."}
{"text":"All of the baked items are handmade on the premises!  If you're lucky, you'll even get your pastries warm from the Korean lady who made them.  The selection is a bit limited (no problem, she's really good at what she does make), but the quality is top notch and very authentic."}
{"text":"This is a very cute shop that I actually never even noticed until it was recommended by a friend. The girl working was very timid, which made ordering a little difficult. I resulted to speaking some Korean in order to make sure I was ordering exactly what I wanted. I ordered , (Korean shaved ice with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit). It was very good! I went on an extremely hot day, and this dessert was not overly sweet and very refreshing. I'm glad that I stopped by the shop before Sumi went back to Korea to learn how to make more desserts."}
{"text":"I really like this place. After seeing good reviews from Yelp, I always want to go in there. But they are closed most of time when I went by. One day, my husband and I went by and they were open. We went in for Korean ice cream with shave ice. It is very good. We love it. It is a lot more expensive than what we paid in Phoenix but it is very good. I also bought a few bread/bakery that day. They are very good. They were playing my husband's favorite music when we were there that day. I am going to try their sweet potato cake. 

I actually heard about this place from a cab driver about 7 months ago but I didn't know this is the place. He told me that there is a great Korean bakery very closed to me when he drop me off from the airport. I am glad that I have a chance to try it. 

I told my coworker about this place. She was very excited and called them about a birthday cake. She told me it's a $75 a cake for the size to feed her family. :-) 

It is not cheap but it should be a must try when you are in the town."}
{"text":"My favorite bakery in Pittsburgh. Sumi has an assortment of pastries from sweet red bean, cinnamon rolls to my absolute favorite.. Her buns!! Green tea and blueberry are my favorite because they're just the perfect amount of sweet. Caution: very addictive!! Eat these once a week. The whipped cream cakes are also so delicate, fresh, and beautiful; no butter added, not too sweet and just heavenly. Sweet potato cake and green tea flavors are so unique and flavorful. Shaved ice is also to die for."}
{"text":"Sumi's has pretty good Korean breads, which are the closest to the Japanese kinds I crave. The prices are a little high, but they do have a monopoly being the only Korean bakery in Pittsburgh (that I know of). The green tea mousse cake is pretty good - light and not too sweet. Bubble tea is alright and the Korean shaved ice is massive - a great treat to share with friends on a hot and humid summer day. I definitely prefer Sumi's over the other bakeries in Squirrel Hill. The base bread is always moist and the red bean is just right."}
{"text":"Their bubble tea is quite good as are their green tea buns. I do wish they had more overall selection, as their items are a bit more limited than some other places. But I do like their stuff."}
{"text":"When someone says their food was \"totally different than anything they've ever had before\" this place will legit come to my mind. I've never had a pastry like these before.

I'm not in Squirrel Hill often, but when I found myself here I wanted to hit up this bakery after reading all the stellar reviews. I walked in and had no clue what to get. I'd read about the phenomenal cakes, but it was late in the afternoon and they were all gone.

I went across the baskets of what looked like bread products and asked the employee what to get. I picked the blueberry and pumpkin buns and a cream filled pastry. All the pastries reminded me of a cross between cake and a very sweet bread, if that makes sense. But the cream itself in the one pastry wasn't overly sweet, which was unexpected, but I liked it. Both pastries were light, fluffy and incredibly moist. 

I would love to get my hands on a cake at some point soon. If you're a sweets lover, this is absolutely worth a try for something completely different!"}
{"text":"Got a cake from here for my friend's birthday. Not only was the cake delicious,  it was also beautiful - I loved the printing on the side! The flavor was green tea with red bean filling. It had nice strong matcha flavor and was not overly sweet. I can't wait to try their pastries!"}
{"text":"I was here one and half before the closing time on a Saturday to witness an empty bakery. All they had was few slices of cake (maybe the green tea flavor) and the snack items that don't need any refrigeration. That was disappointing. However, among the few items they had, I had the butter cream puff which is amazing and I got a chance to taste the mocha puff. 
I liked both the puffs. They are good for breakfast, snack or dessert. 

I will go back again early after they open the shop instead of going at the end of the day."}
