{"text":"They didn't want to take my order for pick up 20 minutes till closing and all I wanted was papaya salad. I live 5 minutes away. Guess they're doing good money wise."}
{"text":"Sun's Thai Food & Jerky was a wonderful surprise! We stopped in to grab their lunch special, around six dollars for select entrees and it included a drink, a small appetizer (either soup or a spring roll), and steamed rice. They have a karaoke stage open to the public, and the atmosphere is relaxing and simple. The service was really friendly and was happy to answer any questions we had.  My boyfriend ordered red curry, and I ordered the green, each with pork as the meat. The orders came very quickly, and the appetizers were quite good. The spring roll was a little plain, nothing special, but the hot and sour soup was fantastic. The curry that we ordered for the lunch special came in a bowl with a scoop of rice next to it. It didn't look like a lot of food until they were combined, but I could barely finish half of mine, so don't worry about leaving hungry. Their portions are quite generous. As for drinks, the standard Thai tea and Thai coffee were delicious and included in the special.   The only warning I have to give about this place is how spicy their seven was. I can usually handle spicy food pretty well, but they use baked Thai chilies, and they really bite you back. My boyfriend, however, ordered their ten and absolutely loved it, so I suppose it just depends on if you're a weenie or not. Either way, Sun's Thai Food and Jerky was a delicious spur-of-the-moment choice and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident.  We were looking for a different restaurant and couldn't find it.  We were starving so we pulled into the first restaurant we saw.  Being new to the area, we have tried other Thai places and have been very disappointed.  That being said, this place was awesome!  We had the appetizer sampler, chicken pad thai, beef noodle soup with meatballs and sweet sticky rice with mango for dessert.  The sampler came with spring rolls, two types of rangoons, shrimp and veggie tempura.  They were all very good.  I normally do not like rangoons but I was fighting my hubby for these.  My husband loved his pad thai.  He got the spice level 7 and said it was perfect.  My soup was very good.  The sweet sticky rice made my eyes roll back in my head.  The service was prompt and very friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  The prices were very good.  (pad thai was 8.95 and soup was 9.95) we didn't finish them because the portions were huge so definitely worth the money.  We are so pleased we stumbled across this little gem.  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see that a real Thai place (not a chinese joint that sells Thai food) is finally closer to my place in NLV.  It's a small quiet place that I'm sure gets pretty loud when people get \"jiggy\" on their stage with Karaoke and also instruments for their live band. It's family owned and when our group of 6 entered we were greeted by the wife who is very very friendly.  After our waitress/The Wife brought out our drink orders, she thoroughly answered every question we had, even as redundant as some of those questions might have been. Most places that I've been to, you can tell that the waiter/waitress gets a little annoyed when he/she has to answer the same sort of question. We got our orders within a reasonable amount of time and was always politely asked if we needed anything. We never had to hunt our waitress down for refills or anything extra that we needed, as she seemed to always come at perfect timing and to where it didn't feel like we were constantly hounded.  Now on to the food! The food was good. Sounds like a bland description, but...what can I say? It was good. It was your typical Thai place, where with whatever you order you select your spice level from 1 to 10. For only being the first time that I have eaten here, its kind of hard to tell if the food is consistently good or just for that night. Overall, out of all the orders from our group, me being a taste tester of everybody's order, it was all tasty. I will be going back to see if the food is really legit and not only being good on certain nights. Only draw back that I have, is that they don't have fountain drinks! For soda, they charge by the can...i think $1 each. Which sucks because if you get hella spicy food, you will drink more! But this isn't a reason that I wouldn't come back here.   Unfortunately, they close at 9. I don't remember if this is closing every night, but that night it was at 9 pm. Being a karaoke place, and being that I am with a group of a bunch of friends, we wanted to have fun and sing a little. It was after 9 pm, and we nicely asked if we could still sing and our Waitress, with a big smile on her face, says \"Of Course! Have fun!\" The husband came and turned on the whole Shabang! Disco Lights, fog machine, and even dimmed the lights in the restaurant! He showed us how to use the machine and just let us have a blast. Even their kids were having fun recording us acting like fools on their iPads and phones! The husband and wife were watching and clapping for us even as they cleaned up! We only did maybe 4 or 5 songs and then decided we didn't want to hold them up, but they insisted that they wouldn't mind if we stayed longer. They were Super Nice!  So, 4 stars! I will be coming back! Great Food and Great People that own it!"}
{"text":"This has to be some of the best Thai food we have had in Vegas! The Thai egg rolls are flakey and full of flavor! The pad Thai (chicken, shrimp or pork) is delicious!  The chow mein had so much flavor! They also offer karaoke on the weekends. This place is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife found Sun's Thai Food just a couple of months ago. This place is amazing! They have the best Thai food in Las Vegas, hands down. And I mean every dish! I personally LOVE the Panang Curry. It's family owned and operated and has a very warm, inviting feel. We've been literally eating there twice a week since we found it! The prices are great. Saturday night karaoke is a blast, too! Very laid back and introvert-friendly. One tip before ordering: be sure to order your food between a spicy level 1 and 3 if you are used to ordering at a 5 and 6 (like us) other places. They use very high quality spices and the scale runs much hotter than normal!"}
{"text":"03/19/2014- Went in this evening and the food was great and the staff was fantastic. I love eating somewhere where the owner is in-house and interested in everyone's experience. Great locally owned restaurant. Met Miss Sun in person tonight. What a genuinely sweet person! Swing by and give 'em some business folks! Know where and who your dollar goes too!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place in Vegas, found it by ordering delivery one night on a whim... been hooked ever since... It's my go to Thai restaurant, eat here about once a week. Very authentic Thai food, probably the best Thai food in Vegas for locals and cheap! For those used to American Thai food, this place does Thai spicy, I will normally order an 8 at other Thai places and get a 6 here. The portions are awesome I get two meals out of mine...delivery and dine in is excellent, cute hole in the wall that's 3 mins from my house! Favorite dishes: Spicy Eggplant, spicy mint, green curry, and their beef jerky appetizer! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai good! I got the green curry with tofu and it's amazing! Great spice too! I called in my order for pickup and it was ready in 20 minutes! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"the food is pretty good, but they charge $2.00 to have shrimp as your protein, for which you receive 4 small shrimp. 50 cents per shrimp is pretty ridiculous if you ask me."}
{"text":"I would love to give this establishment 4-5 stars but as I am awake with a roiling stomach at 4AM I simply cannot.  I've ordered take out from them several times and it is always good; delivered quickly and courteously.  This last time however I ordered two curry dishes, one mild, one medium, but both were spiced so heavy as to be barely edible.  Right now I'm wishing I had stopped eating it rather than force feeding myself the spiciest dish I've eaten.  I ordered using the eat24 app so maybe there is a problem with the app or how they process the order.  At any rate I would recommend calling them to confirm on the amount of red pepper in the dish.   I should have sent it back....."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant was great. The food tasted really fresh. I liked the Tom Yum Kai soup and the ginger chicken. The spring rolls were excellent and complimented well by the peanut sauce. The service was very good. It's ideal to have a small family type Thai restaurant close by that serves great food at a reasonable price. We had a pot of soup, appetizers and 3 entrees for four people and the bill came to around $60, great value."}
{"text":"Just tried this today, and it is amazing. Very good food placed a pick order and they are very quick"}
{"text":"This restaurant is honestly the best Thai Restaurant I've ever dined at in Vegas. I've been a regular for two years now, coming up on three. Since I'm Laos, I have an addiction to my cultural foods. I cannot go a week without stopping by and ordering my favorite bowl of Phö, and don't get me started on their amazingly spicy Red Chicken Curry #10 #10 #10!!! Yes I eat their delicious foods at an extreme spiciness for my tongue. I crave the peppers that go straight through me and burn my asshole. Thank you Sun's for being the best Thai Restaurant in the world!                                                - Omar"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice and cozy to dine in and the food is great.  The quality of the food is very good, but the portions are small and it costs around 8-10 bucks per dish.    I left happy but we had used around $30 for two people ordering only 2 entrees and one appetizer plus drinks..  I feel like the price doesn't justify the portion but overall the restaurant feels great for what it offers.  Definitely a place to remember if you want to dine near NLV."}
{"text":"Promptly seated, service was on point. Thai tea was strong and amazing. We started with the fresh spring rolls and egg rolls. They were both excellent and the peanut sauce for the spring rolls was delicious! I ordered the Green Curry Shrimp at a level 1 (I'm a wuss but I'm trying), it was perfect, I could eat it without a problem. My fiancé, he's a heat nut, ordered the Drunken Noodle at a 10. Everywhere else he orders it at a 10 and it's no problem, here he couldn't finish it! He loved it, no where else compares to here bar none! We will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. I will definitely be coming back!  I grew up with laos style papaya salad and they serve it here! I don't know if the owners are Laotian or thai but they made it taste great!"}
{"text":"I loved the food! I am a super picky eater and they totally 100% catered to what I wanted! Service was great! Had a small problem due to my know mistake and the management graciously took care of my problem! Would 100% recommend my friends and family to this place! Oh and a side note the jerky is wonderful! Great service and great food! Where  could you go wrong!"}
{"text":"My go to spot down the street. Red curry, pad thai, thai chicken wings, and of course the sticky rice with mango are my favs. The spice levels have been a bit higher recently. Usually a 5 is just right, but now it feels like it's on the brim of being inedible. We'll see next time!"}
{"text":"Such a HUGE disappointment. I seen this place have an opening soon sign up a couple years ago. I was so excited for it. But, before they opened. We relocated to Henderson. And never thought of it again. Until now. We ordered take out from here since we were on this side of town. We placed the order online which was convenient, to view the menu and order. I read the reviews before hand and got a feel of what's good. After reading, I decided I'll go with the Pad Thai. My husband likes to stick with typical entrees. It's either orange chicken or sweet and sour chicken/beef. They had the option for sweet and sour chicken, Thai style. I told him how it'll be different from what he's used it. He agreed to get it but just wanted to make it wasn't spicy. Double made sure I didn't order it spicy. We also order the chicken satay with peanut sauce.   It took us longer than expected to arrive there. I think we got there 20 mins passed our expected pick up time. It was stormy out and it delayed driving time. We got to where we were going. Which was up the street to eat our food.   The only thing good was the chicken satay and the rice that came with the sweet and sour chicken.   The pad Thai was gross. I don't know if it was the oil the cook it in or just the seasoning. It was honestly the worst pad Thai I ever had. I even made it myself once, and I screwed it up. Plus, the noodles all stuck together. Like when you leave your pasta sitting in the strainer too long. That may be due to is arriving late. But I don't think too much of it was. It looked like it was just thrown in the pot and then top with everything to heat up.   The sweet and sour chicken was a mess. They wrapped in a bag and all the liquid went into the bag. Which I guess is better than it going over everything else. My husband didn't eat much of it. I didn't think of anything till he said I could have it tomorrow. And he just ate the rice and chicken satay. I asked him what was wrong and he said he didn't like it and that it was really spicy.  I told him I ordered it not spicy and maybe it's just a kick to the dish and that'll I'll save it for later. I tried it. Not only was it too spicy. The chicken was bad. You could totally taste that the chicken had expired already. I almost threw up. My stomach is more sensitive to his. I can handle spicy food. I ordered my pad Thai spicy. But the chicken...bad. I've cooked bad chicken before and it was the same. When you smelled the dish, you can smell the spoilage of it. Just covered in spice. My husbands stomach didn't feel well the rest of the night. It makes me wonder if anything else was good.  I was excited for this place. I always bought Sun's beef jerky at Sam's Fantastic Swamp Meet for as long as I could remember. I don't know if this was just a bad day for them. Maybe they didn't check their product. Maybe the cook was tired. The reviews seemed trustworthy. I don't know. I just know I'm bummed as hell.   I really thought this was going to be a five star."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, never tried this place before, and absolutely wow! Great food! Pad Thai, chicken fried rice, and garlic and peppered chicken are amazing. Delivery said it would take 55 minutes. Took maybe 30. I will be eating here often."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service good. However they charged me 30 percent gratuity with a party of 6, 4 of them kids and two of the kids under 5. Probably not dining in anymore!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was great as well. The portion size is perfect for the price. Highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Everything was very fresh and delicious. I ate here 5 times over an 8 day span. I tried many things and they were all equally delicious.   They were very accommodating of special dietary requests such as no fish sauce, low oil.  The two highlights for me were the spring rolls and the sticky rice and mango. I just ordered rice papers off Amazon so I can try and make my own raw spring rolls."}
{"text":"With all of these 4 and 5 star reviews, I feel like I must have eaten in a different place!  Yes, the service was friendly and quick, but the place felt dirty and the food was really bad.  My shrimp pad see ew was very bland and had exactly 5 dirty-tasting shrimp in it and my husband's curry was a big bowl of super liquidy sauce with some very rubbery chicken and peanuts floating in it.  The crab rangoons we ordered as an appetizer were some of the worst I've ever had.  It makes me sad giving them a 1-star rating.  I really do wish the best for mom-n-pop places like this.... especially when they are friendly.  But I have to be honest.    I should have known when we were the only people eating there at 6:30 on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"On 2/14/15 we ordered take out for family. All 5 of us got deathly ill. Will never go thete again. Clean your act up sun. I would not recommend this restaurant unless you eant to get sick"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé been driving by this place for months joking about the name.  So we stopped in yesterday for lunch the joke was on us the food is amazingly good. The staff was very friendly, place was clean and the food was incredible. I got the Mongolian beef spiced number seven it was perfect. She got the red chicken curry spice three so delicious. The chicken satay & Beef jerky appetizer was to die for."}
{"text":"Sun's is my regular Thai food restaurant. I order their chicken panang curry and chicken pad thai from there at least once every two weeks. If you ever get the pleasure of meeting Sun, she's really sweet. More importantly, her food is AMAZING! I just checked out Basil Thai Fusion and their pad Thai was so bad, I literally only took one bite! Oh, and her beef jerky is delicious too. I always ask for the heavily peppered flavor. I've never dined in before but, I've seen karaoke going on in there one night lol. Really comfortable environment. If that's not your thing and you really want to dine in, Lotus of Siam on E Sahara is one of the best in town as well."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai food restaurant. The food is perfect every time, the staff and especially Sun is so amazingly sweet and helpful. The live music is a nice touch. It is very homey and I could eat here for the rest of my life and be totally happy. I am obsessed with Thai food so I am pretty picky. The beef jerky is how I found out about this place. Best beef jerky I have had to this day, Thai Spicy #10 delicious. I was at the Summerlin Farmers Market and on my way out saw the booth and thought I would give it a shot and I fell in love! I continuously recommend this place to everyone I know. I am a bit new to this reviewing thing so usually no idea what to say. It is fantastic though so feel free to ask questions and I will always answer them honestly."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT DELICIOUS AWESOME!!! This place was great! Our family usually drives allll the way to Chinatown to get that Authentic Thai food taste .not anymore..so glad to have found a place in North LV that tastes like we're sitting in a restaurant somewhere in Thailand! My daughter and I are big on Thai food..we ordered Pad Si Ew, Green Curry, Beef Jerky, and Spicy Chicken fried rice. EVERYTHING was excellent with a good size serving portion! The beef jerky is BOMB! The texture was awsome..crunchy, tender, and tasty all in one bite! Never even thought of trying Thai beef jerky before but that was excellent! The service was great, everyone was very pleasant. The Restaurant was CLEAN which is a big plus! Oh and yes spicy 10 means spicy 10!!!! Also it looks like they may have a live band because they have a little live band set up for after hours. This is a NLV must try! You will not be disappointed.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is despicable! They don't deserve any stars. In fact their stars should be in default! I ordered delivery from here a few days ago and it took over two hours for it to be delivered. I live a little over a mile away from this place, there is no excuse for the service to take that long. When the boy came to the door, he explained that they only had half the order ready. That's right. HALF THE ORDER! You have the nerve to show up with an incomplete order and expect me to be happy and he asked for a tip. I refused to take an incomplete order, but I had already payed for the food. So I proceed to call the manager asking them to take what they brought me back and to replace it all in a timely manner (I did not want to wait another hour). She very rudely told me that I should take what was there and wait for the rest to arrive. To which I asked her if she liked to eat cold food, because if I waited for the other half of my food the half I received would be cold. Then she hung up on me! So I call back, and by now I'm LIVID. I ask for the manager again, and when she received the call she told me that \"this is how she does her business\" and to \"stop calling her with complaints.\" Needless to say, I cancelled my order and demanded my money back and told her that she had lost a valuable customer (I eat A LOT of Thai food, and have been looking for a place, so she lost my $50 a week). This place lacks good customer service and management and should be closed until they learn to respect the people that keep their doors open."}
{"text":"Not only was the food great, but the customer service was top notch as well!  I came here with my friend a few nights ago and ordered the shrimp thai, only because i had been craving it for so long.  Everything on the menu looked delicious! We will definitely be coming back here ago soon."}
{"text":"Really yummy food, the Pad Thai is saucy, not dry like some places. Wish I could eat here more often but I work too far away. If I was closer I'd eat there every day. So good!  Do yourself a favor and grab some beef jerky on the way out for a treat later. Love the hot jerkys they have."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with Thai cuisine because I grew up with Thai and Laotian friends.  True authentic Thai restaurants in Las Vegas are unfortunately scarce in this city.  I usually only try new Thai restaurants based on word of mouth but I was meeting up with a friend so we decided on a place nearby.  I went to this restaurant based on the good reviews on Yelp.  As I was waiting for my friend to show up I ordered the traditional favorite Thai Beef Jerky.  I looked at my plate when the waitress brought it out and notice that the majority of the jerky was cut almost as thin as mini straws.  And at first glanced I could tell that the jerky was fried to the point where it was dried out and hardened.  I mentioned this to the waitress and her attitude was \"next time tell me not to fry it too much\".  I didn't like her attitude so I told her I found this place on Yelp then her attitude change.  She didn't offer to change out the jerky but she was more attentive after that.  The jerky was definitely flavorful and would have been perfect minus the cost effective size and dehydrated brittle state.  I sucked it up and my friend and I tried to finish the $7.95 appetizer.  We ordered the Drunken Noodles(which was not on the menu).  I thought that was a plus.  The flavor was authentic and perfect with some minor tough rice noodles that I encountered.  Their red curry flavor was right on but the chicken I could tell was a bit dry.  Their Papaya Salad flavor was perfect with the exception of the equal amount of carrots to papaya portions.    It's a simple little restaurant with a definite mom and pop feel to it.  Overall I enjoyed their authentic flavors. And would have given them four stars if they had stayed more true to quality on a few of their dishes.  But being it's location on the Northwest side of town I would have to say I consider this 100% Thai as you're going to get."}
{"text":"Great Food!  Love the Singapore Noodles !  They make everything exactly as requested and spicy is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Great jerky, soups and entrees.  Portions are large and big enough to share. Small, but warm atmosphere. Karaoke available on Friday and Saturday nights. Definitely a must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and I love Sun's. If you like it spicy be careful;  a level 6 tasted like a level 10. Delicious,  and authentic."}
{"text":"My nephew and I were in Las Vegas for estate settlement of my brother, his dad.  I've seen this place a few times when visiting over the years.  I wish now I would have tried it then.  I love red curry and this was the best I've had and the largest portion.  My nephew had never had Thai food and tried the Chow Mein, I think because the name was familiar....  He liked it and took what was left home for lunch the next day.  The wait staff were very personable and put up and helped me with my long forgotten never grasped speaking of the language.  That was enjoyable.  She said I did ok.  It's only been 41 years since I was in Thailand.  She has never been, but plans to in a year or so.  I doubt I'll ever return to Vegas.  But if I do, this will be on my list of places to eat.  I regret not trying it before. Sa wa dee and kaup coon mach cup!"}
{"text":"Pineapple Fried Rice is so good that we went back for it twice in one week. Loved the chicken satay as well. Ain't nothing better than a delicious restaurant tucked away where you don't have to wait for a table. Eat in! Sun is a riot!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and it was much better durning lunch service. I went this past Saturday on the 11th and ordered 3 orders of basil chicken and it was the worst I have ever had. The chicken was really dry and looked like it had been soaking in sauce to try and moisten it . I have no clue what happened but it didn't even look like the same dish I order at lunch. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've had in the area. Their curries are absolutely amazing. The servers are all very friendly and the restaraunt has a really welcoming vibe to it. Definitely give them a try if you haven't."}
{"text":"I've had jerky from their stand at the farmers market and loved it. Today was my first time ordering food from them through Yelp and they arrived 20 minutes earlier than expected which was wonderful! The delivery lady was very nice! The food was good! I was craving fried tilapia for a while so it really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This is my very first Yelp review, and unfortunately, it is not going to be a positive one.  I apologize in advance for the length. I decided to try Sun's based on it being close to my house and having pretty decent Yelp reviews. I placed an online order through Yelp and was given a delivery time of 1 hour. This was fine with me, given that the order was processed through a third party; however, when the driver arrived, he had only half of my order with him. The driver left what he'd brought with my daughter and returned to the restaurant to get the rest.   I called Sun's to find out  A) what happened to the rest of my order in the first place and B) how quickly I could expect the rest of the food to arrive, since half of my family's dinner was sitting on the counter getting cold. Initially, the person on the other end of the line was apologetic and she told me that the driver would return but he had other stops to make first. When I told her that I was not okay with basically being placed at the end of the line to get food that should have been delivered, she started talking over me and her tone got a bit nasty, telling me that it wasn't right for me to call upset about my order. Admittedly, I was dissatisfied and I was not a sweetheart during this call, but I was not inappropriate or abusive. I am not \"that\" customer. Despite the fact that I SAID my reason for calling was to make sure I got the second half of my order quickly, we had a ridiculously long exchange and the girl on the phone ultimately told me that \"of course\" they would include extra stuff and she \"didn't know what I wanted them to do.\"  I think the extra stuff was supposed to placate me. She actually hung up on me because what I wanted was just the stuff I'd paid for in as timely a manner as possible, and I was insistent about that.  At this point I was livid, so I decided to write this review rather than call her back--I very likely would have been inappropriate if I'd called her back right away. However, after half an hour of waiting for the rest of my food, I did call back and I asked to speak with a manager or owner.  I was told that he was not in. I wanted to be done with Sun's at this point, so I told the girl (same one from the first call) that I did not appreciate being hung up on and that I'd waited so long and was so unhappy with the service that I wanted a refund. She claimed that the hang up was an accident but managed to tell me in the same breath that I could have been \"nice about it.\" It's tough to be nice when the person you're dealing with gets defensive about a mistake and wants to talk over you instead of actually hearing what you're trying to say. While we were talking, the delivery driver finally showed up and I ended up sending him off with both halves of the order. Needless to say, my first experience with Sun's will be my last.   To his credit, the owner's son did call back to apologize and to make sure that the refund was taken care of."}
{"text":"Be careful what you order because the portions are extremely generous! Service staff is great, atmosphere is fun. We came here for lunch so I wonder if you can karaoke or the stage is simply for live music during dinner service? Either way, food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, cozy atmosphere! The place is small but very cute, they have a band stand with musical instruments- live music on weekends. Variety of beers, wine and sake. We had seafood curry with vegetables and pineapple fried rice. Our order arrived quick! It was so good! The server helped us to make a choice btw, even though in many places if you asked \"what's good?\", you would get the inevitable \"everything \". She said pineapple fried rice is children's favorite because of pineapples, raisins and cashews, its sweet. She explained the difference between several curries that they had on the menu. Also for most of dishes you can choose your meat - beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, combo or seafood combo.   We'll be coming here again"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I gave this place a try, my family and I came here last night and we all loved it!  The food came out super hot and fresh My daughter got the pineapple fried rice, it's not your normal fried rice, it was a little spicy and I think it had yellow curry on it. Overall a really good dish!  I had the panang curry, it seemed a little thinner than the other thai place I visit but the flavor was amazing! I will definitely be ordering this again!!   The service we received was the best service I have had in a long time! I can't remember his name but he was so nice and helpful!   But BEWARE.. the spice level here is more than you may expect, I got a 4 and it was extremely HOT! if you like spicy like I do maybe try a 3.."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  I've had the chicken pad Thai and yellow curry and both were really good.  The yellow curry is the best I've tasted.  It was just the right amount of kick with a spice level of 5.  Will be recommending to my family."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a small place. I tried the BBQ pork, tasty with lots of flavor. Panang curry, not too bad. And the chicken Satay is marinated, unlike other places I've tried where it's plain flavor needs to be masked with peanut sauce. I'll be ordering again in the future..."}
{"text":"5 stars for the delicious and authentic Thai food 5 stars for the super friendly service 5 stars for the delicious homemade jerky + they have salmon jerky!!!"}
{"text":"We've tried every Thai place in the area multiple times. None compare to Suns! The Green curry is the BEST! Never unsatisfied"}
{"text":"The beef jerkey is the bomb! I also ordered a plate of garlic peppered chicken  it was very good.  Ill be coming back most definitely!"}
{"text":"The fam and I went here to eat some delicious Thai-style pho. It didn't disappoint. The bowl was perfectly sized and the taste of the broth was very good and flavorful. I just wish we could order extra noodles. The bowl was $8.95, still reasonable and comparable to other like restaurants. This restaurant felt comfortable and inviting when you walk in. They have karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights. They have excellent customer service. The staff was friendly and nice. Will definitely go back and try other entrees."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, the service was good, but the atmosphere was nothing special. It was a little more spicy than other Thai restaurants spicy scale, but I liked that. The portions were decently sized. I'll definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"We had a person that was leaving the company and decided to eat here for their last lunch. Called ahead of time with orders and the time frame we would be there. When we arrived the food was set up on tables waiting for us to sit and enjoy. A little confusing of which order was which but it made for a good time and no one was upset. We all kind of shared anyway. The staff was great and even accommodated for more then we told them. Overall good, will bring the family next visit."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food spot in Vegas! I order delivery at least twice a week and it's consistently amazing! The staff is always friendly and they're vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! Enough said!!!!! Delicious, pleasant, and exceptional service...oh did I mention DELICIOUS! Food was gone before I remembered I should have photographed it."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Las Vegas.  I switch between the curries and papaya salad.  I make a point to eat here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! It's hard to post a picture because all you want to do is eat it the moment it arrives. Yellow curry is fabulous!!"}
{"text":"This place pissed me off......they said my order wasn't ready yet and I waited 30 mins while my order sat on a table."}
{"text":"After months of seeing this place, I finally decided to try it. I got Thai iced tea, chicken wings and spicy catfish curry. I've tried many other Thai spots here in Vegas but I can honestly say this is one of the best ones. The dessert, especially. Mango sticky rice is amazing!! I'm so glad this place is here!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go eat Thai food I just don't recommend ordering for delivery. Other than that their food is always fresh and their Thai tea is perfect."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were at the hair cut place next door and we saw this place decided to try it out. We ordered the Thai tea, pineapple fried rice , yellow curry , and pad see yew. Amazing, great service , awesome food! Definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great flavor! They start at 5 on the spice scale and go to nuclear! If you don't like spicy food order Cantonese. The delivery is good, but some thai food just doesn't travel well. This and Archies are the only ones that get the flavors."}
{"text":"I ordered online right when they opened and when I got there I did have to wait a little for my food but they offered me Thai tea which I know I don't like so she brought me Thai coffee for the inconvenience it was delicious! The chicken & shrimp pad Thai is delicious and I also got a complimentary soda and soup. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have only ever visited Sun at Fantastic Swapmeet, but I never even liked jerky until I found her! She makes the most flavorful, enjoyful jerky!"}
{"text":"Wife and I wandered into this place craving some Thai food. There are quite a few choices nearby and this one by far surpasses them all!  Service: The service is great. The family that runs the restaurant is very friendly and punctual. I've seen them go out of their way to deliver food and make meals correct. They don't skimp when you say you want it spicy so buyer be advised. Don't say you want it super hot and then wuss out it ruins the restaurant for everyone. They can get backed up with orders but be patient the food is worth it.  Atmosphere: Although I rarely dine in the few times I have, everything is well taker care of and clean. The tables are clean and not sticky and the cutlery is clean and not cloudy. The restaurant itself has a stage and a bar (that may or may not serve liquor not sure). The stage is for events and karaoke but haven't seen them having music etc. so possibly something that was left there from the previous establishment. There is a significant amount of Thai decor so it really adds to the experience. Overall humble and clean.  Food: The food is great. Everything I've ordered from the; whole fried fish to eggplant to fried rice to tom yun gong and etc. has come out fresh tasting and well seasoned. The Thai flavors of sour, slightly sweet and SPICY really shines through. I love that I can say I want it spicy 10 out of 10 and I get exactly that. Not some watered down \"well I put a lot of chili sauce in there for you\" hot, I'm talking I added a few fresh thai chili peppers prepare to burn. I hate that most Thai restaurants throttle back the spice to appease their Americanized audience. My wife is Thai and loves her food spice level LAVA as do I. So in short if you're looking for authentic tasty and fresh thai food then this is the place to be!  -Side note: the thai jerky is also delicious. It's not your typical jerky because they tie all the spices normally used in their dishes into the jerky. It is unique and tasty.  -Side note2: Dishes I reorder again and again; fried catfish with curry sauce, eggplant, sum tam, pad thai- with spice (different flavor than your typical sweet pad thai much better imo)  tl;dr: great restaurant. family owed and operated. friendly. clean dining experience. genuine thai food. don't skimp on spiciness so beware. try the jerky."}
{"text":"I'm here twice a month and everything I ordered are always perfectly prepared, delicious, and fresh. Lunch Specials M - F 11am to 3pm at $6.99, small portions but includes: salad or soup & rice."}
{"text":"I came here especially for jerky- better than Alien jerky in my opinion. The food is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Today I ate the Thai fried rice and the Spicy Catfish. I was in heaven, I have never had a better Catfish dish in my life. The sweet chilli sauce was spectacular, the sweet owner suggested I try a level 2 because a 5 would be too hot for me. (I'm more comfortable lying to thai women about my heat level tolerance), I accepted, but refused the glass of water to keep my pride intact. I truly wish you'd come and try this restaurant. I realize that my other reviews don't make me a food critic, but this place is up there with Poke Express in quality and overall experience. The Thai fried rice was out of this world, their Thai beer sealed the deal for me. If you're out for a sports night, come here first then go to your bar. Excellent service, I am not sure, but it might be a family run restaurant, everyone is very nice and the food is made to order delicious. Mayor, if you're reading this post, you gotta drive up here for the Spicy Catfish."}
{"text":"Great Thai place! We sampled the jerky and it was really good. We had red curry and the chick satay. Both delicious. And of course, Thai ice tea was great! Definitely watch out with the spiciness - we ordered level 8 and it was very hot! They give you a pretty good amount of rice with each meal as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food one day and my sister said \"look! A sign that says Thai food!\" And so we visited this this little hole in the wall... and I became addicted.   You know you've been somewhere a few too many times when you walk in and right away the waitress says \"you want your usual table?\"   I've taken just about everyone I know to this restaurant and everyone loves it!  I'm actually pretty surprised to find bad reviews about this place. It's a little too mom-and-pop for some people, I guess. It's family owned and operated. If you're looking for fancy, look somewhere else. If you're looking for amazing Thai food, look no further!   My favorites are the Thai Beef Salad and the Chicken Panang (coconut curry). And of course the Thai iced tea can't be passed up... just be careful with the spice level. It goes from \"a bit of a kick\" to \"holy shit\" real quick. Stick to the lower levels unless you have a death wish.   Sun is the owner, and yes, she's a bit chatty and her English is hard to understand sometimes. But she's a very sweet older lady who loves what she does. No need to insult her appearance! Did your mothers teach you no manners??"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Eat there! Worth every cent! Food is fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. Our favorite is the Pad Woon Sen. Yum!"}
{"text":"As a family we went here to celebrate an extended Mother's Day dinner & the service & food was great . I like the ambiance with the string lights & disco lights for the karaoke nights . We actually enjoyed Sun's jerky before we found out she has her own Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and service was friendly and prompt. Glad to find a Thai place up on the north side that I can frequent"}
{"text":"Met Sun at the flea market and tried her jerky, she gave me a menu for her restaurant and since I love Thai food it was a no-brainer. I couldn't have been happier, fresh food great taste with friendly service. They also had karaoke in a very intimate setting. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I judge thai restaurants by the quality of the Laos style papaya salad and this place is My new favorite Thai restaurant. You need to try their Tom Sap soup (hot and spicy soup) also. Everything is So so goood!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Very friendly service. My favorite thai food place in LV !  2 thumbs up !!"}
{"text":"Just took some tom yum noodle soup for take out, i live about 10mins away from this restaurant and when i got home to eat it the plastic lid from the tom yum soup cracked and melted off into my soup, i had to throw away the soup because pieces of the plastic melted into my soup and there were some broken pieces on top on my soup..."}
{"text":"Came here twice after painting my rental home and boy was I glad to be here after a hard days work.  My parents know the owner of the restaurant, but we live pretty far away so we don't normally get a chance to visit here often. But the two nights I've had my meal here were spectacular. Coming from a Thai family, we really do know what places are a hit and what places are a miss when it comes to Thai food, and this place sure is a hit. The family come from the northern region of Thailand so definitely try their Isan food!  As most reviewers have mentioned, their spice is actually a lot hotter than most restaurants so whatever you're normally comfortable with at most restaurants, take it 2 or 3 numbers down because my 6 Tom Yum tasted like an 8. Some foods I would definitely recommend would be Nam Tok (waterfall beef) which was seasoned perfectly, Tom Yum which had huge flavor and you can tell they use natural herbs and aromatic to get that big taste, and my favorite by far is their BBQ Pork (which is a bit misleading because it's actually translated to grilled pork in Thai since BBQ Pork is normally known as Char Siu here in the States.) This restaurant truly does pride itself in serving authentic Thai food (I can say this because the owner kept asking my parents if it tastes just like food from the motherland.)  All in all this place is great for authentic Thai food with big flavor. If you are in the North Las Vegas area and you want some Thai food, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in a long time. I asked for the papaya salad to be 8 out of 10 spicy and get this, they actually gave me 8 out of 10 spicy! Yes, me, a white boy actually got the spice level he asked for! The jerky with that sauce was awesome! Great service. Decent prices. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Husband and I visited Sun's Thai Food on a friday night around 7:30. Restaurant was pretty empty with about 4 tables occupied. As soon as we walked in we noticed the string lights running across the ceiling and the live music on the stage. I'm not sure if the gentleman was the owner along with his wife? sister? female friend??? I'm not sure, but they were both singing karaoke and soon a few other diners were singing as well. It's a cute atmosphere, be prepared to sing if you're into that.   Food was great as well. Tom Yum Soup with veggies was SPICYYY holy goodness, but so delicious. I ordered a bowl expecting it to be small, but it's actually really big. We also ordered chicken satay and mint chicken. I was not a fan of the mint chicken, mainly because I didn't taste any mint. Chicken satay was grilled perfectly, but the peanut sauce was served hot, which i thought made it taste odd. I'll probably return here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I just finished eating here for the first time. The food was very good and I was wise to go with the spice recommendation of a 3 out of 10 for medium heat. This is a neat little place with great service and food.  The prices and portions are also very good.  I'm always up for some good Thai food.  I'm really a fan of the disco ball green light thing but it will not stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors in multiple dishes. If the papaya salad was as spicy at 3, I can't imagine a 5 or higher. However, the flavors are awesome. Tom Kha soup could be easier to identify the lemon grass and keep it out of each bite. These are all nitpicky things because all of the food was phenomenal. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We have seen this place so many times and finally decided to try it last night. I must say, this is some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten. We had it delivered and it was still steaming hot. The flavors were so amazing. We usually do not go back to a restaurant more than once because there are so many great places to eat in Las Vegas, however, we will be returning to this one. What a gem this place is!"}
{"text":"Iove this place. Food is always so flavorful and delicious. I can't get enough of it. I love their lunch special. And their jerky is excellent too"}
{"text":"Ordered the 8-piece crab rangoon and have to say the sauce was good and the crab rangoons were crispy with a tasty filling. Also ordered the shrimp Thai fried rice, has good flavor, you can choose how spicy you want it, only flaw was although the shrimp was cooked well, I was disappointed that I paid $2 extra for shrimp and yet only got like six pieces. I ordered a Thai tea when I picked up my food and I have to say it tastes really good compared to others. Overall customer service was friendly, fast, and the flavor of the food was worth getting."}
{"text":"This is a great gem, excellent food, nice wait staff and 40's music during lunch! Very enjoyable. Green curry chicken delish."}
{"text":"Normally this place is good but unfortunately this time we ordered online it was a bad idea when I come to pick up my food this women told me she male a mistake an give my food to a wrong guest so I said it's ok I'll wait for my food I thought they ware going to remake it but as little I did know there driver go to deliver the food to the right person and it was trying to get my food from them... so when he come back and the girl ask him where the other food was he said to her that the guest was already eating it so by then 20 minutes pass by and they told me we are really sorry we will remake it just give us 10 minutes... so I just told them no thanks and I left . Is unacceptable they are trying to do this... I been in the restaurant bussines for many years  and is no way any restaurant try to get the food back in to the restaurant to give it to an other guest after they already take it home. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Although little bit out of the main strip of Las Vegas.. Looking for local Thai food. Never regretted this place .. Referred here by a Thai guy who I met at Pier 39..   Worthy .. Big serving too .. Lots to choose from. I let me Thai Roommate order..   Verdict.. YES ..."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Their curry is my favorite. And the crab rangoons! Fun and relaxing environment, and the staff here is top notch!! I would recommend everyone needs to try! And check out their beef jerky. It's phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It is super close to where we live and the food is awesome! Everyone here is very friendly also, and the prices are more than fair. Just a word of warning however, when they ask you how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1-10, 3 is medium! Our waitress told us this as well, I ended up getting a 6 on the spicy scale and it was pretty spicy, but I'm into that so it was great for me. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Usually very good but tonight everything was cold. Appetizers were cold, rice cold, curry was was good but still not very hot. This was reported to me by my daughter who usually loves this place! They did nothing to resolve the situation... they paid the bill and will have to think twice about returning. I will too... word travels fast!"}
{"text":"The jerky and thai iced tea is amazing I'll definitely be coming back for more. I would have given 5 stars but the waitress was disrespectful."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai place! I've never really been inside and had a sit down dinner, I always have the food delivered or pick up. However, I think they have live music on some nights which I bet is entertaining! They charge a $5 delivery fee after a few miles, but it's far beyond reasonable! This is a super cute family owned business, with exceptional Thai food! They're always sweet and accommodating. They give out coupons, and always give back if they make a little mistake (I find businesses don't really do this anymore...) One of my favorite things about this place is also the prices vs portions. I could feed at least 2-4 people with a couple entrees. When I order alone, I ALWAYS have left overs. I'm pretty partial to curry, however, every single thing I've tried has been good! I always order about a spice level 1.5/2. I'm not a huge spicy eater, but I do like it, and I fine it to be the perfect medium between not really spicy, but you can taste the spice enough to really enjoy it but not have the after burn.   Red curry: 10+  Veggie Soup: 9+  Glass Noodle Soup: 10+  Drunken noodles: 10+  Tofu Nuggets: 8+ the ginger sauce was 10+  Pineapple rice: 10+  Thai tea: 8+   I love Sun's and everything about it. :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The Thai tea is to die for and the pad Thai is out of this world"}
{"text":"My second time trying Thai food...and this place makes me want more. Delicious!! The atmosphere was great plus they have karaoke on Fridays and  !!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is better than most. The Pad Thai, shrimp and chicken was great, I found the dish to be more sweet than what I am used to, and would say that it was a pleasant surprise. I like Spicey food and choose the 4/10, which I found to be good for someone who likes spicey."}
{"text":"Very happy with our last minute stop at Sun's.  We were driving down Craig Rd. trying to figure out what to eat.  Newly Vegan, our choices are often limited.  We were picking up something to go and after seeing the menu and speaking to a very nice woman (daughter of the owner I believe) she assured me they could make the dish with no animal stock, egg or milk.  We were very pleased with the flexibility and sincerity she showed and though I thought to give 4 stars which is \"Yay I'm a fan\" I went with the 5 because her service to us really showed that they could work with our food limitations!   We added extra vegetables once we got home to our pineapple fried rice & masaman curry (namely cauliflower & bamboo shoots) but the flavor was PERFECT and that is the main point of anything.   We were very happy with the flavor & will definitely return!  Thank you so much."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue..I used to work up the street from here and on a whim we decided to try it out.  Pleasantly surprised at how yummy it was. We had the pad thai and yellow curry , chicken patay and shrimp rolls.  I could drink the sauce with the satay...sooooo delish.  Pad thai was good and the curry was smooth and rich.  We have gone here numerous times since and have never been disappointed.  Love the jerky too!!!!"}
{"text":"Location is the epitome of a hole in the wall- from the outside. Inside, the decor is cute and full of personality. There's a stage area and instruments set up for karaoke and performances, though I've never seen them actually in use.  Sun herself is there at the counter, day or night, offering samples of thai jerky and anything else on the menu- what that includes, exactly, I'll never really know, since I only get the jerky. They do have cute chalkboard menus suggesting chef specials and customer favorites, but I still come for the jerky..  The regular beef teriyaki is my jam, though I sometimes snag a bag of the hot for my guy- all of their hot flavors are generally pretty mild. They also have buffalo and salmon jerky, the latter of which I'd never heard of and don't really care for, despite loving salmon in all of it's other forms.  TLDR: Come for the jerky, stay for the karaoke?"}
{"text":"This place is great! Not only are they super friendly but the food is out of this world!  My food was ready super quickly and came out so hot and fresh. Some of the best Thai I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Generous portions and very well priced. They use quality vegetables and accommodate special orders."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from these guys once a week for months. The food is pretty good, but we noticed that the portion sizes kept shrinking to the point of being ridiculous. Despite all this we figured maybe they were having some staffing issues or something. We decided to give them one last try. After applying the order on eat24, we received a call from eat24 customer service (45 minutes later) informing us that they wanted to add an additional $4 delivery fee on top of the existing $4 delivery fee. Well, we won't be ordering from Sun's ever again. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Great food. We ordered the Tum yum chicken soup. It was very tasteful. We couldn't finish it though. It was a lot. The place is very nice. The owner is sweet. Great customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the farmers market at The District in Henderson and came across Suns Jerky! It was amazing! We sampled a lot of flavors but our favorite ended up being pork jerky Thai style! After looking on Yelp I found her restaurant and was so excited! The place is cute and has an area where someone can play music or sing live! We ordered Mongolian Beef, Pad Thai and Tom Yum Kung soup! All so delicious! So flavorful and we love spicy - and we definitely got SPICY! :) Not to mention great friendly staff. Sun, herself personally takes people's orders and waits tables. She's the sweetest lady ever! We will definitely be returning! Thank you for great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town and you can buy jerky to take home. The mango sticky rice is the most delicious dessert. We love this place!"}
{"text":"First time in, delightfully surprising! Our server is a sweetheart, food is great and so is the sake. the ambience is very peaceful, chill.  Love it here. Definitely a new regular."}
{"text":"This is by far my best Thai food restaurant when I came to Vegas. I am from California and always have to stop for the good Thai  taste.  The staff was very friendly. Enjoy the Kareoke night on Saturdays. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Now I would say !this is my favorite Thai restaurant.Peter and Dew the wonderful cook .The service was great the food was excellent"}
{"text":"I have tried much better thai food than this restaurant. Maybe the food that gets delivered is different but it was not nice at all.    They have the driest jerky ever look at the picture now tell what I m suppose to eat. I think the paper out of text book will taste better."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai food in the northwest, the only place that makes Thai food that tastes like Thai people made it. The entire staff is wonderful and the food is always good!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there on Friday night. I've never been here but they told me the food is good and that they always go there. The ambiance was good, they had karaoke and the food was decent. I'm giving 3 stars because they messed our order up and when my friend accidentally dropped a bowl of rice she asked for another and they charged her another dollar for rice. Smh.."}
{"text":"Great food! I had a lovely meal here with my husband. Big servings and it was very tasty. Service was a little slow because they only had one girl on and three tables came in behind us but I was very pleased with the food which is he most important thing to me. I will return!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this restaurant for seven years now. So much so that I have taken quite a few friends here. Casual, owner is nice and food is fantastic. The squid salad and tom yum soup being my favorites."}
{"text":"I ate here 4 days ago. I only give it 4 stars because its too pricey to eat for a regular meal. My order alone was $25. Imho flavorful rice, an alright steak flank side dish, nice table setting and an occasional live band doesn't wow me enough for the price.. I came late in the day before closing. I reccomend being there when Sun is there. She seems to make sure everything is perfect.  Nice portion sizes with the $11 pineapple fried rice. The matcha green tea ice cream tastes barely like matcha. Try a Starbucks matcha green tea anything, or buy Matcha powder like me and you'll see what i mean.  Their beef jerky is fantastic. You can eat alot of it just from sampling. (When Sun is there atleast haha) When Sun is there I'd give it 4.5 stars because she's an absolutely amazing manager. You have an option of 1-10 on food (spicyness). But this just means more red pepper powder and flakes of it i beleive. I wish i could say better things but this time it wasn't near as good as last."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few weeks ago with the hubby absolutely loved it..got the yellow curry and the fried rice so delicious this is going to be our new Thai place."}
{"text":"I had to try the jerky just because it's in the name and I did not regret it at all! The spice is usually almost perfectly hot enough here and service is usually speedy."}
{"text":"Four stars because the curry was a different kinda texture. But the flavors were great!!! I ordered some beef jerky too, and that sh!t was amazing. I would definitely order from them again but maybenot the curry, it just wasn't perfect.  The fried wontons were great, and sticky rice was wonderfully sticky. But really I can't wait to butn my mouth off with that jerky again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in town! Right around the corner from my frequent lunch spot Jimmy Johns. I love everything here, and I enjoy the extra fun of their karaoke nights. The curries are Delish and the noodle dishes are bomb my favorite being the pad woon sen. try everything you'll love it"}
{"text":"Nice decor with good Thai food. Pineapple fried rice is my fave it comes with chicken and shrimp and they also have mango sweet sticky rice"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Everything is so good! And is willing to make their dishes gluten free if needed!!"}
{"text":"First time dining at this place.  We will definitely be coming back to this place.  Next for my kids, I will stick to 0 for the spicy lol.  We ordered chicken fried rice, pad Thai and my fav red curry and man was it , but was sooooo darn delish.  The ladies who serves us are so nice esp Pom.  Oh yeah the sticky rice with mango, hmmm yummmy"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Best Thai food in Vegas. My to go place for a order out or dine in. Chicken stay is amazing so is the papaya salad. They don't white wash their spicy levels so beware!!  Service is always good and no complaints. Highly recommend for anyone seeking Thai food!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. I really like the pineapple fried rice. It has a great flavor. I also like the spicy catfish. It is very crispy. They also have very good customer service."}
{"text":"Red curry chicken... Enough said. I haven't actually tried anything else from the menu, but I've been in love with this since I first had it!! It's delicious!! And their spice level is serious so if you're used to higher numbers at other places, be cautious."}
{"text":"I've been 4 times in 2 weeks. I love their pad Thai (when the spice level is correct). The staff warned me that a 4/5 spice level at most other restaurants was a 9/10 at their restaurant. So to be safe, I ordered a level of 2 on the beef pad Thai. BRUTAL!! It was extremely too hot and no matter how much water I drank it didn't help. Well, the flavor is amazing and I've only had one other pad Thai that could top it. So I went back and ordered a 1 and it was still too hot. The last time I went I ordered a 1 and it didn't have any spice (which I didn't want it with no spice, just slight spice). So take heed, the spice is like no other. My husband got the fried rice and he really enjoyed it. The Thai tea sample was great but the actual cup I ordered was too sweet. The waiter did fix it. Staff is friendly as well. Despite the location (I expected a hole in the wall) it's really nice and clean inside. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered spicy Mongolian beef and appetizer combo via Uber Eats. Kudos that entree was bagged inside inner plastic bag to prevent leakage into entire order in outer bag. Other restaurants don't take this extra step and spillage gets everywhere. App combo was good, only thing was that the veggie spring rolls had too much black pepper and it over powered the cabbage filling"}
{"text":"Sun's is a new Thai restaurant in the near North Las Vegas area where I work, and I welcome it!  The staff is very welcoming and full of smiles and professional service.  The inside consists of your usual Thai restaurant decor, and has a fresh cleanness about it.  The karaoke stage had drums and guitars set up and ready to go.  On to the food!  I ordered the jerky ($7.95) and the red curry ($8.95) on the server's recommendation.  I found that the jerky was a little tough, but the flavor was nice.  The sauce, other than the basil, was pretty bland and rather useless against the stronger flavors of the jerky.  It did pair well with the red curry, however.      The red curry was pretty good.  For a subtly flavored red curry, it had a nice balance and a unique creamy flavor.  It was a very watery curry, but had well balanced flavor so it worked out.  The green and red peppers were pretty juicy (P.A. has raised the bar here), and the beef was tender.  There was lots of bamboo, but not to the annoying amounts that Archi's does.  It easily served two people and I had to order an extra rice to finish it (they didn't charge me for the extra rice).  I ordered a 7/10 heat level and it was moderately spiced for my tastes.      All in all Sun's is on the upper 3's for me, so rounded up to a 4 for this review.  It is a welcomed addition to places to eat around my work.  A bit more Americanized, Sun's offers a little extra quality in their food than some other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"This is now our go to Thai place and now that we know to order everything with 0 heat we love it! Very good!! Since I read about the delivery problem, I ordered and just went and picked it up 20mins later with no problems. Always good food but as everyone else said it can be very hot so order heat level lower then you like because a 4 here almost killed me!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've never dined in so this review is just for takeout. I ordered through the Yelp server and was able to track the order online. I arrived within the timeframe they set and it was ready and waiting on me. Friendly service and the hostess addressed me by name. The Pad Thai is amazingly flavorful and is a great portion. The spice chart is accurate. The Yelp server goes mild, medium etc versus the numbers. I got mild and it reminds me of a 1-2. I also got spicy rice and it is definitely a crowd pleaser. Reminds me of the fried rice back East without the peas and carrots."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai food I had in Las Vegas. I drive from Henderson to come eat here."}
{"text":"Always good food when I come to this restaurant. Everyday Friday my family and I order the Spicy Catfish & Pork Fried Rice in an 8. Sometimes the chicken fried rice. There's times where I'd like to take a picture of the food but it's gone by the time I do lol. I've also sampled their beef jerky. With the wide variety and different kinds they provide you want to buy many different ones. I haven't purchased any yet but I definitely will soon. The staff is very nice and respectful, thank you for the fantastic food"}
{"text":"Very nice people, nice place inside, but not what I expected.  They have Thai coffee its alright they might benefit from checking out Archie's or the noodle house."}
{"text":"If you like beef jerky, you need to try these guys. Flavor up the &@$, perfect amount of spices, and all around good people that make it.  No joke, seriously amazing jerky."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, so glad we found this place. Their heat scale goes to 10. I ordered the spicy eggplant with chicken and my boyfriend had the pad thai. The flavor was good he had a heat level of 3 and it was spicy for him but he has a low tolerance. Mine was good I requested a heat level of 9 but she would not serve me a 9 because she insisted they had very spicy food. I insisted I could handle it(I have a very high tolerance and love hot food)but she said since this is my first time she would only give me a 5 and extra peppers on the side. This was my only negative about this place please give me what I ask for. Needless to say I ended up putting tons of peppers on my food. She asked me if it was hot and I told her not enough for me I b had to add to it so she said next time I come in they would give me a 9 or 10. Fast service, cute inside looks like they have live music too but not on the night we were there. If I'm back in this area I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Beware-- spices are spicer than normal spices. Whoa, try saying that 5 times real fast. Their spicy level 5 is spicy level 10 in most places!   The usual eats:  Spicy Beef salad-- made a mistake and ordered it as a spicy level 5 one time and it was extremely difficult to eat due to the spice level. From than on I order it as a level 2 which is perfection. A lot of beef and not enough veggies but still very good.   Mint chicken-- some Thai places use ground chicken for this dish which is what I'm used to but this place uses real chicken chunks. The amount of chicken they put in this dish is greatly appreciated. Great in favors and the mint doesn't over power the chicken at all.   seafood tum yum soup- Great burst of flavors but not enough seafood. I would like to find more fish, clams, and shrimp than garlic and tomato chunks. I do like the actual soup/broth, it's pretty dang good, but for paying $16 they need to make it worth our buck.   The people that work here are really really nice. It is family owned so you often see kids in there watching TV or helping the adults. There is also a mini stage area where there are instruments and I think karaoke. I've never been here while that was active but it looks like good time.   They are also well known for their beef jerky. Ask them for a sample, they'll be more than happy to give you taste."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonight Had the drunken noodles with chicken spice level 5, Thai fried rice, chicken satay and the mango sticky rice.  I didn't notice they had special menus on the chalk boards or I would of ordered the curried noodles. The food was great and in line with the Thai food I've had at Seattle's international district (best ever). One of the best I've had in Vegas do I'm glad I looked at others reviews.  The owners were there serving and were very nice.  I'd go back again"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and affordable.This is the best Thai food in Vegas! A true hidden gem.The owner is always there usually waiting tables.Its a shame I did not discover this place sooner."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. We had the vegetable egg rolls, chicken pad see ew, and Mongolian beef. We did a spicy level 3 and it was perfect, had just the amount right of kick that left our noses running. The server was super friendly and attentive and it didn't take too long for the food. We also ended up getting some of the jerky, smoked and Cecina Lime. It was nice being able to taste test the jerky to make sure we liked it. We definitely will be back and are super super glad that we found this little hole in the wall in northwest. They also do karaoke after 7, we may have to go back for dinner and try that out too!"}
{"text":"This is in large point due to delivery - it is awful. The food is good but the past 4 times has arrived cold & 2+ hours after ordering. Even during non-peak o m hours. We used to be really really good customers but after this last time with our sticky rice being so cold it was hard... We're done. They know it is arriving late & cold & they just don't care."}
{"text":"Coming from the bay area to las vegas, finding food that compares is difficult but not until I came here. This place is amazing and the price is perfect!! I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered twice from them; once was delivery and once for take out and both times I was disappointed with the quality of food.  The first order was one of those chow fun, wide flat noodle dish and the favor was just plain weird.  There was too much pepper and I couldn't take more than a couple of bites.  I also ordered dessert of mango and coconut sticky rice and the rice was super mushy.  This last order was last night and it was a simple beef pad thai, mild.  Omgoodness, I don't think these people know what mild is.  I spent about 10 minutes picking out pepper seeds because it was that spicy!  My lips and mouth was on fire!  and of course I didn't get all the seeds so I did ingest some.  The pad thai had no other real favor besides the heat.  I'm not sure if others who have raved about this place have tasted what authentic Thai is about, sure there's heat but seriously there has to be favor underneath that heat."}
{"text":"In a blighted little part of the NW valley lies a ray of sunshine in the Thai cuisine of Sun's Thai Food & Jerky, a discovery I made on a grey, cold afternoon. I love Thai food and I love great service coupled with a charming ambiance and Sun's possesses all of these features. It actually made me feel like I was on vacation!  I had the yellow chicken curry and chicken larb. The presentations were minimalistic but elegant. The crumbles of chicken larb flavors were resplendent with bold chilis, bright lime, and mint juxtaposed with the crisp cabbage, just wish there was more of the latter. The curry was a comforting bowl of meat balanced with large chunks of perfectly cooked potatoes and carrots. Jasmine rice was served separately so I could have a customized balance of creamy curry and rice.   Giant chalkboards featured the day's specials and a nice offering of international (Asian) beers, and across from the board was a small stage where apparently live music starts at 7 pm. Two big screen HD TVs play what appears to be cooking and travel shows featuring Thailand, but the audio was off so I couldn't be sure.   Overall, I was really impressed with the quaint atmosphere, the menu selections as well as my choices. Most of the time I find my way to Commercial Center which is quite the haul for my favorite Pad Thai and rad na, but now I will have a closer place to visit! So glad I had the nerve to venture into a bit of a dodgy area because I was rewarded with the warmth of Sun's Thai Food & Jerky."}
{"text":"We usually go to Pin Kaow for work but found this place that's much closer. My coworkers and I had the lunch specials: Panang curry, red curry, and I had the spicy mint chicken. The waitress gave the typical \"are you guys sure you want a 9/10 in spice level?\" But my coworkers insisted they did (she didn't ask me how spicy I wanted my dish but assumed spicy chicken meant spicy). The lunch specials come with soup or salad. The salad has a sweet mustard dressing and the soup that day was sweet and sour.  The place is pretty cute. It's in a strip mall and has a nice display of dishes on a couple chalkboards on the wall. There's also a small stage with instruments and two TVs that were playing a Beatles DVD and a thai cooking show while we were there. Interesting...  Though the plates are small, there's a ton of food in the lunch specials. I tried a bit of the Panang and it was definitely spicy, which was refreshing. However, my spicy mint chicken was not spicy whatsoever. I'm also used to ground chicken and this dish had chunks of pounded chicken which was good, but not expected. It was also pretty greasy. I had to take half of mine home because there was so much.   Overall this is a good option for lunch. The price is hard to beat at $6.99 and it has more dishes for lunch specials than Pin Kaow. Also a lot less busy and service was fast. Not my favorite Thai place but fine for close to work occasionally."}
{"text":"Family owned and the Tom Yum was off the hook! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Really reminds me of home. Authentic food, even the kareoke. Small place but that doesn't matter. Servers are friendly too, they aren't hard to remember lol. I'm Lao and Thai and if I don't feel like driving all the way to China town just for ingredients to cook Thai food I just come here. Everything is so good. They dont use MSG either. They also sell different flavor beef jerky."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place! WARNING:  the Pad See Yew is more addictive than crack.  If you eat here you will have to come back for more; it is so good. Sun's has a fun, eclectic family run atmosphere and amazing authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to have a new Thai restaurant open in this part of town.  We went for dinner and the first thing we noticed was the prices.  Thought they were a little high for the quantity of food and location of the restaurant.  Also, was extremely disappointed that the soups, especially the Tom Kha Kai, didn't come in a size small enough to enjoy before the entree.  So no soup this night!  The Pad Thai was ok, but it was not served with a lime or any cilantro, which I love in Pad Thai.  We also had a pork and vegetable dish, which was kind of bland.  All in all it was just ok"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time today and loved it! My husband and I ordered the house appetizer (sample platter), pad Thai, and spicy mint chicken. ALL of it was so delicious! We ordered a 6 and 7 heat level which was perfect, great spice!  The service was very good and the prices were great. Our bill was only $30 and we still have a lot left over. We also bought some beef jerky on our way out. Mango hot is amazing!"}
{"text":"The red curry was excellent. Food is fresh and authentic Thai. I chose to pick up dinner for my housemates. Shared the Thai fried rice, red curry and pad thai. A perfect dinner to bring home."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came here with my Husband and 2 toddler daughters. The staff was super friendly, filling up our waters, asking if we needed anything and checking on us. The Karaoke was pleasant and entertaining. The food reminded me of homemade style Lao food! The flavors were amazing and FRESH! We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"So today my husband and I tried a sample of the spicy Thai beef jerky. It was so good!! So my husband bought the small bag for $5.  Long story short the bag we bought did not taste like the sample. It was crunchy and dry. Didn't taste like the delicious sample at all. Very disappointing because I love beef jerky."}
{"text":"Don't order carry out... It takes FOREVER. The staff will continuously say \"10 more minutes\". I wouldn't have mind if they were just truthful so that way I don't drive to the restaurant and wait for about 30-40 minutes!  And I was a little irritated that I specifically asked for the spicy peppers on the side... They did NOT include it. This wasn't the first time this happened, so I suggest checking your bag before leaving the restaurant to make sure it's all in there.   The staff is friendly... But no, just no. You're better off visiting another Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was good, employees friendly, location very clean. We will definitely be back, maybe even to give karaoke a try! Definitely will save room for fried banana and ice cream next time."}
{"text":"The Food is really good! I always like getting the Pad-see-ew and the crab ragoons and it's awesome the service though isn't very good, they take really long to bring your food out, they didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert and we had to go track them down just to get our check. OH! and when we got served our food she just handed us our plates, she didn't even put them down in front of us but this hasn't just happened once, it happens every time we are there.  so, service is horrible but the food is delicious! Go if you are a patient person."}
{"text":"Great, great, great food! I am addicted to Thai food and unfortunately have had to drive across town for my fix for years and years due to the lack of good and authentic restaurants (none) in the North Las Vegas area.  Thank god this place has opened up! I was really hesitant due to the shopping center / lot but I'm so glad I didn't let the location deter me. I ordered the yellow curry with veggies and tofu, chicken pad see ew, and combination fried rice. Absolutely delicious and extremely fresh! The staff was so friendly as well and the restaurant was very clean and very nice. My only warning is that the food is very spicy - I usually order level 5 at my other favorite spots but here I will probably have to go with a 3. Over all, this place is awesome! They will be seeing me a lot! :)"}
{"text":"I was impressed by this little Thai place tucked into a little shopping center. The major anchor of the shopping center has been gone for awhile, so little businesses have come and gone. I hope this one is here to stay. The Crab Rangoon was excellent as was the Mongolian Beef. Plenty of flavor and just enough spice."}
{"text":"This awesome place inspired me to stop being lazy and finally open up my Yelp account.       I have changed my diet to a whole food plant based diet, therefore, shopping and cooking organic/ farmers market veggies/NON-GMO Frankenfood  is time consuming, plus exercising efficiently, working a full-time job, getting PROPER rest, and having some fun times with the Gurlyfriend to counter the stress and enjoy life...Is what I'm seeking but like Pimpin', It ain't easy.  When we fall short on time which like many others out there we skimp on time to eat properly resulting in zooming thru the Drive-thru of any of your fast-food chain and basically putting high fat/calorie/sugar/sodium/poison dead food with zero vitamins or nutrients in our body's.  We like to get this as take-out to have this around the house when we don't have the time to prepare and cook healthy meals (which is often these days).          We have been eating there 4 to 5 days a week, considering I get 2 sometimes 3 portions from 1 order (8$-10$)  I have also changed my portion sizes away from your typical Western Diet mentality.  We have been eating there about a week after they opened, since I live close and drive by it almost everyday...do the math on that.  We eat there a lot.  They know us now obviously, since my GF is Thai and is also fluent in Thai, she enjoys speaking with them.  They all are extremely friendly and polite.  What I really respected was that I asked the chef if it was possible to not use oil in my order of just a veggie stir-fry ($5-$6).    He sure didn't use the oil, no debate at all and It was absolutely delicious.  I also do not want to put MSG in my body, so we asked if they use any products containing it and they told us \"No\"        Food I have ate there:                 Veggie stir-fry, All their veggies are fresh, cut well, and flavorful.  They cook them perfectly also.               Green Thai Curry veggies only, spicy #10 (spice scale 0-10) I have had various degrees of spice levels, all are yummy and to your taste.  This is my personal favorite.  Veggies are red bell pepper, bamboo shoots, carrots, bok choy, broccoli, mushrooms...I might be missing 1 or 2 more.  I crave this stuff.              Red Curry veggies only----super yummy              Yellow Curry veggies only------yummy              Pad Thai with chicken-------super yummy, GF's favorite              Pad Thai veggie only-----super yummy  If you want lime with your Pad Thai, just ask them...it does not come with it              Papaya Salad----yummy              Veggie Egg Rolls-----super yummy, fresh, some of the best I've had               The place is very clean and has a good energy about it.  They have Karaoke, but unfortunately we don't sit and eat due to busy lives, so take-out it is.  The food is also consistently good, never a \"bad\" visit.  The prices are good for the generous portion size and quality ingredients.  One of the reasons their veggies taste good is the quality of them.  But, quality ingredients cost more also.  They also are a small business and have to make a living too...so yeah, prices are good.  Although I don't normally incorporate animal protein in my diet anymore, I did try a piece of the Beef and Chicken in which the quality and cooking time was spot on.  Flavor was great.  I have not yet had a chance to try any jerky yet but I have heard from others that it is good which doesn't  surprise me.   I shared the Green Curry with a fellow co-worker and he is also a huge fan now.  I made myself hungry half way through this review, so I ate some left over Green Curry w/ veggies over some of their traditional Thai jasmine rice while I finished this.   -Davey"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the atmosphere was really cool. I'm a huge beef jerky fan and to have beef jerky as an option for an appetizer was awesome!"}
{"text":"They have the best thai food in town. I live in Henderson and occasionally drive across town just to eat the food."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Thai food. Moved from Guam and didn't like the food there. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Delivery guy was very nice considering he had a difficult time finding my apartment.   I loved the Thai cucumber salad-cucumbers, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, peanuts and that divine dressing. I will be ordering this again especially when it's hot outside! When isn't it?   The Thai tea was the best I have had in Vegas. Aromatic and lovely. The spicy chicken was good too. I would like to try some noodle dishes in the future since those are the best to determine authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry and chicken satay. The chicken in the Satay was too tough and thought it was just okay. Where this place let me down was when I ate the curry I got a metal curled up shaving in the food...in my mouth! Sure it's probably from an opened can, but that's my point. It threw me off and I didn't enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"Love the red curry! Hate the long wait for pick up. Always gotta call 20-30 minutes before leaving the house. But other than that, food is good."}
{"text":"First time in.... what a great little spot... the food was exceptionally flavorful... nice little gem in the north....definitely will be going back.... staff was very attentive..."}
{"text":"We ordered take out which was supposed to take 30 minutes. When we got there we had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they were 'out of rice'. When we finally got our food we were very disappointed. The pad Thai tasted like old used oil. Both the red and green Curry had almost no vegetables and were so watery. Basically all you could taste were the canned bamboo. We won't be returning. We'll stick with Archies and Komol"}
{"text":"Feeling under the weather, there are only two foods that can perk up my spirits when I'm battling/recovering from a cold: curry or sundubu (tofu soup). Craving for some panang, I remembered I added Sun's Thai to my mile long list of bookmarks, and I thought today might be the perfect time to try their food.  Quick note: I didn't visit this restaurant in person. My awesome father was the one who picked up my food. He did mention how the service was quick and the order was ready in under 10 minutes. With that being said, onto the food portion of my review.  For $5.99 I received a small carton of white rice, an egg roll, and my panang. The egg roll was OK. Just an ordinary deep fried egg roll that contained the common minced veggies and rice noodles. Rather than choosing either beef or chicken for my panang (spicy level 5), I opted for tofu. Upon opening the container, I got a whiff of the strong aroma of basil and lime (that awoke my senses!). The curry's consistency was watery and wasn't as thick as other panangs I've eaten; however, the rich flavor was undeniable. Unlike Komol's or Archi's panangs, red and green peppers were absent, as were chili peppers; although, there was a subtle spiciness present. But the absence of those ingredients left me desiring for more substance than the curry and tofu alone.   Sun's Thai receives a solid 3-Stars from me. The lunch special price is reasonable for the quality and quantity of food, though it might not be enough to remain satiated well until dinnertime."}
{"text":"Suns thai is our favorite family Thai spot! The staff are so welcoming and friendly and the prices are very reasonable. The food is always delicious and their karaoke is super fun!! I have brought friends which also love it. My go to dish is beef noodle soup and the bf gets curry. MUST TRY!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service is ok but the foods is HORRIBLE! Lunch special (Spicy Mint Pork/Chicken) portion so small and barely have any meats on entree plus the hot & sour soup doesn't taste like hot & sour at all!!! Their Shrimp Pad Thai is WET too much sauce (bad tasting sauce) so in other word their Pad Thai is the worst Pad Thai I ever eaten! Overall Service is average BUT THE FOODS IS HORRIBLE!!! Sorry if this post offended anyone but I'm just keeping it real and wanted to let everyone my experience here!!!   Almost forgot their Thai Tea is thin in other word they mix too much water!!! My lady said when she got in the car \"The food is Nasty\"!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup so bad after being introduced to it at a different restaurant. I went with something closer to my house and on yelp for reviews which usually works , not this time. I was so disappointed with the Pad Thai it was dry, lacking taste and just simply bland even the color was off and pale. The Tom Yum soup was another disappointment. I ordered it med spicy it was way too spicy, which led me to believe since I ordered 2 different orders in separate spicy levels they messed up and decided to make one just super spicy. The shrimp were grainy which means its old and over cooked. I literally had a couple of bites and it all went in garbage. I was so disappointed I thought since this place was a mom and pop shop it was going to be amazing. I was wrong.. I see everyone's reviews and wonder if I just had a different cook. Next time I will suck it up and make the drive to Archie's and order it where I know it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant! All of the staff is friendly, Sun is cute as hell, and the food is authentic and delicious. I had the spicy fried rice level 10 and it was very spicy. I usually order a level 10 because most places don't have a very accurate spice scale. I loved it and I also got the beef jerky in spicy level 10. The live entertainment made me want to go back definitely!"}
{"text":"Not crazy about their pad thai... Pin Kao's is much better... The sauce was too sweet, not spicy at all. I'm used to feeling that kick. Not a fan of THIS dish but want to try their pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"The best beef jerky I've ever had! My favorite is the hot smoked jerky. It's not your typical thick chewy jerky. It's thin and almost crunchy, so good!"}
{"text":"All of the curries are fantastic! Very authentic and very spicy.  They rate their scale from 1 - 10 but I'd recommend ordering based on a 1 - 5 scale. I LOVE spicy and typically order a 3. The sticky rice with mango is delicious!  So happy this is jus just around the corner!"}
{"text":"My fave Thai place on the north side of town. Def recommend the green curry! Customer service is always on point :)"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with their food and service! I ordered food for delivery when I was late and rushing for work and had no idea what to serve my family for dinner. I ordered the pad see ew (spicy), crab rangoons and fried tofu for my husband. We can tolerate heat so I asked for it to be spicy, as in my experience whenever we order Thai food the heat seems to be lacking. Not in this case! The pad see ew was seasoned nicely, spicy like we wanted with generous portions of beef spread across it. The crab rangoons were alright, they weren't anything special. The way they make theirs is they just fold the wonton wrapper triangularly in half and put filling in the middle, making the first bite mostly wonton wrapper. It's not a big deal but my husband did say something about it. The fried tofu came with a yummy chili dipping sauce that also came with the crab rangoons. The delivery didn't take long, I was given an estimate of 40-55 minutes but it got here in maybe half an hour. The prices for the portions they give you are also very generous and always appreciated! Overall a very good meal and will be ordering more often from this place for sure!"}
{"text":"First the service was great and helpful. The drunken noodles are amazing and also great reheated the next day!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! I lived in Vegas almost 10 years before finding this gem. I had been looking for a Thai place with Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) for years, I actually thought I would never get to eat it again without returning to Chicago or Milwaukee. I always order the same thing, chicken Pad Kee Mao, it's sooo addicting! I have to ask them to add baby corn (since this place doesn't already add it, it's a MUST and I'm addicted to those little things). My boyfriend always orders the Chicken Red Curry (minus the bamboo chutes because he thinks they're gross), he thinks it is absolutely delicious. We have tried many of their appetizers over the years. The Thai spring rolls are fresh and the veggies are crisp and the flavor just pops, the mint really makes it. Tonight we had the House appetizers, it's like a sampler. Everything on it was delicious, from the rangoons and wontons to the egg rolls...fried to perfection. This place has a 1-10 spice level on their dishes. My boyfriend sticks to a level 3 and finds it very hot. I love all things hot, so I usually get a level 5 or 6 (spicy and delicious). If you have a craving for jerky, give it a try. I've had spicy and regular beef jerky and thought they were both tasty. If you aren't sure what flavor you want, just ask them and they will let you sample as many flavors as you would like! The restaurant always has extremely friendly staff and Sun is always friendly and asking how we've been with a big smile on her face! I really enjoy Sun's every time I order and I've never had a bad experience. I've been eating here for about a year and a half and I'll continue eating here as long as they are open. If you want good, fresh, inexpensive Thai food and friendly staff, definitely give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered the Green Curry Chicken and it was absolutely delicious.  As a matter of facts, it was probably one of the best such dishes I have ever had.  The vegetables were fresh and crunchy, the chicken was of high quality and no chewy pieces at all.  The sauce was not watery, as is common at Thai restaurant in USA, but of perfect consistency and flavor.  I did not specify a spiciness level but it was about a 3-4 on a scale from 1-10, which is exactly the way I like it.  I'm sure they will adjust the spiciness to your liking if you ask.  The food came out piping hot, it looked very appealing to the eye, smelt great and the portion was generous (dinner size).  All the workers at the restaurant appeared to be of Thai origin and they are hitting it out of the ballpark.  This will be one of my weekly \"go-to\" restaurants for sure since I love Thai food."}
{"text":"I just had a warm noodle salad and omg sooooo good! I sadly forgot the name of my dish but it was exactly what was craving!! tasted just like back in Thailand!"}
{"text":"This place will always be my favorite Thai food place. When me and my family moved out here from Cali 4 years ago, we started going here and we loved it. My mom would have me pick up her food all the time. We NEVER went any where else. She passed away 2 months ago , and I can just hear her Telling me to go pick up her shrimp fried rice. Or her hot and sour soup lol ! I'll always love this place."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars because the food was great but I have never been to a restaurant where the server runs to your car in the parking lot and says you forgot to leave her a tip ????"}
{"text":"Found this gem of a place via here on Yelp. Thanks to honest reviewers, because the place is soothing, the food is great and the customer service makes you feel at home. Went there 3 times already, and I just discovered it 2 months ago. Delicious Tom Yum and Spicy Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Suns is the best restaurant on the north side of Las Vegas but in my opinion the best in Las Vegas I tried recentlyto help them into being number one for review journalist was not one on their list restaurant however reviewed in my opinion Suns  food compares to CaliforniaGreat capture culture we love sun's"}
{"text":"Favorite place to get lunch before work on weekdays plus it's like 2 minutes away from my house!  My little family and I always come for their lunch special-- only $5.99! We always order the same thing because it's delish. My boyfriend gets the garlic peppered chicken and I always get either the red chicken curry or the beef broccoli-- all comes with rice and choice of soup or salad. I always get the soup it's really good and spicy! My daughter always requests for their shrimp rolls... Sooooo yummy!  Not only do I love their lunch special but the workers are always so kind. It's a little family owned restaurant so they always remember my daughter, my boyfriend, and I! The owner always comes in every now and then and she's so sweet as well!"}
{"text":"Uh. Its fu**ing delicious.  What else do you need to know?!   Also, super spicy, so always order 2 levels less than your normal level. If you get a 7 or 8 here, your mouth is likely to catch on fire.  If you get a 10, God help you."}
{"text":"This place is very yummy the food is always served at a great temperature. The service is not fast we almost always wait longer then we should. Overall I would highly recommend and I'm a picky eater"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai! Love how it's in the neighborhood and Mrs Sun is so nice! Tom ka Kah soup is my favorite and so is the curries."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed, took over an hour for delivery and we ordered 2 green curries and did not get any rice. I have ordered curry from lots of Thai restaurants and never once was rice not included. So it took an hour for delivery and then I had to make my own rice after paying $55"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Thai food I've had ever!!!! The people working there are very friendly and the portions are quite big. Their food is MUCH spicier than most Thai places. I can usually handle a 7 or 8 spice level at other restaurants, but here I can only go to a 3."}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats. I didn't mean to but I had hit the wrong button and by the time I figured out how to cancel the order it was to late stating that I may not get a refund if I did. So I thought oh well now I have dinner on the way. Yellow chicken curry is one of my most favorite Thai food dishes. I usually always get a level 3 on the spicy meter and it's always perfect.   Well this curry is so spicy I almost can't eat It! They have a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the hottest, and I ordered a 3! I called to ask and she said that's the kitchens fault and we made sure it was a number 3! I don't know how that could be a number 3! I can only imagine what a number 1 is!   The curry wasn't bad, I just wish I could of enjoyed more of it without my mouth burning after every bite! I also wish the lady I spoke to would of had a solution instead of making excuses. Well lesson learned. I'll still eat it because I'm not gonna waste the money I spent. Just beware, medium is not medium!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best tasting Thai food restaurants you will find in Las Vegas. We usually order delivery or take out and they never disappoint! They have a great staff to match their food!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sun's, ordered to go and had their food delivered without a complaint. Unfortunately this time the food came cold, way smaller portions and had lack luster flavor. The larb salad was ok and the mint chicken lacked any spicy heat and was cold. It is to bad, they are close to the house and have been excellent over the years."}
{"text":"I ordered for pick up and I'm impressed. It's was about 12:30 when I arrive it wasn't too busy but my food was ready in the exact time I was promised. It was packaged well and the temp was hot. They have a $6.99 lunch special which is fantastic. The food is great I ordered the spicy mint chicken #7 and the flavor and spicy we're both on point.  Sun's Thai Food gets a 5 stars from me. Excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"I go here twice a month with either my family or girlfriend. I always get the Tom yum with chicken and thee teriyaki plate. The mango with sticky rice is delicious and I would high recommend their ice coffee."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.  Was a little skeptical about all the mixed reviews, but glad I went.  The food was amazing.  The chicken in the dishes was real chicken.  Not that weird rubbery fake chicken.  We ordered Thai beef jerky, mint chicken, Thai chicken fried rice, crab rangoons, mangolian beef, Thai ice tea and Thai coffee.  Everything was great.  The place was very clean n the service was great.  We went on a Friday at 4pm and were the only ones there.  Go and try it out if you live close by."}
{"text":"Very food Thai food ! Today was my 1st time to visit only Monday to Friday they have lunch special:( I was order Thai sukiyaki! It was yummy. Just little wait for order . I waited 20 min for 1 order . But I'll come back again ! It was good dish good price good size !"}
{"text":"My kind of place: local owners, hole in the wall setting, top notch food. This is delicious Thai food! Reasonable prices and what seemed like good quality ingredients to me. The Tom kah Kai soup was loaded with good-sized chicken pieces, and lots of mushrooms. The \"3\" spicy level of papaya salad was too much for me, so beware! I don't consider myself a lightweight on spices, but I guess I'm not ready for Thai-style levels yet."}
{"text":"Sun's is a local hole in the wall Thai-Laotian joint.  Its also a big karaoke spot.  The service here is excellent. The food flavorful and fresh. Watch out they do use MSG in their cooking so if you are sensitive, beware.  I had a delicious seafood soup that was spicy and satisfying.  If you like spicy you are in the right place.  Medium spicy here is hot elsewhere. And they make all kinds of jerky and sell it at the counter. Park for free in the onsite lot. Recommend."}
{"text":"BEST Yellow Curry in Las Vegas!!! I've only taken my food togo but the staff here is real nice too. I recommend this place if your a fan of Curry.   P.s. the Thai Tea is make to perfection here as well!"}
{"text":"This is one of those all bad all good spots. I absolutely love the wet jerky they have! But I can eat waaaaaay too much of it. I wish they were closer to the Westside! All the flavors are incredible."}
{"text":"This food is amazing. It's always fresh and tasty. Only down side is, I've had a few other Thai Fried Rice and they have more juice in them this one doesn't."}
{"text":"I'm from California so when my bill for 4 entrees and 3 drinks amount to $40, it's freakin' amazing! To top it all, the food was excellent. W edit the pad Thai, green curry, spring roll and Kao ga prow."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to place near home!  I live in northwest Las Vegas and, lets face it, good Asian food is kind of hard to find outside of the main Chinatown area up and down Spring Mountain. Sun's was a great place to  find. The food is consistently delicious and it's reasonably priced. The venue is small but charming and very comfortable. The service is always friendly and spot-on. I find myself here at least once a week now, even if it's just for carry out. Pro-tip: the beef and meatball noodle soup (spicy level 8) is great for when you have a pesky head cold. They have a small stage with some guitars, keyboards and amps, so it looks like there is some live music sometimes but I've never been here that late. Comfy venue. Great Thai food. Cold beer. Live music. All conveniently located at Craig and Decatur."}
{"text":"Really great service, attentive, helpful, pleasant, accommodated special requests, and made good recommendations. Turned the music down slightly on request. My party had the warm beef jerky, fried rice, and combination pad see ew. Beef and chicken both remarkably tender. When they say spicy, they mean it, but customize with a scale from 1 to 10. I'd personally prefer no MSG, but, that said everything was delicious and enjoyed by everyone. Also, the decor with Xmas lights and a small stage is prettier in person than in the Yelp pics."}
{"text":"Disappointed...and i had such high hopes for this place. I feel obnoxious for writing this as so many seem to love but this really was like the worst Thai meal ever. I'm from Wash DC burbs and haven't found great Thai here but this really was was no good for me. Yellow Curry was watered down with mushy potatoes. Pad Thai had way too many carrots and just wasn't flavorful. Fried rice was just mush, like cement. The yum woonsen was the only saving grace. I grew up with a Thai friend so I think I know what authentic is, but maybe not since so many call this place authentic tasting food. Maybe I'm too American Thai food jaded, I don't know.  I just don't get why so many love this place. It was cute and authentic looking for sure but the food was not good."}
{"text":"Really tasty, authentic, fragrant thai food. I haven't dined in restaurant, but I got take out.  The restaurant looked nice when I went to pick it up, and they sold in house jerky at the register."}
{"text":"Great spot service was super friendly. Jerky was amazing! Bought like 3 bags really moist stuff just ask for the recommendations. Food was great gf was really impressed so 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"THE BEST JERKY...EVER!!! We went to a farmer's market and came across the vendor/owner if Sun's Jerky and Thai restaurant. Sampled the jerky and it was so tender, flavorful, and mouthwatering. We ended up buy 2 bags. Crispy teriyaki pork and pineapple beef jerky. On the packaging it also had info of the restaurant and went 2 days later. We ordered the papaya salad  (3/5..only because the lady did not tell us ordering a spicy level 3 WITH FRESH RED CHILI PEPPERS would be an Inferno in our mouths but still good) the bbq grilled pork (4/5) it was tender and juicy and full of flavor we also got the lunch special chicken thai fried rice (5/5) so damn good!  We'll definitely be going back for jerky and food!"}
{"text":"I really really like the food here! The pineapple fried rice is great and I like the pad Thai and the chicken satay. I really like how it's decorated inside it's super cute. We ate in once and they forgot our order and we had to wait a really long time and they felt bad so they gave us free crab rangoon but unfortunately they were still cold in the middle witch was gross but at least they tried to make it up to us. The waitress are all really nice."}
{"text":"Really good green curry. Their spicy levels is about 2 points spicier than I would expect so if u usually get an 8 get a 6"}
{"text":"Everything was really really good. From the food to the customer service. Very content!"}
{"text":"All i can say is WOW! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I see they like to get people hooked on their food. I can see Already coming a LOT!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food and services were amazing.  They have karaoke Fridays n Saturday from 7 till 9.  It was fun.  My 6 year old niece had a blast. Will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious thai food and great service! We had thai beef jerky to start, which was so good. We also had chicken pad Thai and beef noodle soup, which were far better than we have had at most other places. The thai iced tea was refreshing with the spicy food. We finished with the mango sticky rice for dessert."}
{"text":"The food here is always great but however I will not return!! In the past I would come here for dinner it was always a nice experience then I started ordering pick up for lunch (horrible idea) the worker that works the day shift has the worst attitude known to mankind, I've came here for lunch 3times and every single time this worker reaps attitude to the point of spoiling your appetite. I have actually met Sun (owner) a few times and she was very pleasant. If you decide to eat here go in the evening"}
{"text":"SOOO amazing I got the chicken coconut soup and it was delicious! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Food was great, fresh and served quickly. No complaints about the quality at all! Really good Thai food, which is hard to find outside of Spring Mountain area here in Vegas. I went to Dinner with my husband and 4 kids. ( they are 9 and under)  What DISTURBED me was that I was charged $18 tip for a bill of $58!!! That was outrageous!  My youngest child is 3....I have never had gratuity added like that for a bill anywhere!  Service was good, but not 30% tip Amazing!!  I don't skimp on tips, we usually leave 15-20%. For this reason Alone, we will not return for dine in. EVER.    So I get  response that its 18% tip for a party of 6 or more....... Lets do the math on that one   $60 bill ( Includes Tax) x 18% = 10.80 So why was my GRAND TOTAL $78??   Yea  I am hilarious....so funny that you lost my business."}
{"text":"I have been looking for good Thai in the northwest and I have found it! Don't let the location deter you! Green curry and pad Thai are on point. Just a warning for people that don't like heat, their scale is 1-10 but they said a 3 is medium heat. To me 3 is the effect spice level."}
{"text":"The food was hot and fresh when I picked it up! I love the pad Thai!! The papaya was ok, not a big fan. But otherwise I recommend if you want some good authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai and drunken noodles and both were amazing. My one caution is that on a scale of mild, medium, spicy and super spicy I ordered medium and it was pretty spicy. That was fine by me but if you don't like spicy I would definitely go with mild. I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"The food is here delicious. It is a small little restaurant in a large parking lot. I come here at least once a week. I never had a bad experience on all the times I've come to eat. Everything from the soup, to noodles, to main dishes are tasty. The price isn't all that bad either. They have karaoke Friday and Saturday evenings which is great since you can have entertainment while having dinner. Well worth trying this place at least once."}
{"text":"First off respect the spicy the levels are real not like other places where you ask for 10 level spicy and it's not even mild I ordered a seven and almost couldn't finish it customer service at an all-time high I definitely would come back"}
{"text":"Best beef jerky i've had in ages. Sun is so nice and let us sample everything before we purchased. Hawaii peeps will love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Karaoke is fun and is great with friends. The pad see ew is absolutely great and I love a spice of 7/10. It is very spicy but I love it. Great service and feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place. The inside is cute the food is delicious. If you're going to order soup make sure you can handle spicy cause even if you say no spicy it'll be pretty spicy. The service was pretty good considering there were only 2 servants. I'd come back. :]"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas!  Great flavors, big portions.  And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Delicious and accommodating for dietary (or in my case aversion to fish sauce) restrictions. They can make pretty much anything on the menu vegetarian or vegan, and are happy to do so, even though, as a jerky manufacturer, their meats are splendidly spiced and flavorful. I ordered delivery first thing in the day, and when their driver was late the owners personally drove my food to my house. I love their commitment to the customer and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the food alone is probably about a three but the service dropped this review down pretty low and I do my best not to do that but we came here for lunch on Friday around 12pm. Upon entering we had to wait about five minutes to be seated due to phone orders and servers bringing food out to this large table that had no guests . Dishes kept coming out one by one for that table and their food just sat their looking pretty but getting cold .  When a waitress finally came to us she offered options of drinks and I opted for the Thai tea which not only was too sweet but upon getting the check I realized she gave me the large for $3.50 without asking me when I could never finish that size so that is a pet peeve of mine .   Now let's get to the food .. they don't offer spice levels if they do I wasn't asked and this was the first pad Thai I've ever had that was also too sweet no spice hardly at all and maybe she assumed we didn't like spicy because we weren't offered a sauce tray either so I was baffled ... first up tho came our salad and soup I ordered two lunch specials pad Thai and Thai fried rice and my mom got a pepper chicken and egg rolls .  The  Thai egg rolls were good , my soup was good , salad was okay and my fried rice was really good but not the freshest tomatoes with it .  Issue was all our food came out except my moms chicken and when we finally were overheard upset about it two different people came by and one went back and told them to start making it when we would of just cancelled it because can you imagine you're at lunch and you don't feel right eating cause your mom has no food plus like I said my paid Thai was combination I had hardly any shrimp and the meat had no flavor plus I wasn't even offered sauce until I got upset and had them give us the stuff to go than I got it but barely any apologies and nothing was done but I won't be going back and it sucks cause it's close by and the jerky is good and I like the ambiance but this was a fail"}
{"text":"Probably one of my most favorite Thai restaurant I enjoy coming in from time to time. I know some of them personally. They are all hard working individuals who are always making sure food comes out best as it possibly can, almost to perfection. I enjoy there Beef noodle soup, it came on a big bowl of amazing taste of beef and soup, enough to make you full. They have karaoke nights which I don't remember which days they have them on but it sure entertains some folks there especially some customers would even participate which makes it a welcoming stage to anyone which is pretty awesome. You'll have a couple of disoriented singers that may participate but they may either be drunk or doing it for fun! But that's karaoke for you, its meant to be fun! Atmosphere is dark but I love the settings, honestly I would love a little more light however, it doesn't bother me greatly, maybe some will find it difficult to see. Beef jerkies are so good especially the spicy ones. They advertise their Beef Jerkies every Sunday at the Craig Ranch Park at a Farmer's Market event where you have all these different vendors selling their food, products etc... Overall, I enjoy coming here when I am hungry for Beef noodle soup or Pad-Thai noodles."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Yelp app and came earlier than quoted time, much appreciated. I had the larb gai, pad see ew, and drunken noodles which came in plentiful portions. Each item tasted good, but I think it would be better if eaten at the restaurant so must make a visit in the future. Also, ordered spicy, but next time might ask for sirarcha or needs pickled jalapeños."}
{"text":"The jerky is very good but beware, the \"hot\" jerky can be REALLY hot even when it's not \"supposed\" to be the really hot version.  In addition, the restaurant doesn't carry much jerky on days when the Indoor Swap Meet is open so if you want jerky, go there (couple of miles away on Decatur) instead."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  We couldn't find a good Thai place around this side of town and I am so happy to find this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best thai restaurants I've been to. Great service, warm welcome and really friendly staff. You'd be in good hands if Pete is your server, amazing guy, food suggestion was spot on for someone who was trying out new dish.  I'd suggest Spicy mint chicken for anyone wishing to have chicken dish. Try this place if you're looking to try good authentic thai food with the spice level that can be tweaked to suit your palette.  Would definitely come back if I visit this area again."}
{"text":"I've never gone here and ate in before. I usually order online or pick up, so I can't really review the restaurant itself. The food is good;  -Sticky rice is good, consistency is good. -White rice is good, not too wet, not too dry. -Beef larb is delicious, however I always order WITHOUT onions. If you like onions, I would still suggest getting it without onions. The first time I ordered this without specifying \"no onions\", they literally put half of an entire onion in it. -Papaya salad is good. Order the \"regular\" and see how you handle that spiciness. I made the mistake one time of ordering \"spicy\" and it was nearly uneatable. \"Regular\" tends to have the right amount of spice and flavoring."}
{"text":"We've been pretty devoid of good Asian spots in the north side of town. I knew of this for a little while, but haven't been in since it closes at 9 before we got off work. Now that I have a different schedule, it's been on my to eat list.   The fiance and I both got thai ice tea to drink. It was ideal sweetness for me and very creamy. I definitely liked their balance here.   Massuman curry with tofu was good. There were a lot of small tofu pieces, potato, carrot, onions and peanuts in it and a good amount of curry sauce. It's more watery of a curry which I prefer because I don't like when places use thickeners and seem to have a pasty curry that is indicative of using premade store bought bases. The flavor was really nice though, balanced and had a nice creaminess.  The only downside was the potato was a bit undercooked. It came with 1 scoop of rice which is not enough so you may need to order more like I did to sop up the curry.   Pad kee mao with pork was awesome. I love drunken noodles and this was a really good version of this. Good flavor, the noodles were soft and cooked well, pork was pretty tender.   Of course the spices here are on the \"Thai spicy\" level which kinda makes me happy. I love spicy, but to me places that do not water down their cooking values tend to cook the way they would for themselves, the way it should be. We ordered a \"3\" which normally is not spicy at all at most places, just a bit of pepper flakes for flavor. Here it was spicy enough for the fiance to be at his spicy threshold which is a 5 at most places. I still added flakes and vinegared chili because I like my Thai pretty hot.   Service was pretty friendly from Ms. Sun and her husband. It's definitely family owned and run which is the type of places I like finding and supporting.   I'm definitely gonna be back for more, but this was a pretty positive first visit.,"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the $6.99 special list is great to choose from. I had the chicken pad Thai, it came with a salad and was fresh and quick. Service was attentive and friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hello, Thai that delivers and you can order online...favorite already. Yes, I am an introvert at times.   We ordered here last night and I was satisfied. The only warning I ask you heed - the spicy is like a 10. Out of a scale of 1 to 10. If you order online, it says \"Mild, Medium, Spicy or Extra Spicy\". I was thinking spicy would be around a 7-8. Holy shit, it was crazy spicy. But delicious!  We had -   Panang Chicken Curry - Good, just wish it had a little more something to it.  BBQ Pork - Delicious.  Pad Thai - Very good. Tum Yum Krung Soup - Delicious with awesome flavor. This is supposed to come with shrimp, but it was chicken.   They delivered within an hour and the delivery man was very friendly. Overall, we'll definitely be using this place again in the near future. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! to this beef jerky!   I've been spoiling myself with it for the last couple of years and felt a review was in order. You can get it at both the swap meet and at their restaurant.  The flavor is ridiculously addicting...the sweet and spicy combo of the \"Hot\" flavors and the \"Thai\" flavors (my two favorites) hand you the biggest challenge in trying not to tear through the entire bag in 10 minutes.   I think the beef is made from high quality cuts as it's dry but still extremely tender and there's no fat or cheap marbeling or strains like you'd find in a store bought Oberto bag...Sun's Jerky is an entirely different experience.  I recently tried the spicy pork strips and their new Hawaiian and came across 2 new favorites.   If you haven't checked them out yet, you're definitely missing out on something special. It's a snack better than anything else and also probably better for you too, straight up protein, no fat and some wickedly tasteful flavors.   Mouth is starting to water...Must. Grab. Some. Thai. Flavor. Now."}
{"text":"We order from this place 2-3 times a week. Their service today made us stop ordering from them! They argued about an order they messed up, did not apologize and degraded us by asking for the bad order back! Didn't have the sides I ordered and on top of that, the $11 pad Thai was skimpy as hell on the meat! Will never go back"}
{"text":"Spicy! Good! Friday nights..... Elvis sings karaoke! What else do you need to know? This is a unique dining experience- don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in the northwest.   We ordered via Uber eats.  It arrived hot and when expected.  I tried the red curry I'm always looking for a good red curry and never find a great one.  This is it the best one I've had noodles were good and spicy Mongolian beef great.   And of course since every one talked about the ice tea I had to try it, very good also.  Not disappointed at all.  Will do it again."}
{"text":"My family and I have become regulars here. We even have our friends and family patronizing now. However my visit yesterday infuriated me.   My daughter and I ordered food to go. When we arrived, my daughter decided she wanted to sit down and eat before we continued our afternoon. So I asked if it was ok if we sat down and ate. The girl told me no and that I should have ordered to dine in if I wanted to sit down! ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! I couldn't believe it! As much as we like the food. I WILL NOT be patronizing them again. I refuse to be disrespected in any place where I spend my money."}
{"text":"I like thai and this place was FANTASTIC. Its nice and quiet, i loved the decor and the food was just so good. I will be recommending this place to all my foodie friends."}
{"text":"I've been to this place over 7 times and I have never been disappointed. The Pad Thai dish is delicious! So is the jerky. The atmosphere is great and the restaurant is very clean. If I lived closer I would go this place weekly."}
{"text":"I'm not a Las Vegas resident but after eating here I wish I was. The food is delicious and the service was one of the best restaurant services I've ever had. We had a huge order and everything was served with perfection.  Thank you Dena and we hope to see you again."}
{"text":"I should have heeded Sandra R.'s warning about the spice levels here. The mister and I ordered take-out from Sun's Thai Food & Jerky. I thought I'd be safe with getting a \"medium\" spice level - Boy was I wrong. I about burned my face off! So please, should you dine at Sun's, order a level or two below what you would normally get for spiciness level. Online ordering through Eat24 for Sun's is Not Spicy, Mild, Medium, Spicy, and Very Spicy.     PAD KEE MAO aka Drunken Noddles (8.95): My medium level spiciness was so spicy, I couldn't drink a coke with my meal! I was forced to drink a glass of water. My nose was running and my mouth was on fire. Basically, I couldn't really enjoy my meal and eat as much food as I wanted. I got this entree with tofu, which wasn't cooked the way I like it. It was fried. Of course I would have liked the dish MUCH better if I would have ordered it with a \"mild\" spiciness level. 2.5/5  *** It is exasperatingly difficult to find a place with tofu I actually like. So far Le Thai, Tuk Tuk, Teriyaki Madness, Benihana's, and Geisha Steakhouse are the only places I can find where I like the tofu. ***    GARLIC & PEPPERED CHICKEN ($8.95): My husband got his entree at a 'mild' spiciness level. He said it was perfect. At first, he complained his meal was small but ended up saying it was the perfect amount after finishing. Entrees come with a side of rice. 4/5  SERVICE: Our order took less than 15 minutes to be prepared and the employees were extremely friendly to us while we waited inside. My husband sampled some beef jerky and wants to buy a bag on our next visit.       Worth a Return Visit? I'd come back but have learned my lesson about the unusual spiciness level dished out at Sun's Thai Food & Jerky.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #79"}
{"text":"I've been ordering food from this place almost since they opened. I order the same thing every time. I placed my order today and when I got home it was loaded with onions. Something I'm highly allergic to. When I called to see if they would fix it the young lady on the phone instead gave me attitude and was rude as hell.  I took the food back and they did remake it but I had to sit there while she belittled me about not telling her no onions. Foods good but this customer service experience will probably keep me away from here. Good food just not worth the attitude. Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"Always good food and always good service. Gotta give this place 4 stars. Their flavor is on point and the prices are reasonable. The ambience is interesting; if you go to their restaurant (and you should) you will understand. Definitely try their pad Thai, chicken larb, and their Tom yum noodles. I haven't had a bad dish yet."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place after having Sun's beef jerky at a farmer's market a few years back. In all honesty, I didn't even know she had a restaurant too! Her dishes are very good. We got red curry, tom yum with fish fillet and chicken satay. All were excellent. I was so full but really wanted to keep going! Of course, I had to get some of her beef jerky. Personally, the lime flavor is my all time favorite. It is so tangy and so good!! My mom and I also ordered the mango sticky rice and we were in absolute heaven. Absolutely delicious. Can't wait to try more of her food!"}
{"text":"So me being Thai, I'm really picky about eating Thai food.   I usually go somewhere on spring mountain for Thai food, didn't feel like driving too far. So I found this place, I was kind of skeptical at first. Because every where always says they are \"authentic\" and ends up being just \"ok\"  When I seen that Sun's Thai & jerky was family owned, I gave it a shot. I like my food really spicy & let me tell you they understand what spicy is lol. I ordered Pad see ew and spicy (basil) fried rice. I was really impressed on how authentic it really does taste. I definitely recommend this place & im going to start becoming a regular here. :)  Now, back to my food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. It's a good place to go when you're in the mood for inexpensive curry. I was excited to go for karaoke but they don't have it on Fridays I guess :("}
{"text":"It's jerky. Tastes great, it's paleo. All in all it's not bad. I would go again. There's a ton of different flavors. The people working there seemed nice. They have some cool Packaging. All in all it's not bad."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken mint.And it was 90% onions. I also ordered shrimp pad thai. It came with chicken and shrimp. The rice was dry and hard also. They need to focus more on what their sending out to the customers."}
{"text":"Had Mongolian beef... Which I rarely order because of all the fat on the beef.. Pineapple rice... Mushroom chicken.. Broccoli and chicken.. And shrimp spring roll.. All this shit added up to 57 bucks.. Small portions.. But the shit was alright.. I'd order again, I d just keep the entrees down next time.. But Mongolian beef and broccoli chicken is a must have.. The spring roll bullshit can go.. Like who makes 2 big ass burrito size spring rolls!!!? With 1 shrimp in it.. And the shit was like 6 bucks.. I'll pass.."}
{"text":"A place to impress! Tucked away in the outskirts of Vegas,  this place is a hidden gem! We came across it accidentally while we were driving on the highway which is 3 miles away. Great food,  amazing service, perfect music and huge portions! Will definitely visit this place if I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"so DEEEELISH  My first 2 visits, I ordered the Pad Woon Sen because it was just that yummers  Grabbed the Masaman Curry with beef this visit,  shoot, I'll be having this again too! Totally not overpriced, which is why we went with it over our beloved sushi place  (WE love y'all Tachi sushi,we're just too poor right meow). If you're interested in Thai  (this is my second review for a Thai place so clearly, we are) food that's not hard on your wallet yet still pretty tasty, I totally recommend Sun's Thai and Jerky:)"}
{"text":"Very good quality thai food. Love their panang curry & pad thai. I've had terrible experiences with pad thai at other places being too dry & inconsistent. The pad thai here isn't dry & has lots of flavor. The panang curry also has a ton of flavor & the right combination of coconut milk. I get everything mild, yet it's still spicy for me cause I'm sensitive to spice. Still sooo good! Customer service was also great! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Went to Suns after hearing the spice level is actual Thai level. I have tried a few local Thai spots and while the food is great most restaurants hold back on spice to sell. A great example is Bajarong Thai, while the presentation and good is great the 10 scale heat had no heat to me. Now suns has the typical 1-10 scale heat but the heat is nice on a 10. My mouth tingled and I broke a sweat while eating. I tried the Red curry w/ chicken, Thai beef jerky, crab rangoons. The beef jerky is actually cooked beef jerky with a crispy shell and mouth watering everything else.. It is served with a salty dipping sauce. The crab rangoons are not as fluffy as others I have tried but nice and crispy with a delicious sauce. The red curry was a huge bowl served with a plate of rice. I got my curry a 10 on the heat scale and it was great, hearty and delicious.  My only complaint might be the environment.. It's not so much a complaint as it's sort of cheesy. There is always club lights on with music playing from the early 90's .. Not bad but it definitely has a karaoke bar feel.  Go check this place out the staff is all family and everyone was super nice."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself seems a bit of a hole on the wall given that it's in an older strip mall without many businesses left open. We were the only ones dining there for a late lunch. The red curry chicken was outstanding. I've been back since to order takeout and the portion is enough to feed two people easily. The pad see ewe was equally wonderful with the flat noodles and Chinese broccoli. We were told the chicken satay would be a 10 minute extra wait so we opted for the spring rolls which were delicious. The Thai iced tea was nice as well. I'm happy to find a good Thai food option in the northwest :)"}
{"text":"Have only tried the green curry and keep coming back weekly for the same meal.  Best green curry I have ever had."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY from here. They should be ashamed of themselves. I ordered 3 dishes, and all of them were MUCH smaller than normal. I ordered Yentafo (Seafood soup) I got 1 small over cooked shrimp, 2 small rubbery squid, and 2 fish balls, no wonton, for $10.95. I also order Lard Na, and I got a small handful of noodles, and the \"Gravy\" was soup. I ordered the Red Chicken Curry, and they gave me 1/2 of a Styrofoam container. I am the type of person who rarely complains, but I had to call about this. When I called, I spoke with a women who said that she was the owner. I told her my complaints, and she just said \" Oh your not satisfied, well that's how we do it here\" No apology, no offer to give me a credit on my next order, NOTHING."}
{"text":"I've heard good reviews from 2 different sources. We went for lunch today and really loved the flavor and atmosphere. Very nice family owned restaurant. We had the lunch special of spicy chicken basil. I was a little disappointed when it arrived and the chicken wasn't ground. The flavor was awesome. Next time I will get the regular size spicy chicken basil, sounds like that one comes with ground chicken, which I prefer. Chicken Satay was probably the best I've ever had. Beef salad was also pretty good. Thai tea was delicious. Large was served in a large beer type mug over ice. $3.50. Well worth it to me. We'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good eat in North Las Vegas...and Sun Thai will be my go to spot to satisfy my Thai cravings.  Small mom and pop shop, we were only ones dining there, but we did notice quite a few people picking up to go orders.  We started off with the stuffed fried chicken wings (deboned chicken leaving just the skin and wing tip and filled with ground pork, vermicelli, veggies), and this dish was surprisingly tasty but a tad on the salty side....nothing a few bites of rice can't neutralize.  Honestly, it's not the best Thai ever but the Thai fried rice was comparable to Archi's and the dish was fairly large.  The fried rice was my favorite dish, the rice had the right texture and flavor.  We also ordered the garlic and pepper chicken...which had good flavor but perhaps was slightly overcooked and the portion was rather small.  The service was very attentive and the server always had a smile on her face.  Definitely give it a try if you live in North Las Vegas...well since you really don't have too many other options :)"}
{"text":"This is my first review so here it goes! Sun's is a Thai place actually close to my neighborhood. The place is not the biggest but they have a karaoke stage(more on that later) and they also sell their own jerky! I have been to Sun's at least 4 times and the food is always hot and tastes good. I have had the red curry, yellow curry, masaman and phad thai. They let you choose your spice level. You can choose the meat: chicken, beef, pork, or for little more some seafood options. Soda comes in a can that you open and then pour into the glass with ice. For the food to price I can say this, I never leave hungry.   The service is good but I can say that most people seem come to get their orders to go. The karaoke is just awesome. Just ask and they will start it up. They have a fog machine and disco lights and there are real instruments up on stage which make me feel like a rock star! The owners and staff are friendly.  The only downside to Sun's is I can easily imagine as people get to know it will become packed for that karaoke. For now I enjoy belching out lyrics to my friends and the owners!"}
{"text":"We have lived in LAS for a year and tried many Thai restaurants in the area since we arrived since Thai is our favourite cuisine.  Sun Thai is way above them all in the food, the freshness, the price, the quaint romantic atmosphere, and the beer and Thai tea.  Pamh is a delightful and sweet Vietnamese waitress and she always knows I will order the hot sour soup which. I crave!  We have tried many of the local casinos' buffets at which I ALWAYS have a bowl of hot sour soup because I love it.  But Sun Thai's version is the best I've tasted here in Las or ANY other place in the USA I've tried it. Their green curry chicken is great and their shrimp pineapple rice is great too.  I tried their chicken with basil and mint with veggies yesterday and it was really good! Their karaoke is on weekends.  Their lunch menu is the best value but it's all a good value.  I was not crazy about the beef jerkey.   I've seen only a couple of bad reviews on this place and it's never about the food.  If you have a service dog, alert the owner when you get to the front.  It's only polite.  Also, make sure you tell them how spicy you want your food.  I have forgotten to tip once here and I was not chased to my car. That review is just twisted. I am not a friend of this family.  I am not an employee and nobody paid me to review this.  I care about YOU.  And I want you to know how great this place is. You will.thank me!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite authentic go to place when I am craving Thai or Lao food. Love that the food is always consistent and that its on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Went on a date night and this place is awesome. I loved the ambiance, it was really cozy and just dimly lit enough.   The Thai ice tea was some of the best I've ever had and they are served in large mugs, a bit heavy on the ice for my liking but worth the price tag.   We got the yellow curry level 4, and whoa was that just a touch outside of my comfort level, but I fought through it and it still had a fantastic flavor, sweet, spicy, and well balanced with a decent amount of chicken.   The sticky mango coconut was NUTS! I LOVED it. They don't give enough mango for the amount of rice, it was half a mango to about 1.5 cups of rice but the flavor and the sweetness was sooooooo good. I would order it to go when I have the craving.   We also got an appetizer of the house appetizer to try a little of every thing and that was as filling as an entree! The food and service here is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good portions. Wish they added more veggies to their dishes though. Theyre mostly meat."}
{"text":"Nothing to add to what the other five-star reviews haven't already said, amazing...  Just one comment for those complaining about the spiciness of the food; you're eating top quality Thai food, which is traditionally spicy...it's going to be hot!!! So man the f*#@ up and educate yourself on the food before you order next time. Lowering the overall score of this excellent Mom n' Pop restaurant due to your ignorance is a damn shame."}
{"text":"This place may be small, but it is comfortable, authentic, delicious -- hits home for me. From the food, to the kareoke set. The lady there is just the cutest little lady. Service is kind of slow, but it is so worth the wait. I can eat EVERYTHING on the menu. I am Lao/Thai myself and this place reminds me so much of home. 5 star ALL THE WAY, I would give it 10 if I could. I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Love these unassuming places we find. This is right up there with the best. The friendly staff and soothing music is just the start to a great dinning experience. The drunken noodle had a great kick with lots of crunchy veggies. The Thai egg rolls...couldn't eat them fast enough, but be careful because those things hold the heat. I can't wait to come back and try more. Great prices, great food and great vibe. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great little Thai place with a solid menu. I like the Mongolian beef and the Tea is also great. The only knock against the restaurant is that the ambiance is kind of dull. But it's a cheap and excellent little place."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch because I work close by. They have a good lunch special with limited choices for a decent price ... (like $7). I love pad thai so I rarely get anything else. Most my coworkers like the red or green curry. The service is good but they can be slow at times (believe there are only 2 servers). Overall I come here regularly and will continue to come."}
{"text":"My family and I went there on a Saturday night. It's a fun little restaurant. Food was okay. My favorite was Fried Tofu, the tofu was light and not greasy and the sweet and sour dipping sauce was good. The Panama Curry was alright, my only complaint was the beef was a little too thick, a thinner slice would have been better. We also ordered the beef noodle soup, chicken satay, Crying Tiger Beef and finished up the dinner  an order of the mango sticky rice for dessert. All those were okay nothing really special.   Food alone for this restaurant  isn't good enough to be a 4 star restaurant. The best part about the restaurant was the karaoke. My family enjoyed the karaoke very much we ate and we sang. It was very fun for the whole family.  There was great energy in the restaurant and the karaoke MC did a good job engaging everyone. Karaoke is only available from Thursday to Saturday. Overall the service was good, the staff was friendly and worked well together to ensure we had a good experience.  Another thing great about this place is that it's very wallet friendly. Also they were very generous with serving portion."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! Fried is the best I ever had. My favorite is the Drunken noodles though. The Thai iced tea is delicious too."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through uber eats. My Thai tea was pretty good. The crab Rangoon's were also good. Not too greasy, good amount of filling and a good sweet and sour sauce! I ordered the beef and broccoli for myself. I feel that in vegas, I should just stop ordering it. Beef is just weird everywhere, and here was no different. My roommate ordered the red curry with chicken. It was delicious and I ate a bunch of it lol. I would probably eat here again, just no beef entrees. I tried suns jerky at the flea market. She was a very sweet and friendly lady. And her jerky is just delicious!"}
{"text":"Thai tea is great. A little stuffy on those hot LV days. Very nice girls who wait on you. Have had had several lunches there and all have been tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place!  This is the ONLY Thai restaurant I will eat at.  Their food is always fresh, wonderfully flavored.  My favorite is always the pineapple fried rice, but today I ordered the chicken noodle soup.  It is absolutely fantastic!    Service is friendly.  I am never disappointed when I go there.  I highly recommend them, even for take-out."}
{"text":"Friendly employees, great food and relaxing atmosphere. Everything I've order has been great! Give it a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"excellent place to eat and the waitress are very friendly."}
{"text":"Well I finally found a great Thai place in my area and they deliver plus on grub hub! Bonus! It was my cousin, her husband and I. We shared each other's dishes and it was ALL GREAT! Spicy mint chicken, pad thai, and green curry. Mmmm give this place a try if you're by it. My cousin also got some beef jerky but I didn't try it, she said it was great."}
{"text":"Really great Thai food here!   I am a really big Thai food fan and IMHO the flavors here are full and complex. The restaurant has a simple interior, so I wouldn't be overly optimistic regarding the atmosphere, but the food can go toe to toe with many 4/5 rated Thai palaces in the Valley.  I'm a big fan of the Pad Thai Noodles and the Panang Chicken Curry. The Papaya salad is fresh and spicy. The soups a rich and vibrant with flavor.  I would suggest this place for a really solid Thai choice in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! They have karaoke Friday and Saturday night and it's not too loud. Our baby slept through it. We had so much fun, we'll definitely go back again. Caution... Their food is spicy!!! I orddera a number 3 hot and it was hard to eat... 2nd time I got a 1 and it was perfect. And I normally can do HOT!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I literally come here so often for my lunch breaks! one time I think I was there like 3 days in a row! I love the staff. Everyone is very friendly the service is fast.. and the food!!! ahhh, I always get the Thai fried rice with chicken. its so flavorful and just perfect. I usually meet my boyfriend and we both get the same thing. Their soup is to die for! we get the lunch special for a smoking deal!!! 2 soups and 2 big plates of fried rice for like $15. I highly recommend going there for food. the jerky that she makes is really good as well. :)"}
{"text":"Best authentic Thai food and customer service in Las Vegas that won't break the bank!  My girlfriend and I have eaten at many Thai restaurants in Vegas from Archi's to Thai Food To Go to Pin Kaow and while those restaurants may have good dishes, Sun's Thai Food & Jerky may be the best. You can order your food with the typical spicy levels 1-10 or do it yourself (The best way to go, of course!). They don't mess around here with their crushed chili peppers either. I took one whiff of it in the metal container and I thought my sinuses exploded! A 5/6 here is like a 10 at the other restaurants mentioned above.  Started off one meal with their Crab Rangoons (Delicious!), Pad Thai for myself (Fantastic!), and Panang (Amazing!) for the girlfriend. Top that off with great customer service and they have something really great growing here."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out, Verry good food.   I got pad thai, crab rangoon, and thai tea and purchased some terriyaki beef jerky   Pad Thai - really good great flavor   Rangoon - interesting shape sort of like a paper football shape but good filling  Thai tea is outstanding and a must also the Beef Jerky was really good for $5.00    These are def. good and worth ordering again"}
{"text":"I was just talking with my step-mom yesterday about how hard it is to find a decent Thai place these days, and how everywhere we used to go has seriously fallen short in the quality department. I then remembered today about a Thai place that opened fairly recently down the street from my house and figured I'd give it a try.  I got to Sun's Thai Food about 45 minutes before closing, and was immediately greeted with a big friendly smile from one of the owners. I decided to order to-go, and she handed me a menu to peruse. Once I was ready, she had the waitress (her daughter-in-law) come up front to take my order. She was also extremely friendly and told me the wait would be about 15-20 minutes.  I actually ended up waiting about 35 minutes...which really wasn't a big deal to me, I wasn't in a rush. During that time they never forgot about me. They acknowledged me with a smile every time they walked behind the front counter and apologized for the wait, assuring me it would be ready soon. And when it finally was, they handed me my to-go bag, thanked me for coming in, and wished me a pleasant evening. The customer service alone would have made me give this place another shot, even if the food was sub-par.  While I was waiting, I had overheard a group that was dining in exclaim \"Oh my gosh, this Tom Yum soup is incredible! Everything is so good!\" So I was very excited to get home and eat. Fortunately, I was not disappointed.  Tom Yum Soup w/ Tofu - It was, indeed, INCREDIBLE! I always get nervous when I order Tom Yum with tofu because, for whatever reason, a lot of other Thai places seem to have a different recipe for the tofu version than their regular Tom Yum Kai. But this was exactly what I was looking for - hot and spicy lemongrass soup with white onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, scallions, and all of the wonderful spices that make this soup what it is...but with tofu instead of chicken. The scent of lemongrass hit me as soon as I lifted the lid and I was immediately sold. It was so fresh and flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it. I hardly left myself any room to enjoy the rest of the food I ordered. I highly recommend it. And I'm willing to bet that both the Tom Yum Kai and Tom Yum Koong are just as good.  Fried Wontons (?) - I ordered the Crab Rangoons, but I'm pretty sure it's not what I got. I think I may have actually been given the fried wontons, because the inside definitely didn't have any cream cheese and tasted like pork. I was only slightly disappointed since I was really craving cream cheese filling, but despite this...they were still pretty good. They were not at all greasy or soggy. They had a nice crisp texture and I was pleasantly surprised that their sweet and sour sauce was slightly spicy. (But not overwhelmingly so. It had the sweet and sour flavor, with a bit of heat in the aftertaste. Excellent.)  Pad Thai w/ Tofu - As soon as I opened the box, I thought \"Whoa.\" This was the sauciest Pad Thai I've ever seen. (And in my mind, that's not a bad thing.) I usually have to ask for some extra sauce at other places because the noodles tend to be dry, but that was not a problem here. That sauce had great flavor and the tofu was cooked perfectly, fried and slightly crunchy on the outside. I'm not sure if the waitress heard me say my spice level on this one, because it ended up being very mild. However, they did provide a couple containers of chili paste which easily rectified that. The box did not contain any lime or cilantro, which I may ask for next time to see how those flavors compliment the extra amount of sauce.  They threw in a side of rice, which I didn't order. So that's pretty cool. (It'd be more so if I actually liked rice to begin with.) They also provided plastic ware w/ napkins, soy sauce, and the aforementioned chili paste...so I had pretty much everything I needed to consume my dinner without ever popping into the kitchen.  Overall, I'm extremely impressed. And I will definitely be bringing my family by to give it another go. (My step-mom especially!)"}
