{"text":"Love this place! It's a bit pricy but worth it. Our server was very attentive and professional. Food is delicious but wouldn't recommend the calamari there. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for an early dinner  before heading into Cleveland for a show. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is quiet, clean with low lighting and large booths. The employees were attentive and polite. My husband enjoyed the Fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken and I had the Gnocchi alla Vodka. The portions were very generous and the quality of the food was great. Maybe not the best Italian food I have ever eaten but everything was very good. I would definitely come here again and would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried on the menu is superb. The desserts are excellent. Cozy atmosphere and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Walked in. No motion at all by staff to greet, interact, ???, profit. Walked right back out."}
{"text":"Order food from this place for dinner and everything was so amazing.  I cant stop raving."}
{"text":"100% 5 stars. Wonderful food, great service-quick and caring. The bread was delicious, we got calamari, and salad for appetizers. I got the shrimp angel hair, and my boyfriend got the carbonara (I believe) The portions are stupendous, & prices were very decent. Definitely coming back very soon and recommending to all. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food!!!!  Truly is a hidden gem and really beautiful atmosphere as well!  Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I was there on Christmas Eve which meant they had a limited menu. I had the eggplant parmesan. Quite honestly, it was probably the best eggplant I've ever had. There were three layers of eggplant on my plate, all of which were delicious and crispy. They didn't drown it in tomato sauce which would've made the breading irrelevant. The angel hair pasta and sauce was average. Nothing bad, nothing special. Finally I had the tiramisu for dessert and that was really good. The presentation alone was a nice treat. I'll definitely return soon for the full menu."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp but I signed up to write this one. I love this restaurant. My husband and I both ordered the beet and arugula salad, which was very good. I then had the veal saltimbocca! FRESH HERBS, very thin, very lightly breaded, served with fresh crispy green beans (I had them hold the mash potatoes).  it was delicious. My husband ordered the Bolognese (with homemade pasta) which was also delicious! We finished the meal with creme brûlée and tiramisu. I ate to much but it was so good!!! This is going to be our 'go to' Italian in Westlake!"}
{"text":"I must say I have been to Stella Mia one time before and the Pork Schnitzel I had was excellent, so I suggested we go there. I ordered the Chicken Marsala, it came and was lukewarm, the plate it came on was cold, a hot plate might have helped. I ate a bit but sent it back because I actually questioned whether the chicken was cooked through. Just asked for it to be warmed up, well it came back the same way don't know if anything was done with it to warm it, there was also no sauce on the plate when it came back so it was still not hot and no sauce. I took it home and ate a piece of bread that tasted as though it had been saved by someone else's meal and just reheated. When you are spending $40.00 plus for 2 people you expect at least a warm meal. The waitress didn't seem to care either. My partners meal was lukewarm and was taken home also. You shouldn't have to bring a meal home from a restaurant to have a hot meal."}
{"text":"Go to this restaurant!!   I stopped by with a friend on Tuesday night. It was very quiet and 50s Italian music was playing.  Talk about cliche!!  However this place is awesome!!!  We has the prosciutto mozzarella appetizer then the spaghetti and meatballs and a carbonara.   The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauces creamy without being heavy. The wine selection is limited but good and inexpensive.  They also cater to gluten free diners.   The music also got a lot better.  The waitress was very friendly. My new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet Tuesday night and was absolutely floored from beginning to end. My hubby and I started with the meatball appetizer. As close to my moms authentic Italian meatballs as I have ever found. Salad was crisp with a luscious vinaigrette. I chose the lemon chicken piccata for my entree and my husband chose the equally delicious chicken with prosciutto and ricotta. Crazy good. Homemade cannoli and spumoni topped off our wonderful meal. Icing on the cake was Tuesday is half off bottles of wine. Service courtesy of Tina was amazing as well. First time here, but regulars from now on."}
{"text":"Went with some family around the holidays. Everyone was very happy with their dishes. The gnocchi was awesome, not too blue cheesy. The carbonara was also great. We all loved the stuffed peppers. The jalapeño Alfredo was also very tasty . Our service was great. I highly recommend this over all the lame chain restaurants like brio and Olive Garden . Everything is handmade from scratch and it shows. Will def. be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out this place, due to the many positive reviews. And, you know, Italian food, which you don't find in Cincinnati, and it being a mom-and-pop restaurant.  We showed up about an hour before closing and parked the car right in front of the restaurant, headlights on and everything. Saw about four or five employees in the restaurant and made eye contact with at least two of them through the very large windows in the front while they were cleaning as we were approaching the restaurant front door.   We entered the restaurant and saw the employees still cleaning, and, one by one, they disappeared to the back of the restaurant. No eye contact once we walked in. Not a word regarding whether we were too late and the kitchen was closed, or even a greeting or any sort of acknowledgement.   We would have gladly ordered takeout if they didn't want us to dine in. Stuck around for about another minute or two and decided to leave when it was obvious no one was coming back out.  Really unfortunate. I was really hoping for some good Italian. But not here, it seems. Wrong attire? Did the potential Asian clientele make them scurry away? We don't bite. But I guess we weren't welcome.  We went back to the car, which was facing the restaurant, headlights on, and didn't see anyone else come back out to the front for the five minutes while we sat there figuring out where else we were going to take our business. Ended up spending $100 on a very nice dinner for two at a different restaurant in Lakewood instead."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Stella Mia based on previous reviews.  We live nearby and as recent transplants from Portland, OR, were looking for a neighborhood place to go regularly.  They advertise themselves as a wine bar, yet there's no wine bar nor is there a wine bartender.  Or any bartender.  No big deal tonight.  Our waitress was mechanical at best.  We weren't told about the specials and I don't recall that she smiled or made eye contact once.  The gnocchi was on the menu as \"homemade\" and I am certain that it is not.  If you're not going to make something in-house - don't put it on your menu that it is.  End of story.  Don't anticipate that your clientele won't know the difference.  They weren't busy, which is a red flag on a Friday night.  I get it that your neighbors want to support you and make sure that you succeed, but for goodness sake, earn it!  Hire more people, hire the talent that warrants the prices on your menu and the support that you are enjoying!  The owner did give us a gift certificate after pointing out our disappointment with our dinner, and for that she gets an A+, but that's not going to help this restaurant succeed."}
{"text":"Came here in February. The food was great and the restaurant is attractive inside, however I think they are not always busy due to their location.  I had seafood (and bacon!) carbonara and white wine and the bf had steak and later a chocolate martini. No complaints, all the food was well prepared and plated."}
{"text":"Upscale decor, comfortable, what is expected for restaurants in the price range and neighborhood. Friendly wait staff, obviously inexperienced, not very helpful.  Some members of our party were having difficulty making decisions, most more seasoned wait staff will make suggestions. Good presentation.      My opinions are based on the price level of the menu.  In my opinion the food was below average(overcooked eggplant, average sauce). The mussels should have never left the kitchen @ half were inedible and way too salty, so it was graciously removed from the bill. Lots of sugar in the bread that was on the dry side.  The Balsamic dressing was odd in texture, tasty on the sweet side.      Did not review the wine selection, the mixed drinks were over iced.       In summary every thing looked good but that is where it stopped. I felt like the philosophy of the restaurant was to maximize profits rather than present claimed creative cuisine.  More attention to detail will go a long way."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. It's in a weird little residential strip mall. Don't be fooled, it's a gem. The beautiful owner greets you, seats you, and treats you like an old friend. The food is great, a mix of Italian and eastern European. I can't recall now, but I think her dad, a fantastic chef, is the genius behind the scenes.  We're on our way now, and I can't wait. I'll post pics."}
{"text":"The food comes super slow, it's a Italian restaurant I get it, but still I aged here I swear!  I ordered one of their veal dish with mash potato, the gravy was way to salty, veal was not fresh probably stayed in the freezer for way too long.  Server was slow and unapologetic for the horrible food or slow speed."}
{"text":"The food and service are great! I have been here twice for dinner with my grandmother. Probably my favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience. Fresh ingredients, well prepared. Atmosphere and service was casual and friendly. Nice mood lighting, linen napkins and table cloths. The scallops with truffle butter and herb, asparagus risotto was outstanding. Wine list was small but thoughtful; like the food the focus is on quality rather then quantity."}
{"text":"We went to Stella Mia after the Auto Show on a weeknight.  I was a little concerned as the place was almost empty at 6pm.  Let me tell you, this place should not be empty at any time.  Tucked away at the end of a small group of stores, it is not visible from the street, so you have to be looking for it.  Please do!   The four dishes ordered were the lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, linguini Alfredo, and a special dish.  The salads were fresh, and yummy.  I challenged the kitchen to make up something that was not on the menu, and they agreed- - the end product being quattro formagi gnocci.  WONDERFUL - almost like being in the Lakes district again.  The meatballs \"melted in your mouth\", and all was well, with the possible exception of the alfredo sauce being a little pasty.  Portions were large enough, but not overwhelming.  It is apparent that quality is very high on the agenda here.  The waitress was wonderful, I would love to see her at every restaurant I eat at....  The wine list was limited, but had good selections.   If this restaurant was local to me I would be here weekly."}
{"text":"On food, Stella Mia is at least four stars. And ordinarily, I'd give the experience as a whole that. But 25-30-minute wait times for food are really a bit less than acceptable at places charging $20-$25 a plate, and it's not helped when servers come by every five minutes to ask \"if you're doing okay\" when it's obvious that your salads are long gone and you're anxiously awaiting your meal. It's rubbing it in, basically.   So, like most upscale-ish Italian places in suburban strip malls, the crowd here's on the older side, with decor featuring red velvet carpet and various other semiotics for luxury circa 1961.   Service was friendly and enthused, with the exception of the long turnover time on the entrees. (That's not your waiter's fault, by the way, and is not actually an excuse to leave a bad tip. Just sayin'.) I did the shrimp in a white wine sauce with angel hair pasta. It was delicious, although the absence of either freshly ground black pepper or crushed red pepper at the table brought me down some. Other entrees--e.g. my mom's fettuccine carbonara--looked excellent as well.  So, given the other reviews and the quality of the meal itself, I kinda feel like we just caught them on an off night. But that's the restaurant biz for you: you never know when people are visiting from out of town, and you might only get one chance to impress."}
{"text":"Wow. What a surprise!  This place, sporting 4-star Italian food, is tucked into a run down strip mall. You walk into the door expecting a middle of the road mom n pop experience and what do you get? First class decor, service, and food. All three of us had a phenomenal meal with outstanding service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visited this new establishment Friday evening, 7/19.  First...they do not have a liquor license yet so if you want a glass of wine with your meal you will need to bring a bottle and they will happily uncork it for you - no fee.  We started with the carpaccio and were very disappointed.  The beef was sliced paper thin, as it should be, and served on a bed of arugula but had no flavor at all.  None.  Between the 2 of us we had the grouper with pasta aglio olio and shrimp with pasta aglio olio.  The group and shrimp were very good.  The pasta was very bland...I could not find a single piece of garlic or seasoning.  We finished the meal with the tiramisu.  It was just ok...a bit dry.  The coffee; however, was very good (regular coffee...they do not offer espresso).  Overall...the meal was ok.  They have not officially had their grand opening and may still be working out the \"bugs\".  The service was very good...our waiter was very kind an attentive.  I think we will give it another try in 4-6 weeks and see if there is improvement."}
{"text":"This place is overrated... makes me doubt yelp. Chicken limone...tasteless .. awful.. My husband had lasagna.. I'm not Italian but can Make better lasagna than that! We will not return!"}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try based on the great yelp reviews. We are converts! The space is not very unique (I think it used to be a greasy spoon we went to for breakfast years ago) But, it's clean and modern and nicely appointed. We went with three generations and our server treated us all warmly. Started with salads. Fresh. Tasty. Moved on to entrees. The salmon was done perfectly. The mashed potatoes weren't anything special, a little thin. The grouper was devoured. As was the pasta with shellfish. Even the gnocchi dish was flavorful and quite good! It's nice to find a high quality restaurant in the suburbs that serves fresh, innovative food. I hope the word gets out and they survive."}
{"text":"Yum! We celebrated our 37th anniversary there last night.  It's not necessarily a \"special occasion\" restaurant, but we LOVE their meals.  It was our third time there and we've not been disappointed.  The fresh bread, house salad (OMGosh...delicious homemade balsamic dressing!), and main dishes are a treat (This time husband had veal parm & I had the veal milanese).  The creme brûlée for dessert was the perfect way to end our meal.  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Stella Mia I love you!! A very private and hidden restaurant that only the people with good taste in food would know about! I've been here a number of times and have never been disappointed. The service is always outstanding, the portions are good for the price, and the chef really knows what he / she is doing!! Outstanding.   I would recommend trying the veal whether you're against it or not. It is some of the best veal I have ever had and I will definitely order it again. Also, the salad they bring out is so simple and light but the house (homemade) balsamic is to die for!!!! I may be able to drink it straight, not sure..... it's that good though. Sometimes I crave it and even dream about it (haha jk) but take my word!!!!  My family and I have tried a good size of the menu and will definitely taste the entire menu. Anytime I'm home in the area I definitely like to stop by for dinner.   Good job Stella Mia, keep up the awesomeness"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to this restaurant several weeks ago. At the end of the meal, the server whose name I won't mention (Sheryl), came to us with the check. Mind you, we still had glasses of wine on the table that we hadn't finished. She hands my friend the bill and my friend handed her her credit card. The server said (not nicely), \"I need two credit cards.\" My friend told her that I would be paying cash. Instead of leaving the check on the table and saying something such as \"Enjoy your wine and I will be back for the check,\" she stood at the table while I opened my wallet to get the money and STARED at me until I came up with the money. She would not leave the table. My friend and I are in our 60's, by the way. I had to come up with the money and figure out the tip while she hovered over the table. Afterward, I sent a letter to the restaurant manager explaining the situation to him or her and never heard a word back. I will NEVER go to Stella Mia again and plan to tell everyone I know about this disrespectful, unprofessional behavior."}
{"text":"What a hidden little jewel! Don't let the outside appearance fool you. Food was fantastic, service was great, great atmosphere, and they were very accommodating of my wife's gluten allergy which is very refreshing."}
{"text":"What a find! Get to Stella Mia asap. They are a family that are doing it right at this hidden gem in the back of a strip mall. Italian fare being crafted by hand, in a homemade, from scratch, family process. Tonight I indulged in a weighty plate piled with a linguini-styled spaghetti, then covered in a meat sauce that held the pasta hostage underneath. The first thing you notice when it hits the table in front of you? That's a lot of meat! It did not disappoint either, chucks of tomato and veggies were blended into the saucy side of things, but the meat still reigned supreme. My better half ordered the staple dish of any good Italian spot, the lasagna. I have to say, it's up there with the best, even had qualities of  lasagna from the motherland, light and fluffy with a cheese and sauce that, when it hits the tongue, send the receptors of the brain into a heavenly spin out. Proceed with caution! Oh, and a free cannoli for dessert that was not to be missed either. I'm kissing my fingertips for you Stella Mia! Bella... bella."}
{"text":"Amazing home made Italian and Croatian food.  Reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere, and sweet service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dined here last night for an impromptu dinner with party of six old friends.  Was definitely more than you expected when you see the restaurant from the parking lot.  The decor was inviting and tasteful with an old New York Italian restaurant feel.  We were all able to converse without having to scream to hear each other.  We had delicious Italian wines.  Appetizers were excellently orchestrated and very good.  Mussels deliciously flavored, plump and not fishy.  Stuffed sausage peppers were abundant and flavorful.  Everyone was happy and content with entrees of chicken, veal and steak.  To top it off dessert was incredible.  We all split the best tiramisu I've ever had and a vanilla creme brûlée that was lighter than most and yummy.  The waitress Tina was fun and attentive.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So the choice to come here was plan B - as our first choice was booked being Mother's Day.  We had a 1 PM reservation which included my parents (age 84), brother, SisInLaw, Niece, Nephew and me.  I was first to arrive (early) and our table was already set and ready for us.  The waitress was pleasant and took my drink order.  The rest of the family showed up around 1 and was seated.  We were given time to look at the menu - but about half just did the buffet.  The buffet looked great - but I'm not a breakfast food person. There was frittatas, french toast, pizza and couple other things.  My dad got the grilled salmon and I also ordered off menu.  I am picky (I guess) and didn't want pasta or anything else on the menu.  It was a limited menu as I had looked online previously and had seen something I wanted.    Fortunately, our waiter was very accommodating and brought me the salad I wanted.  It was DELISH!  It was simply perfect and I was so glad I asked rather than settling for something I didn't want.  And the meals weren't cheap so it would have been wasted $$.  The Stella salad (I think that was the name) had grilled chicken and feta.  It also had tomato, cuke and roasted peppers and some onions.  There was a choice of dressing but I take my salad dry.    The staff was very attentive and pleasant and didn't even blink when my father divided up the bill in 3 ways - 50/25/25 - he paid half while my bro and I split the rest.  A very nice venue for our Mother's Day meal.  We weren't rushed out and enjoyed a nice long conversation.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Best homemade meatball and Hungarian peppers I've ever had ! The bread is also soft inside and crispy outside"}
{"text":"We came here for our 2 yr anniversary. Everything was wonderful! Delicious food, great portions, AWESOME prices! I was shocked when we got our bill, though it would be way more!! Thank you for the wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"We ended up here due to an inability to get reservations at another Italian place in Rocky River.  I went in with low expectations, since there are so many meh Italian restaurants around Cleveland.  While taking our drinks, our waiter, after ascertaining that this was our first time, said, \"Welcome to the best food on the west side!\"  Yeah yeah, bro.  What else would you say?  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  Everything about our experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on.  The food was excellent (we were a 4-top and everyone loved their entrees).  We had reservations, and were shown right to our table on arrival (Friday night, 6pm).  The pricing may have been a tad high, but I'm not complaining, as everything was prepared so well. I see us coming back here frequently."}
{"text":"In Cleveland a nice little Italian restaurant. The food and service  was really good. Had the Chicken Marsala and it was good. Quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"The cuisine is exactly what you want it to be. Seasoned perfectly, but not over-done. From the bread to the perfectly prepared sauces, from the melt in your mouth meats to the succulent chocolate cake, everything is homemade and oustanding. Both the bartender and the proprietor made me feel right at home. Service was impeccable, yet never made me feel rushed. When I'm in the area, this is where I'll be having dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, friendly staff who treated us like family.  Authentic Italian menu options. Reasonable prices.  Put this place on your \"must experience\" place.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food, presentation and atmosphere were all excellent.  It doesn't look like much from the outside the inside was pretty, comfortable, good music.  Nice environment for date, friends or business.  We came on a week night so staff was a little light but she was very good, efficient and helpful."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp as we are from out of town... and what a GREAT Italian joint! First of all, our waitress Sandy was AWESOME!! Very personable and really took care of us like we were a part of the family! All of the staff were very friendly for that matter. We actually came back here 2 times in 3 days because it was so good and such an enjoyable experience. On our first visit we were craving spaghetti and meatballs and OMG was this the perfect spot. They use linguine as the pasta of choice for the dish and their house made meatballs are FANTASTIC! I mean really delicious! The house salad is remarkably fresh with spring mix, tomato and cucumber wedges, thin sliced red onion and their house made balsamic is so good! And we HAD to end it with some tiramisu and creme brûlée... homemade of course. UNbelievable. Just heavenly. On our second visit we got the Italian wedding soup... again, amazing! Sandy whipped us up some garlic bread that was to die for, to go with a pasta dish that we customized: Linguine, Alfredo sauce, veggies from the Tuscan Pasta dish (mushroom, eggplant, artichoke, sun dried tomatoes, zucchini) and added shrimp and Italian sausage. Absolutely knocked our socks off. Just DEElicious!! We're coming back tomorrow for the Lunch Buffet!!"}
{"text":"FABULOUS, FABULOUS, FABULOUS!   Did I mention this place is fabulous? The meal started with warm, homemade bread. I said, \"If this is any indication, I am in for a wonderful meal.\" Great wine selections.  Sheryl was my server. Friendly and very helpful. Told me this is a mom and pop place and the sauces etc are made daily. Most food is cooked to order.  I had the eggplant rollatini with Angel hair pasta and grilled summer veggies and it was absolute perfection. I also had a side of risotto which is a plain risotto you can customize. I had mine with mushrooms.  She brought me a complimentary tiramisu for dessert. Decadent!  One of the waiters sang Happy Birthday to several tables and he had a beautiful voice.  The prices are extremely reasonable! This place is located in a rather empty strip center so it's a bit of a hidden gem.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different and found Stella Mia on Open Table. Immediately greeted as we walked in. It was pretty empty when we got there but definitely got busier. Our waitress was awesome(short blonde hair). She was super swamped though and it seemed they were completely understaffed. Why are waitresses bussing tables??? Regardless she busted her butt. On the food side of things we split calamari. Very good. For dinner the boyfriend got chicken parm and I got shrimp with angel hair. No complaints. Food did take awhile but we weren't in a rush  I will say alcohol prices were way too high. $4 for a Miller Lite and $9-$10 for a glass of wine? Waaaaay too high   That all said we will be back but get that poor girl some help!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on Saturday night with my girlfriend, January 10, 2015. The staff was friendly, but the place was nearly empty. We were quickly seated (after being asked if we had reservations).   Our server offered us drinks and a bread course. The drinks were fine, and the bread was fine. Nothing extraordinary.    We ordered the meatballs, muscles, and shrimp pasta (sorta tapas style). Salty. Everything was extremely salty. Not to the point of inedible, but salty nonetheless.   I didn't complain (that's not my style) and I am certain the staff would have addressed any concerns the best they could (they were all very friendly). But every single dish was salty. Did I mention how much salt they used?   After dinner, the desert menu indicated that we should inquire of our server about the chocolate cake, so we did. They didn't have any. Apparently there had been a wedding party there the night before so no cake.   Lastly, the decor was... Well mauve and carpet. You be the judge.   I struggled with the rating between a 2 and a 3. I gave a 3, because they may have just had an off night. But buyer beware. Outdated decor, empty On a Saturday night, and salty food... I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have a gluten allergy and ever since that started it is unnerving to try to go to a restaurant.  I am getting tired of cooking everything at home. And I certainly didn't feel up to making Easter dinner for 7 people.  So a family member suggested Stella Mia.  If you call them, they will tell you that they accommodate gluten free diets.  After all, they can whip up some gluten free pasta with marinara sauce and expect you to be all happy.  This year, nearly every item on their buffet had breading or gravy or sauce with gluten.  When I spoke to a server, they were not very helpful.  They really didn't know what items had wheat, and they didn't offer to get someone who could help.  I broke down in tears and I wanted to leave but we had six family members who had started to eat.  I talked to several staff members who each made uninformed suggestions, like I could eat the chicken parmesan.  So now I really didn't trust any  of them to tell me what had gluten or not.  Finally after a family member implored them to make something for me from the kitchen they finally did something.  I will have to restrict my restaurants to those who actually have a printed menu that addresses allergies or gluten sensitivity.  Several restaurants in the area have this accommodation, and you can count on them to have a productive discussion about what to order to avoid your allergens."}
{"text":"Better then ever.  Now they have a great maitre de. The food is ridiculous. Prices are great. Deserts are handmade.  I can't say enough.    It's perfect. Please patronize this place. We need to keep it around. Petra is awesome."}
{"text":"Wow, what a hidden gem.   We went for an early dinner - had a baby with us.   The staff was very accomodating and sat us away from the other early diners.     Very attentive,   large portions, quality food (the salad was especially great - mixed greens, no iceberg).   I had the pasta amore,  my wife had the eggplant parmesian, my daughter had chicken tenders (of course).    All were excellent and large portions.  Our waitress was very attentive.   This is now our go-to place for Italian.  They also have some other eurpoean inspired dishes - Paprikash and Hungarian Peppers."}
{"text":"Splendid food,  wonderful atmosphere, excellent service all add up to a magnificent dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazingly yummy!!!!! My family found this place on open table after seeing an hour long wait at Cheesecake Factory. Wow am I glad we drove to this place, only a mile down the road.  Kinda hidden in the back of a strip mall and a little hard to find. But everything we had was amazing! Calamari was one of the best I've had. Bruschetta was crazy good. I had their fontina scallops and loved them. Others orders eggplant parm and veal. Everyone LOVED everything. The waitress we had was so nice the prices were good. Portions are huge. I'd definitely go here over Cheesecake Factory any day!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian restaurant, with an extensive menu, decent value, and great tasting food. I enjoyed an excellent dish of veal, and the rest of the party had a variety of pasta dishes. Everything went down well, and the large portion sizes meant we were able to take a lot of food home with us to enjoy later.  Despite not being able to finish the meal, one member of the family insisted on ordering some cannoli, and so I was able to enjoy this treat for the first time in my life as well. It was perfect- the right balance of crispy and creamy. Service was fine, but was perhaps the least strong part of this experience.  Thank you Stella Mia- I will be back."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! Petra, the owner is a gem!"}
{"text":"Quiet, elegant. Tina served us and was exceptional. Very attentive and sincere. Food is amazing and great portions. The price is fair given the portion, ambiance and service.  Beautiful Italian classic music in the background set a perfect evening."}
{"text":"I've yet to visit this restaurant in person but we have ordered it several times through Uber Eats And it never feels to be delicious"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pretty good Italian food and you can order right from the Yelp app-incredibly convenient. They always get the order right!"}
{"text":"The place would be pretty good if they were consistent.  I picked up takeout tonight.  Cold food. No bread. No salad dressing."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant and it was fabulous.  The ambience is beautiful.  The wait staff very friendly and professional.  At the time they did not have their liquor license, but told us where we could drive to -to get bottles of wine that we could drink there. The guys went for the wine and we ladies ordered appetizers.  The calamari was awesome.  Great portions, beautifully arranged on the plates.  The chef is awesome. Eggplant parmesan was homemade and very good.  Veal chops were huge!!!  We will be back, can't wait for the liquor license.  The owners were very nice also!!"}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying our night started with a terrible dining experience. We were attempting to go to Cheesecake Factory at Crocker Park, and it was a nightmare. The restaurant lot was filled as we were stuck behind a 6 car convoy circling the lot. Then we went to the parking garage and it was full as well, all the way to the top and again we were stuck behind a slow moving convoy. So we ended up parking at Nordstrom Rack on the shopping plaza side of Detroit. We walked 10 mins outside in the blistering cold to Cheesecake Factory after 30 mins of the parking spot search just to find an overflowed lobby of people waiting at 4:30!!!! Why is it so packed at 4:30????!!!! We thought we were arriving just early enough to beat the start of the dinner rush. I hate Crocker Park! This place irks me. So we walked 10 minutes back to our car. I was ready to eat subway or even worms at this point but the wife was set on having pasta for dinner. At this point I'm very irritated but I love my wife so I pulled up the Yelp app and found Stella Mia which I had bookmarked for years. So I said screw it, we will check this place out. So I road rage my way all the way to Stella Mia and arrive already disgruntled and distraught with our dining experience thus far for the evening.   The reason I just mentioned all that was so that you know I was pretty aggravated when I arrived and it would take a lot to have a good night at this point as HANGRY as I was! As I was eating my dinner I literally said \"Cheesecake Factory\" can suck it! lol. Everything was amazing from start to finish. The Hungarian Stuffed Peppers appetizer were the best stuffed peppers I ever had. I'm usually disappointed almost every time I get this appetizer at almost every place I try it at because the description says hot but never is. These actually had a kick packed with amazing flavors that weren't hidden behind the hotness. It was just a perfect blend of Hot and Flavorful! The salad was very fresh and crispy with a Balsamic Vinaigrette that was so good I had to make sure it was made in house because if not I had to know the brand. I could eat salad everyday with a dressing like that. For our entree we both ordered the Mozzarella Chicken because we are die hard Chicken Parmesan fans. This dish was AMAZING!!!! You can tell the Chicken was actually made there. It was pounded out to a perfect thickness and breaded with a perfect crunch topped with a bed of their sauce and finished with a  smothering of melted cheese. The sauce that was used on the Hungarian stuffed peppers, the chicken and the pasta was soooooooooo good!!!   To speak on the experience spectrum of things I have to say what an incredibly attentive and friendly staff.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile immediately and taken to our table. Right away after being seated another server came to ask us what we would like to drink and told us who our server would be. Such a nice touch to have this kind of team work. We have had many experiences where we waited forever and already knew what we were ordering before we even got our drinks. I really like the idea of having somebody provide drinks right away until the server can make it over to the table. \"Jayme\" was our server and she was awesome! She came over quickly to ask if we had any questions about the menu so far and if we wanted to start with an appetizer so that she could put that in right away for us. She was very friendly, attentive, caring and just perfect really. She always had great timing when arriving at our table to check on us, we always had our drinks full whether it was her or somebody else going around to check on us. Multiple people checked on us. This place just really cares about how people are treated and wants to make sure their dining experience is special. This is why I love finding a hidden gem. Jayme, thank you so much for turning a nightmare of a night into a special one! We will definitely be back and will request you as our server if you are there when we are.   If you want to be treated well and fed well then you have to try this place!! I'm an Elite Yelper but Stella Mia is the real MVP!!"}
{"text":"Stella Mia is INCREDIBLE!  My partner and I have had dinner here multiple times, yet last night was hands down the best.  The place was packed, got seated right away, there was a one man \"band\", who was incredible! Had no idea they had entertainment.  The owner was our server, love her to pieces! Food, again spot on! Never a disappointment! The chocolate cake, to die for!  If you've never been, I highly suggest going!  The one person we missed last night was Tina! But service was a 5 star!  Hope Stella Mia is around forever!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a nice relaxed atmosphere. The freshly baked bread was excellent with butter and for our sandwiches. Salads were fresh mixed greens with house made dressings. Service was attentive and friendly. This place is family-run and a real jewel. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside, great service and delicious food! We would definitely recommend and will be coming back very soon to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful hidden little fab restaurant that you need to try.   There is plenty of seating as the restaurant is well sized.  Clearly they have a great kitchen and well motivated staff who were timely and attentive in service.  The food was excellent.  I did not find the wait to be very long but the food was so fresh and delicious I was very pleased. The prices were clearly moderate and the food borders on 4 star food or 5 star food at 2 star prices so this should become a favorite go to spot.  Meatballs were excellent other ethic foods were also delicious. I am going to go back and if I do I will update this again.  These little ethnic gem restaurants are few and far between in our age of corporate packaging and chains who deliver good food. This food is a step wll above your typical fare that you pay about twice as much for."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  A must if you live on the West side.  Truly good food.  Ordered meatball appetizer: fresh and delicious recipe.  Veal marsala was amazing.  Half price bottles of wine on Tuesday.  Service by Tina was perfect."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. I got the salmon and risotto which was wonderful. My husband got the chicken carbonara, also very good. The manager sang happy birthday to a lady while we were there and it was so much better than the chain restaurant circus.  Laurie was our waitress and she was awesome!  Multitasking at its finest!  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is not your typical strip mall Italian joint. No sticky plastic table cloths and they didn't cover everything with mozzarella cheese like some Italian places tend to do. I know as an American I am supposed to cover everything in cheese but sometimes you want to taste your food. You should definitely give it a try.   First I have to rave about the excellent service. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. One person in our party requested special preparations and the staff was happy to oblige. Also, that Saturday there was a musician that played guitar for the diners. I thought that it might be distracting so the staff allowed us to choose wherever we wanted to sit which was nice. It turned out that the music was not too loud and quite pleasant.  We all really enjoyed our meals. We started with the meatball appetizer. The homemade meatballs were delicious and the marinara sauce was very flavorful. All our meals came with a salad and it wasn't your typical iceberg lettuce and cheese. The salads were very fresh and elegant with delicious frisee and arugula lettuce. Of course we were served complimentary bread which must have been home made.  Between the four of us we ordered the Veal Marsala, the spaghetti and meatballs, the Mediterranean pasta, and the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. I was able to try a little bit of everything. All were delicious. The veal was tender and flavorful, the spaghetti and meatballs were amazing and the Mediterranean pasta was chock full of artichokes, chicken and shrimp. We all loved our meals but my favorite was the pork, it was tender and juicy and the bacon was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I'm quite impressed with this place. My girlfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day. The truth behind why we came was simply because they were the only restaurant in the genre she liked that I could find with decent reviews that had open reservations.   We decided to give it a shot and I'm thoroughly impressed. This restaurant is definitely a diamond in the rough. The pricing is reasonable. I had a fantastic steak dinner and a chocolate martini. It was simply amazing. The staff seemed friendly across the board.   The restaurant had a beautiful decor, and felt cozy.   I am reserving the fifth star for one reason: the bread they bring to the table wasn't very good. They brought out two rounds of bread and they were both the same for me. They seemed a little dry or stale.   I'm going to come back. If the bread gets better I will definitely update this review to 5 stars. These guys deserve it. I hope business picks up for this place because they really are a treasure. Their location makes it hard for business I would imagine."}
{"text":"Like many already stated, a total hidden gem.  The ambience is casual, Italian romantic.  All of the staff are super friendly and eager to make your experience satisfying.  Went for my Birthday dinner and was not disappointed.  Nor was my family.  Every entree was carefully put together, and so fresh and tasty.    Tiramisu was outstanding.  Priced well for the portions.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"a gem in a strip mall, it was quiet and bright, We loved the stuffed peppers , Cioppinno was superb. with lots of delicious fish and shellfish .  red sauce was also quite good, We were there at a very quiet time and our waitress was delightful. This is my first review but i worry that this restaurant might be missed due to location. it is worth traveling for , Everything is made fresh and it is definitely not a chain restaurant ,"}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner last night. We all had great meals. We split the stuffed pepper appetizer which I thought was the highlight. It was just the right heat and ample to share.   Desserts good and tiramisu big enough R to share. I had the Camille and filling was creamy and flavorful.   The food here is good enough that I will return, but the service and friendliness of staff is what really shines."}
{"text":"Had the lunch Buffett.  I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty everything was and for 9.99 the options that were available.  I took a look at the dinner menu and will certainly be coming back soon.  Chocolate cake was insane."}
