{"text":"I like the place, ambience, customer service and although the food were portioned smaller than I anticipated the quality ingredients and taste were great.   I recommend the Risotto Nero, Carbonara (in house made pasta) and the Grilled Calamari (Brown butter taste so good). The Buffo pizza was yummy, but it didnt justify the $26 price tag and it wasn't even cut. The tiramisu was a let down, I prefer the cake.  The one disappointment that stood out for me was that I ordered another Carbonara for takeout since I enjoyed it. It was way too salty! I don't know what happened, but it was a huge letdown and I couldn't finish the pasta for how salty it was. Overall, I may come back next time to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"We were invited to a soft open. It was a great experience to see the hustle of a restaurant opening up to the public. The staff were awesome. Very welcoming and cared about our opinion on the 3 course meal offered. Decor was beautiful and high quality. You felt comfortable the second you walked in. We decided to order a cocktail, a Bellini. It was way too strong so I would suggest asking them first how strong the drink is if you're considering ordering one. We were told after that the Gin and Tonic is to die for. So on our next visit, we must try it. The first course was a tuna salad of sorts. It was very good, however, a bit salty. Second course was 2 pizzas. AMAZING. The Buffo pizza was fantastic. Sweet and savory. Just ask for extra napkins cause it's a bit sticky and eating with your fingers is a must. They won't judge :). We had the anatra pizza as well. Tasty. Crust was perfect, soft and light. Only comment was that the Buffo came cut but not the anatra so it was a bit awkward trying to cut into it. Again.. fingers are a must in this situation. Last was dessert. We got the 3 nuttela donuts. So yummy but very very sweet. Pairing it with tea or coffee is the perfect ending to a wonderful experience. This restraurant will do very well!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is modern with clean lines but has the severe decor so popular today. No sense of cosiness at all!  The waitresses were trying hard.  We went in at 4:00 P.M. and one of our party of three had a dairy allergy.  We were limited to a starter menu between 4:00 and 5:00 P.M. and almost nothing on the menu was dairy free.  The restaurant accommodated us by leaving the cheese out of the bruschetta which we ate while waiting until five o'clock to order from the dinner menu. We asked for bread too but all the bread had cheese baked into it so that was a nonstarter.  Unfortunately, the toast that the bruschetta came on was very blackened. The dinner menu was not your usual fare.  For example, the only  available risotto on the menu had squid.  Not everyone's cup of tea for risotto. The pizzas were exotic in terms of toppings and most of the dishes on the menu had an unusual twist which made them a  dodgy choice for those who like simple or traditional fare.  I opted for the duck pizza with Belgium endives and sweet apple.  Too much endive and once again the crust was blackened instead of nicely crisped and toasted! I don't like the taste of \"burnt\". My friends had lasagna and spaghetti which they said was very average in flavour.  All in all, I don't think I would recommend this restaurant and I don't think that I will return - at least not for a very long time.  Frankly, I will be surprised if Buffo is much of a success without making some serious changes."}
