{"text":"Everything was amazing.  We got fried calamari as an appetizer.  It was light and had good-sized pieces of tasty calamari  (not a ton of batter and grease).  As for the entrees, Chicken Parm was huge and delicious - everyone in my party agreed.  3 others in my party got various steaks - bacon wrapped, with mushroom sauce, etc..and one got Pork Souvlaki.  Everyone was very happy and surprised - comments were: juicy, tender, tasty.  I also liked the pickles they serve with bread at the start of the meal.  There were not a lot of people there (weekday night), the waitress was very friendly and both owners were around and greeted us - this is just a very authentic restaurant all around..it's dark, and decor is dated, but I think that just made me like it more.  The only thing I would ask for is more vegetables to be served with the entrees.  The entrees are really just meat.  I'm probably the only person would want this though..  As someone said, prices are similar to The Keg which is very fair for the quality you get."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place countless of times for over 30 years and finally made it in for dinner. I'm glad I did. This is honestly the best steak house in Scarborough. From the looks of the dining room it feels like it is stuck in the past, but in this case that's a good thing. This is a family run steakhouse and it shows. They don't treat you like a customer, they treat you like family. And this was my families first time here!  We started with appetizers:  Garlic bread - cheesy and buttery, so good Village Greek Salad - they way greek salad should be, good olive oil, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and ofcourse, huge pieces of Feta.  Soup of the day - lentil soup, not what I was expecting as I usually don't like lentils.This was great. Light soup full of flavor, and a family recipe that they were happy to share with us. Not kidding, they told us how to make it. (Like i said, treated like family, not a customer)  We then had our steaks. New York for me, Medallions and Filet for the girls. So, so good. Good portions, cooked perfectly, tender, and juicy. Why we've never had dinner here before, regretfully I cannot answer. But I do know I will be coming back again and again when we want a good steak dinner.   The only negative with this experience was the lighting. It is very dark in here. And when they stuff you with so much good food its easy to fall asleep. But I can live with that for sure. Would 100% recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Rarely am I disappointed in the food here. For the most part it is excellent. The cheese, garlic bread is to die for. It is addictive. The salads are just okay which come with the meal. The meal itself is tasty. Last visit I had the Fillet Mignon shish kabob special and it was tasty. The meat was very tender. I do wish the owners would offer more light in the restaurant. It is difficult to read the menu. Usually our service is excellent. The waitress we had on this visit was a little abrupt with us. It totally unnerved me. This has never happened before. I know we can be a bit indecisive but most of the staff usually handle our questions with ease and do not make us feel awkward. We will continue to frequent here because overall one can expect decent food and decent service. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch for green pepper corn steak, medium rare wrapped in bacon.  Delicious.  The deep apple pie was a nice touch too.  Thank you Blackhorn!"}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood gem!  The food does not disappoint and the staff are friendly and attentive.  Each entree comes with soup or salad and portions are generous.  The restaurant is surprisingly spacious with additional seating in a beautifully updated basement space.  Perfect for family meals and for larger scale group gatherings.  We go to this restaurant every week!"}
{"text":"Great food in a hidden gem.  Sign says they have been open since 1969.  Had a 10 oz striploin. Cooked perfectly. Nice cut of well aged meat. Will be back."}
{"text":"The meat was great, the potatoes not so much tiramisu cheesecake was delicious."}
{"text":"Great service, one of the best in Scarborough. Although I found the steaks to be decently average, other steak on the menu is worth coming to this restaurant for. Their saganaki opa was really good, and so unique. Not to mention that the ladies working here are super helpful and sweet. I would go with one of their recommendations. Love to come back and try their Strogonoff."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst steakhouse. Been twice and had to send back my steak both times. First time ordered Pittsburgh style rare and got a charred steak med. Second time was a NY striploin wrapped in bacon on special and I ordered rare and received med well. Waitress told me to eat the middle. Excuse me but I want to eat the whole steak and enjoy it. Sent it back. Garlic bread is good though. Too bad I sat and watched my dinner date eat while I waited. Killed the mood and was his bday. Will never go back. I'd spend the extra cash and go to any other steakhouse. Always give one chance to  every restaurant. My dinner date ordered the prime rib and was satisfied with med rare cut and a large portion. At least he had a good meal for his bday. Just not happy being told to only eat the center. Not good customer service. That was rude."}
{"text":"We came in for a stake and what we got was pure awesome! After reading the Yelp reviews we made the dash over. We had the ribeye 12oz and the bacon rapped 8oz. Wow! Amazing food! So good! The waitress was the sweetest lady too she went the extra mile for us. We started with pickles! Then home made bread followed by salad then a super stake dinner! And finished the date with tiramisu cheese cake! You bet your ass we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint, hidden and long standing steakhouse in Scarborough,  The back of the restaurant was very dim with candles, which was pretty romantic, but the front was bright with the window facing a bland patio and street.  Food is reasonably priced at around $30.00 dollars per steak, which includes a salad, veggies and your choice of potato.  Note that there is an upgrade fee of $3.95 for the ceasar salad and an upgrade fee of $1.00 for the baked potato.    Overall, the steak was cooked well.  The striploin had a charred taste and the filet was delicate and buttery.  The bruschetta and the garlic bread were tasty appetizers to begin with, but they also serve warm bread with huge slabs of butter if you do not wish to order an appetizer.  The downsides to this place is that the ceasar salad didn't really have a kick to it, it was bland for me, however, I do like lots of garlic and anchovies in my ceasar salad dressing.  The view by the window has much to be desired and the waitress was really unrefined! She did not mention the daily specials as the other waitresses did at the other tables and she even made a comment \"You guys are slow!!! (eating)\", which of course made me feel weird because, what does she want us to do? is this a buffet that we have an hour limit? Is this Mcdonalds? It's a fairly decent priced steakhouse, but it is still a steakhouse and do not need to be rushed out of there.  I think if the service was just ok, instead of being so unrefined, I would be inclined to give this four stars.  I really like the fact that it is not a chain restaurant and that the steak was pretty good.  However, the baked potato had only sour cream, the fries were the frozen kind and the ceasar salad was not that special.  The pickles were amazing.  I am not sure if the bread they used for the bruschetta and garlic bread is baked in house.  That is why I would have given this a four star.  It was three star because I have no idea what happened with the waitress?!? confused.  The coffee was really good and is free refills."}
{"text":"I had high hopes because of the great ratings on Yelp, but it turned out Blackhorn was quite unimpressive and extremely overpriced. Started out with the fried calamari, which was tasty but nothing out of this world and definitely not worth $16. It also tasted like it might've been fried in older oil. The asparagus and pea soup was nice, although the consistency was very watery, almost as if they wanted to stretch the batch out by thinning it out. The saddest part of my meal was the filet mignon - lacked the tender filet mignon flavour, was super charred, and served with a small side of veggies and potatoes. For a $40 entree it was highly disappointing and I can confidently say The Keg's filet mignon is seasoned better, cooked better and cheaper than this (and The Keg's steak isn't that amazing by any means). My partner felt the same way about his experience and we agreed at the end of the meal that we won't be coming back to Blackhorn in the future. The cherry on top was that he got a stomach ache when we came home and then I woke up with one the next day - that was the only meal we ate together so it had to have been something we had at Blackhorn. I hate to write bad reviews but this is something I felt was necessary, hopefully others had/have better experiences. The bread was great though!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my most favourite restaurants in Toronto and has been so for years. Everything I or my husband, family and friends have tried has been top notch. My Gourmet Group of 33 years often chooses to go here when we are not planning a dinner at one of our homes. The service is always excellent. Free parking too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic, the service is impeccable and the food was A1. I had the steak Neptune that was cooked to perfection and I could not believe the amount of seafood that was on top of the steak my companion had the filet mignon in the most terrific blue cheese sauce. We loved it and we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  After being shut out of other steakhouses in the city for Christmas Day due to it being fully booked, I came across Blackhorn Steakhouse and decided to try this place out, as the menu looked promising and the reviews seemed excellent.  The interior is quite dark. Not a lot of lighting, which was a pretty good atmosphere for a date...although most of the customers here that night were of the older clientele.  There was a special Christmas Day menu that day. To be honest I never looked at the actual menu, so I wasn't sure if there were price differences or selection changes, but at least everything that my family and I wanted were all in the menu.  I had the green peppercorn steak, followed by the trufflicious cake. My family also shared escargots as an appetizer. The escargots were not the best; while they were plentiful, the pieces were quite small and I tasted a lot more of the cheese than the escargot itself. The peppercorn steak, however, was excellent. Perfectly cooked medium rare, juicy, and the peppercorn added a nice zesty touch to it. The trufflicious cake was decent, but it was kinda overshadowed by the tiramisu cake my parents ordered, which was superior to the trufflicious cake in taste IMO.  Service was excellent, and the food was very reasonably priced. I'll definitely return for other special occasions, and perhaps try some other items since it seemed the Christmas Day menu was limited compared to their wealth of steak options available."}
{"text":"We visited the Blackhorn when we were visiting Toronto from out of town. We went there based in the Yelp reviews and were so happy that we did. We likely wouldn't have found and/or chosen this lovely place otherwise as it looks like any other strip mall restaurant from the outside.  When you walk in, the decor is dark and dated, but the staff were very welcoming and made it feel quaint and charming and intimate.  After a yummy plate of pickles and a yummy bowl of bread, it was a short wait for 3 plates of pasta and meat. Ample food portions, well cooked meat and veggies made this all better than any chain restaurant we would have considered as an alternative.  Sure, it likely costs 3-8 dollars more per plate, but in our opinion, well worth it.   We would gladly visit again!"}
{"text":"This place looks dark and uninviting from the outside - it located in a small strip plaza but is definitely a hidden gem! The menu has many options - steak, seafood, lamb, Souvlaki etc. Fresh pickles and bread are brought before the meals. The service is efficient. The owner or his son at times takes the order themselves and often walks around to greet the patrons. I've always ordered the steak and I've never been disappointed. The food is quality and the food is fresh - I'm tempted to say that it's even better than the Keg."}
{"text":"Great menu and great value. Wife and I dined here for a date night was really impressed. The steak Neptune was great! Printed a free appetizer coupon online and they had no problem honouring it. Great service. We'll be back."}
