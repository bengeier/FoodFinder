{"text":"Full disclosure... I used to go here all of the time until they got a bad health rating. I put them on about a six month hiatus before I worked up the nerve to go there again. In that time I ate at many hole in the wall Chinese places. None of them really won me over.

So I went back to Tea Room and all I can say is wow. It's not that they have changed from before. Rather it is how much better they tasted than all of the other strip mall type Chinese spots. That hiatus gave me perspective. Are they PF Chang's? No. But when you get that craving for some cheap Chinese that is just plain solid? Tea Room won't steer you wrong. I go probably three times every month."}
{"text":"Great food and quick delivery! Always my go to Chinese restaurant for delivery. Drivers are always friendly and delivery has never taken over 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"it's disgusting... and the guy yelled at me cause he had supposedly waited for an 30mins. And he kept going off about that so I tipped him 5 dollars so he could shut up cause I didn't want to be mean  he couldn't have been waiting for 30 mins I ordered my food to come in at 11:55. I called the restaurant at 12:08 and the delivery guy called me at 12:09.

Wish I could give it zero stars


And I've never left reviews but I just had to for this"}
{"text":"For a few years they've been really good on their delivery, but I'm getting tired of their lack of customer consideration.

Nobody ever answers the phone like they want, or care about, your business.  They sound bored and uninterested.  But the food is usually good and delivery is usually pretty quick.  However, they never tell you on the phone when to expect your food or even how much it's going to be.  All the other places we call for delivery are considerate enough to let you know when to expect your food and how much to expect to pay.

Recently we ordered some delivery --- I asked when I should expect the food and I was told 45 minutes.  An hour later I called to get an update --- it had been raining all day and the guy who took my order seemed really unsure about how to spell my street name, even though they've been here several times before.  I was told they were busy and the delivery should be here in fifteen minutes.

Twenty minutes after that call, I called back to see what's going on.  If they're lost, they're lost, you know?  Maybe I can help get the guy here.  I'm told that they're busy and it's been raining, so..... you know?  No, I don't know.  I know it was raining when I placed the order, so if you're that busy, then tell me it's going to be an hour and not 45 minutes.  If your guy is lost, then tell me, or call me and let me know he's lost.  My family is waiting an hour and 20 minutes at this point.

At this point it doesn't make sense for them to even show up.  It's embarrassing for them to even walk up to my door with, what I presume, is going to be cold food.  If they made my food an hour ago, then it's been in this guy's car since then and I don't want it.  Or did they make it an hour ago?  Did they lose my order and not tell me?  Has the delivery guy been out delivering this whole time and he's just hopelessly behind on deliveries?  I decided to wait to see when --- IF --- he would show up.

We made a pizza.

Two hours and ten minutes after the initial order there is a ring at the door.  And then the guy just starts leaning on the door bell.  I barely have time to get up from the table and walk down the hall and he's rung the bell five or six times.  Yeah, that's annoying --- you're the guy who's over an hour late and now you're being just being a jerk. 

I opened the door with a slice of pizza in my hand.  He tried to hand me my food while telling me how much it's going to be.... wait, where have you been?  We made pizza!  Is the food even warm?  Yes, it's fresh and warm ... so when did you make it?  An hour ago?  Two hours ago?  Twenty minutes ago?  He doesn't know.  Did you get lost?  No? Well we're only five miles from the restaurant --- where have you been?  I didn't get any good answers --- not even an apology.  But I did get a steep, steep discount on my (somewhat) warm food.

If you had to wait two hours for your food to come out in the restaurant, what would you do?  Wait ... what do you mean you wouldn't wait two hours for your food to come out in a restaurant?  You'd want an apology or some kind of feasible explanation, wouldn't you?  I got neither of those things.  

What almost certainly happened is the order was lost or sent to someone else ----- so it had to be made again.  That's fine with me because I want fresh food, but don't try to BS me in some lame fashion about the weather or something else.  Be straight with me so I can make dinner plans ---- start playing games with me and I'll start looking at other options and then I'll come on Yelp and tell everyone what a lame business you run."}
{"text":"Another decent Chinese restaurant, but on the other side of town from where I usually hang.  Great Chicken wings, it must be something in the grease they use to fry them, but man its good, obviously the wings are greasy, and they have a slight yellow tinge, but  scrumptious none the less.  The fries rice here is bangin, get the \"House Special Fried Rice\" it has tons of goodies inside, like shrimp, chicken, and pork pieces all mixed into savory rice.  They also have an amazing Pu-Pu Platter (What a great name for a dish). The shrimp lo mien was alright, better than Panda's Den, but not quite as good as the Cherry House.  The China Tea Room is just up the street from Carowinds, so if you are hungry after a day at the amusement park, there are more choices than gas stations and Wendy's,  head down Carowind's Blvd  towards Tryon and check out this little Chinese gem hidden in plain sight in the strip mall. It's tiny so keep your eyes open once you turn onto S Tryon. They are very inexpensive as well, with large portions."}
{"text":"Good food and fast delivery!  Very nice people!  Pick up and delivery are easy. Online menu!  We love their hot and sour soup especially!"}
{"text":"I am originally from up north where the chinese food is typically much better so I may be different then someone from charlotte having chinese and never tasted anything better but this place is really bad. There entrees are pretty much unedible. The only things they have that are ok is there appetizer stuff. Basically anything pre made and fried like crab rangoons etc. However, even this stuff is sub par. I seriously do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Chinese food in Steele Creek, possibly Charlotte. Their service is lacking but the food is delicious so it makes up for it. I ordered takeout from the restaurant and it was fairly quick."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Nasty food. Sticky gross tables and floor... Horrible attitude from owners and cashier. Disgusting moldy drink machine. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"This was by far the absolute worse hibachi I've ever had!!!! The chicken wasn't even cooked like hibachi style and had so much black pepper!! The vegetables tasted old I couldn't even eat it!! It was all I could do to eat the rice!! I will never go back there and I don't recommend any else go there either!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty good, we ordered crab rangoons (spelling isn't correct) they were pretty nasty. I was upset about that we also ordered chicken wings and pork fried rice and it was really good no complaints there! We ordered it to be delivered they where very nice and it came pretty fast. We will be returning"}
{"text":"So since I've lived in Charlotte (2 years). I haven't been able to get good Chinese food. Until now. I just ordered for the fist time and food was was not just decent it was good. Now that I live in Steele Creek. This is the spot!!  I will definitely order again. The price is reasonable and the delivery was quick. If you live in the area try this place."}
{"text":"Always great service and super fast. Just don't love the won tons, very bland compared to every other Chinese place. Fried rice is on point"}
{"text":"I actually live in the neighborhood behind this place and so it's super convenient! We've been ordering at least once a month for almost 2 years now and always really enjoy our meal! Prices are totally reasonable, food is fresh and hot, and delivery is pretty quick! I HIGHLY recommend their Hibachi Chicken Dinner with fried rice, you WONT be disappointed! Super delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a rainy evening. Hot n sour soup, veggie roll and Kung Pao Chicken. The soup was fairly flavorful, although less spicy than I ordered. It will had a good taste. The veggie egg roll was kind of mushy on the inside. The Kung Pao chicken was good, just lacking the heat I thought I asked for. 
You can order online and pay cash or credit. 
Delivery took about 30 minutes or so. Which was pretty fast considering it was rush hour. 
I would order again but probably ask for extra extra hot."}
{"text":"About what you'd expect from a strip mall Chinese restaurant. Average Chinese food, but consistent. Family run restaurant."}
{"text":"I moved away from Charlotte/Steele Creek five years ago.  I ate at China Tea Room the very first weekend they opened, and my family frequented this neighborhood restaurant countless times until we moved.  We were always impressed by the Tea Room's consistent great flavors, as well as the way they kept the facility clean and in good repair.   If I had to take a guess, it would probably be 20 times a year for however many years it was, definitely over 100 visits.

I also ate a farewell meal there just a few days before I left in 2007 just to try to remember the great flavors we had all enjoyed for so long.  So while visiting Charlotte recently, I knew I had to come back and see how things were going.  

On the downside, the condition of the restaurant has deteriorated significantly.  The floor was dirty, the tables hadn't been cleaned, and the pictures of the food over the counter looked terribly dingy.

But I wasn't going to be swayed by the condition if only I could enjoy some great flavors again.  I ordered the special of the day, hibachi salmon, and my guest ordered one of our family's favorites, chicken & broccoli.   My hibachi salmon was excellent.  It was cooked perfectly, with moist flesh in a thin sauce with onions and great peppery flavor.  The side of thinly sliced zucchini was also tasty.  I tried out my guest's chicken & broccoli, and it was as great as it had been 5 years ago as well.

One thing I look for in all Asian food is a light hand on the sauce, with a delicateness of flavor where each ingredient shines through, and the sauce doesn't overwhelm the dish but rather pulls all the flavors together.  China Tea Room has nailed this quality since the first weekend, while I struggle to find it in countless other Chinese takeout places I've tried all over the country.

As disappointing as the appearance of the Tea Room was, it was great to know they're still turning out great Asian flavors.   I sincerely hope they'll invest some attention to these issue so customers will continue to support it.  The flavors are too good to see this excellent Chinese takeout place fail.

{"text":"I always order from the Asian Grill portion of the menu and the hibachi is awesome! Fried rice is great too. We have ordered from here several times and they have proven themselves consistent."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese places in this area , I think this is one of the best. Their food is less greasy than wang and king and they are very fast and affordable . Had way better Chinese food in Florida and the UK to be honest but for around here this place can't be beat...   (:"}
{"text":"Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me."}
{"text":"Our go to for Chinese in the Steele creek area. Prices are good, the menu is large, the service is pretty quick and the food is always good. 
 Not sure what else I can add to this review other than check 'em out"}
{"text":"This place is quick.  The food is not as consistent as I'd like.  Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's so so.  I do wish the telephone operators to perk up a little bit, I mean- words are free - I'm not paying by the word so please use them freely and lead a friendly conversation as I'm ordering to give you my money  :-)"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out on a recommendation of a neighbor. Had the General Tso's Shrimp which was good but would probably be a lot better if you ate it in there dining room. If we order that again to go we will definitely get the sauce on the side to prevent the shrimp from being soggy. Wings were just OK and IMO the fried rice was kinda dry. The food was just OK,  nothing to write home or brag about. May try them again on a late rainy Friday night."}
{"text":"I love this place. I would order from here at least once a week when I lived close by. I have since moved and greatly miss them. The food was always ready when promised and the portions were perfect."}
{"text":"China Tea Room is exactly what you think it is the normal run of the mills chinese take out restaurant. 

The space isn't big but they have seating for about 20 customers. On my visit I did take out. I wanted Asian food and was open to trying a new place plus I had a coupon for $2 off an order of $15 after 4pm. 

I used yelp and their website to be able to view their menu. I phoned in an order and they said my order would be ready in 15 minutes. 

My order was chicken and broccoli in garlic sauce dinner combination and chicken Lo Mein dinner combination. The great thing about the dinner combo is it comes with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I liked how even the noodle combo came with fried rice. 

The ease of ordering and pick up was great. They had a self serve condiment station and plenty of to go menus to grab for future reference. 

Now the most important thing the taste. Let's just say I wasn't over impressed or under impressed. It was my normal expectation for Chinese take out. You get what you pay for and I didn't pay for exquisite flavor. My chicken wasn't too spicy but the garlic flavor didn't shine thru. The fried rice was bland and the egg was just ok. My nephew ate his Lo Mein with no complaints. 

This will probably be my first and last time at China Tea Room.

{"text":"Yay!!! This place delivers AND you can place your order online.  Tried them for the first time on a Friday night, delivery took about 45 minutes, perhaps that was because it was a weekend.  Very courteous delivery driver.  I had the pork fried rice, it had a lot of meat and veg, a little bland but soy sauce helped.  Hot and sour soup was good, they let you pick spice level.  I picked medium, it was fairly mild so if you like it nice and spicy bypass the medium option.
Will definitely try them again, they have a large menu."}
{"text":"I order here several times a month. Their entrees are  delicious but their rice needs work. I feel like the rice is undercooked every time I order their dinner combo so I just avoid eating much of it."}
{"text":"The food is average. The sesame chicken is hit or miss. Sometimes tons of dark meat sometimes half dark half medium meat. If you ask for white meat chicken they just give you the chicken from the sweet and sour dish and just a huge side of sesame, peanut whatever kind of sauce. I guess it's family run so the kids that ring me out are usually pretty chill and efficient."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!! Not only did they mess up our delivery order, when we called to get it corrected the owner told us we would have to come to the restaurant and bring the messed up order and he would remake the order. When I asked to have the delivery charge waived since we would have to come there he said he wasn't going to argue with me and didn't need our business. (We ordered noodles and he sent us pork fried rice which we cannot eat under any circumstance). He then had the audacity to tell me we didn't order the noodles.  He ended up sending a driver to come get the food for me to get a refund instead of making the correct order and picking up the wrong one. If i could leave a negative star I would. I have never been treated this way by a restaurant in my life. Not only have they lost my business but my family and friends and I will be sure to tell as many people as possible."}
{"text":"Gross! Very average to below average food and small and. It was not a good experience! You could get over how small it is when you come pick up your food if the food was actually good but it's so average to below average Chinese that he appearance makes it so much worse.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 meals received 2 , delivery driver states I don't know what to tell you. Called into store was told I would be charged a second delivery fee for them to correct the mistake they made..... The food is good but the staff is incredibly rude I was eating here once a week for the past 2 years and will never return"}
{"text":"The food is alright. Kinda mediocre though. Had sesame chicken, crab Rangoon, and a spring roll. All was alright. Likely to return due to convenience and price."}
{"text":"Quick spot for lunch, but nothing fancy.

The food is pretty good and service is quick. If only they'd make the place look a bit more like their fancy website - I was a little mislead, thinking this was going to be more of a sit-down, waiter service style restaurant, but overall still a nice lunch location.

Best Tip about this place: They have real Chinese television on at their location - no english subtitles either."}
