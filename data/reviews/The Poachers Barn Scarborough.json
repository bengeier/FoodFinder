{"text":"We tried to go to the Poachers Barn, but were told that following a recent takeover of the pub they are not currently doing food - though they haven't updated signage to say so yet... looks a decent enough pub, but obviously check ahead to see if the new owners are doing food yet!"}
{"text":"speaking as a regular, the Poachers Barn has now become the focal point of the village, especially since the Post Office and Village Shop have disappeared. Other pubs in the area cannot hold a candle to the warm and friendly atmosphere, the excellent menu and the real ale (especially the Marstons Cocker Hoop which is a delight!). Richard the Landlord has worked tirelessly to make it a success with Pool and Darts Teams, Sunday Quiz nights and one offs such as the Ghost Night. The Christmas Carol night on the village green with free mulled wine and mince pies was well attended and the New Years Eve Party saw lots of new faces. Hopefully some of these people will return in the future and help make the pub the succes it deserves."}
{"text":"Can't praise this pub enough. We've visited on several occasions to have a meal and a drink when we've been in the area, and have always been made to feel very welcome. Good pub food with generous helpings and in my opinion excellent value for a reasonable amount of money. Loved the vegetarian options which I've had to date with a good choice. My husband loved the chefs signature dish and my brother is addicted to the monster fish and chips. Very child friendly and the landlord and his staff always seem eager to please. Give it a go, I'm sure you won't be disappointedthey've certainly got our custom for the foreseeable future, we'll be back soon Poachers!!"}
{"text":"Lovely family orientated pub which serves good, fresh, wholesome food. Nothing is too much trouble.


 Warm and cosy.


 Would recommend but watch for the Landlord.. he bites!!!!"}
{"text":"The Poachers barn at Osgodby is our favorite bar and restaurant. The poachers is located in the village centre with easy access from all directions. The new bypass which has taken the constant traffic flow away from the area makes it all the better for a quiet drink in the beer garden or the outside tables. The Poachers offers more than just a drink, it is a traditional place, and a place you feel welcome. Richard the landlord is your host and one of the friendly faces behind the bar. 
The Poachers is a family bar with menus for all tastes.


 Update 1/1/10
The Poachers New year party was not to be missed, A personal welcome from the Landlord to us and our friends. Inside the early revellers had taken our favourite seats but it turned out to be a bonus on our part, the large restaurant had been turned into a buffet / disco / karaoke and we found a suitable table. 
The FREE buffet was endless, every time a tray emptied another one appeared. A good selection to choose from, and both hot cold food was available.


 For all you Motorhome owners who want a safe stop off for the night the Poachers allows this service. A large hard standing area at the rear is the ideal solution.


 In summary, give it a try you wont be disappointed.


 Dave, Debb, Dora."}
{"text":"We went to the Poachers for the third time hoping that this time we would have a decent dining experience only to be disappointed yet again. Whilst in the restaurant all we could hear was the cook and the young waitresses acting like they were still in playschool and swearing as though they were navvies! We live locally so hoped when these new people came that we could once again have a decent local. How wrong we were! Even I know that salad should be served cold and I'm no cook."}
