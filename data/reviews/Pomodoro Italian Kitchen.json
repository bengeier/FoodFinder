{"text":"Consistently good food... would just appreciate a little more hospitality from the owners/staff. A smile and some small talk wouldn't kill them.... they make you feel like they are doing you a favour by serving you... what's up with that?"}
{"text":"Decent food.  Service was fine.  Veal panini could have used a little more veal for the money"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! They do not disappoint. Dough was great! Sauce is delicious. This was our first time here. We were looking for good pizza close to home and this place hit the mark right on. The price point is fantastic for the quality you get. Will definitely be coming back with a big appetite in tow. This place is worth more than the 3.5 rating currently posted on Yelp."}
{"text":"The Best Panzerotti in the world. Have been coming here for over 25 years and I can't say that I have ever had a bad meal. Everything is so fresh and you could feel the love of the food!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. It is a small family fun Italian restaurant. The first time I called in a panzorotti order for pick up. I got home and noticed that they forgot 1 topping in one of them. I called them to let them know and tell them that it was no big deal. They appologized and it sounded sincere. About 1 week later I went back in, they remembered me and gave me my order free. That is not the reason why I am giving them 5 stars, the reason for that score would be because of the friendly service I received from start to finish on both visits, and most importantly the food. I must say it was one of the best panzorotti's I've had. They have a full Italian Italian menu that I am sure to try."}
{"text":"Weird hours. Slices are really tasty and prices are average.

I'd like to try something different next time."}
{"text":"I've only ever got the pizza slices but saw someone order the panzaratto....holy humungus batman!

A great quick option that really fills.

Layout is...ok.  Nothing to rave about.

Staff is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Can only review based on the pizzas I ordered, (can't yet vouch for pasta or Panzerotti). Take a look at the menu (available online) and you can see they have a tonne of options, many of which are quality Italian ones you aren't likely to find anywhere else (bocconcini, Parmigiana, Pesto, artichokes, fresh herbs, etc...). Good news is that the pizza comes out as good as you'd hope.
I didn't expect it to be cheap, given the quality of the food. Only downside perhaps is that they charge a minimum of $2 for each additional topping and it can really add up when basil is being charged the same as a meat option. Still, we and our guests absolutely loved the pizza and I'd be shocked to find something better in the area."}
{"text":"Been going here on and off for years now. Maybe more Veal on their sandwiches would help the cause, but still very tasty because of their sauce and you can tell it's not your frozen box of Veal being thrown in a fryer pre breaded. 

Its not wood or brick oven but their Pizza is definitely something else if you are willing to pay a little extra compared to most spots. I definitely need to go in to take a Crack at the pasta. 

I would have dropped a three star review if it wasn't for the service."}
{"text":"What Pomodoro lacks in \"atmosphere\"  it more than makes up for in quality. Their pizza, pasta, and eggplant parmesan are all amazing. Their salads are fresh and crisp and have a delicious, zesty dressing. The portion sizes are very generous, too.  I'm a vegetarian, so I can't speak to the meat selections, but I have never been disappointed when eating here and I have been eating here once a month for several years. Long live Pomodoro! P.S. Their washrooms are always spotless!"}
{"text":"I ordered into my hotel for delivery. I ordered the lasagna. It was hot and full of fresh pasta noodles , meat and lots of cheese. Yum! The Caesar salad I won't order again. It was just lettuce and dressing wish some croutons. No cheese or bacon. The garlic bread was a disappointment- cold bread with hard cold mozzarella cheese. You'll have to heat it up to enjoy it.  Overall I think - it was just ok. I'll try their pizza next time.  ++ points for on time delivery. They were fast and poliet"}
{"text":"I called Pomodoro's last week to place a lunch order for a few of us at work. The website says \"We deliver within our area ($15 minimum order).\" When I asked about it, the guy who answered (Jas?) said the minimum order was $50 for delivery. He said the $15 minimum didn't start until 5 pm, yet there was no mention of this on the website. Since all my co-workers were already set on Italian that day, I proceeded with the order anyway. I started ordering our meals and drinks, then Jas said he doesn't take drink orders over the phone, since we can just add those when we pick up the order. When I asked if cheese was included with the paninis, he said none of the paninis come with cheese, but when I asked about cheese on the Chicken Parmigiana Panini, he was very condescending, saying that ALL parmigianas come with cheese. When we picked up the order, our total including drinks before taxes ended up to be over $47, so had he taken our drink order over the phone with our meal order, we would have just thought of adding some small appetizer to bring us over the $50 minimum order requirement to qualify for their lunch delivery! Would've been nice to know that we were only an appetizer away from getting delivery! The food was okay, but the horrible service (or lack thereof) definitely left a very bad taste in our mouths! Would not recommend this place to ANYBODY!!! Wish there was a -5 stars!"}
{"text":"Tastiest and freshest pizza in BTown. Went on a weekday at lunch."}
{"text":"We order for delivery from Pomodoro's on a regular basis. I have no complaints about the food at all, in fact, some of their stuff is fantastic! We get the pazzo, thin crust veggie pizza and wings most of the time but even their veal panini and fettuccine with alfredo and bacon is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area.  Eat in or take out.  

Reasonably priced slices.  Their full pizzas are great as well. 

Pretty busy at lunch.  I have not seen dinner yet (I work in the area during the day)

If you have not tried this pizza -- get your butt in there.  

Grazie Pomodoro"}
{"text":"Visited Pomodoro's on Thu for lunch with a party of 3. You enter the doors and there are tables and banquet seating at the front. The order counter and kitchen are at the back. You walk through and there is a large menu board above you. We all ordered veal sandwiches as that's what we came for. I got mine with sautéed mushrooms and mozzarella cheese and Brio to wash it all down. After ordering we found an open table and our food arrived within 5min which was pretty quick.

The sandwich was made using a large kaiser bun. The veal was thinly cut with a nice thick coating of Italian breadcrumbs. The sauce was good and they didn't load the sandwich with it. The sautéed mushrooms and cheese add depth. This was a good proper veal sandwich but not the best I've had.

I would visit again and will need to try their pizza next time."}
{"text":"First five star review on yelp. Now, I know compared to some higher class restaurants this place may not be a five star, but as pizza goes, this is my favourite place in the GTA by far. Their sauce and crust is delicious and has that amazing homemade quality. I typically grab a slice with artichoke and feta, but if I have a big appetite I will order a cheese panzerotti. What's amazing is that they do not put sauce inside them. Instead, you get a large dipping cup of their warm-off-the-stove marinara. YUM! I have also tried many of their salads, which were all great, and the chicken parmigiana sandwich is to die for. I always find the staff is polite. Highly recommend Pomodoro!"}
{"text":"Well went in yesterday to see your new sized slices I heard from friends in area. Man was I disappointed. I have been a customer for 20 years and always raved to friends about your big slices. Now this new small size for same big price is not worth it. Looks like I will be going elsewhere. If you ever go back to big slice let me know as many friends and I are now not going to visit you anymore. 

The fact is now you need a minimum of 2 slices to get full. So 11+ dollars... I could go get a full pizza for that at even Pizza Hut as they have daily deals. 

Even the panzerotti I received about a month back was smaller than usual. I even paid double cheese and got very little cheese.

My old friends of pomodoro I wish I could say better after 20 years, but I guess this is where we part ways."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch.

Large variety of pizza slices are available to be reheated in the oven.  Slices are thin crust and slightly dry.  $4.29 gets you a large slice that's cut in two.

Paninis are filling and comforting - chicken and eggplant parmigianas ($7.49) are highlights.

Panzarottis ($6.99 for cheese, $7.49 with pepperoni) are big and made fresh to order.  The dough is on the tough side.

Service is quick, but table service is sometimes forgetful and confused."}
{"text":"I would actually give Pomodoro's a 2.5 but Yelp doesn't give that option.

A friend and I were looking for a place to have some Italian food and this was the closest around her neighbourhood according to Google Maps. The reviews were surprisingly higher at the Mississauga location than the Brampton one. 

As we entered I commented on how we were the only non-Italian's there because neither of us are Italian (obviously!). The family-run restaurant is quite small and has about 6 tables where 2 of them were booths. The menu isn't extensive while not too simple. The staff at Pomodoro's are quite friendly and even helped my friend decide on which sauce she should have with her penne.

I ordered the pepperoni panzarotti which came out to be $7.49 and my friend ordered penne pasta with rose sauce which was $9.99. When they brought our order to our table, the also gave us complimentary garlic bread. The garlic bread tasted more like bread and was quite plain. The panzarotti was HUGE! However, the majority of it is dough and there's barely any filling inside besides air. I ended up only eating the bottom part of the panzarotti because I didn't feel like eating just dough. My friend let me try her pasta and it was alright. Nothing special to comment on considering how even we can make it at home.

I probably wouldn't go to this location again because I RARELY go to Brampton. However, there is a Mississauga location which is about 5 minutes from my house which I might end up trying."}
{"text":"They delivered to hotel I am staying at. Yay! Delivery was fast, food was pretty good, and my order definitely came with a lot of food!
I got the eggplant parmigiana and garlic bread with a mixed salad. 
The salad was wonderful- fresh, variety of vegetables and dressing was a light refreshing vinaigrette. Garlic bread was warm and buttery. The eggplant parmigiana didn't come with the spaghetti noodles like I'm used to. It wasn't the best I've had but OK. 
Pros- delivery, fast service, decent food, good customer service, large portions, mobile credit card processing 
Cons- a bit pricey, food is about a 3.5 star
When I'm back in town, I'd like to try their pizza and maybe try dining in.
Overall thumbs up!"}
{"text":"By far this is the best pizza in Brampton! It's a hotspot during lunches and dinners so come early. They serve wicked sandwiches and panzerotti. Definitely check them out."}
{"text":"The lasagna was quite possibly the worst I've ever had in my life. Literally ground beef, noodles, cheese and some sauce on top. Y'all couldn't cook the beef in \"Nonna's sauce\"? It was so bland. Couldn't even finish it, would've exchanged it for a sandwich (cause at least those are still good) but didn't realize how disappointing my dinner would be until I got home.
Sigh.
I'll stick to places downtown for my lasagna fix now on...."}
