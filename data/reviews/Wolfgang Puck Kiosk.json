{"text":"Gotta disagree with Dan the Man on this one - of all the grab & go options in CLT, Wolfgang Puck places first. It's important to denote the price gouging is assumed, as it's an airport and every pre-packaged sandwich or salad rides above the $10 mark. Wolfgang Puck is no different.

Where the wheat separates from the chaff is in actual execution. I got a fresh, crisp Chinois Chicken Salad for $11 and I ate the whole durned thing. A napa cabbage and romaine base with a mustard-soy vinaigrette, crunchy wontons and real herb roasted chicken. It was more than airport good, it was actually good.

Avoid the sandwiches, and stick with the greens. You can see everything inside."}

This miniscule kiosk is at the very end of Terminal C. Our plane was leaving shortly and we needed to grab something before we boarded for Hartford.

So we each grabbed a Turkey Club Sandwich with avocado, and when the cashier said \"$25.98\" I kind of laughed at the ridiculousness of the price of the unmarked sandwiches.

Whatever.. we were in a rush and we were hungry. Our hunger changed to disappointment when we unwrapped the packaging. Massive slabs of bread, a few slices of turkey, a few sprinkles of pulverized bacon, a miniscule green schmear (must be the avocado), and a few shreds of L and T.

A big $12 disappointment."}

She really liked the Octopus and my sandwich was not nasty but it was nothing to write home about. I will go back and try the restaurant again, I just wouldn't order the Turkey Club Sandwich again."}
