{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the food is good but the beer prices are about twice as much as bars that are much nicer. The bar itself needs a makeover."}
{"text":"I had no idea this bar was a fabulous place to eat. My husband and I both agree they make the best burgers in town. The menu has great variety and the food tastes chef level quality not typical bar fry cook fare.   We love the homemade soups. Tasty hot wings. Large portion salads. Can't wait to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS and FRIES for miles and miles. This is a beer joint with a kitchen that recognizes the need to put out exceptional food to get people to make the drive best kept secret in the area. Grab a seat at the bar and get ready to experience something really special the pickle relish on the burger is a must as well as the malt vinegar on the hot fresh cut fries. If your hungry don't drive by this place because the looks of the outside inside contains all the magic :-)"}
{"text":"We have loved the HCI for many, many years. From the age of 21 to 36 I have images bright & clear of so many wonderful times to recall within those walls and on the outside walkway before the patio. Great memories were made at the Hambden Country Inn. Glad walls don't talk hahaha! 

We either eat there or drink & order our food to go. The convenience of being 1 minute away from HCI is a huge plus for great service and amazing food so near it's still hot & fresh when we pull in! Their burgers are the bomb, can't go wrong! Bri loves their Romanburger. With kids we're not there like we were when we all were a wild bunch of young wild adults haha! 

For years if we called our number would come up as \"Mailman Bri,\" it's those little things that meant the most. Not just a number, we have always been treated as welcome guests, even after we had kids, with less time there. That's the sign of great owner's that will always have our loyalty and patronage.

Brian & I make a point of going once a year together to pay our respects and relish the nostalgia of the past. While appreciating all the growth and wonderful changes that have come with time. Well worth the stop, always! Thanks for the memories Hambden Country Inn!!!"}
{"text":"I drove by this for years and never stopped in. Went in for a beer and a burger on a whim one day and have been back many times. Don't fool yourself, it's not restaurant. It's a bar with a kitchen that knows what it's doing. Try their gyro."}
{"text":"My husband, mother-in-law and I tried this place on a whim last fall. Admittedly, we were skeptical, because it doesn't look like much from outside and my mil uses a walker and it didn't look especially accessible, but we were hungry and didn't know the area. It was awesome! The employees were so welcoming and friendly, helping my mil to enter and get situated and serving us very quickly and efficiently. The menu was much more extensive than we expected and our food arrived fast and hot. It was delicious. We all had chicken sandwiches and enjoyed them quite a bit. Too much food to finish so we took half home. Seems like a neighborhood place where everyone knows everyone, but new faces still welcomed. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Was in town for a thing recently & saw on yelp here it has the best burgers for miles, so we immediately chose to go there for lunch. Wow. So good. The waitress was really nice and personable and was quick to take our orders, get our food, and make just the right amount of friendly conversation."}
