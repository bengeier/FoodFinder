{"text":"I saw the great reviews about this place and decided to go with my friends. We ordered 5 dishes but I've only tried kimchi poutine, pan donkatsu and pan steak.  Overall I was satisfied and I was especially delighted with the poutine. It was one of the best poutine I've tried in a long time. I will surely be back for more poutine."}
{"text":"This place is a steal at these prices.  Must try their pan steaks.     We ordered the pan prime steak($17.99) and the pan rib steak ($15.99).  Each steak comes with choice of rice or bread and fries.  Also came with 3 small side dishes.  Steaks are served with bean sprout and bell/banana pepper in a pipping hot pan.  Highly recommend the pan prime steak.  It was cooked to perfection (medium rare)!   For only $17.99 it was melt in your mouth good!   The rib steak is good too (but not as good as the prime steak).   Will return again for sure.  Very good quality-price ratio."}
{"text":"Nice little gem that offers steak on a pan. Something different from the regular affairs"}
{"text":"We came back again for dinner because we enjoyed it very much a few weeks ago. However, we noticed they have pumped up the price for 33% in particular the pan steak menu. We had the rib eye steak in a sizzling hot pan with potatoes and vegetables for $15.99 last time and today it was $20.99!!! It's quite ridiculous! The staff told us the business has not been going well along with the food costs had increased so much, they have no choice but to put that onto the customer!!! If you don't have much business in the first place, increasing the price is not the solution. Hope they find their way to survive."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night to celebrate a friend's birthdat.  Glad we went early because it filled up suddenly at 6pm.  It's a small cozy cute eatery offering korean style beef and western food.     Food:  We came with a large group so I got to see a wide range of dishes.  The dishes were all served sizzling hot on a cast iron pan.  Saw other peoples dishes and they looked great.  I personally tried the Korean marinated steak dish.  It was good but towards the end, I felt it was very salty.  I could have ordered rice to go with it but opted to eat it with vegetables instead.  Overall, not a steakhouse experience but great value and portions.    Service/Decor:  Nice comfortable eatery with small tables.  We were a large group split into 2 tables so they tried their best to serve us quickly and together which was good."}
{"text":"omg. this place is Amazing! everything tastes so great. so yummy. so clean. service is really good. will come back again. kimchi Putin, steak, all are great quality. perfect dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night for a bite after seeing the great reviews on yelp. I was not disappointed with what I ordered and with the service received. My friend and I shared the kimchi poutine (roughly 12.99 before tax and tips) and the spicy salmon roll (roughly 14.99 before tax and tips). The kimchi poutine was great, there was a kick to it and was extremely flavourful with good portions. The spicy salmon roll was pretty good too, this place doesn't fool around with its spicy stuff, there was a pretty good kick with this roll too.   Both items are recommended, although this place is a bit more on the pricier end (they charge $2 for hot green tea too), it is well worth the try. The service is good and there was not wait time to get a table on a weekday night."}
{"text":"One of the best bang for buck rib eye steak. Def get it!  Very tender !  Service was good and will come again.  Tried kimchi poutine as well. not bad!"}
{"text":"Got the bibimbap, which was the lunch special and it tasted pretty good. The service was really great, and they were very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"A brightly lit, cozy restaurant at the end of the plaza.  Most of the tables sit 4 people only, so this is not the place for a big party.  The staff were young and friendly and made several recommendations for us which we enjoyed.  Having scanned the menu I was less than interested in the sushi options (compared with the other steak options), so I'm not sure how their sushi is.    Had the kimchi fries and a steak combo.  It's a typical asian-style steak but thankfully it was not overcooked.  The steak was fairly good but could use more sauce.  Kimchi fries were very good but a bit overpriced for what it was (fries and kimchi).  Will come back again to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Very good Korean fusion. Love their bulgolgi poutine! service was really good! The place is bit small but love the atmosphere! Make a reso if u have a big group !"}
{"text":"Very unique. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from here but what I can say is, you won't know completely until you've experienced it for yourself! This cute little restaurant is tucked away in the corner of the plaza and comes with super friendly and informative staff members.   The quality of the food is actually amazing for what it's worth. Although it can be a little slow, everything is almost entirely cooked to perfection. We ordered a pork belly pan steak and Korean short rib steak. The short rib steak came with a separate side of fries which tasted bomb. I've never had fries tastier before - probably because they used fresh oil. The dishes itself come on a sizzling hot plate with a side of rice & veggies. I had just hoped the veggies would be more flavourful because they were practically raw & they were just left to cook on the sizzling plate. Also I found the one little piece of potato to be kind of random.   The meat portion was so delicious, which partially makes up for the lack of effort with the veggies. The pork belly was cooked just right and comes with a separate sauce that you can dip it in for extra flavour. The short ribs were deliciously marinated and cooked throughout without being tough at all! Overall, for its price the portions are very filling. They definitely do not cheap out on the quality of meat used! I intend on coming back sometime to try out the bibimbap as it is so highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday dinner with my wife due to the overwhelming positive reviews, and I was not disappointed.  This restaurant is located in a plaza on the north-west side of Steeles/Yonge. There is ample parking and was easy to find. It has been open for about 5-6 months, so it is still relatively unknown.  The place has a nice ambiance and is relatively small. The waitress promptly seated us and gave us water and menus. Since it was our first time here, she was very great at explaining the menu and the daily specials. We ended up ordering the Pan Rib Eye Steak and the Kimchi Poutine.   The food was very good, and the prices were reasonable. I love how the steak comes on a hot cast iron steak so that the steak is very hot while you eat it. You just have to be careful that it doesn't overcook by putting it on the veggies if it reaches your desired wellness for steak. The Kimchi Poutine had a good flavour mixture of spicy and sweet.   I would definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner around 7pm, the restaurant is relatively small, not very busy (3 tables) , the decors have a chic, modern feel to the place,  they have wooden stools as chairs which were not very comfortable sit for an extended period of time.  We ordered the AAA rib eye steak and the steak and shrimp fried rice.  The food came pretty quickly, not a lot of side dishes though (2 only) compared to other nearby korean restaurants,    here are what we thought for each of 2 dishes we ordered :  AAA rib eye steak:  the steak was order to be medium rare and it did came that way, the meat was quite tender and portion was generous, however the taste seems a bit blend  and a bit lacking on flavor,  however for the price ($28) I guess the taste is somewhat proportional to the price..    Steak and shrimp fried rice : this is somewhat of an interesting variation to the standard dosot bim bim bap,  where there are steak cubes and 2 shrimps in addition to rice with egg and vegetables on a hot plate, it came with the ingrediants unmixed and we are to mix them at the table just like bim bim bap, the steak cubes were very tender and flavory  ( actually more flavory then the AAA rib eye steak), the fried rice was bit blend in flavor, we resorted to adding more hot sauce to enhance the flavoring..  Overall, i feel this place is trying to bring a little variety to the typical steak joint scene, with a younger, hipper decor vibe and lower price point for their steak menu, however, i feel it's also somewhat reflected in the lack of flavoring in the steaks, that you would normally find in the more traditional steak houses that ages their steaks and go through the more elborate process to prepare the steaks to lock in their flavoring,  but for the relatively low  price level  I guess I'm not complaining. .."}
{"text":"FOOD: 3.5/5 - Their menu offers a mix of fusion dishes including steaks, poutine, fried chicken, pasta, and sushi. I tried their AAA rib eye steak for dinner and asked for medium rare. It came on a sizzling hot plate with hot peppers and rice on the side. The meat was very juicy and tender which was a splendid surprise. I wouldn't recommend eating the rice that came with it though as the bottom of the rice absorbed all the oil of the plate.The kimchi fries was a bit disappointing. It barely had any kimchi, so it lacked the kimchi flavour and the sour cream made it tasted like nachos. The fried chicken was not what I expected as well. They were similar to popcorn chicken but a bit on the dryer side. The only sauce that came with the chicken was ketchup and mustard on the side. The Pork belly steak was great and packed with flavours. The Rainbow sushi roll was alright, nothing too spectacular. My favourite was the rose pasta. Love the sauce, it was way better than the Tteok-pokki (rice cakes in cream). The rice cake was too soft and the sauce had minimum flavour. They also gave you bread and a small basket of fries before your meal which was a really nice touch.  ENVIRONMENT: 3.5/5 - Modern space with wooden tables and large windows. The space could accommodate smaller groups but would be tight for groups larger than 6.  SERVICE: 1/5 - Non-existent. The waitress must be on a bad day or something because the entire time from the moment we walked into the restaurant, she had a stink face on. No smile, no greetings whatsoever. I visited on a Thursday night and our group was the only ones there. So, I'd expect to get attentive and friendly service from her. But the waitress was either playing with her nails or on her phone. We had to ask her for water, clean up the plates and we even said Thank you to her as we walked out the restaurant for her to say something to us in return. This is not the kind of service I should be getting from an empty restaurant. The food came in at once and pretty quick so I gave that one point but the service was what caused the low score. I'd like to see that particular staff improve."}
{"text":"It's a cute place, interesting decor.  I very much enjoyed the chicken cutlet set, the sauce was different from other restaurants in the area.  I think the best thing we got there though was the cream tteokbokki.  It was good, not phenomenal, but I'd go there again"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go out to eat every single day. We love korean food and we never dined at a fusion restaurent before. A korean fusion restaurent with KIMCHI FRIES? Yes!!! I love fries.  As soon as I looked on yelp, I saw the prices of the old menu? Or lunch menu... Pansteaks for $15.99... They were actually $22.99-28.99. Anyways, we ordered a rib eye steak and kimchi poutine. There prices were relatively higher than other korean restaurent but it was a fusion steak house.   The kimchi poutine was not worth paying $12.99 for. It wasn't a huge portion, then again it was an appetizer.   Next, the rib eye steak ($20.99) was ordered medium-rare. The heck! It was SO chewy and kind of tough. There's a butcher next door too...   Everything was presented really well, I loved the nonstick pans they used to serve the dishes. But the food was really subpar for the price we paid.   Our end total was $44.50 including tip. It was relatively an expensive dinner for just two people that weren't really full. It was subpar food... I liked the decor, presentation and menu options but their prices could be knocked down a bit."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant for lunch since we were in the area. Based on the yelp reviews and pictures it looked really delicious. We ordered the Kimchi fries, bibimbap, spicy pork rice pan and a bottle of peach flavoured rice alcohol beverage. (Total bill came to $60, after tax and tip) The only thing that stood out was the spicy pork pan rice. The pork was juicy and soft. The rice at the bottom, near the pan was crispy and crunchy!! The flavour had just enough kick to it. I must admit, I was a little disappointed. The pictures portray a much better image than what it tasted. Food was just OK. Plus, they messed up the Kimchi fries  order (whatever came in it's place was kinda sweet and I didn't like it). In my opinion, wasn't worth the cost. Just saying..."}
{"text":"This place is really cool and there's nothing else like it in the GTA. They specialize in pan fried steak. They have several choices of meat that is served to you grilled on a pan. Comes with veggies and some korean-ish sides.   I wouldn't come here for the rolls. I'd definitely stick with their pan selections. Taste wise it is good. It's steak...they don't over season the steak and you can always add more condiments on it.   The place is not that big. The atmosphere is like a modern bar. Like most Korean places, they work with minimal staff but the lone server knows what she is doing. Honestly steak is not my thing, but I would recommend this place to people that want to try something different."}
{"text":"I ordered the pan rib eye steak with the assorted vegetable. The steak was quite large and good- it is great quality for the price you pay for. The steak was cooked the way I like (medium rare) and it was great how the pan did not over cook the meat and kept it warmed.   The fries that came with the steak was crispy amazing, however it was quite a small serving. I was not a fan of their veggies which was stir-fry bean sprouts. Also the meal order comes with banchans.  My friend ordered the bibimbap and it was good - better than the average.   The place was empty when we were there, and we were the only ones there for the night. Service was good and the food came out quick. It is a good place to go to if you're looking for decent price steaks."}
{"text":"I had the bulgogi poutine and bibimbap and they were simply delicious! They also give you little appetizers for free (pickled radish, tofu). The food comes out a little slow since I think there's only one chef, but the waiter was polite and kept us updated."}
{"text":"Friendly service and amazing food! Steak is tender, delicious and I personally love the rose pasta! I just wished the pasta portion was a bit bigger. This restaurant has become my go to now."}
{"text":"Beff in Korean actually means best friends, and this restaurant and I might be just that! Beff specializes in pan-steak, but they also serve other food too.   My bf and I arrived on an early Sunday evening around 5pm and the place was pretty much empty. Originally, I wanted to order the Beff House Steak but our server warned that it will take some time to prepare. Okay...so I went with the Pan rib eye steak - $15.99. It came with a side of rice or bread, but I chose bread. My bf ordered the Cream Beef pasta - $13.99 and we shared a Crunch roll - $8-9(?).  The bread that came with my meal was warm, it wasn't dry or stale. My meal also came with a bowl of miso soup which wasn't anything special. The main star was obviously the pan steak, it came sizzling hot in a pan which also included bean sprouts and spinach. I found the steak to be quite tender and juicy, just the way I like it.   Our server was very attentive, occasionally coming by to see if we were okay with the food or if we needed anything else. But I also felt a little uncomfortable at times especially when the server was looking at us eat from afar. It was because it was not busy at all, with two other tables full. Also, the price is fairly decent. If you're looking for a quiet evening, come early. Skip the sushi rolls and come for the steak!"}
{"text":"Such a warm welcome from the owner himself; Jae (Jay) served as host, cook and waiter all in one.  Nice, sturdy wooden tables with coat hooks right next to it. Ordered the Rib Eye for me and Steak and Jumbo (not Jumbo sized) Shrimp with fried rice for hubby and fries to start off with.  Received water (they don't have ice cubes so the water is only refrigerator cold) and complimentary pickled veggies and coleslaw. The fries were piping hot, super crispy and tasty but a bit oily; I should have let them drain a bit longer. While we waited for our food, we enjoyed the kpop music (boy bands so more dance type) playing in the background. Our food came out on sizzling plates. The aroma was tantalizing and the tastes delicious. The meats were a bit chewy but hubby likes it that way. I would have preferred less oil used (I wonder if I can order it with less oil).  I was looking for dessert afterwards but they don't  have any on the menu, Jae was kind enough to refer us to Chocolada which was close by. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Nice little place to eat modern korean food. Prices were a little high for the portions they gave however the quality of it is okay (but not phenomenal). Will probably come back if I cant think of where else to eat and only if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Good portions. We were full by the end of the meal. Like the fries, reminded us of fries from Costco. There were only one waiter serving the restaurant, so he can get busy at times. The place filled up quickly after 7:30pm."}
{"text":"I had the house beef pan steak and it was really good. When I walked in I was immediately greeted by all the employees, which created a really nice atmosphere. The portion was more than enough for me and I also got side dishes. There was also free wifi. Overall a 5/5"}
{"text":"Very cozy and excellent foods!! Their rolls, pan steak  were so good and price is also reasonable"}
{"text":"Flawless! Amazing new addition to the neighbourhood. They've been open for 2 weeks now and I'm kind of torn between writing this review or not- I don't want this place to get crazy busy because I know so many people will be piling out the doors when they realize how good this place is!!   Service was amazing. Everyone was very attentive, the waiters, the kitchen staff- one kitchen staff even rushed over on his lunch break when I dropped my phone to see if it was okay. So nice! The food was impeccable. The idea of putting everything on a pan is unbelievably genius. The pan bibambap stole my heart and more. It was tasty, high quality and the crispy rice (aka the entire reason why I order bibambap) stuck to 0% of the bottom!! OMG CAN I DIE NOW? My dining companion got the pan pork belly, which I was surprised at how great quality it was and how many slices there were for only $12ish!! It was thick but not too chewy. It was absolutely delightful! With all that being said, I did notice it was a little more oily than most Korean dishes.   The place is pretty small, which can definitely be a problem when this place blows up, and oh I know it just will. There are limited places to hang your coat, which can only be problematic in the colder seasons.   BOTTOM LINE IS. I LOVE IT HERE. I'm moving in."}
{"text":"This is quickly one of my fav places to order using ubereats. Their fries are especially good imo.  So far ive had kimchi fries, steak and jumbo shrimp, rainbow rolls, all to my complete satisfaction.  The only dish I was slightly less satisfied was with AAA ribeye steak, Ive had better steaks for that price range, but considering it was delivery, still good.  I will be trying out a lot more dishes from them since I order delivery very ofren, and I am looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I was recommended to try this place from Peter M. And I think I'm in love. This place is pretty small but it wasn't busy At all on a Saturday night at around 7-8.   Me and my boyfriend shared the ribeye steak and a bibimbap. The ribeye was seasoned with salt and pepper, however Both me and the boyfriend thought the black pepper was very strong maybe a tad less it would have been excellent! The bibimbap comes with the spicy sweet sauce on the side so you can determine how much you wanna put on it. The bibimbap was soooo good! All the flavours really go well with one another. Also the beef in the bibimbap with very soft and tender!   Actually both the steak and sliced beef were really soft and tender, the meat quality is really good!   The only negative is that there's no real place to put your jackets and if you come in a large group you might have to be split up. When I mean large I mean 10+. I saw two long tables not too sure how many people it can hold. All the other tables are 2-4 seaters."}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly thrilled upon leaving. We were the only Patrons and it was rather quiet so hearing a microwave siren is rather alarming.  I'm not surprised this location closed. The steak was tough as f***."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went there thinking prices were good and looking forward to something different.   The menu prices have changed. Increased substantially.   On the menu board was Korean steak.  Everything we tried to order was a no!   No the Korean steak isn't ready , no the appetizer wasn't available.  No the wine isn't by the glass only bottle.  So we ordered the strip loin steak(18.99)squid in a curry sauce (ttukbokee) 12.99 and had our complimentary apps  The squid in the curry (ttukokeee)had maybe 6 pieces of squid, only the tendicles, mixed with rice cake and fish cake. Pretty much rice and fish cake and no fish. Very disappointing.  The steak was greasy and fatty and little meat. The flavour was ok but not outstanding or something to bring me back.  We left with a bill of 60$ with tip and only 3 beers to increase the price.  Not impressed at all and won't be back. Sorry. Wish the establishment would actually step up and be what they say they are."}
{"text":"I always have trouble choosing what type of cuisine I would like to eat for dinner. Some of my favourite dishes are sushi, poutine, pasta and steak. At Beff, I get to satisfy my cravings for all of them in one restaurant.   Food: Their kimchi poutine is delicious and a great appetizer. Their pan steaks are also enjoyable. I had the rib eye steak and it was tasty! Unfortunately they ran out of korean steak that night. Their sushi is also very delicious. I have tried their spicy salmon dragon and black dragon rolls, both tasted very good, just like what you would get at a Japanese Restaurant. Their pasta is decent. Not the most amazing but would definitely satisfy your cravings.  The restaurant itself is small, so I would recommend making reservations if you have a group of four or more. They are of average price point and staff are friendly. I don't have anything bad about them to say.   All in all, I would definitely recommend you to come if you want to try out korean pan steak, while enjoying sushi and poutine!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. They have about 5 items that are for $8.99. I got the ribeye with cheese. I enjoyed it but not sure if I would order it again. If you want steak always goes to a steakhouse. Hubby ordered the rose pasta. He said it was good and the portion wasn't out of control so he was able to finish it all. My dad ordered the $8.99 lunch bimbimbap. It smelt delish when it came to the table....sesame seed and the ingredients looked fresh! Lots of beef as well. I will definitely come back to try their other menu items and change it up. It's not meant for large groups but can accommodate a table of 6-8 max if needed?"}
{"text":"Saturday night date meal with my girl. We had the pan Galbi and the pan prime rib. It was quite tasty and satisfying.  Cozy little spot that is fusionesque of Seoul and New York. What an amazing combo. The ribs were tender.and juicy, maybe because we ordered rare. At the end we couldn't finish it all and got take out to eat for the next day. The fries were surprisingly good. It also came with Korean side dishes that was satisficing as well.  Highly recommended for you steak lovers."}
{"text":"Such an amazingly delicious restaurant with a cozy environment and wonderful, accommodating staff.    They have a good variety of food to choose from; our large party tried a multitude of dishes from kimchi poutine to pasta, and steak, etc. none of them disappointed, and all were prepared quickly and delivered piping hot to our tables.  Considering our large party of 13, with babies galore, they did an outstanding job with their food and service!  We will most definitely be recommending and returning for more!"}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE Tiny little restaurant that seats 25-30 guests. We made a reservation for 2 people on a Sunday night and were seated promptly when we arrived at wooden tables and stools. There are a couple coat hooks situated high on the walls (not short people friendly) but not accessible to tables seated away from the wall. We ended up hanging our coats on the bar chairs by the cashier. I had to place my purse on the floor.   SERVICE There was one waiter all night who, while friendly and dutiful, struggled to juggle taking orders, serving food, heating and bringing dinner rolls, filling water glasses, clearing tables, and printing bills. I felt bad for the guy but he smiled the entire time.   FOOD We ordered the rib eye steak, which smelled and tasted delicious. Tender and well seasoned, it also came with sides of veggie and potatoes to complete the meal. The dinner rolls were warm and soft. No complaints here. I do note the food took a while to arrive so snack on the side dishes and chat away!  QUALITY/VALUE Prices are reasonable for steak, approximately $25-30/person.   OVERALL I would definitely return. The ambiance is nice and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Yelped and found this place.  It's a small restaurant and yet it's cozy.  We came on a weekday with only one waitress.   She was friendly and gave us suggestions of what to have.  We took her advice and had: cheese corn, Korean short rib steak, spicy salmon roll and rose pasta.  There were banchan, fries (came with steak), soup (salmon roll) and bread (pasta).  The steak was seared to perfection and came in a hot cast iron skillet, and the spicy salmon roll was huge.  Rose pasta with seafood was the best dish; the sauce was creamy, silky and it's just so tasty!  I'm already looking forward to my next visit : )"}
{"text":"The rib eye came with fries and some awesome sides. I loved the potatoe and the veggies. Tasted so good coming from the hot pan. The rib eye itself was a bit chewy. Not the best cut of meat...which is surprising since next door is a meat butcher.   The salmon sushi roll was the best part of the meal...which is also strange since this place is all about the beef! I loved the salmon roll. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I would come back and order two rolls of it. But then I would realize that its so expensive for a salmon roll. $15.99 for ONE. YIKES. But for that price you are getting a lot of salmon. Torched salmon on top too.  Service was really good. It was really empty for a weekend lunch. Maybe they do better on the weekday with the business crowds. I would come again and hope the quality of the beef improves. Dont sacrifice quality while your business is growing! Pro tip! 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Beff! Best ever friends forever! This is a new place opened up for about 2 weeks? The interior has a cozy feel to it and the tables are quite nice!  They use chemical drums to hold up the tables and they still got their labels. Pretty nifty if I say so myself. The menu is simple but quite delicious or at least what we ordered was deeeelicious.   We had the pan bimbibap and it's probably the biggest bibimbap I've seen! I got the pork belly and oh man the stripes aren't tiny. They are the perfect size to eat! Also on top of a bed of bean sprouts and that fat oil omg. Deeelicious! The sauce that comes with it is quite nice! Definitely good for dipping and rice! Don't overuse though otherwise it'll be too strong! If you do get the pork belly try to mix the rice in the pan it comes and add the sauce! I'll probably do that for next time!   Definitely will be back here to try more!   Also am told their pan prime steak is the most popular dish!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. We got the lean meat rib eye pan steak and chicken katsu. Got the steak in medium rare but we recommend rare because it's served in a skillet so it continues to cook. It was a bit too chewy and tough to bite towards the end. Chicken katsu was great - sauce was good."}
{"text":"Pros: Very well done steaks Prices are very good  Cons: Not the most kid friendly  Steak lovers assemble!!!  I was a bit skeptical at first when I heard about a Korean steakhouse.  Still, as a steak lover I had to try it considering it was so close to where I live.  Beff delivers and then exceeds anything I was expecting.  Beff isn't too big of a place.  There are about 6 or 7 tables and a bar.  I expect this place to be very busy on weekends.  Beff offers pan fried versions of beef, chicken and pork.  There are a few other things like pasta, salad and sushi so there is quite a bit of variety in the works here.  You can come for a meal, or just come from drinks, either way works.  Of course, coming here for the first time we tried the steak.  We ordered the rib steak (my fav steak) and the prime steak which was recommended by a friend who tried this place earlier.  Each entree comes with fries, veggies and a choice between bread or rice.  There are also a couple of side dishes that you get like most Korean eateries do.  So you get a good sized steak and a bunch of extras for $20, not bad at all.  The steaks were very well done.  They were very juicy and tender.  I usually like my steaks seasoned with just salt and pepper.  I think there was a bit of something else they seasoned it with but it was still good nonetheless. They are served on a cast iron skillet that's very hot.  If you like your steak on the rarer side, this will present a small problem.  You need to set your steak somewhere on the veggies or it will continue to cook in the skillet.  Because the skillet is super hot, you also need to be careful while you're eating so you don't burn yourself.  It could be a little tough for young children to eat here because of this.  The service here was very good.  The server was extra polite and patient explaining how things work here as it was our first time.  The chef in the back also came out to ask us how things were as well.  If you're a steak lover and can get to the Yonge and Steeles area without much trouble, you need to try this place.  A good steak that won't break the bank, can't ask for much more!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my family on a Sunday. We were very satisfied with the steaks; they were amazingly tender and flavorful! We also ordered the beef & bean sprout stir fry, dynamite roll combo, and the squid tteokbokki, and everything was tasty! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I went here with my family after seeing the reviews and a pic of their kimchi fries. We went on a Saturday around 5:30pm and the place was empty. We were greeted right away by our waitress (there was only one person working the whole place), she did a great job of explaining the menu to us. We ordered a pan fried steak, a bibimbop, the kimchi poutine, the cheese corn and a dynamite combo for 3 adults and 1 kid.   I've had kimchi fries was to die for! I've had  kimchi fries at other places and never thought much of it, but this was HEAVEN. It was just the right balance of sweet, spicy and salty. We got it to share but I'm not ashamed to say I totally hoarded it and ate most of it.  would come back here just to eat these kimchi fries again. They called it kimchi poutine as someone from Montreal it was definitely not a poutine (there is no cheese curds). The bibimbop was also yummy, my sister who had it mentioned that the bottom is really crispy with a good amount of ingredients. The sushi was also good. The steak and corn was okay, but I wouldn't say anything to write home about.     Now what I found really put this experience over the top was the service. She took the time to explain the menu, checked up on us to make sure we were okay and brought out our food quickly. She also made sure to warn us about which dishes were really hot and placed those away from our kids (4yr and 7 month old). At one point I asked my husband if there was any water left in the pitcher and she was there almost immediately with a fresh pitcher of water. At the same time she didn't make us feel like she was hovering and watching us eat. I was definitely impressed.   I'm really surprised that this place was so dead on a Saturday night. The service, food and ambiance all make this a great place to eat. I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Beff by mistake and decided to give it a try. Food was surprisingly very good. We ordered the rose pasta and the bibimbap. Rose pasta was very well executed, bibimbap was served in a cast-iron pan which I thought was really smart. Small family-run establishment, owner was really nice. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Nice little cozy gem in the Yonge and steeles area! Would revisit and recommend to friends.   Place is cozy, suitable for dinner dates and small foodie gatherings!  Was originally going to give it 3.5 stars, but at the end of writing this review, giving it a full 4 stars.  Ordered a Avacado Salad, Bulgogi Poutine, Short Rib Pan Steak, and a Spyder Roll for 2. We couldn't finish..  Avacado Salad was pretty good, the avocados were perfectly ripe and the balsamic dressing was good. Tomatoes was were also perfectly ripe.  Bulgogi Poutine was disappointing.. first impression was it looked like a Fries Supreme from Taco Bell.  The beef was grounded, seems they used some sort of mayo/sour cream type sauce. Fries was all stuck together like a fries supreme from Taco Bell, didn't pick up individually with chop sticks.  The Short Rib Pan Steak was great!!! Beef was tender enough and super flavourful! Nicely portioned for 2 people to share along with other items in the dinner course. The veggies it came with were perfectly stir fried and had that Al Dante texture to it with Bulgogi sauce to dress.  Potatoes were also perfectly cooked!    The Spyder Roll was just the way it should be.. the Roll was pretty big  I would definitely come back here to try other Pan Steaks on their menu.  I feel they do a great job marinating their meat!  Bill for two came up to $72.50 plus tip."}
{"text":"Been here two times now and Beff has been amazing! Love Korean fusion food. The service has been impeccable during each visit. They always came by to make sure everything was fine and your drinks filled.   We had.. Corn Cheese $ 7.99 - If you love cheese, if you love corn... oh my :) Not sure about that price however.  Beef Cream Pasta $13.99 - Loved the pasta! But next time I'm ordering chicken as the beef was a bit too chewy imho Kimchi Poutine 12.99 - I couldn't really taste the kimchi but it was amazing. Kind of reminded me of a tacos instead but the sauce was much sweeter. Loved the fries as it was super crunchy.  Can't wait to come back another time ! We went there on a Saturday evening around 9pm so it wasn't busy at all (one other table). Food was served quickly. Love!"}
{"text":"We need more of these places around Toronto. The staff were very polite and attentive, food was great at a great value (i had a generous portion of pork katsu served in a skillet with 3 sides and miso soup for $8.99!), and everything was clean. They delivered the perfect service. The server was what made this visit standout."}
{"text":"This is a late review as I tried Beff on Father's Day.  My hubby and I planned to have Korean food on that day but the restaurant we picked is PACKED, so we went to this plaza and saw a new restaurant.  Around 6pm, there was only a family inside but still we wanna give it a try!  We ordered avocado salad, pork with rice and veggie (don't remember the exact name), prime steak.  Actually I'm not a steak fan, but I fall in love with the steak right after I had a bite.  The salad portion is bigger than I expected.  The waitress is very attentive and friendly.  Definitely will be my go for steak restaurant.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Service- came here on a Sunday night. Pretty packed. Service was a bit lagging because there was only one worker at the time. She tried her hardest to cater to everyone though.   Food- ordered the chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki and the bulgogi poutine! Overall pretty good! Both terriyakis came with a rice bed. Saucy and rich, the vegetable mix, sauce and meats all mixed very well together. Their beef almost tasted a little buttery! Yum! Poutine did get a bit overwhelming but loved their fries. Crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. The bulgogi topping does get a little soggy with the fries so be mindful of that.   Atmosphere- small and cute resto seats about 25-30 in total. Modern decor. Comfy casual atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Bulgogi Poutine ($13.99) Originally I was going to order the kimchi poutine, but if you add one more dollar you could get meat in the poutine which seemed to make more sense in terms of price value. However, the disappointing part was it looked and tasted like Taco bell's fries supreme. The thing that was odd was it literally felt like fries supreme because it was ground meat mushed up instead of actual bulgogi meat, not to mention the flavoring or sauce didn't taste like bulgogi either. I like the fries, they were super crispy like Costco fries. Decent amount of ingredients. One thing that bugged me was the poutine wasn't hot or room temperature, served sort of cold so not sure how it being on the hot plate did anything.   RIb eye steak ($20.99) Around an 8 oz steak, cooked medium rare. Comes with veggies, potatoes, and a fried egg on rice. The meat was tender, cooked on point at medium rare but because it was sitting on a hot plate it slowly turned the steak to medium. In terms of flavoring, typical steak nothing special.   Slightly disappointed as I thought this was going to be a Korean inspired fusion restaurant, but it felt more like a Western restaurant trying to add some Korean culture but failing to do so? if that even makes sense...."}
{"text":"When you're craving for steak but you really want that Kimchi Fries and Cheese corn after watching your Korean drama, Beff is the place to go for all that.  The restaurant is a little small but coming here in mid November with all the Christmas decorations and tree up, it felt very homey & comforting.   We ordered the Rib Eye Steak for $20.99 which came sizzling on a hot cast iron pan accompanied by veggies, potatoes, a bowl of rice, a cup of fries, and side dishes. The steak was ordered medium rare but my steak was a little bit overcooked compared to my bf's steak. To prevent overcooking the steak, place it on top of your veggies! His steak was tender and juicy, the fries were really crispy and delicious. Although I'm not a big fan of steaks, I really enjoyed my meal. I would've preferred a fattier steak, but everything tasted really good together and I definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"Food is great the service is average. The price for the food is worth and the portion is good. The service is not great but bearable. Seating and setting is cute and comfortable. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time with my mom and overall we really liked it! It's small and homey and definitely has a younger crowd. We ordered the kimchi poutine, the fried tofu and the garlic shrimp. The kimchi poutine was delicious (although it could use more kimchi), and the fried tofu and garlic shrimp were decent but not amazing. We also got the ribeye steak, which was a bit chewy but really tasty. The sides were yummy too! Service was really good - there was one server for the whole place and he did a really good job of managing all the tables and we never needed to wave him down.  Overall a really good first experience - I'd definitely come back with friends!"}
{"text":"This is what good food being killed by high rent looks like. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the food is good. Unfortunately they are closing this weekend for good. I'll still write a good review but I guess it's not going to help too much.  Success the restaurant is closing, the selection of pan steak is limited. They offered a $2 discount on the AAA rib eye. So I was like, why not. We also got kimchi poutine.   The kimichi poutine is delecious. It's sauced just right with fresh tomato. The fries were fresh and crispy. Mixed with the fresh tomato and kimchi it taste delecious.  The pan steak as expected comes out in a hot steel pan. The meat was nicely done. I asked for medium rare but it was more to a medium. I though the texture would be gone but no, every bit is as delecious as the first. The meat melts in your mouth.  I give this restaurant a 5 star as the food serve here are special."}
{"text":"Beff Pan Steak And Roll House serves up Korean Style Western Food.  If you here looking for a real Steakhouse experience, you might be disappointed. But for$17.99 you do get a decent 250 g Rib Eye Cut Steak with sides. Avocado Salad ($5.99) with a Japanese dressing was fresh and plentiful!  Rose Pasta ($13.99) was enjoyable!  Sadly Spider Roll ($12.99) was the most disappointing item we ordered for our visit. The soft shell crab was so overcooked and it hurting my mouth while I was eating that.   Service was attentive and excellent. Our waitress was so friendly.  I would suggest ordering the steak the most medium rare as it was a little overcook for my liking. Maybe I would even go for rare."}
{"text":"I came with my regular group of friends with whom I routinely frequent restaurants. Beff fashions itself as a fusion-type jack of all trades eatery, with steak, pasta, sushi, and various comfort/bar food offerings.   Our server was courteous and friendly, and despite being a little forgetful, delivered acceptable service and was overall a pleasure to deal with. The restaurant sports wooden high square tables with matching backless square stools much like many ramen joints.   Our group ordered the ribeye (some with and some without cheese) as well as the pasta with rose sauce. As someone who detests onions, I requested a plate without onions and green onions, and opted for the spicy upgrade. The pasta itself was okay, with the sauce packing a moderate amount of heat, but overwhelmed the taste of the shrimp; the mussel was dead (shell shut) on arrival---noodles: nothing to write home about. The banchan that was served included a potato/squash mash, a pickled medley of vegetables, a slaw, and tofu. The tofu which I'm guessing was supposed to be crispy honey tofu had an impossibly stiff and chewy exterior. But that's not my largest gripe. The steak coated with a layer of melted cheese and parsley flakes came in a sizzling hot Lodge cast iron pan with a mound of rice seasoned with furikake, and a side of peppers and bean sprouts as well as caramelized onions---a dish well plated. However, everyone who ordered a steak on our party requested medium rare. What we received ranged from medium well to well beyond well done. My friend's steak was absent any taste of beef and unpleasantly tough to chew.   For a place that charges as much as it does for their ribeye---not to mention one that calls itself a steak house---you should not be mis-temping your steaks off by 2 levels of doneness. As such, I cannot recommend this place, despite the decent portions and the friendly service."}
{"text":"I will give u 3 stars for service and effort. Food was mediocre. Wasn't impressed with kimchi poutine at all. The shrimp pasta is not bad but I can get that anywhere. The cream rice cake tasted exactly like the shrimp pasta. The teriyaki chicken was boring and dry. The fried chicken breast was nothing but a flavorless chicken cutlet. But exceptional service and portion isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Interesting decoration inside. You can't put the coats on your chair and must hang on the wall which may not be very convenient if your table is not beside the wall.  we went on a weekday night and it was not so busy. It would be uncomfortable to sit if there are more people.   The food was just average. We ordered the pork belly and bi bim bap. The pork belly was good size but nothing special about that. They used a pan to put the bi bim bap, it is not a good idea because it doesn't keep the food warm like the hot bowl.  It worth to try once but wont go back."}
{"text":"On a summer night with three hungry souls, we scoured Yelp and came upon a 4 star Steak house. We were immediately interested. So we drove down and were greeted by a very rustically decorated small shop. The atmosphere is very comfortable, and it's not exactly your regular steakhouse. It's more down to earth, seems more like a bar, and has a more Asian vibe.  Service was top notch. The waitress was attentive and was friendly. I opted for the BiBimBap with Beef and it was approximately $10~. My friend ordered the steak for $17~ and I wish I got it because it was heavenly. It was tender, nice, and really tasty.   When we went, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and I was surprised. They deserve more business and this is a very solid restaurant that has an interesting menu and I would come again if I was in the area. 4/5."}
{"text":"BeFF (It think it's supposed to be a play on BFF and not BEEF) is a Steak and Maki Sushi place that opened recently.  A strange food combo for a Korean restaurant.  The first time I drove though the mall and passed this place, it was packed!  This time, it was empty!  Feast or Famine I guess.  We went in and took a table + another for our coats...that's how empty it was.  The owner told us that they are attract mostly younger crowds that are usually on date nights.  I can see why.  This place is pretty cool. The decor looks like a library reading room with a small bar.  We ordered the Premium Rib-eye, Steak and Shrimp with Rice, Kimchi Poutine, and a Dynamite Roll.  The Steak was good - juicy and cooked to a perfect Medium Well.  Nice...especially since I wanted a perfect Medium!  Oh Well - the Keg they are not!  The Steak and Shimp came with rice, some veggies, and topped with a fried egg - this was a good meal.  The Kimchi Poutine fell really short of expectations.  It was too sweet and somehow, there really wasn't any real Kimchi to speak off.  Don't get me wrong, as fusion Poutine goes, it's pretty good but as Kimchi goes - not so much.  Oh..BTW...surprisingly, the Dynamite Roll was...dynamite!  A return trip to try other menu items is in the near future.  Who know, maybe the place will grow on me and become my BeFF!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with my boyfriend for a weekday dinner and it was just as all the yelp reviews had indicated: great service and delicious food.   When we arrived at around 8pm on a weekday there were many spaces available, we were seated by the window and the owner then went to adjust the fan above us until we were comfortable. The waiter went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction throughout the meal. I must also note that the soundtrack playing in the restaurant were the instrumentals from Ghibli movies. A+ for service and music choice!   Food. Before our main course arrived, we were given two side dishes: a coleslaw like salad and a spicy pickled radish/carrot dish. We ordered the rib eye and the prime steak. They both came in cute black skillets that were still hot to the touch and were decorated with bean sprouts, a piece of bell pepper, zucchini and broccoli. A side of fries and rice were also served. The fries were hands down the best fries that I have ever had - soft in the center and crunchy on the outside. Everything was delicious!   All in all, I highly recommend BEFF for those of you looking for a Korean steak experience."}
