{"text":"What a fabulous little gem!
The service was stellar!
The atmosphere perfection!
And the food/wine delicious-o!! (the spaghetti dish had flavors I would not have expected- my mouth was overjoyed.

I only wish I lived in this city to enjoy this spot every week.
What's great about this place- it's not trying to be amazing- it just is!

Merci beaucoup to the entire team that makes it so special.
I shall return"}
{"text":"local wonderful place. very delicious garlic sauce. special Colombian taste."}
{"text":"Great casual \"Columbian\" food.  I'm not Columbian or Latin, so can't talk about if it's authentic or not ... but it was GOOD! (and we'll be back to try more of their menu).

We started with the Cheesy Corn - really good, sort of like a white queso dip with chunks of chicken and bacon.  We liked the Columbian fries that came with it as a good crunchy base for the rich cheese dip.  The appetizer is probably big enough for at least 4 people - 3 of us couldn't finish it, and I'm not sure why anyone would order it as an entree (it's melted cheese people).  It probably would have been even better with some additional tortilla chips - or like what I did and just kept ladling it on my dinner :).

We ordered the steak and pork arepas - really good sandwiches with a side of the black bean soup.  We really liked how the \"bread\" was crispy but not hard - the six or so sauce options brought to the table gave us a chance to mix up each bite.  Both the steak and pork were tender, juicy and just slightly seasoned.  I'm not a huge fan of black beans, but wanted to try the soup since it was highly recommended - mellow flavor, tasted like creamy beans to me - so if you don't like beans, you can probably pass on the soup as it was as described - bean soup. 

We also had the empanadas - great taste, but nothing especially unique if you're used to eating a bunch of empanadas (we're used to ordering 5-7 different varieties at a time, so getting a plate of four beef/potato empanadas was a little boring - but great quality and taste if you're craving it).

Regarding beverages, you really should BYOB (think beers) if you want something to pair with the fantastically greasy and rich food.  But if you're thinking of trying some new soft drinks ... they have a Colombiana - a soda which tasted sort of like what a sweet potato soda would taste and look like - it was described on the web as a champagne cola, but that led me to think tiny bubbles and slightly fruity - but this was more like what I described.  The manzana postobon was just like a pink apple soda ... again nothing extremely different ... so if you're not excited to spend $2.75 for a can of soda, you can save your cash (or BYOB!)."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I'm impressed - more Spanish in a dialect that ain't castilliano. My tummy is growling so I go straight for the Cubano!"}
{"text":"Lakewood is really stepping up the game with some great places to dine. We went searching for one yesterday as we had some time in the afternoon since the Browns were getting slaughtered by the Steelers again. 

Driving down Madison into Birdtown section of Lakewood we almost missed this place. Very cozy converted house. Expecting nothing but some kind of Spanish food based upon the name we had a very pleasent surprize witht he variety and apparent authenticity of the food. I only say apparent because I wouldnt know Columbian food if it hit me in the face. 

Took a quick look at the menu and ordered a beer....they dont have a liquor license....most of the time we would be gone but really wanted to try the food so Colleen ordered while I ran for some beveages. NIce craft selection 4 blocks away at Waterburry beverage and they let you mix 6 packs so I got a variety. 

Tried the Guacamole and cheesy corn appitizers. The guac was spot on with garlic and cilantro. The cheesy corn was really good and different. Chicken chuncks and some smoky bacon were in the creamy sause that was not overpowered by corn or cheese. They were served with THICKER corn triangle kinda like polenta. They were too thick for my taste

The arepas are a columbian \"wrap\" made of white corn and grilled. They stuff them with a variety of meats, beans, veggies sauces. I had the \"mexicana\" which was a spanish chorizo with onions, mushrooms and sauce. It was super flavorful. The red bean chilli was my side and it was equally good especially when a dollop of paprika sour cream was put into it. 

Colleen had the Steak arepa which she enjoyed and I tasted as well. 

You must try the homemade sauces. Garlic, chimicurra, ranchero, spicy peanut, pineapple. 
I mixed the pineapple and spicy peanut to get a flavor fiesta.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée avec mon copain et nous avons partagé une entrée avec du fromage burrata qui était à se rouler parterre! Ensuite, nous avons aussi partagé la paella. Pour être honnête, la dernière fois que j'ai mangé une si bonne paella, je me trouvais sous le soleil de l'Espagne! 
Ce qui rend cette place magnifique, ce n'est pas seulement La nourriture divine, mais c'est aussi le service! Les serveurs connaissent leur menu et se font un plaisir de le présenter et l'expliquer. Mais ça ne s'arrête pas là, TOUT dans le service égalait la perfection! 
C'est grâce à tout cela que je peux affirmer que c'était une des meilleures expériences gastronomiques que j'ai vécue!"}
{"text":"Go for the arepas and maduros, stay for the cool ambiance and friendly staff! Love this place! I went for the first time last night and I definitely plan to go back soon. It's a bring your own wine place, so be prepared to bring the vino to accompany your dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

My wife, daughter and I had three very different meals and they were all excellent.  Very authentic.  Juicy and tasty but heavy or greasy.

The service was cheerful, on time and very welcoming.  

The interior decorations are very cool--nicest I have seen in this location.  The outdoor patio is airy and comfortable.  

This will be a new favorite of the family."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding, but the drinks were even better!  

Classic cocktails with a Montreal spin...the maple wood smoke infused Manhattan was fantastic.

Make sure to try the gravlax if you enjoy great salmon.

Our bartender's (Simone) advice on the local food scene in Montreal was amazing; just wish each of our nights in town was as good as the one we spent at Barrocco..."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my top 3 favorite places to eat in Cleveland.

Everything I have eaten there is delicious.  The wait staff is pretty good.  Their sauces are amazing.  And it's BYOB, which I haven't taken adventage of yet but is a nice little bonus.

My only suggestion is to try to avoid weekend nights - they get very packed & the wait is much longer, as it is a smaller place."}
{"text":"What else can be said that hasn't been said in hundreds of reviews?! I love this place. the food is amazing. The atmosphere is fun.  Good drinks for happy hour, love the live music on the weekends, and the service is awesome! For my latest trip here, we had a big party and they were just as attentive and friendly, and didn't balk about having separate checks.  Definitely worth checking out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this place, even though prices seemed a tiny bit steep for what it should have been. 

I had a tea mule cocktail (awesome) and my husband had a glass of red wine that was recommended by the in-house sommelier. The special burrata appetizer was served with fruit, so it was lighter and refreshing. I had the tagliatelle for dinner, which was perfectly cooked, and my husband had the shortribs. The creme brulee dessert was kind of ordinary, but fine. For the two of us, we ended up spending about CA$190 (includes 2 glasses of $25 wine)."}
{"text":"The tomato and buratta tartelette is literally to die for! Had a very wonderful evening in an intimate and inviting space...the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, and the food was absolutely delicious!!  I ordered the Carne Asada & Calentado...empanadas for an appetizer.  Everything was cooked to perfection..."}
{"text":"Crap. Unprofessional cooking skills, very loud music. The place it self and the decor is very beautiful."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints and the service is great! Currently, they're in the process of obtaining their liquor license, so it's not possible to BYOB right now."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this place. Trying o hard to be hip. The horrible artwork ruoins the mood. Confused menu offers little in the way of authentic Latin food. Just another messy fusion place. Get rid of the art make the food more authentic, get rid of the terrible sauces(the pineapple sauce had turned the first time and I checked again second time and it still smelled) and you  have a nice place. As of now its Latino food for people who hate Latino food."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here.  The atmosphere was very nice.  The service didn't start out particularly well, but they made up for it with charm later.

I thought that perhaps the tartare could have used a little something, but overall the cocktails and wines we had were superb as was our food. Not an inexpensive place, but we thought it was worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was within walking distance of our hotel so when we were looking for somewhere to go for a nice dinner, we decided to try Barroco. In short, it was amazing! Probably the best meal we had for the week we were in Montreal. I had the Beef Short Rib and it was fall-off-the-bone tender and oh-so delicious. My boyfriend had the Arctic Char and he raved over that as much as I did the beef. Definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch on the weekend.  The arepas are outstanding.  I get the chicken and add pineapple and jalapeño.  

The sauces they have for the chips are super tasty and cover the full range from sweet to smoking hot.

Service is always good.  I always try to take company here when they are in town because there is no other place like it!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, helpful staff. Will definitely be coming back this summer."}
{"text":"Nice decor and space. Food was decent, seemed authentic, however our food took over an hour to get to us when the restaurant was about half full. 
All in all we were there way longer than we wanted, though the menu said be patient, it was a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Barroco is always a good bet! The staff is really cool and helpful. Their cocktail list is exquisite. I've tried everything on the menu and everything is amazing, the only dish that I would suggest they elevate is the pasta dish. The Foie Gras has to be my favourite dish and the Dandy Old Fashion cocktail is the best drink, a must try!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!

Top 5 meals of my life!  Sat at the bar and had Julienne as our waiter/bartender.  Besides the fact that he is super cute....he is super nice and has a wonderful personality!  
The cocktails were delicious and very unique!  The appetizer my husband got, the Burrata,  was completely out of this world!  His quote...\"i've never eaten anything that when I finished it, I immediately wanted to order another\"

Both our dinners were excellent and the desserts were an amazing end to an overall amazing experience!

This is a must stop when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Unreal. This place rocks. I've been here lots, taken friends in, brought my wife, meet ups with friends and I've sent my customers in too. Barroco is likely my favorite restaurant in the area- the atmosphere is extremely pleasant, I love to B my OB and pay a measly cap'n'cork fee to do so, the music is spot on, the patio is neat and the food is excellent. 
As others have said, the cheesy corn is amazing but what's even better is that the waitresses don't look down on you for eating it with your fingers when the plantain chips are all gone. I've wept like a baby who lost a balloon when that dish went empty.
Now the dishes, I don't speak any non-English dialects so I'm bad at remembering what I ate, but I do remember the ropa vieja. And it was amazing. One of the Top 5 plates I've eaten in my life. The Bandeja Paisa and the Punta Carne weren't far behind. Service was great but a bit slow, but remember you are waiting on delicious food and delicious food takes a while to cook- it doesn't sit under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after getting a half off Groupon.

My wife and I went on a Friday night, and it was packed! We were seated right away, and had an attentive waitress right from the start. 

The place is cramped, and there was a house band playing so loudly that you would have to scream in order to be heard, but we honestly didn't mind. It was an overall fun atmosphere. By the way, this place allows BYOB!

The food was great. My favorite part were the homemade sauces that they bring out to the table at no charge. Mix and match, and put them on everything!

The Barroco Burger was fantastic, and my wife really enjoyed her Hawaiian Arepa!

We'll be back"}
{"text":"Would've given it 5 stars, but had too wait entirely too long for our food (dined in and not very busy at the time). Server was not very good, but friendly. A for effort. Food though is awesome. I just couldn't stop eating..so good. Great value."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while on a business trip to Cleveland.

Great place to eat!  We ended up coming back the next night for dinner and would have again if we hadn't been travelling home.

The arepa was delicious and the sauces were even better.  A perfect combination.  The second night I had one of their steaks.  It too was phenomenal...and quite large for the price. 

The environment was a unique, very hip and happening place.  Our waiter was great and he helped explain everything about the food/sauces.

If I'm ever in Cleveland again, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service throughout!  Once inside, the interior stone wall and Spanish decor bring you to another place. The service is a bit slow as other reviewers mentioned but the atmosphere and food are so fantastic that you will not mind the slower pace and will enjoy a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I probably go to this place every week, it's definitely my favorite spot around Cleveland.  The food is exceptional, the atmosphere is very cool and laid back, it's a great value for the price, and the staff there are so friendly and the service is great.  I always get the guacamole or cheesy corn dip (make sure you try it with the plantains), and the arepa mexicana with the black bean soup (its to die for).  I have also tried the plaintain sliders, which really aren't what I would define as a \"slider,\" it's really a huge pile of meat and plaintains, but equally delicious. I am also in love with their sauces....there are 5 that they give you on one of those little trays and they are all fantastic.  My favorites though are probably the spicy peanut and the garlic.  It's also BYOB, so run to your favorite craft beer vendor, pick your own 6 pack, and just go to town.  Top the night off with their banana dessert :)"}
{"text":"First off, by far the best restaurant we have been to in Montreal (thus far!) The service was exceptional and the staff very friendly. This is a cute and quaint spot located in Old Montreal. The ambience is charming and had a rustic feel to it. Our food journey, while we sat at the bar begins...

1. Amuse Bouche- Huitre and Foie Gras (Oysters)
Foie Gras topped with a coulis sauce and combined with the taste of the ocean was definitely worth it! Must try.. 
2. Paella
Squid, shrimp, scallop, morcilla, chorizo....all of these ingredients combined to give you the authentic spanish taste that will leave you wanting more..
3. Braised duck leg parmentier
Paired with a side of bay leaf and coriander scented salad. The pulled meat....beyond tender....topped with a thick layer of butternut squash and Foie Gras..absolutely amazing! The Foie Gras really enhanced the  flavour of the meat and added a kick to the bite!

The drinks...
1) Pimm's Cub - wonderful flavours of the carribean, topped with pomegranate and fig.
2) Tsar - martini-like drink paired with rosemary, topped with caviar. 

Would recommend this spot to anyone visiting old Montreal who enjoys an authentic experience!"}
{"text":"Un des excellents restaurants à Montréal. J'ai eu un excellent service, les cocktails étaient excellents, 90% des vins sont des importations privés, et la nourriture est tout simplement sublime! 

En entrée nous avons mangé le tartare de veau, la burrata et morilles. Le tartare était succulent, et l'entrée de fromage burrata avec morilles est vraiment superbe.

Comme plats principaux, nous avons eu le saumon et la paella. Tous les deux très bons. Une vraie paella! 

Et pour le dessert, nous avons été enchanté par le gâteau au gingembre. Du fromage de chèvre sur un gâteau au gingembre, avec un sorbet et des bleuets. C'était absolument incroyable! 

Je vais y retourner souvent!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try an arepa, but thought I'd have to go to a bigger city like New York or a city with a much larger Latino population. I was thrilled to find out about this place and eager to give it a try. I had the Steak and Hawaiian Arepas. Both were great on their own, but the sauces really put them over the top. My favorite was the garlic sauce followed closely by the chimichurri. Wish they sold the garlic sauce by the bottle. The pineapple sauce is a nice palate cleanser. The ranchero sauce is like a creamy ketchup. The peanut sauce was the only one I didn't care for since it was all heat and not much else. I hope that they will expand their menu to include more traditional fillings beyond the chorizo. I'm now a fan and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. The Valentine's Day menu was great. Everything was fresh and the service was spot on."}
{"text":"The ambience is excellent, great food and our waitress was awesome! The last night is always the best night."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious, I loved everything about this place. The decor is great and so is the service. And the food is...wow! It hits the mark on presentaion, taste, smell, and texture. You can tell everything is made in-house. I ordered tostones for my side and the South Floridian in me was very happy! Try all the sauces, too. Thanks for opening on the East side! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good food, however very small portions. This is not the true Latin place where you are satisfied with the portion sizes. It is what it is i guess..not a lot of options in lakewood"}
{"text":"Delicious arepas filled with an amazing variety of meats, veggies and the like.   Eaten gyro style, there are homemade sauces to squirt on, with the chimichurri being the tastiest.  The maduros were good, but could have been cooked a little more to be crispier.  The flan wasnt very good, and I think it might have had rum in it.  Nevertheless, I would definitely go back.  Service was great too!!"}
{"text":"love the atmosphere of this place. Awesome, music, colorful decor and friendly staff.

The delicious arepas (I had a the chicken) are very ethnic and filling, only $6. It was a great stop for lunch and very affordable.

The 5 different sauces they provide are delicious accompaniments to your meal.

I tried the arepas fries, but wasn't as crazy about them. There is parking available in the back which is really convenient and it doesn't cost anything.

The location is in the middle of nowhere but I think that adds some charm  to this place!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!
This place is cozy and funky -- with scrumptious food!
 the \"cheesy corn\" is super delicious!!
The staff is always cheerful and helpful and ready to serve you!!
Its BYOB - which is always fun :)
Great for dates, lunch or anytime of day, really!!
YUM YUM YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon. There weren't too many customers at the time since it was fairly early for dinner so we were seated right away. It did take a while for a waitress to finally come to our table tho. Once she did, we ordered piña coladas and they were brought out about 10 minutes later. They were delicious and presented nicely! 

We had the condado cheese dip as an appetizer and it was ok. The chips were slightly stale and the dip should have been much warmer and that would have made it a much more tasty dish.

I had a pupusa meal (I believe it was called the montañera) with braised beef. This one is an open-faced pupusa, not as easy to eat as those with the fillings inside that you can hold like a sandwich. Nonetheless, it was tasty overall. My only complaint is that the beef wasn't as tender as I would have liked. It was slightly chewy so I didn't eat too much of it. I did enjoy the maduros that accompanied my meal. My husband had the ropa vieja platter with rice & beans as well as maduros. He enjoyed his meal overall with the same complaint about the beef being too tough. He really liked the rice, beans and maduros. 

Another note is that even in the early afternoon with just a few tables of customers (and many staff members present) service overall was slow. Doesn't seem like the kind of place for just a quick bite to eat. 

We will likely try it one more time, but we will try something besides the beef dishes."}
{"text":"Another awesome place to be in Montreal for great food experience.

No words...it's an awesome experience"}
{"text":"Barroco is truly a world-class restaurant in Old Montreal. The service is warm and beyond accommodating. Roberto makes you feel like family! I ordered the Angus Beef Tartare which literally melts in your mouth and is beautifully seasoned. I had the Market Course entree, which that night was braised short ribs and a celery puree and potatoes---the meat was decliously glazed  tender and fell right off the bone and the puree was addictive. My friend got the Barocco Paella which ranks as one of the best dishes she has ever tasted. They also have an excellent Spanish red wine there and everyone is so knowledgable and helpful. The space is gorgeous, in a perfect location in Old Montreal, it is truly the most beautiful place on the block. If you are in Old Montreal, you will regret not eating at Barroco so make a reservation (only 50 seats) and prepare for an unbelievable experience. Thank you Roberto and staff for one of the best dining experiences this New Yorker has ever had!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Barroco last night for dinner.  What a great little place!  This is perfect street food...and I mean that in a good way!  It's the perfect food for a nice, different lunch or dinner, but I'll bet that it's even better after you've had a few \"barley sodas\" at the local public house and need something to soak it all up.

I was waiting for my fellow diners to show up, and, despite not having table service, the girl at the counter brought me a menu and took my beverage order.  A nice touch, I thought.  I was totally sold on the Cuban sandwich, until I saw the Arepa sandwich come off the grill onto another diner's table.  I had to try it!  An arepa (ah-ray-pa) is a sandwich where the bread is made from a  quarter-inch thick corn tortilla... similar to sopes at Mexican restaurants.  It's cooked on a griddle until crispy on both sides and then split in half to make a bun.  Mine was stuffed with piping hot shredded beef, onions, tomato, cheese, corn and some lettuce.  It was very tasty!  The corn \"bun\" is crispy and toasty and soaks up all of the beefy juice without falling apart.  The girl behind the counter brought out 5 squeeze bottles of their sauces; chimichurri, pineapple, hot/peanut, garlic mayo and a ketchup-based one.  They were all good!  The hot/peanut sauce was really zesty, but my favorite was the chimichurri.  Perfect with my beef arepa.

We also ordered the Cheesy Corn dip, served with arepa fries.  The dip is a creamy, cheesy, corn, chicken, bacon combo that was really great and a cardiologist's nightmare.  We ran out of arepa fries about  1/2 way through and I'm not ashamed to say...we ate most of the rest with forks.  

The atmosphere is cozy, there are maybe a dozen tables in the place with an assortment of music from Latin to pop playing in the background.  There's also lots of artwork adorning the walls, presumably from local artists, for sale. The kitchen is really part of the dining room, when you walk up to the counter to order, you're about 1/3 of the way in the kitchen.  One down side to all this coziness is that the farthest table from the grill is only about 15-20 feet away, so it was very hot in there!  I saw the thermostat on the wall and it was registering a balmy 84 degrees.  There is also parking in the back, but don't even attempt it.  The \"lot\" is very small, only 4 spaces, 1 of which is handicapped parking and the other 3 spaces are so small a Mini would have trouble.   Just park on the street and you'll be better off.

The staff was very friendly.  Both people behind the counter were from Latin America and clearly passionate about sharing their food with us.  The man on the grill took great pride in telling us about how they make all of their arepas from scratch and he's working on bringing even more authentic flavors into the shop.

Barroco is some really good eats!  Stop in and you'll agree."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Yelp, I probably never would have went here. I'm glad I did. The food was amazing and the staff was very friendly. It was definitely an interesting place. How many places let you BYOB?"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, we came here with friends. It was an amazing dinner. I had the artic char which was incredible. Our friends had the short ribs which were spectacular. I would came back again on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"What an awesome treat!  Our first visit and they were packed to the gills with customers, which is a good sign because it means they're doing something right!  Lucky for us, a table for two just opened up.  Service was amazingly fast and friendly, and food was fresh and tasty, prices were reasonable, and portions were plentiful.  Music and decor made us feel like we were in a little place down in the Caribbean.  Keep up the good work... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Barocco and would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  It is a more rustic setting, darker than many restaurants in Montreal but I enjoyed the setting.  Service was good,  no complaints.  We had the heirloom tomato salad which was quite good as I'm sure the tomatoes were in season.  The Burrata was also very good, but seems to be a popular dish in Montreal.  For the meal, we split the Paella for two which was good not great.  The flavor of the dish was good, but I thought for two it was a little light on the seafood.  The octopus was everpresent and too chewy for our taste.  

In all, I'd certainly go back again and would love to try some of the other items on the menu.  If you have had great Paella before, I'd go a different direction though."}
{"text":"Exceptional warmth, charm and positivity. The food and drinks matched the atmosphere. The service was one of a kind."}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING!!!!!!

Everything is delicious on the menu....You can't go wrong with anything you choose to have. In addition to that, the bartenders and the waiters enhance the whole dinner experience!!!

A must go!!!!"}
{"text":"All the appetizers were really good; however we found the entrees to be poorly executed.  Paella was way too salty, osso bucco was dry, but the short ribs were pretty good. 

Ambiance was intimate and service was good.

I'll give it another try someday, but my first impression wasn't good enough to recommend this place.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and could not think of one bad thing to say about this place. The vibe and feel of the restaurant is very mellow and chill. All of the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. But the best thing about this place is the food. Everything I have tried from here is excellent. I have gotten a few different dishes and sampled off of my husbands plate as well.  You truly can't go wrong with ordering. This is definitely a place to try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Was fortunate to have the beef short ribs before they are retired from the menu.  Incredible meal, and the customised cocktails from the bartenders are an experience in themselves."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the building fool you- this place is amazing and very authentic.   If you come here you have to get an arepa- I had the chicken one with black bean soup and it was very tasty. The servers are extremely nice and go out of their way to help you.  

They also have multiple homemade sauces that will add even more flavor to your arepa."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely terrible! Now that I've read the bad reviews (many of which seem to be hidden amongst what sounds like a bunch of \"not real\" reviews), I feel sad for falling for this tourist trap! 

We ordered 4 appetizers and 3 main courses. Each one was inedible. My 1st piece of duck was so rubbery, I had to spit it out. My husband had the 2nd piece and also spit it out. I was unable to cut the 3rd piece of the duck with a steak knife! I let the waitress know and they took it off our bill. The staff was very nice, and it seems that they know how bad their food is. 

I now regret not telling the waitress about all the other food that was just as bad. We took the pasta to go (since we had already ordered it), but ended up trashing it. 

Ughhh, just ughhh. Hugely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Presentation is beautiful and servings are generous. The paella with lobster is delicious. Took a bit of coaxing to get our waiter's attention in this beginning but after that it really was perfect."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. Best service our group of four had on our trip to Montreal. Drinks were excellent, especially the old fashioned, Smoking Gun. Extensive drink menu and the the guinea fowl stuffed truffle over foie gras with brussels sprouts was delicious. A little expensive, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Server was nice but they didn't follow through to their Margarita special happy hour because they are still in the process of getting their liquor license apparently?? Sounded like BS just to rip the customer off. The food was pretty crappy honestly, very greasy and heavy. Not that great of taste. Also, idk how they get away with 2 $$ because they were expensive as hell. 2 drinks, 2 meals, 1 appetizer and it ended up being over $90. Definitely not worth it and its located in an over-gentrified odd looking location. They are price gaugers."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Lakewood. Their drink specials during the week are on point and the food is amazing. The ambiance is fitting of this Colombian style restaurant and it's almost guaranteed that you will be served by someone who knows and loves the food. I'd recommend ordering an arepa if you have never been before, and try all of the sauces offered!

My biggest complain is the service is usually slow, but the food and drinks more than make up for it! My personal favorite is their mojito, not only is it fun to look at it also tastes amazing! Also, during the summer take advantage of their patio: they have a small outdoor one and another enclosed one"}
{"text":"The ambiance was great and it seemed like it would be a good dining experience, but it was not a good experience. We ordered the steak for two to share. The menu says a 45 minute wait, and we were okay with this. It took 1.5 hours for the steak to come, we ordered medium rare and it was medium. If you love steak like us, medium and medium rare are two very different ways. After coming for dinner at 915pm, we ate at 1130pm. We asked for the rest to be packed up. They actually left out the bone piece that had significant meat on it, but somehow packed up the fat that we cut off our steak. How incredibly rude are you to pick and choose what you pack up for your customers?!?! Especially since we waited over 2 hours to eat our meal. The wait staff was only nice when we flagged them down to remind them that we still haven't eaten; they showed little to no care of our presence, and we had to get their attention to top off our drinks.  The food was nothing special and the service was non-existent.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Bon souper, en entrée du crabe et comme plat principal la paella. Délicieux!
Ambiance conviviale, un peu bruyant, mais de la bonne musique. 
Serveurs très courtois. Je vous le recommande"}
{"text":"I just moved here from south Florida and have been having trouble finding authentic spanish food up here. I heard this place was good and I saw picadillo on the menu so I got excited. The sangria was really good but the picadillo only had 1 olive in it. The olives are my favorite part so this was disappointing. I would have said something to our waitress about this but we only saw her a few times. The service was pretty terrible as our waitress only came to our table to take our order and bring our food and drinks. We had to flag her down to ask for boxes and the check at which point she asked if I wanted another sangria. I would have ordered another sangria if she came by our table at some point before we were sitting there for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to get out of there. Also, the live music was too loud to have a conversation with anyone so my boyfriend and I just sat there the entire time staring at each other once we got frustrated trying to talk to each other and not being able to hear."}
{"text":"Had a romantic dinner on a November Saturday night at Barroco.

Had no problem getting a reservation 3 days prior for a 7pm sitting (they also have a later sitting).  They did however let us know at that time that :
a) we had to be out of there at 9h30 the latest and 
b) that they would call us back to confirm on the said Saturday. 
The restaurant is small (seats about 50) and they want to maximize their revenues given they can pack both sittings on this night.

The decor is warm and inviting with stone walls and a fireplace.  The tables however are small and packed close together.  The chairs are simple wood and very uncomfortable after a while. Ask for a booth table if you are 4 or more when reserving.  This all makes for a noisy environment.

The service was nice but not very knowledgeable about the menu.  The wait staff all wore jeans.

We had oysters and a cheese plate as appetizers that were all delicious.  Tried the duck egg and scallop/morcilla entrees that were equally delicious.

The short beef ribs were good and plentiful but unremarkable.  I had the meat market plate that was baby pork ribs on that particular night.  This dish came with 2 tiny ribs on which the edible meat was the size of a quarter, a large scallop, some lentils and piece of leek. This dish was seriously overpriced at 39$. Taste was good but nothing special. 

Aside from the two market plates the other dishes do not come with any sides.  If you want any, it's extra (8$  to 12$) each.  
The wine by the glass list is limited to 3 reds and 3 whites.  I tried all 3 reds before selecting one and they ranged from awful to mediocre. Prices are also high compared to similar or better restaurants.

The pace of the service was very good except that we received our main plates at 9h15.  It was somewhat irritating to feel rushed by looking at the folks who came at 9h25 for their table and were waiting less than 3 feet away (it's a small place remember). Hence we didn't have any dessert or coffee.

All in all a satisfactory meal in a nice decor.  There are better places for the price in this city."}
{"text":"Best duck ever , it was delicious.  Service was excellent I totally recommend this place. Pricy it is"}
{"text":"A gem in Lakewood. The food was phenomenal. Service was so-so, but not bad by any means."}
{"text":"Always a great vibe here amidst an exciting, friendly atmosphere. During my most recent visit I had the Arepa Paisa with Black Bean Soup. The arepa features fried pork cracklings (delicious!), and the soup was flavorful and silky. So many great things here, and next visit I plan on diving into one of the carnes plates."}
{"text":"Great place... Empanadas were great. I had the Chorizo arepa and the Carne asada. All food tasted great! Staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend this place and I'm Colombian."}
{"text":"My husband and I had really high hopes for this place. I tried to call a number of times and emailed the restaurant as well for a reservation. No reply either way. However, given the reviews we really wanted to give it a shot. So arrived around 845 to take a chance a a table. The hostess noted a 15 minute wait and we immediately jumped at the chance thinking we had lucked out for my birthday.

Ordered a bottle of prosecco and veal tartare to start, both were good. Nothing to write home about though... the waitress was attentive when we arrived then gradually less so..... they had a special that evening of clam, king crab, shrimp and french sausage; pan fried then placed in a saffron lobster sauce. Sounded delicious while quite expensive at $49. But then again it was my birthday dinner so we went for it. my husband ordered the short rib.

The bread that kept arriving at other tables never made it to ours, which was disappointing but I did want to save my appetite for the actual goodness to come. so no harm no foul there really...

After our veal tartare, we basically sat and waited. our glasses were empty but no one came to refill us.  no one even glanced our way for a entire period between our courses... I kept my optimism as I waited for the ever so rich and scrumptious sounding dinner.

When it did come, it was borderline lukewarm.  The broth too salty and nothing tasting as it should. I like my meals hot, and for the price you pay you would expect it as such. The short rib was not as tender as we had hoped either. We actually did need a knife.

All in all, poor service, disorganized and mediocre food. I'm sure it would have been much better had it been hot. Sadly they did not allow me to have that experience and provide what may have been a better review"}
{"text":"This Spanish and French restaurant is fantastic. The food is really good and the service impeccable. If you like a cocktail try the Woodford Reserve Old Fashioned. Awesome.  Barocco is in my top 5 favorite restaurants in N. America."}
{"text":"The flavors were authentic, plantains were perfect, and they had so many sauces to apply to everything. We eat gluten free and the menu said that 80% of the menu is GF. That's pretty amazing. We had an arepa, a Colombian traditional dish, and a starter. Yum!"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is exceptional. The food is interesting and so well thought out and prepared. The interior is charming, and beautifully lit. The service is excellent. What are you waiting for? GO!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived in Montreal late on a Thursday night coming from Toronto. Barroco was recommended to us for a relaxing atmosphere in quaint Old Montreal. The food was delicious. The Barroco Ham on Focaccia was great, lots of flavour. Extensive wine menu. We enjoyed sampling some wines on the house before making our choice. The restaurant is very comfortable. Relaxed, rustic and charming.  Good music and incredible service. Out server, Andre, was very helpful. He had great suggestions from the menu and offered some advice about bars to visit in the neighbourhood for a few late drinks. Highly recommend this restaurant to locals or visitors to Montreal."}
{"text":"Place is great!  Food is fresh and priced reasonably. Their sauce collection is impressive.  

We loved the pork arepa, and the chorizo arepa was nice as well.  

Overall a job well done"}
{"text":"A new experience of Latin American cuisine -- Colombian style.  The menu takes a little time to peruse since everything is unfamiliar, yet delicious sounding.  I chose the house special, arepas.  I don't even know my sides were, but they were delicious.  The food was quite good, reasonably priced and the staff was quick with service, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I feel like I have found the most holy place of Colombian arepas!  If you don't know what an arepa is you should do some research and be sure you're not looking up Venezuelan arepas because they're different.  Barroco is like a neighborhood spot you're glad to have in your neighborhood.  The servers are really sweet and let you know what each of the items on the menu are and offer up their suggestions.  I go for the Hawaiian and that's enough to fill me up each time.  Though sometimes I can convince myself to split a flan...

If you're the sort of person who loves a frou frou dining experience you may not love the atmosphere.  Check yourself and take it down a notch and you'll be glad you did.  The food is affordable, the food is fantastic, the people are real and did I mention that the food is fantastic?   

Oh, and it's BYOB."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my girlfriend. Made reservation on a Tuesday night and arrived and did not have to wait a minute because there were tables available. The place is small but has a good romantic ambiance. Big open window by the front provided a nice breeze. 

We ordered cocktails. I had the white negroni and it was incredible! I make a mean negroni and this one was as tasty and refreshing. I can't remember what the girlfriend had but it was also delicious. So good we ordered 2 rounds.  

Food wise, we shared the octopus appetizer and also shared the steak 31oz with truffle butter with a side of mushrooms... Medium rare steak, cooked perfectly.  The food was simply amazing! Delicious in so many ways my taste buds were dancing! Steak was one of the best I've had!  Can't say enough but would definitely recommend this place. Staff were friendly and fun.  Place was expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"I first had arepas in NYC, at Caracas Arepas. The arepas were venzuelan-style there, lovely white corn cakes, split and filled with the most amazing fillings. I immediately came home to Ohio and made them non-stop. When I heard about Barroco I was excited -- always good to try another person's take. I wasn't thrilled looking at the menu -- the fillings seemed a bit uncreative, but I had been to the best, so.... I ordered the chicken one. It was a huge sandwich! This arepa was not venezuelan, but a colombian-style arepa -- much thinner, and fried. If I hadn't had my experience in NYC I might have liked them OK, but I didn't like the deep-fried taste. And the filling was incredibly oily too, although pretty good. The slightly thicker and not fried venezuelan arepas have such a lovely, almost flowery smell, like homemade tortillas. 

The saving grace? THE SAUCES!!!!! Oh. My. God. The garlic one is out-of-this-world. I could taste the fresh mayonnaise base (perhaps hollandaise?), and the garlic taste was deep and multi-dimensional. I asked if they sold it separately, and was told \"no\". Drat! I asked the cook what was in it, and he replied he didn't know -- the owner wouldn't even give his son the recipe! My mission is clear.... 

It was a fun place to stop at, nice ambiance, reggae on the stereo. I couldn't finish my sandwich -- it was just a bit to rich -- or maybe it's all the garlic sauce I ate with it. Definitely have to go back just to get some sauce, even if it means I have to order fries."}
{"text":"This was a solid, cheap dinner. I just moved back to Ohio from Texas, so maybe I'm being overly harsh to Latin foods, but I wasn't wowed. I had the Cubano, fantastic. It's giant, big enough for two to share. My boyfriend had the chorizo arepa, which was decent, but I think he'd wished he'd ordered something else. We split the cheesy corn. I guess I was expecting something more like what I assume a KFC bowl is. This was entirely too much cheese. It was a pie tin full of cheese, with a little corn and chicken sprinkled in; very small amounts of corn and chicken. It tastes good, but it's just wrong somehow. They need to make this like chili cheese fries, or add more corn to the cheese. It was just overwhelming, and not super appetizing once the cheese cooled down. The sauces are amazing. My favorite was the Chimichurri, which is what y'all are calling pesto. On another note, the seating area is pretty small, but clean. No complaints about the art. it closes pretty early, which is surprising because it's perfect late night food. This place would be a great food trailer."}
{"text":"Je suis allée à ce restaurant il y a un an, et j'en rêve encore!!! J'avais une amie en visite qui s'était fait recommander cet endroit, alors, sans avoir aucune idée à quoi s'attendre, nous nous sommes aventurés.

D'abord, de l'extérieur, on pourrait le manquer. Il est en plein sur St-Paul, mais reste discret. À l'intérieur, ce sont des murs en pierre qui ne datent pas d'hier, mais toute la déco affichée sur les murs (photos, articles) est très humoristique. L'ambiance est feutrée et calme, mais la musique est moderne. Ce mélange de classique et d'originalité se reflète dans la nourriture, et ça réussit parfaitement.

J'ai commandé une entrée comme plat principal, pour épargner mon portefeuille (car ce n'est pas donné...). J'ai opté pour le tartare de bison, accompagné de gnocchis sauté dans le beurre à l'ail. C'était impeccable, plein de saveurs, léger au goût, et même si le plat était une entrée, c'était suffisant. Surtout qu'on s'est gardés de la place pour le dessert, une variation de tarte au citron en verrine absolument incroyable. Mon amie et mon copain ont aussi adoré leur repas. Seul plat moins apprécié : l'accompagnement de broccolini.  Mais la balance compensait!

Le service était lui aussi impeccable. Nous avons eu droit à d'excellents conseils pour le vin, et un petit digestif offert par la maison.

Quelle belle soirée, que je répèterais n'importe quand. Mais il y a tellement d'autres places à essayer... Quel dilemme!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Barroco four times and thought each time, \"it has to get better.\"  The ONLY time we had good service and good food was the very first time shortly after they opened.  Each time after that it was one thing that was amiss, either the fries were cold or the coleslaw was rancid or the kitchen lost our order or the waitress was nowhere to be seen.

The arrepas and burgers are ALWAYS good, don't get me wrong.  It's just not consistent everything else.

Also, I think the menu changed since it first opened.  You used to be able to just get an arrepa and fries on the side if you wanted.  Now, you get them both together.  I want the ala carte option back.  If the fries were awesome that would not be an issue but they are mediocre at best, sometimes worse.  And get rid of that tasteless cole slaw.

Glad they have started using real plates but wish they used glasses instead of paper cups - so much waste!

Unfortunately we will probably not go to Barroco again - 4 times is enough trying."}
{"text":"This place is such a wonderful little flavor haven. It's TINY, so be prepared to either wait awhile if it's busy or get there early. The food is incredible, the arepas are SO DAMN GOOD. They give you this big selection of sauces with your meal and they're all really good. I actually ordered some tortilla chips just so I could sample all of them. The service is friendly, but slow at times if they're busy."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times and I live in Miami. I love this place!  The ambiance is the best. The service just cannot be improved as it is the best just as the food. I love their short ribs and to start the tomatoes with burrata. Of course you must start with a maple old fashioned. Also I'm sure all the waiters and waitresses are excellent but I love Rachel or Raquel as I call her. She is the best. She will ensure that you have a great experience!  One last tip, do make a reservation. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A really great place with excellent atmosphere. the empanadas are outstanding and the arepas are good as well. A local favorite."}
{"text":"Ah, sweet, original Barroco location ...you're so near my home that access to the cheesy- corn dip is mere moments away.   Juan and crew know what they are doing."}
{"text":"The atmosphere:
Fun.  Bistro.  Small.  Casual

The service
The bar service was slow.  Very slow.  The drinks were not very good.  The bartender was trying to impress by making a show of pouring bottles and making drinks.  Unfortunately, not quite hitting the mark with his blends.  Too much lime, too many liquors.  Too much show and not enough skill.  Young. :)

He forgot to put in our order...twice.  He seemed to get distracted frequently.  Then would look over for an 'a-ha' moment and remember he still needed to get our orders fulfilled.

The Food:
The Tourine was very good.  The meats were excellent as an appetizer.  The bread was ok.  For Montreal, it was a dissapointment.
The Paella was a mixed review.  my boyfriend liked it.  I thought it was too 'strong\".  Overseasoned.  The one prawn in the dish was cooked perfectly.  Most of the paella was calamari and rice (overcooked).

Overall review:
Not worth it.  Nice atmosphere, but the food was not worth the price.  I would highly recommend going to Pied De Cochon instead."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  Both the food and ambiance are incredible.  I would definitely recommend visiting as it takes you back to old Montreal."}
{"text":"All I can say is Perfect!  I come to Montreal for business from California......it is now a necessity that I dine at this restaurant each time i come here.  There is nothing I can complain about...... Barroco is just fabulous!"}
{"text":"I'm from medellin Colombia and the bandeja paisa was anything but a bandeja paisa. The food was horrible and expensive for the poor quality."}
{"text":"I have never had such exceptional customer service. I've ordered from them at least 25 times, and one time they messed up an order and Juan couldn't have been nicer about it. Everyone makes mistakes but the way he handled it was above and beyond. Will be going to this place for years and will tell people about it every chance I get."}
{"text":"Sorry to write. Update food getting a bit greasy and they no longer make their own

 corn wraps for their sandwiches.

  Pick up the slack. Was there when they opened I hate to be there when they close.

  Its the details that kill a good eatery."}
{"text":"What a fabulous restaurant. Small and cozy. The staff is fantastic. We had the beef short ribs and the pork chop special and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Thought I wad going Mexican. This is an outstanding Latin American cusine. A combination of Columbian, Argentinian and South American fare. Bring your own libation. Reasonably priced. A must visit."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing cocktails and wine options. The food was good but the foie gras mousse seemed to be overpowered by the amount of brioche and cherries it was served with. The duck magret was cooked beautifully and my husband loved the paella. The scenery and music was a plus."}
{"text":"Amazing Latin Food!! Best Cubano sandwich in Ohio! 
The service is great and restaurant is very festive. Warmer weather the restaurant has an outside dining available. After ordering your food the wait is not long at all. 

I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for delicious affordable food! 

(Don't forget to bring a marker!) :)"}
{"text":"Been here several times, always bring new folks. It never fails that they say, I\"ll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance, great bar, great starters.  Staff excellent.  It is fun just to watch the bartenders lovingly make classic drinks.  It became our nightly first stop while we were in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had the arepa fajita. It was to die for. The most delicious thinly cut beef with sautéed onions, peppers, in a delicious sauce. There was guacamole. There were these yummy triangles from heaven with cheese in them.

Also, grabbed apps - guacamole with tortilla and plantain chips and    the shrimp ceviche. The plantain chips weren't the run of the mill plantain chips - they were warm and crispy and soft on the inside and homemade and perfect.

I want to go back. Now.

Also, it's BYO. We stopped at Rozi's wine house before dinner and grabbed a light and refreshing Argentinian white. The gal at Barroco served us up glasses with ice and lime wedges. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Fantastisch! 
The perfect meal on a frosty night.  

Everything from the dishware and decor to the cocktails and the cuisine itself was delectable. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the wealth of vegetarian options.  We had a winter green salad, followed by main courses of vegetarian lasagna and arctic char with a side of garlic rapini.  The flavors complemented each other superbly.  

We felt at home in the restaurant's intimate ambiance and our server was knowledgeable and very friendly.  We took his suggestion for dessert and were surprised when he brought us a complimentary wine pairing to enjoy with it. 

Overall, a great success and highly recommended."}

{"text":"This is one of my favorite eating establishments in Cleveland.  Every time I go I bring someone with me who has never been there before.  I've frequented Barroco Grill a dozen times now with newcomers and it's nearly unanimously loved (a group of hoity toity consultant coworkers did not like it, but they eat at 4-star restaurants every day).

Recommendations:
- Cheesy corn - a must-try
- Black bean soup - good level of spicy, lots of flavor
- Buffalo chicken arepas - they're all good, but this seems to be the favorite
- All of the 5 sauces, in many combinations.  My favorite is the garlic.

I wasn't so impressed with the ropa vieja and empanadas - Barroco Grill decided to add more upscale items to its menu a few months after opening (they originally offered only burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, arepas, and cheesy corn) and I don't know, maybe these just need tweaking before the flavor's there.

BYOB - Wine and beer are totally welcome here.  They'll even provide the appropriate glasses

Reservations - This place is a small hole-in-the-wall kind of joint.  You do have a waiter (well, it's been a waitress every time I've gone) but it's the kind of place where a couple of tables that seat 2 are arranged in various formations.  Not the kind of place you make a reservation at (though I did once for a party of 8 and they were able to make sure to save us a spot)

Decorations - The art is all done by a friend of the owner, I think, and it look snazzy!  Sign your name on a wall before you leave!"}
{"text":"We've always loved this restaurant! And always craved and wished it's closer to us. So today I brought my mom and brother who are visiting from out of town. We walked in to a baby being changed on the counter...Who wants to walk in to that coming into a restaurant to eat?! The hostess then took us to outside seating. It was so hot that we asked to sit inside. She just walked us to a table without even smiling or anything and left. Ok.... We then ordered appetizer, which came in a reasonable time. But then it has been over an hour right now and we still don't have our food. The waitress hasn't even come by, not even once, to check how we are doing or explain why the food is taking forever. We are still sitting here at the restaurant, 1 hour and 15 minutes later. And no clue when the food is going to be here. We should have left a LONG time ago. Service today is beyond terrible. I am so very disappointed in Barroco. I spoke so highly of this place and even took my visiting family here. Now I don't think I want to come back. Step up your game Barroco! It's so sad to see this happening to such a promising place."}
{"text":"It was surprising to find a Colombian restaurant in Cleveland but I am so happy I did. The Chicken Arepa with fries it yummy (greasy) meal filled with flavor. The best part of the meal, however, is the spicy peanut sauce - I think I can drink a cup of that stuff. The only downside is the service is spotty. Sometimes they are attentive and sometimes they are not.

I cannot wait to try some different Arepas!"}
{"text":"I went there specifically to get a Cuban sandwich because Cleveland is lacking in that department. The Cuban was definitely not traditional. Being that it had tomatoes and mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss and no pickles,where are the pickles?!!!! Overall it was a pretty good sandwich though and it fed my craving for a Cuban. We got the guacamole and fry plantains for an appetizer. The guacamole is some of the best that I've had around, very flavorful.I will definitely be back to try one of their famous arepas! The one disappointment that I had was I had bought a living social deal and I couldn't use it because apparently the numbers on my LivingSocial had already been used. I will have to call LivingSocial to figure this out. Hopefully there'll refund me so I can it another time."}
{"text":"We were wowed by the atmosphere the moment we walked in! Lots of character with the classy decor, but simple at the same time. The service was impeccable. The cocktails hit the right spot. The food is something that I will remember for a while.

I got the Scarlet and the bf got the Smoking Gun to sip on. He really enjoyed his, which is great, because I am not a whiskey person, so that drink was so not my type. Fear not, mine was definitely my type. 

We started with a small charcuterie board. I don't like pickled vegetables and it's a near fact. I say near, because that perception changed at Barrocco! The picked cauliflower and the cucumber were oh so good. They were not too vinegary, which is my usual complaint. The toasted bread that came with the meats, jamon, chorizo and the pate, were perfectly grilled, not too crunchy and not too soft.

I got the paella for dinner and he got the octopus special. The paella had a good amount of squid, a big disc of scallop, a huge shrimp, and scattered with chrozo and morcilla. A very flavorful dish, but no one ingredient stole the show. His octopus was first sous-vided and then grilled, so it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The lemon peel puree balanced the heaviness of the gnocchi and the sweetness of the corn.

We were quite stuffed, even though I didn't finish my paella. It was a shame that we didn't have room to sample the goat cheese cheesecake. Will definitely go back when we visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Old Montreal.  

Nestled in an old building with exposed beams and stone walls, you could easily miss this Old Montreal gem.  When you step in, the restaurant is breathtaking with ornate European style.  The bar glistens with a wall-length mirror behind.  All the tables have candles and the art-work and decor are reminiscent of Old World Europe but have a hip slant.  The bar is no doubt filled with 20-something hipsters.  

The food is a mix of Spanish, French and Italian and there is something for everyone.  The French onion soup oozes with melty-cheesy-goodness and is served piping hot.  I had the Guisado de Polo, a stewed chicken dish with almonds and herbs that was tender and moist, with a side of grilled asparagus.  I generally find asparagus mediocre, but not this time.  I had an amazing caipirinha here too.  

The only point of dissappointment i have for this place is the service, all-be-it polite, the waitstaff is a little ditsy and not the most put together.  

Overall, this is a great and dining experience in Old Montreal that you shouldn't miss."}
{"text":"Great music and seating area. Also the short rib is really amazing. Everyone I came with loved their dishes and there were no complaints, a rare occurrence..."}
{"text":"Everything has been great! I'v never been disappointed with the food.  Great appetizers.  Every one I introduce to Barracos always wants to go back."}
{"text":"So close to perfection.....except for the bathroom that is in the center of the dining room. Literally, there are 4 walls, and one of them holds the two lavatory doors. Not so great.
However, once you've embraced that imperfection, you're in for an amazing meal with fantastic service. Food was absolutely delicious, wine just as good. We sat at the bar, Marc Andres the bartender/server was extraordinary.
Barocco and Liverpool House are two musts for anyone in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is extremely cute, it is small but the interior is very cozy and warm. The atmosphere is simply amazing.

The food was delicious - I had the seafood paella and my boyfriend had the short ribs. Portions for both were pretty small given the price (something like $40 per plate), but it was tasty and good thing there was dessert after. 

They also have a really cool drink list that has tons of cocktails!"}
{"text":"It became my favorite place in Cleveland. The downtown location is a bit phony- the Lakewood location is the real deal. Ask the employees there what they eat- they know better than you.

This place doesn't disappoint. Unless you don't like Cuban/Venezuelan/Latin cooking- then this place will suck for you."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Mexican food will never be the same.
Being from latín america I must say this is the best place in this area, hands down!!"}
{"text":"Love this place . Has a good vibe when you walk in . Food is freshly made , good service . I am regular at this place . Little gem that brings in Colombian flavor to Lakewood !"}
{"text":"Very quaint restaurant in Old Quebec. Outstanding wine list and food presentation was unique!  We enjoyed the Lobster Carbonara and the sea smelts were a unique treat."}
{"text":"Overpriced greasy food. When it first opened it was ok. How much does cornmeal cost? Poor quality. And why are there no vegetable sides?"}
{"text":"Yummy! You can bring in your own alcohol and it's priced just right. I love the decor and you can write your name on the wall. Only thing I dislike is the male/female restroom is a shard restroom. The food is delicious and priced just right! One of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"For not looking like much on the outside, Barroco Grill delivered on the inside!

When you initially walk in, it's teeny tiny & hot as heck. I'm not sure if the air conditioning was broken on the particular night I went but... phew, it was a bit steamy in there! Besides this fact, our server was very friendly & the food came fast. I heard this place was known for their \"arepas\", a white corn, grilled, pocket-like tortilla stuffed with deliciousness. I chose the classic chicken arepa with a side of black bean soup. The dishes also come with their famous homemade sauces. The arepa was a good size & the soup was as well!

My first bite I didn't have any sauce so I could taste the flavor of the arepa. Very good. Then I moved on to the 5 sauces they offer... Sweet Georgia Brown, these were good sauces. The top 2 I stuck with the rest of the meal were the creamy garlic & chimichurri. Both were absolutely delicious & paired perfectly with the arepa. The black bean soup was also very good! We had an order of fries on the side which were spiced with paprika & a hot little something. Very good as well!

I ended up taking half of both my arepa & soup home! Plenty of food for a great price of $9! The experience at Barroco Grill was great & I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a concert, and found Barroco on Yelp. We had the chicken/chorizo arrepa and the cubano. The food came very quickly, and the server was excellent. While the fries were a bit average, the cubano was unbelievable. The arrepa was really good as well. And the sauces were the highlight -- all so good! Can't wait to go back for the cheesy corn, which looked awesome. Great little gem, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great local spot found it on Yelp so decided to give it a try with a buddy and it was a great choice. It's a more colombian/American restaurant we had the Steak Arepa and the Chicken Tostones and I must say they were great if your in the mood for something different or south American dishes this is a great choice. Only reason why's wouldn't give it a five star is because it's a bit small and the art work is kinda creepy."}
{"text":"First of I've only been there once, but plan to to go back and introduce my other friends and family to the restaurant. I may need to update this review at a later date as I explore the menu in greater detail. In short though, this was a great place. Small and very brightly decorated, provides a great atmosphere to explore food. I ordered Arepas, to dip my toes in the water so to speak, and was not disappointed. The corn tortilla that wraps it was new to me even though I've spent most of my life in Los Angeles, wonderful texture, great subtle taste. I'm anxious to make my way though all the other varieties in future visits. When you order they bring a selection of different sauces in squeeze tube to the table, this was fun to explore also. I also ordered a side of Maduras which are sweet fried plantains, these along with the pineapple sauce (in one of the squeeze tubes) are candy. This place is screaming out for beer service, but for a small place like this it's probably to expensive or too tightly clenched by the criminals that regulate alcohol in Ohio. Wonderful food, I will be back to tip toe through the crappy neighborhood to explore further."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent staff --both front of house & server ( Jason -- knowledgeable/ great advice/ fun/ right level of attn)/ fun atmosphere/ super reasonable prices---can't wait to go back ! Owner on-site & hands-on. Easy to understand why the place was packed ! No liquor license, so BYOB, but no corkage fees !"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Small but quaint place right in old Montreal. Decor was like most Montreal restaurants with a hog on wall with other nick- nacks that really bring the delicate ambiance together yet accompany the culture. We were seated quickly since we had made reservations which I suggest anyone going to Montreal should do. Also, as a side note, make sure to keep your phone on because the restaurants will call to confirm your reservations and if you do not answer they will give your reservation away. 

Ok onto the rest of the review. Service was great and attentive the whole time. I Will say they sometimes run themselves short as one of the waiters was the hostess as well. 

Now most importantly, the food. My girlfriend and I began with the cheese and charcuterie plate and oysters. Oysters were very good and fresh as well as the meat and cheese board. The ladder had fois gras , grapes, and prunes for extra taste. I has the short ribs as an entre which were delicious with the truffle oil, however, the meat was not that tender. My girlfriend had the special which was a veal chop with eglantine and pea risotto. Very good, but nothing out if this world. The one dessert they offered was a fancy brownie which was less than memorable. 

Overall, this place was very nice. Ambiance was good and food was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed!! First time I came I got a Cuban and my friend got a meat filled sandwich I tried both and they were both unflavorful and sweet tasting. It was not a true Cuban sandwich. A couple of my friends wanted to go because they have never been so I said I will try it again I got guacamole and chorizo arepa and empanadas. Guacamole was good. The other two dishes my friends didn't even finish. I'm not really sure what the big hype is about this place."}
{"text":"Both food and beverages are way overpriced. $14 for a glorified taco? Come on now. Ingredients seemed fresh but the 'glorified taco' seemed tasteless unless you load it up with their special sauce. Waitress was super friendly and earned her tip. Apparently many like the place but it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Had such high hopes based on a recommendation from my hotel.  Unfortunately the food was mediocre, the service was slow, the music was so loud that made it almost impossible to hold a conversation, and lastly... with their door and large window open... cigarette smoke poured into the restaurant for the entire 1:40 we were there.  With other great restaurants in Montreal... I would easily skip this place unless they make some changes."}
{"text":"Awesome! You must get the cheesy corn appetizer! So good! I usually get the perico arepa (scrambled eggs, chorizo, mozzarella, peppers, and onions) and I sub the chorizo for bacon! The Barroco loco sandwich is really delicious as well! The housemade sauces are the stars here, my favorite combo is the garlic sauce and the pineapple sauce, ridiculously good!  Great ambiance, don't let the hole in the wall look fool you."}
{"text":"Awful service and incompetent staff. Waited for an hour outside only to be told at the last minute that they could not accommodate us that evening (after the expectation had been set that we would have a table in an hour). Ended up going next door to Bocata - they are very friendly and accommodating. Would never return to Barocco based on our awful experience there. Stay clear of this one."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in CLE. The brunch is a delight and the dinner is awesome. You should go to it. Specifically the one in LKWD, it's better than the East side one. Though the one one on the East side is good also."}
{"text":"Barroco Grill is fairly straighforward. It has that Lakewood vibe with tattooed, alternatively dressed servers - the service is friendly, quick and helpful! 
Once you are seated you fill out a slip of paper with your choices for toppings and your tacos are made to order. Ingredients were fresh, with few exceptions the food was tasty and delicious.

A few cons: 
A side of sour cream is about a half cup and costs $1. How about 50 cents for a couple of tablespoons? I don't know anyone that would use that much or want to pay a dollar for the side. Not a huge deal obviously but I thought the pricing/serving size was a bit of an odd decision.

My husband's side of rice was sticky and flavorless. All of those delicious spices in that kitchen and you couldn't save the rice. I'm of the opinion if you can't cook it well, don't serve it at all."}
{"text":"One of the best place for dinner in Montreal. The food was really tasty. I would definitely recommend the paella or the ribs. 
Excellent service and very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We are here twice during the week and it was simply amazing. The food was executed perfectly and service was attentive and caring."}
{"text":"This is a tale of the good, bad, and well no ugly. Here is the goods. Cool vibe. Food was fresh and tasty. We started with the condado cheese dip. I would definitely suggest the jalapeño option. We had the Cubano sandwich very tasty though not a legit Cuban sandwich, but good nonetheless. The bad!!! Our sandwich took 35 minutes."}
{"text":"On the advice of the hotel concierge my group went to dinner here. We ate at the bar and Kristoff. He is an amazing bartender and a lot of fun. The food was phenomenal. We had steak tartar and oysters for an appetizer and the tartar in particular was great. The ribeye with chimichurri was to die for. I can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG!!!!! Honey this place is the BOMB.com, OK!!! Sangria and Mojito was on point. I love the atmosphere. ITS a VIBE...like you out of town. We went after noon and could tell that at night, its even better. Now the Food: the menu says be Patience they cook with care. Hardly noticed the wait, which was short and the food was cooked with lots of care. The presentation was wonderful. Oooh not to mention, Our Server gets the BEST Service Award. Man this place was so good I have been dreaming about it everyday since. Cant wait to go back for GIRLS Night OUT. Great place to start and End. I want to enjoy the Live music on Friday or Saturday. i definitely have to try HAppy hour. I usually try New restaurants at happy hour but this one is WORTH EVERY PENNY."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would! I was really excited to try this place out as I saw they had arepas (my grandma makes them from scratch and they are amazing!) They didn't beat hers but they came pretty close! I ordered the veggie arepa and added jalapeños and pineapples. This was an option on the menu and the waitress suggested I try it as the conflicting flavors made it delicious, definitely recommend!

In addition to the awesome service and food, the interior was fun and unique. The inside features colorful artwork with Christmas lights strung from the ceiling. 

In conclusion, I can't wait to return and try other things from the menu. If you're in the area, it's a must that you check this place out!"}
{"text":"I had pretty high hopes for this place, unfortunately we were pretty disappointed. The prices were quite high and the quality of food definitely didn't reflect that. We started with guacamole w tostones & chips. The tostones were good but the chips bordered in stale - and the guacamole was underseasoned. It really needed some salt. I had the arepa paisa which had chicharrones w a fried egg, cheese & pinto beans. The arepa itself was not fresh and was over cooked. It was hard and kinda chewy and pretty oily. The fillings had almost no flavor and they chicharrones were chewy and also unflavored. I love chicharrones but they need to be crispy and hot - these were neither. The fat was barely rendered from them and the surface was just chewy and the meat was tough. Very disappointing. Hubby had the frijoles soup and it too was disappointing. It looked delicious but really lacked any depth of flavor and was in need of salt. All of the ingredients should've made for a very savory, complex soup but this was none of it. It was kind of a basic light tomato-based soup with a bunch of unseasoned stuff thrown in. I've had authentic arepas, made by hand and filled with basic stuff and they were amazing and also very cheap - I didn't expect cheap but I expected good and hopefully authentic... sadly, these were none of that. Our meal w those 2 entrees, 2 iced teas and the guacamole app came to $46+! Sad to say it was Not worth it at all. We won't be back. :("}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance - perfect spot for a cozy romantic dinner in Old Montreal. Great service & really nice presentation on all courses. Glad we came."}
{"text":"If you want to have some authentic South American food this is the place to go to.  It used to be BYOB but it has recently changed to some of the best drinks you will find around. The Cubano sandwich here is legit there aren't too many places in Cleveland that do it justice but you will definitely find it here.  The atmosphere here is like none other, especially on the summer nights in which they have live music perfect for those who like to Salsa."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and amazing food. The food had so much flavor and I'm not Columbian or even grew up with this type of foot but it could be my comfort food. It was amazing, go there, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Such a special place. If you are going to Montreal make reservations here - you will not be disappointed. Expert from the kitchen to the bar and the service. The best salmon dish I have ever tasted! A wonderful evening spent at the bar with my husband. Thanks for the taste sensation! We are food professionals, highly critical and fully appreciate when we find people with passion for what they do. Awesome spot."}
{"text":"The East side finally has Barroco!  We had a wonderful dinner there tonight. The restaurant looks amazing and the food and service was even better. We had the pleasure of have Margarita as our server. She was incredibly pleasant, prompt, and knowledgeable. The owner was there and made a point to stop and check on us. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. We will be back soon for dinner on their very cool (heated) back patio."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Montreal! From the beautiful decor, amazing ambiance, exquisite menu, and fresh, locally produced ingredients, this restaurant is definitely one of the top three in Montreal! Never have been disappointed with anything I've eaten here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful dinner here. Reservations on a Wednesday night were easy to come by. They have a great specialty drink menu they're very proud of.  Worth a taste. Everything was well prepared. 
I had the tomato and burrata tartlet was very good. My wife had the lobster bisque gazpacho which was brilliant (I don't known why it was the first time I've seen this obvious pairing on a menu). 
I had the sea bream which was a filling portion of perfectly cooked fish. The gnocchi and vegetables all made for a well rounded meal. My wife had the short ribs which were huge and delicious. I little rich so you have to be in the mood. We were too full to try dessert unfortunately. 

The service was relaxed. A little slow - the whole dinner took about 2 hours which was long but fine if that's all you have planned. The ambiance was comfortable but not overly casual. Contrary to other posts I didn't find the place too loud. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic. Very tasty, well prepared, very authentic. Delicious!
Best mojito and caipirinha I've had in CLE ( been here for 12 yrs). 
The place is cool although layout could be better (read no easy way to get to the bathroom except jumping through some guests). Just Ok for a Latino like me, not sure for an American (read gringo ;)"}
{"text":"Loud music from 70-90s didn't match the ambiance of the place. 

Poor selection of wine by glass. 

While the food was good, it wasn't an outstanding value for the money.

Prompt friendly service."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers!

I got the cheese corn dip, arepa (ropa vieja), black bean soup, and apple soda. Wow, that cheese corn dip (with bacon- a pleasant surprise) was really good. In fact, I practically filled up on that alone and could only eat half my meal! The dip and the arepa fries were so hearty and oozed out \"comfort\" every bite I took.

The soup was good but the main entree, the ropa vieja, was awesome. It had very tender meat and combined with the sweetness of the veggies, it just made the sandwich come alive. The apple soda was also very refreshing and paired nicely with the whole meal.

This was first time I've had arepas and this type of Latin American food. Thanks for a wonderful experience.  I can't wait to try more of this type of cuisine!

OH! Besides the food, our waitress was so pleasant! Great attentive service.  Also, don't forget to bring a sharpie because you can leave your mark and write on the walls in this place. Fun paintings and funky decor!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new and were very pleasantly surprised! Excellent food. Great veggie options. The atmosphere was so fun. We lived the live music. Everyone who worked there was so easy to please. The house beer was a treat as were the maduros! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  All of the different types of plantain dishes that I tasted are fantastic, try the Chorizo Maduro."}
{"text":"There are so many reviews for Barroco that there is only one reason that I'm writing this review.

Everyone mentions the fact that it's BYOB, its appearance is extremely unassuming from the outside and the arepas are nothing short of phenomenal (kudos to the suggestion to ALWAYS add grilled pina and jalapeno to your veggie arepa)!

Unfortunately, I witnessed most of my fellow yelpers missing one key point: the shrimp ceviche.  There was one mention of it, but it did not do the ceviche justice.  It comes chilled with huge, hot, and salty tostones (toast-tone-ays) (fried plantains).  Forget the sauces (they are delicious, but please).  All you need is that cool, creamy ceviche and the amazing tostones and you are set.  Be sure to arrive early on weekends to get your ceviche, because it runs out very quickly.

I can only imagine that more people will order the shrimp ceviche and I will be doing myself a great disservice by suggesting that you do so, but it is a must.  I promise, I have not led you astray.  

Quick!  Grab that chilled bottle of pinot that's been sitting in your fridge and run!"}
{"text":"The place is small but definitely worth a try. We were seated immediately. The server was real laid back and friendly. The sandwiches took a little longer than I would have liked because I went hungry. However the artwork was very original and made for good conversation with the company I was with. The music was my type of music ! Columbian & Spanish Rock ! 
When the food finally came it was worth the wait! I had the Barroco Loco which was ham and steak lettuce tomato garlic sauce and mozarella cheese. My daughter just about ate it all. We also ordered the arepa empanadas which are filled with steak, potato & cheese. Simple, yet flavorful. Delicious !
I'm absolutely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Unbelievably expensive for merely reasonable quality. Even though it's in a touristy neighborhood full of pricey places, Barroco is distinctive for charging a multiple of neighboring restaurants' prices for the same level of food. Go to Holder or somewhere nearby instead -- you're more likely to get a table than at cramped Barroco, and you'll get food and wine that's just as good for half the money."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place and my experience was great! 

Food was really good, and the staff was super friendly. Had the Chorizo Arepa, it was a crispy corn wrap with spicy sausage and cheese . I added some spicy peanut sauce to the arepa and it just made it an even more better food experience. 

The decor was pretty cool and clean. Parking is limited because of the location. I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"The flavors here are really good. Next time I am having the Ceviche as my main entrée, it is delicious! The tostones are the icon here, thin, crunchy, large and with the right amount of seasoning.

The arepas are good but they are way overpriced judging by how much they taste like Arepaso y Pupuseria and they are double the price. I would be back for Ceviche but not for arepas. 

I would recommend this place. The best latin flavors I had found in Cleveland/Lakewood."}
{"text":"I would go back to Cleveland just for this place! I want this place to open in Boston. Hands down the best tostones I've ever had! The arepas will give me sweet dreams for days. Best find ever!!!"}
{"text":"Great Latin food. Freshly cooked.
Arepa selection is fantastic!
Google \"arepa\" and find out what you are missing on!"}
{"text":"Tasty and fun to try new things!

The arepas were very interesting.  A delicious corn flavor - though the texture was a bit tense for my tastes.  Lots of options though.  Their black bean soup was delicious and I liked the Columbiana soda too (kind of a cross between orange and creme sodas).  The best thing was definitely the cheesy corn though.  I see someone below complaining that it was just a bowl of cheese.  Um.. yeah.  A delicious bowl of melted cheese.  Enjoy!

P.S.  The service was also amazing with a very welcoming staff that were friendly and willing to explain the menu."}
{"text":"Third visit to Barroco Grill this weekend.  I've had the chicken arepa and empanadas in the past, and they were both delicious.   This time I had the barroco churrasco (steack w chimichurri, rice, fries).  It was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again just because there are more interesting things on the menu to try.  My husband got the chicken tostones, which were just incredible!  Sort of like nachos, but better.  My sister got the cheesy corn, which was really tasty, but too rich for an entree.  That one would definitely be better as an appetizer to share with others.

This place gets a lot of things right, in my opinion.  The food is good, and the prices are reasonable.  I like that it's BYOB with no fees, and that they have the menu online with prices.

I think next time I need to try the black bean soup."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!! I came here with friends for a casual Friday night dinner.  It was a hot night and their a/c was barely just working.  It didn't matter though because the service was friendly, the food was awesome and came out quickly.  For starters we had the empanadas, the guacamole and plantain chips and the cheesy corn dip( can't remover the name).  All was great-- a special call out to the empanadas and the cheesy corn dip-- scrumptious.  I had an arepa which was a real treat.  If you can stuff it in, their deserts are great also.  I will be back."}
{"text":"It is rare that I ever eat a meal somewhere and then think about it afterwards. For weeks. For months. But, Barroco won my food heart and I have been wanting to go back ever since that day when I discovered the most delicious beef short-ribs this side of the world has to offer. If anyone tries to argue with me about this, I will challenge them to an arm wrestling contest.

Situated in Monty's famous and overly touristy Old Port, Barroco is a gem among all the other restaurants serving up old school French cuisine in dimly lit, romance infused atmospheres. While I didn't go on a date here, unless you consider a birthday party with five other girls a date (well, actually I would), it is without a doubt a choice place to take your partner(s) in crime. The ambiance is relaxing, the smells are enticing, and the interior design is warm with wooden floors and stone walls. 

While I only ordered one magnificent dish, I got to taste five others and all were equally appealing, albeit pricey. So, if you fancy venturing into the Old Port, through the gauntlet of \"J'adore Montreal\" T-shirt shops and into Barroco, be prepared to bring your piggy bank filled with your monthly allowance. But, do yourself and your hot date a favour and remember this if nothing else: you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected (well, ok, kinda expected based on high reviews) treat and I am so glad I came!

Derek and I stopped in for an impromptu \"date lunch\" yesterday. We were in that very rare but coveted place in time where our daughter was at daycare but we both happened to be home because we were preparing to go out of town. So we decided to give this place a try because a) I had heard great things, and b) it seemed unassuming, fairly expedient, and low-maintenance (three things we were looking for out of our lunch yesterday).

When we saw the small interior and \"takeout' atmosphere, we thought, wrongly so, that we would have to place our order at the counter and bring it to a table. Nope! A really friendly guy came right over to us and asked if we were dining in, then offered us any available table. He came right over, went over the menu when we told him we were first-timers, and then quickly brought our drinks as we looked things over and decided what to order.

It was not an easy decision! But I went with the chicken arepa with regular seasoned fries, and my husband had the chorizo arepa with arepa fries. We decided not to get the cheesy corn, which I'm a little sad about, but as soon as all the food was brought to the table I realized there would have been no room for the cheesy corn (on the table or inside of us).

Everything was hot and wonderful. There was another very pleasant and cheerful waitress who brought us a variety of sauces and explained each one. I was a big fan of the ranchero, garlic, and the chimmichuri until I tasted the pineapple sauce. From that moment on, pineapple went on EVERYTHING. It was a big surprise because I don't usually go for pineapple with hot stuff (blame a particularly violent case of Montezuma's Revenge from eating a Hawaiian Pizza in Mexico). I tried not to finish everything .... it didn't work.

The fries were only ok. But the arepa is what stood out. The all-white corn tortilla was sturdy, crispy, and a welcome reprieve from either regular thin tortillas or regular bread. It was a great experience. Next time we come back, we're going to share an arepa and the cheesy corn. (Although I'd really be interested to try the empanadas as well...)

Note: to me, it wasn't a great place for kids because it was a bit cramped in there. However, they were friendly toward a couple who came in with a two-year old and they brought out a highchair for her. So, it is an option for those of you who are debating it."}
{"text":"Several years ago on a visit to Montreal we stopped in for a drink before dinner elsewhere. Wow, were we missing out!  We had dinner here this week, and here's a short list of what was perfect:
- Cozy, romantic atmosphere, candles and beautiful stone walls, but laid back with appropriate 60s rock-n-roll and humorous plates on the wall
- Service was extremely personable (both maitre d and our server), attentive, and helpful with recommendations
- Food was amazing...  short ribs, corniness hen, and squid on toast appetizer were incredible
I couldn't possibly think of any suggestions for improvement."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Barroco 3 times so far. The first 2 times my husband and I ordered the same thing: he: Pork Arepas and I: Ropa Vieja Arepa. They were both very flavorful and delicious. The sauces that they provide are phenomenal. 

On our last visit we decided to try other meals. He got the Hawaiian Arepa and I wanted to try the Arepa Puerca and Cheesy Corn. While my husband likes pineapple, he didn't really care for his Arepa. I wanted to try the Arepa Puerca because it has the chicharron. My chicharron was very chewy, so much that I couldn't eat it. The Cheesy Corn appetizer was good but even for a Cheese lover like myself it was really cheesy. 

Although we didn't have such a spectacular dining experience this last time around, I wouldn't stop from going back. Our first 2 meals were great and that's what I will have next time."}
{"text":"2 Words: Chimichurri Sauce! 
Holy moly I wish I had endless bottles of this stuff!

I have loved this place since it first opened! I only go to the Lakewood location and I am so happy that they have been successful enough to make the place larger as well as open a second location! 

The food here is Bomb Diggity! I have no words to describe how in love I am with the food. No matter how many times I visit each dish I order is as good as the next!

If you have never been...Shame on You! Get in your car and go now!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and atmosphere eclectic!   A MUST DO!  Our waitress was on top of everything,  offering great suggestions."}
{"text":"They let kids draw on the walls. They're BYOB for the next two months. Food is made from scratch. Portions are filling."}
{"text":"Came here on my way to the northeast after working a contract job in the Midwest region. Was craving Latin food so I came upon this place because of its ratings. Got the chicken skewers along with a natural juice to drink which was the Maracuya (Passion fruit). The juice was delicious and had a great presentation to it. The Chicken Skewers were grilled to perfection and very satisfying as I did not feel very full when I was done eating the dish. Excellent service as well as the waitress was very attentive and checked on me every once in awhile. This restaurant had a great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Barroco is such a filling and delicious treat! The atmosphere and decor are all great. Everyone is calm, even when they're busy and the staff really knows how to handle customers. (Particularly indecisive ones such as myself.) 

The cheesy corn is a must try. Seriously. So. Much. Cheese. If you like cheese, don't go to Melt to satisfy a cheese craving. Head to Barroco and eat a bowl of cheese dotted with little pops of sweet corn kernels. You'll never forget how delicious this dip is. 

The empanadas are fantastic and though you'll probably be full from cheesy corn, they are so worth the scarfing and stuffing. They are full of flavor and a good hearty choice.  

The sauces are to die for. The pineapple is an interesting sweetness (paired with the chorizo arepa--so good), the garlic is super garlicky but worth the bad breath, the chimichurri sauce is my personal favorite (so light and flavorful!), ranchero is a perfect creaminess to the meat and potato in the empanadas. 

Finally, shrimp ceviche. OH MY GOSH. This stuff is flavorful, not too fishy and so delicious. It even tastes just as good the next day! If I could have this for a meal once a week, I'd be one happy girl. 

Go here hungry and ready for a great experience. You'll leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I had the cheesy corn and the Cuban sandwich and both were tasty. I will definitely take a trip back when back in the area. The prices were great and the place seemed laid back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The drinks are pretty good. They have nice happy hour drink specials. The Arepa Puerca was a little dry, but the empanadas were DELICIOUS! The Ropa Vieja Arepa was also DELICIOUS. I'm a fan of this place. I'm excited to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food. Family owned, and obvious throughout every part is thee experience. I will be back"}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place and it was absolutely worth the wait. For apps we did the empanadas and chorizo cheesy corn. The empanadas were fine, different from the puerto rican ones I have grown accustomed to. I wouldn't order them again unless I was in a large group. However, the cheesy corn is very original and unique and definitely not what I was expecting. It was like a cheese dip, with corn and chorizo in it. An absolute must have, every time I dine here. 

For entrees we did the ropa vieja and the bisteak. The ropa vieja was delicious, its going to be so hard for me not to order this every time I return. I took the plantain, topped it with the garlic aioli, added the meat and some of the spicy house made sauce on top and went to town. In one word, incredible. The bisteak was not what I was expecting either. Instead of little steak medallions, we received a huge, tender, cooked medium, 12 oz steak. Seasoned or marinated to perfection and grilled just how I like. This was a great steak and if you go with this it will not disappoint. Great concept and even better food."}
{"text":"Not a fan.

The paella was not very good. It was wet and overly salted. It needed more saffron or other spices.

They made us come at 6 - early - but didn't even take our wine order until 6.45 and we didn't get our wine until 7.15. It was unreal. The place was basically empty at 7, so I have no clue why they insisted we come at 6. The service was borderline humorous, but if I wasn't on vacation I probably would have gone insane or just left. 

Also felt very touristy and didn't seem like there were many locals there. Maybe just my impression, but we really didn't like this place."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The food was great and the staff was very pleasant. I really enjoyed the variety of sauces. They had resonable prices and very artistic decor. Great addition to Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Omg I've been wanting to go to this place for years now and finally got to go. I absolutely love the eccentric decor and the open back covered heated patio was filled to the brim. It is a small place so you'll probably have to wait for a table on the weekend and you'll have to stand in the waiting area because there's really no bar but they did allow us to order drinks and brought them out to us. Now to the best part THE FOOD. We split the chicken corn queso and each got arepas that are plentiful with so much flavor. They also have sauces at the table to add to your dishes. I need to go back at least 10 times to try so many different things.  You just can't get Columbian/Latin inspired food anywhere else around here. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I were to rate this place on the food alone it would get 5 stars.  The service, however, was much slower than acceptable, and would have gotten 2-3 stars.  So I'm averaging out the total and giving Barroco 4.

The first thing we noticed when we sat down was the extremely impressive drink menu.  This place specializes in mixed drinks and their bartenders do an excellent job.  I was also surprisingly impressed with the bread provided before the meal.  This was one of the best breads I've ever had.  If it isn't homemade, I want to find out where they get it.  For my entree I ordered the daily special which I sadly can't remember the specifics of (shame on me, this is what I get for waiting so long to write the review) but I believe it was salmon and it was awesome.

Overall, I would like to come back here but I would likely go with a group of no more than 3 and I would plan on sitting at the bar.  I would enjoy this place more if I had plenty of time to sample the mixed drinks and wasn't in any rush.  Unfortunately this time we were not prepared to make this a late night, and it turned into one due to the slow service."}
{"text":"We were visiting for Formula One weekend and remembered this tiny place from our last visit to Montreal where the short ribs were to die for! Definitely, check this place out - great ambience. They had a special menu with outdoor charcoal for the weekend and my honey enjoyed the seabass and we shared the seafood platter as an appetizer. I had the spring salad as my main dish and it was incredible. Our server Adrian was fantastic and the sommelier recommended the most delicious glass of champagne. Our visit was very special with a window seat to watch the action on the street. The staff obviously love working here, the meals are prepared with so care and the service is fabulous. Highly recommending."}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service!!!! We had the cheesy corn as an appetizer and delicious arepas for dinner, it was one of the best meals we've ever had! Plus their homemade sauces are incredible! You need to try this place, it's now one of our all-time favorites in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed another great meal here, this time with co-workers.  It was a simply lunch...no appetizers or extras, just a bunch of arepas.  I chose a chicken version with a side of fried plantains.

The arepa was overflowing and served in a small wooden \"boat\" for a dish...good thing as it easily caught all of the sandwiches overflow which I dipped into the myriad of available sauces.  The plantains were sweet and slightly sticky from the caramelization process of cooking them.

Man, these bad boys are sooooo filling!  After lunch we were all in a food coma, but unfortunately we had to go back to work.  Nevermind that,  we will most certainly return for another adventure at this cool spot!"}
{"text":"Barroco is one of my very favorites!! I've been to this location 5 or 6 times. I love their arepas and house made guacamole. Also the fried plantain chips are to DIE for. 
They have a solid happy hour menu as well if you just want to stop by for a drink at the bar. 
They have live music often, and it's LOUD. Just make sure not to come here on a live music night if you're looking to converse intensely or relax! (Call ahead to find out)"}
{"text":"This place is a real treat! For those who can't eat gluten it has many options. The chips and guacamole were good. We tried the steak maduros and while good, it was a bit sweet so I would get tostones next time. The chicken arepa was out of this world! I will definitely be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"So although from a food and ambiance perspective we'd absolutely give this place 4 stars the $23 charge for a shot of patron is absolutely egregious. I can't even entertain this as a legitimate situation. We were absolutely stunned. Get that your liquor license came last week but catch a clue charging us over $100 for four shots is appalling and we'd absolutely buy a bottle without a problem for a fraction of the price. Get your act together and don't gauge people because you can that's disgusting."}
{"text":"Seriously!? Finding Vegan food let alone finding restaurants willing to accommodate vegans in Ohio is a pretty big challenge and also considering my wife is very skeptical of many restaurants that are veg friendly due to cross contamination. Barroco grill is more than accommodating when it comes to veganizing their menu. My wife and I had the vegan version of their  vegetarian arepas, guacamole and fried plantains, and another dish that was recommended to us by the lady that took our take out order (which was her favorite dish). I must say that when we got home to eat, the food was soo amazing and packed with amazing flavors! I cannot thank barroco grill enough for bringing such amazing flavors and food into our stomaches! Thank you to the lady that took our order and for the awesome recommendations! We'll be back to eat in very soon! Yummy!"}
{"text":"A small place on the Rue Saint Paul in Old Montreal. Busy even this chill April Tuesday evening. One can only imagine that in the tourist season it is packed.

For good reason. The service is warm and attentive. The charcuterie appetizer wonderfully presented and excellent, although for my taste the mustard mayo could have had a bit more bite. 

The rib steak was perfect, coated with a delicious chimichurra and unfettered with vegetables. A side of perfect smashed potatoes for form.

The wine a glass (or two) of a delicate and fresh Barbaresco. 

I have eaten here twice, once in the glow of a summer love, and tonight alone on a business trip. This establishment hits all the high points for either experience."}
{"text":"Food was ok... my husband and I went there, and it took foreverrrrrrrr for our food to come out... but.. the alcohol drinks are good and strong! If you wanna drink go there! And if you wanna eat don't go on a Friday or Saturday when it's super busy"}
{"text":"The best plantains in town! Great drinks, too. Easily one of the best places in Lakewood/Cleveland."}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews, but this place was too great!  When we arrived we were greeted with free tequila shots (after ID checks of course) and were seated almost immediately which is rare for a crowded place with a party of 5!  There was live music and the setting is so warm, welcoming, and unique.  The food lived up to the hype.  I got one of the arepas and it did not disappoint!  Thinking it could not get any better, paying was super simple.  You pay up front and it was so fast and easy.  I was already planning on returning ASAP and then I got a $5 coupon from them in my email.  I'm adding Barroco to my favorite Cleveland restaurants.  Loved every moment."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is by no means gourmet, and doesn't pretend to be.  However, they do their food and they do it well. I had the steak arepa, and the cheesy corn. My immediate thought was \"this is the best drunk food ever!\" the sauces were good, I like the cilantro based one and the spicy peanut one the best. Yes the spicy peanut is clearly Frank's Red Hot with a peanut twist, but it was tasty none the less. My suggestion is have a few cocktails and check this place out! They've obviously been successful, as their 2nd location will open soon in the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"A recommended restaurant by a couple friends, we stopped in to celebrate our wedding.  The cheese plate to start was excellent.  Our appetizer was a tender grilled octupus salad.  She had lobster in a flavorful curry sauce.  My rib eye steak with chimichurri sauce met expectations.  Wine list provides good variety.  The music beautifully accented the ambience."}
{"text":"Cool little joint.  I recommend sitting in the back.  The servers pool their tips so expect to encounter a few different waitstaff during your dining experience.  I opted for the Mazorcada and the boyfriend opted for the Chorizo arepa.  My Mazorcada was heavy-handed on garlic.  And wow, it's rich.  But good.  The Chorizo arepa was good.  The tortilla chips are nicely seasoned but dare I say not as good as the ones Antonio makes up the street at El Tango Taqueria.  The black bean soup was disappointing...tasted weird.  The house-made sauces are good.  By far I thought the spicy peanut sauce (which tasted nothing like peanut) was the best.  Lots of hot sauce in that baby.  BYOB."}
{"text":"I don't know of any other Columbian restaurants to compare them to, but I like the food.  Their sauces are excellent.  The atmosphere is casual and fun, the walls are completely covered in graffiti."}
{"text":"Whoever came up with the Cheesy Corn with arepa fries must have sold their soul or something. Just try it. Amazing.

Have only had one lackluster meal there out of many. Only reason I took a star off was because I feel like the price for an arepa has risen dramatically from the first time I went there four years ago. Pretty sure I was buying them for $8 back then? And you can still get them at other local spots under $10. Maybe they were always that much. Maybe I'm wrong.

Either way, their soda game is on point. Those taps are always calibrated just right."}
{"text":"You had me at arepas. Really. This place is always fun and delicious. Maybe I'm a sucker for food from Latin America, but there is nothing I love more than an arepa, some chorizo, and tostones! I also firmly believe that every Latin place should be loud and energetic. They are just that!"}
{"text":"The second time I came here was for my boyfriend's birthday.The food was great. We shared guacamole appetizers and had arepas (the Mexicano for me and the chicken chorizo for the boy, both delicious!) for dinner. We drenched all of our food in the dipping sauces provided. They're delicious!
But what was really outstanding was the service.  They accommodated a party of 11 very quickly. Our waitress was quick and helpful. She waited on our group with a smile on her face. I had briefly mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday when she asked why we had such a large party. 2 hours later, she brought out cake with a candle for him, with his name written on the plate. I couldn't believe she remembered.
The food is fantastic, but the service will definitely keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food portions were very large. Come hungry. I was full after my appetizer. The corn queso is amazing. The entree was so so. Nothing that I would come back for. Over all a decent restaurant, not somewhere I would go back to twice."}
{"text":"Visited recently.  Arepa and Yucca Fries were not as good as usual.  Someone said since the other location opened, they've been swapping cooks so food not as consistent.  Please keep quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Not a bad Brazilian cuisine food experience and a must try at least once.. Place is very small..parking is limited. But overall good.!!"}
{"text":"I now know it's possible to be in love with a restaurant. Barroco is my most favorite restaurant, ever! I live in the metro area of NYC, home of the best food in the world, and can't wait for my trips to Montreal with Barroco on my mind. I stumbled upon this restaurant a few summers ago, by luck, and I now await my return to Montreal each time with a salivating mouth and flutters in my heart. Not only do the cocktails have a unique spin, the food unquestionably delicious, the décor cozy, sexy, unique, intimate and chic, but the staff adds to the charm factor and experience. I have been to this restaurant on three difference occasions and each time, the staff perfects what other restaurants lack, which is personality and charm that adds to the whole experience. 

The short ribs are to die for and all appetizers and drinks are on the money. 

*I missed my reservation window and the restaurant still accommodated my party, an hour later. 

Thank you once again for the perfect dining experience! 

Love, Your biggest fan"}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything except the shrimp ceviche. I'm used to spicy and sour lime and cilantro and the one we got tasted like tiny store bought shrimp salad coated with sweet mayo. Def not a traditional dish. Id enjoyed the drinks a lot though!"}
{"text":"Crowded, tiny, and mediocre food. I had high hopes for this place. I'm hoping our food was just rushed since we went in on such a busy night. There was a band playing so all the tables were smashed together and the waiters were tripping over each other since their wasn't much room to move. 
I had the ceviche and it wasn't good. I wish we had been told this place was BYOB which would have made our experience  a little better."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience. Jermil at Intercontinental recommended this spot and was able to get us a reservation immediately when another reservation elsewhere had fallen through. We were not disappointed. Our server was very pleasant. We were seated and served promptly. The rib steak is AMAZING. The portions are extremely generous and I could not finish mine, although I wish I could. They make an excellent sabayon as well. The old stone walls and candle lit fireplace lend a nice ambience to the meal and the wine suggestions were spot on."}
{"text":"I can't find a complaint... That burger was bangin. I got the classic Barroco Burger"}
{"text":"the food is decent, i'll say that. But the service was atrocious! It was not a busy evening, and we had way too many things go wrong. We ordered a white and a red sangria- waitress messed that up. We asked for water 3 times before we got ONE.The waitress came to us after 30 minutes and said she was sorry but the kitchen was busy and was just now preparing our food. After another 30 minutes we finally got our food but my food order was not what i ordered.  When i told the waitress she said it was her fault that she put the order in wrong and would bring me the correct side- which i had to remind her of twice. She finally brought me my correct side but i was done eating. We had to beg for a to go box and the whole experience was subpar- even attrocious having to beg for service like we did."}
{"text":"First time eating Colombian food.  The arepas were delicious and the cheesy corn is wonderful!  Better yet, the server was enthusiastic and spent time with us discussing the food and teaching us how it is eaten in Colombia.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Barroco is famous for their arepas which is a corn mass pressed into a tortilla-like pita pocket. They're pretty alright with a bunch of entrée options for meat eaters and vegetarians alike which is always a plus. Although I feel like the best plate to get is on the appetizer menu. It's this massive tostones (fried plantains) platter that can be easily shared with 4 people, if not more. With a bunch of fresh tostones in the middle, around them are many different options to coat them in-- beans, different types of meat, and also the array of sauces with a thousand combinations to try. Great for hangs with the family or friends, has an artistic vibe with writing and painting on the walls-- so don't forget a pen!"}
{"text":"Barroco is my go-to spot for any special occasion or whenever I just want a good meal with an upbeat, trendy atmosphere. Everything about this place is amazing - the drinks, the milkshakes, the arepas, the entrees, the service, the free tequila shots - all of it is A++! I have never frequented a restaurant with such consistent quality of every dining element. 

Every staff member here is friendly and helpful. They know the menu extremely well, and offer some amazing suggestions. For example, we wanted to get a pitcher but weren't sure what to get. The waitress recommended the mojito pitcher, so we went with it even though it was everyone's last choice. We ended up making the right choice, however, and it was quite possibly the best drink pitcher I have ordered anywhere. It was a very balanced drink, as it wasn't too sugary or too minty. I highly recommend! 

I always order the house beer - it's basically a beer sangria and I live for it. 

My go-to favorites are the carne asada (oh my gosh - so tender and a hugeee potion!) and the ropa vieja (both entree and arepa are fantastic). The boyfriend always orders the churrasco, which melts in your mouth beautifully! I recently came here with a large group who had never visited, and they were all RAVING about their choices! I am obsessed with the arepa tortillas; they have such a unique consistency and flavor that make them super addicting. The yuzu fries are also a must!

I will have to say - one of the best parts of the Barroco experience is the sauce. The green and red sauce (forgive me - I don't want to butcher the names) are incredibly tasty. If it was acceptable, I would order a to-go box and fill it with only green sauce. Wow. 

During the last visit, there was a live band playing. I usually hate live bands, but the music was really good and half the restaurant was dancing which made the experience so much more fun than anticipated! The only problem I have is that my friend accidentally pulled into the alleyway looking for parking and a guy in the band yelled at her and made her cry. But what can you do??"}
{"text":"Small, local place with excellent food. Their specialty is arepas, which I can best describe as more of a gyro than a taco. It is a thick, homemade, white corn tortilla cut down the middle and stuffed with filling. I had the Arepa Puerca, which was generously filled with chicken, beans, and mozzarella. One of my favorite things here was the sauces that they have to put on both arepas and chips. You are given a tray with 5 bottles filled with sauce, spicy peanut, pineapple, ranchero, chimmichurri, and my personal favorite, a creamy garlic aioli. The atmosphere was very cozy, with a man playing guitar consistently for the whole time we were there on a Saturday night, almost two hours! I thought the drinks were good, but a little pricey. I thought the arepas were also a bit pricey for \"sandwiches\" but were also very good, so I feel they are worth it. The negative here for me was the service. Our server was stopping over almost incessantly before we ordered, and hardly at all after we ordered, taking quite a while before we received our check. Being my first and only time here, I would not yet hold the service against the restaurant, as it was only one instance. This is definitely a place I would recommend for anyone to experience some of their special Arepas."}
{"text":"First time there, totally amaze-balls. I had the chorizo madura and it was excellent. The patio was awesome and the staff was really friendly. Highly recommended, I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place! The food is phenomenal and the service is what keeps me coming back again and again! Every time I come in here they greet me like an old friend! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone!! Definitely one of the best restaurants in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype, this place is really good. (Bonus: their arepas are gluten free).  Great decor, small back patio, amazing menu (BYOB fyi), and talented servers who leave you alone to enjoy your meal instead of rushing you through."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying that we've been to the Lakewood location and loved it. Second, the menu says \"Be patient, it's worth it\" or somewhere along those lines and I can understand so this has nothing to do with not having patience. 

We came in tonight and it was four of us that arrived and we were seated right away so no problem there. The problem started when we sat around waiting for our server who never came. Meanwhile we sat and watched while others came in and were greeted by their server with waters and a smile(our server included). The manager eventually came over to ask if we'd been helped (I'm assuming he saw us looking around) and took our appetizer order.

The server eventually came around with tortilla chips and said to enjoy while we wait and mentioned that she knew someone else had already taken our appetizer order. Never introduced herself and didn't even say hi so I can't even tell you who our server was. We watched while she took tortilla chips and a variety of sauces to other tables and explained the different sauces. Meanwhile we sat wondering what we were supposed to enjoy our tortilla chips with. I finally asked her if she could bring the sauces and she did and explained the different sauces. Why we had to ask rather than her do it like she did at the other tables...I don't understand. 

She came over and asked for our order and we asked a few questions about the menu. I'll give her points for describing the menu well but that's about it. Three of us ordered arepas and the fourth ordered the fajitas. I wish I could review the food but the service was so sad at this point that we were just ready to leave by the time the food arrived. She never really checked on us while we ate but she did fill our waters.

As much as I would like to have enjoyed this place and come back...I just can't. It was extremely disheartening to watch everyone around us get the service they should while we didn't. I don't want to be the person to make it about appearance but we obviously didn't look like their usual crowd (or at least the crowd that was around that night) and to watch the way our server interacted with everyone else and compare it to the way she served us was just...sad. The restaurant has extremely good reviews so they must be doing something right...unfortunately, we did not get the experience others have."}
{"text":"Really good food, and environment. I went for dinner with my fiance and our food came out maybe only 5 mins after we ordered. Different type of cuisine I would definitely recommend trying! They use to let you bring in your own wine/beer but I think they just got their liquor license so they don't do that anymore."}
{"text":"The very best beef short ribs I have ever eaten.
Quite with a great vibe.
Staff was very helpful as some of the menu was not in english.
I was in the city for 4 days and ate here twice.
Good wine list and the bar was comfortable to eat at and hang out and meet locals.

I would pass through Montreal just to have dinner at Barroco."}
{"text":"The place is FABULOUS! It is small, maybe 12-14 tables total so it would probably be best to have a reservation. On nice evenings the front window opens up for a nice view onto the street. Great service. Our server was extremely attentive.

I had 2 drinks. The peach bellini which was so much better than your average bellini. I really wanted to order another, but I also wanted to try another drink from the menu - which by the way is very cute and built into the front of an old book. The other drink was the blueberry beret, a gin based cocktail. Also really good and I'm not a huge gin fan.

Dinner was impeccable. We had a couple of oysters and the local noyan cheeses to start. For dinner I choose the beef shortribs and I suggest you do the same. Best shortribs I have ever had! Skipped dessert but there were a couple of things that caught my eye, one being a goat cheese cheesecake.

This is a must when visiting Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Loved dinner at Barroco!  The food was delicious and the service was very good.  Had the Taste of Summer salad and the fish.  The restaurant is right on Saint Paul West (not East) in Old Town.  Perfect area to have dinner.  Would highly recommend Barroco."}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth time coming to Barroco Grill and I keep wondering why I don't come here more! I had originally planned on going to Chipotle but the line was wrapped around like three times. Then the lightbulb went off and Barroco was in my head. 

The food is so fresh and the homemade arepas make this place worth the money. For what I get at Chipotle I would have paid around $11, and I paid $12 here for fresh, authentic food. I really need to stop forgetting about this place!"}
{"text":"The best meal I had in Montreal! I highly recommend it. Lovely ambience and fun decor. Tasty beautiful food. Very romantic vibe. I had the lobster carbonara as my main course...divine. My friend is picky but got the steak and it was perfectly cooked and well seasoned with a mushroom gravy. For apps we had the oysters and luscious burrata. I had a great cocktail and then wine with dinner. The waiter recommended a Pinot noir to go with my entree. Overall, terrific experience! Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"So good!
We had the guacamole with plantains to start, and ended up too full to finish our arepas.
They have a variety of sauces, which is fun. Had to get to go boxes! Also, BYOB which is awesome as well. 
Our server was very nice and explained the menu items, making sure to answer any questions we had. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another one of Lakewood's culinary best!  You have not savored the flavor of Hispanic food made fresh from the best Latino chefs around!  Moderately priced and wow the food is great!  Has a great atmosphere and family oriented.  Service is great and when I ordered Plantanos Fritas con Camarones I thought I was back in Puerto Rico!  One of the best Latino restaurants around!   Just luv it!"}
{"text":"This place was packed for a Wed. evening which was a good sign. Drinks and food were outstanding. The only negative was that it was a little loud in the main area but there was so much laughter and discussion which is from the great atmosphere.

If you're hangry, then try the empanadas columbianas for an appetizer but its too much food for just one! Experiment with the various sauces. We had bandeja palsa which has a lot of meat. Very good and heavy meal so plan for a walk or nap after!

Margaritas were tasty but the caipirinha brazilera blow's them all away. Can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Barroco several times and have always had a good, but different, experience. The first time we went we ordered our meals at the front counter took our meals to a table and enjoyed. The second trip, we ordered at the counter and they brought the food to us. The third, we sat down immediately and were served by an extremely friendly waitress.

I have always stuck to the areapas- they are always amazing and very filling. My favorite arepa is the chorizo, you will never be disappointed with the chorizo arepa! My boyfriend has tried something new every time, he has always enjoyed his meals, one being the Shrimp Ceviche. Make sure to try out the different sauces, there are 6 different flavors and all are very good.

I really like the decor, lots of bright colors and artwork all over the walls.  The restaurant is small but we have never had a problem getting a seat. The service is always great as well-everyone is SO nice and attentive. I am a huge fan of Barroco!"}
{"text":"Ceviche app was magnificent and also a huge portion!!  Vibe is perfectly Latin (inclusive, loose, comfy, and polite).  All dinners and drinks were delicious and nicely balanced. Super nice and informative server. Comfortable seating. Live music not too loud but also peppy and fun. Love this place and wish it was in my hometown!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is very fun and entertaining. At 6 two elderly gentleman got on the stage and started to play surprisingly good Spanish/Latin guitar songs. 

Happy hour here is a pretty good deal. We had empanadas. They are super fried and super good. Come out hot and crispy. Not flaky like a lot of other empanadas. I loved eating them but hated myself for doing so. 

This place specializes in arepas, so obviously, we did not get any. Instead we had one order of the soup and also two of their special hot dogs.

The soup had a mild flavor. My fiancé who does not like strong flavors because she's a terrible person, loved it. She did say that she had to pick out some gristle from her chicken. That's how you know it's authentic though right?

The hot dogs were so good! Totally worth it too. 8 bucks for two loaded hot dogs is an insane value. It was an unreasonable amount of both meat and deliciousness packed in between those buns. I have to maybe eat a salad tommorow to make amends to my body. 

Waters were kept full and didn't have to wait long for ordering or food to get to the table. 

I'm not sure what to do next time I come back. Actually try the arepas or get more hot dogs. Life is hard."}
{"text":"We went to barroco on a Monday afternoon just after lunch time. The inside appeared to be welcoming and comfortable... that is, until we sat down. The chairs in this restaurant are the most sadistic and poorly designed pieces of furniture my rear end and back have ever had the displeasure of meeting. That being said, I was willing to forgive after trying the food. We started out with some great guacamole accompanied by what I could only describe as a plantain pancake. I ordered the arepa peurca with chicken, fried chicharrones, chorizo beans and cheese. I really liked how all the flavors work together and I added some of the peanut sauce they had at the table which was a little spicy but tasty. My only complaints other than that wretched chair is that we sat waiting for our server to appear again after bringing our drinks, but they were fairly attentive after that. Additionally, I wouldn't recommend the tacos as they're not what you would traditionally expect, and most people don't enjoy breaking their teeth on crunchy foods. Basically, it's an exceptional restaurant that would really benefit from a new set of chairs."}
{"text":"Barroco Grill is the real deal! I love this place. Not like the one in downtown, reminds me of metro-Chipotle. 

My favorite thing ever is the Cheesy Corn. After that, the Tostadas Con Todo, Arepas, Empanadas Colombianas, and the strawberry soda. Try any of the dishes with their special homemade sauces. I always end up taking leftovers home."}
{"text":"went here last week with an area friend while in town and it was BANGIN' as they say. The cheesy corn is a ridiculous dish, in multiple ways. It's a gravy boat full of cheese corn, some chilis, I dunno what else served with fries. It is more delicious than it has any right to be. The Veggie Arepa was enhanced quite well with a few scoops of melted cheesy corn, I'd eat this all the time if this place wasn't 640 miles away."}
{"text":"Best guacamole I've ever had.  I could eat buckets of this stuff.

I wish they had more vegetarian options.  I don't really care for the arepas, I find them a bit bland but as long as they keep making that guac, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ate there on Saturday, place is small but really nice. Food was great with certain things but I would avoid the arctic char."}
{"text":"Five stars for this place, and I don't give out stars like they're candy on Halloween night (whoops just remembered I don't participate anyway). I think this place has a real genuine vibe. BUT, there was a mural guy staring art me the whole time and i think he even called me an a**h*** WITH HIS EYES. No clue what his problem was? As it turns out my date was smitten by this because its her favorite word to use. Not to mention, turns out she had an extensive history with the guy. There was a banjo player there too, I didn't ask her if he knew him.

Anywayyyyyyyyy, the arepas were muy delicioso ;) I couldn't get enough! I kind of thought they looked like hot pockets but a warmer version since they were cooked on a grill! Side note: this would be a great reason to have a grill (again, to cook arepas). We had really high quality service and the meal was thoroughly enjoyed. My date only called me an a**h*** three times so it was really a great night! Best part, no hands down, were the mints received after paying the check, i think this is their reward system for paying the bill. Thanks for the laughs (and the arepas and the tostines and the wine and the unlimited water (and the mints))!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but gets pricey fast!

The food and drinks are very very good, but if you're getting everything you like, you may be shocked at the bill. The sampler appetizer itself is 35 dollars, and although it's delicious it is a little overpriced, especially for birdtown. 
For two entrees, a split appetizer and a couple drinks our bill was over $100 for 2 people. 

That being said, I would come again, and the live music was amazing. Alfonzo is amazing on the guitar."}
{"text":"This is a great date night place to check out.  If you go, make sure it's on a night when they have live music.  They have a Latin guitarist that plays on certain nights and it provides great ambiance.  The drinks are amazing, I've had the piña colada and the Paloma.  If you go, try the empanada appetizer, I would go for that alone because they are the best I've ever had.  For dinner I had the steak, rice and beans and tostones.  I make all three of these at home and of course everyone loves their own versions, but their food is right up there with what I'm used to.  You will feel like you're on a little tropical vacation and forget that you're in Lakewood.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the ropa vieja and chicken tostones, along with the cheesy corn as a starter. Cheesy corn was delicious, and the arepas served with the dish were crispy. Unfortunately, the main dishes didn't live up to expectations. The shredded beef had an unusual texture, while the chicken in my main dish was overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is different, but perfect. Dining in, the restaurant is so intimate and unique. Service was fantastic on a few occasions. The biggest flaw in my experiences would be from ordering carry-out, in which the workers seemed a little less personable. Maybe they were busy, or maybe the cashier was having a bad day. Either way, I can't ever wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not only was the ambiance super cool, food was awesome. The place was recommended by the concierge at the Ritz who said this was a great spot for cocktails/food and frequented by locals. It also had a sister restaurant next door which has a more French menu while this place is more of a Spanish/French menu. 

The interior stone walls with Spanish art and wood beam ceilings were cool. We sat near the window where we could see passerbys in the Old Town area. The bar was packed with what looked to be locals who just got off of work enjoying drinks with friends. 

The handcrafted cocktails took awhile to prepare but well worth the wait. The book of cocktails had its own interesting character. My colleague and I started with an assortment of appetizers including foie gras, beef tartare, and oysters. All were delicious. For my main entree, I ordered the blackened cod which was prepared very well. 

Love this place. Hope to try the sister restaurant on my next visit to this cool city."}
{"text":"So when I read Yelp reviews I always take the three stars and below ones into consideration.  When I read the reviews for Barroco I thought maybe it will be overrated and those few not so good reviews will be right.  They were wrong.  

This place was spectacular.  We went on a Sunday afternoon so there was no crowd.  The food was unlike anything I've ever had in the Cleveland area before.  It was a tough choice between corn dip that everyone raved about and the plantains for an appetizer.  We opted for the Plantains with Guacamole and were so glad we did.  It was by far one of the best Guacamole's we've ever had and the plantains were delicious.  The sauces they give you just add to the flavor.  

Yes, the main entrees are basically sandwiches, however, not like anything you can get anywhere else.  Several different to choose from all of which looked wonderful.  The two we had were delicious and well worth the cost.  

Service was quick, efficient and friendly.  Small place but a very cool atmosphere, uniquely decorated and just something different.  I highly recommend this place, it lives up to the hype and whatever the price it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"At 12:30, Barroco was busy, but not too busy. We could see that Barroco was clearly a popular lunch spot, but not too popular, as we were able to sit at the last table for 2 on the enclosed back patio next to a space heater. Our hungry grew with the savory aromas of spices and excellently prepared food as we awaited our lunch with eager anticipation. To start, we ordered the the Bacon Wrapped Maduritos as an appetizer and they were fabulous. All of the appetizers looked fabulous. I wanted them all. The Maduritos came out with crisp bacon sweet cooked plantain, drizzled in a special sauce and cheese. The waitress brought us Barroco's different salsas but I never tried them because everything I ordered was so well flavored. All of the food came out perfect the way it was. However, my husband tried the salsas and liked them, especially the chimichurri. Since this is an Arepas restaurant, of course we ordered the Arepas. I ordered the Mexican Arepa, which was slightly spicy with jalepeños. All Arepas come with a side. I ordered a side of black beans. My husband ordered a side of plantain chips and I could seriously snack on these plantain chips all day long. Each Arepa is a meal in and of itself, with ingredients such as Chorizo, Chicharron, Chicken, Avocado, Mozzarella etc... wrapped traditional Colombian \"tortilla\". There are a wide variety of Arepas to order, from Latin American inspired flavors to more \"Cleveland\" inspired. If an Arepa is not your cup of tea, there are many other things to order from salads to steaks to even pasta for the very picky. But why would you order pasta at a Colombian restaurant? Overall, Barroco is a Cleveland gem. I'm looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's hard to get in and there is no close parking but the food is great! It comes out fast and fresh! I am only giving 4 stars because there are not many modifications you can make on the food."}
{"text":"Set in an Old Montreal rustic stone and wood building, this eclectic decorated restaurant is sure to impress. We were six for dinner in the white banquet seating area. 

Some of us ordered wine by the glass, others ordered some tasty beer from a micro-brewerie, my friend opted for the homemade gin tonic and I ventured to order a good ol' mint julep. Interestingly enough the refreshing julep was served in manly Maker's MArk tin cup with a mini-mountain of hand crushed ice. 

As for the food, well let me tell you... Chef Benjamin Leonard (originally from Lyon) really outdid himself with his Mediterranean inspirations.  We ordered the Seafood Paella which was a treasure of flavors. The scallops were rich, melted in your mouth and cooked to perfection. The beef short ribs were very savory and very tasty. The half lobster was as sublime both to the eye and the palate. Definitely would consider going back."}
{"text":"First came here back in February and have returned several times.  Great food and good value, not the standard fare of the chains.  Black bean soup, arrepas, empanadas, Cuban sandwich, tostones...  Small menu, but it's all great eating.  Service staff is attentive and welcoming, willing to talk at length about the cuisine and their great selection of dipping and dripping sauces."}
{"text":"Barroco - is one of my Top Favorites in Cleveland area!!! If you come to Cleveland just for one day, please stop by here to eat! 

Every time I go here, I enjoy everything: music, atmosphere, appetizers, and main dinner! Their sauces they give you with the meal are out of this World!!!

Bistec a Caballo is the dinner I could eat every week. Their arepas are delicious as well! 

Now I am hungry just writing about it :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the prices keep going up, the wait time keeps getting longer, and the service has consistently been unpredictable. The food is great, but with the wait and the constant price increases, it's no longer one of our favorite restaurants. Also, don't waste your time on their mix drinks. They are pure sugar with very little booze."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very friendly and efficient staff, delicious food. Slightly on the expensive end, but it worths."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and have always had a wonderful time. I had seen all of the great reviews and was very excited to finally try it.  

The first time, we got the food to go but picked it up. Park on the street, for one. There is lots of parking in that area.  The decor is cute.  It's a small but inviting space.  Staff was very nice and happy to explain our options for sauces, etc. Our food was ready in 10 minutes from when we called - they were also pretty slow because it was a weeknight.. but still! 

I have gone back many times with friends and loved everything. I always get the veggie arepa with pineapple and jalapeno. My friends have gotten other arepas and entrees and been very happy every time!  The sauces are all awesome - especially the chimichuri and peanut ones!  Fresh chips, delicious fries and some of the best black bean soup I have ever had! 

Also, there's a cheesy corn dip that's awesome and comes in a vegetarian version with mushroom and pepper. I love it! 

The arepas are big enough that I sometimes only eat half and reheat the rest in the oven later. I can sometimes finish one if I'm very hungry! 

Last tip, it's BYOB and they're very accommodating to that. They'll keep your beer in the fridge if you want! 

This is one of my favorite places in Lakewood and I recommend it to people constantly. Love it so much!"}
{"text":"Never a let down here. Authentic Columbian food in a fun festive environment and BYOB. Hardly can this be beat. Don't let the oddness of Lakewood's bird town fool you, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour.   3-6pm Monday-Friday they have half off apps and $5 cocktails.   The plantains are perfection.   Cute dog friendly patio out back. Some entrees can range from 12-25 dollar, however the food is authentic."}
{"text":"I came in to get a quick bite to eat, and ended up finding more than just a sandwich shop. Unbelievable arepas. I had never had one nor had heard of them, but well worth a try. Also the side sauces are great."}
{"text":"So I have been wanting to go to this place forever. I can never make time. I live closer to the Lakewood one but this location wasn't too far either. Parking on street wasn't hard to find. The neighborhood is a solid 7/10 to walk around evening time.

The place is just it's completely beautiful. We shared apps and Arepas. The arepas I've been wanting to try. I like the Corn quesadillas at Tapatias  on Lorain, this is a similar texture like a little crunchy sandwich very good. It maintained its texture and didn't get soggy, which is my pet peeve. I'm all about texture. The drinks, we did the $5 margaritas. At first I was disappointed bc there's only one option and it's not flavored. I don't like the plain lime ones.

Well I was totally wrong. No need for extra flavors this was good on its own.

Lovely server very attentive even though the patio was a madhouse probably partly bc of the yelp event. She was still on it. Five stars for her alone. I actually double tipped her lmao

Will return! So should you!!"}
{"text":"The Colombian food is amazing, plenty of options to choose from.  We had an amazing appetizer, it was one of the dips.  Plenty of tasty entrees to choose from, as well as multiple options for the side including french fries, black bean soup, tortilla chips, and more.  Overall great experience!  Highly recommended the service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Ambience and decor  was beautiful with all the Spanish paintings. Service was great. Menu is a little pricey though."}
{"text":"One of Lakewood's best. Love all of the plantain dishes and arepas. Food, service, atmosphere all wonderful. My only issue is that the seating is tight. We were seated near some hanging beads that kept hitting the back of our chair, which was annoying, and couldn't move because it was so crowded. I'll still give it 5 stars because it's that great!"}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere.  Will definitely go back.  The guacamole is fantastic in my book.  I never had a plantain before but now I will get them every rim very yummy.  Side note the Colombian Apple side was also very good."}
{"text":"Fun friendly spot. Huge menu. Felt like I had left the country. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad thing yet.
Maduras con queso? Fantastic and so unique.
Guacamole? Probably the best I've ever had and serving it with plantain chips is also a great idea. Just wish there was more of it!
I've tried several arepas, all great. 
The sauces here are probably the icing on the cake, though.  They have spicy stuff and garlicky stuff but really, just the pineapple puree sauce adds such great contrast to so many things (I love it on the sandwiches and the fries).
The black bean soup is awesome, and I really am not a fan of beans so that is saying something.
Really, I can't find an issue with it besides every once and awhile I might wanna go there at 1 or 2am and they sadly close at 11pm, but hey, can't have it all."}
{"text":"When traveling, I normally ask friends for suggestions on where to go, what to see and where to eat... this was one of those places and boy was I happy for the recommendation. My suggestion; go there hungry!

The food portions are superb. The steak was cooked to perfection (with alot of it on the slab) and the mashed potatoes I still dream about. I also had Oysters to start.

The atmosphere is pretty amazing.. It's like walking into an old french wine cellar. low lighting makes it great for dates or for nights when you don't feel you look your best.

The service was SUPERB. The guys were so welcoming and were incredibly helpful when we couldn't decide what to order. 

The price is a bit steep but well worth treating yourself. You will feel at home and will be stuffed to the brim.

Bon Appetit."}
{"text":"Loved loved their playlist very eclectic music. Though I loved the playlist the volume was a little high which I didn't mind but some might. So the restaurant is loud. It is also a bit warm which is unusual for a restaurant. Loved the house salad, short ribs and the mushrooms. My partner had the special which was very good 
The only negative would be the service which was hurried quite rushed not attentive and with that slooow. I do think the poor service was server specific as other tables had quite good service. 
So to summarize great music great food subpar service. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"WOOOOW Ce petit restaurant est vraiment une superbe decouverte et s'affiche maintenant dans mon top 10 des endroits ou manger à mtl ! Le service etait sur la coche, mais honnetement ce qui vole la vedette cest la paella maison ! Vous DEVEZ absolument la tester et je vous promet que vous ne serez pas deçu ! 

En passant reservé votre table meme si c'est en debut de semaine ! Le retaurant est tres en demande !"}
{"text":"This BYOB latin, \"street food\" inspired restaurant is a gem.  The arepas are delicious but don't overlook the empanadas - they are wonderful!  The best part of Barrocco are their homemade sauces that accompany every meal... they are fantastic (especially for dipping fries in)... don't forget that you can take some home with you in your \"doggie bag\"

The interior is funky, the servers friendly and the food is quick."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying my favourite steak in Montreal is at Gibby's. With that said, this is a pretty close second. 

The ambiance was rustic with loud music that fit my genre. The space is dimly light which is far better suited for a romantic dinner but my friend and I had no problem enjoying the evening. The service was friendly and the sommelier picked a perfect wine for the meal. Only \"issue\" was the long delay for the bill.

The meal was excellent. Tomato and Burrata tartelette to start. We didn't know what to think of it because the flavours were interesting in a good way. I believe we concluded we liked it. 

The mains were rib steak and paella. Rib steak rivalled Gibby's. Absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. Paella was good. Never had paella before but it reminded me of a jumbalaya as the rice was soft which I was t sure if it was supposed to be crispy. 

Too full for dessert, which is ashame because the goat cheese cake would have been my choice. 

For all of Montreal's wonderful restaurants I really enjoyed this one. Well worth it."}
{"text":"So this review is only for drinks and apps, but I loved this place so much in the hour we were here that I cannot wait to go back.
We had dinner reservations at another place nearby and wanted to grab a drink before, so we stopped here.  One of the very few places that I've been without a bar, but the helpful staff was able to get us seated a table on the patio right away.  There was a live musician playing as well which was great.
I ordered a pina colada and my hubs got a margarita.  We also ordered the guacamole- everything came out pretty quickly.  We loved the plantain \"chips\" that came with the guac. They weren't really chips like other places I've been, but more like fritters or something else.  While we there, we saw several parties getting pitchers of mojitos and the other food looked fantastic. We can't wait to come back with friends and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place amazing! The arepas are just something one must try (multiple) times in their life. The staff is courteous and friendly. You really can't beat the BYOB! The sauces to choose from never disappoint. I love dipping my fries in them! You can definitely taste the Columbian flavor in every bite. The cook's take pride in what they produce and Barroco is a MUST when bringing guest into town. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that finally impelled me to sign up for an account on Yelp after all these years. The food, drinks and ambience were pitch perfect. I ordered the seafood paella and split the octopus focaccia starter with my wife, who ordered the veal cutlet special for her entree. All were amazing. The cocktail menu is engaging and the bartenders are skilled. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went to the Barocco with one my best buddy. We like to think that we are foodies and understand what it takes for a place to be successful. 

We had a spot at the bar (we like to be close to the action). Food was very good. We had oysters as appetizers and we shared a rib roast for 2. Plenty of meat for two guys. 

I would say that the decor and atmosphere is an acquired taste. We had the feeling that there were a lot of tourists (nothing wrong with that given the location), but that's not really what we expected. 

Barman/waiter was super nice though. 

Checked off the list, but will probably not going to be back given the other places that we want to try!"}
{"text":"Wow. The food was outstanding, the atmosphere is eclectic and fun, the service was superb. Our server made the whole experience. I cannot recommend this place enough!! Eat at Barroco or leave this country."}
{"text":"This should have been five stars but they delivered a fish dish to my wife that she did not order. The fish dish turned out to be wonderful. We waited for a very long period of time for our espresso. They gave us free ice wines and finally delivered our espressos. The staff is young and eager to help you out with choosing a wine or entree. The food was incredible. I'm so impressed with montreal."}
{"text":"After reading about this place online and the Cleveland Magazine, we were excited to check this place out. We were immediately pleased with the small/eclectic/colorful/artsy vibe that we got. And the aroma was awesome!!! 
They have 5 sauces on their table, *Garlic, *Spicy Peanut, *Cilantro, *Rachero, & one other one that slips my mind at the moment. They were all very good....
 Buuuutttt that was pretty much were the excitement stopped. 
-I know it's probably due to the fact they couldn't get a liquor license, but yes, NO Alcohol. So that was kind of a bummer. I feel like a beer would compliment that type of food very well. 
-We ordered the arepes which the \"shell\" was very good but it was extremely overwhelmed by the avocado sauce(unfamiliar with Colombian food, perhaps that's how they do it) and that's coming from someone who enjoys avocado. And unfortunately the delicious sauces didn't go too well with the arepes. 
-The black bean soup also seemed quite heavy on the the cumin.

All in all it was just kind of a let down. Very friendly staff and lovely little place, just didn't really give us that \"Wow\" that we were hoping for."}
{"text":"I tend not to write reviews but I just had to. This place is amazing. I get the Ropa Vieja arepa each time and it never disappoints. The meat is so juicy and flavorful it truly complements the arepa well.
My girlfriend is Cuban and tells me this is truly authentic. She gets the Ropa Vieja plate and raves about the beans and rice.

The vibe of the place is just cool. It is very small and only seats about 30 people or so but it is perfect for a date or a small get together. The back of the restaurant is much more romantic than the front. Also the BYOB is a cool touch. It's a bit pricey but it's well worth it. Don't forget to sign the wall!"}
{"text":"I adore the interior of this place!  I stopped in for lunch with my 6 year old and we had a nice time.  

We ordered the 3 tacos and moduras.  The parade of sauces is wonderful and the garlic and chimichuri were my favorites.  The polenta shell was a bit hard, but all-in-all, they were tasty.  I am going to make it back for margaritas and one of their delicious looking burritos soon."}
{"text":"It took awhile to finally get here but we were beyond glad when we finally did. The restaurant out front is nothing like it is inside. Super casual, with an artsy street vibe but refined and accessible. All this time passing by in my car it gives off the impression of possibly being stuffy or upscale, but that must have been my own hang ups cause now that I have been inside I can see how the awning and vibe fit into the brand. 
This place is known for its arepas, which in a nutshell is like a Mexican sandwich or a torta, but these are made with homemade corn wraps, in the tradition of South America or Columbia to be more precise. They must be the only place in the region Doing this cause it was fantastic. Mine was stuffed with diced chicken and grilled veggies which were awesome. My wife got the beef and veggies, which was also done in a diced carne Asada style, again amazing! We will definitely be back because the menu was huge and fun with so many other types of arepa fillings to try. It could take a lifetime to try them all. They can be done vegan as well, we asked. So all you vegans, have a good time here, they will make it for you with a smile! They also have live music starting at 6 or 7 I think. It's a small place but worth it once you get inside."}
{"text":"LOVE the food and vibe here! 

Yucca fries are my favorite thing here and the cheesy corn is a must try! The Hawaiian arepa is my favorite, especially when topped with their chimichurri (sp?) sauce. Great cocktails - their house margarita is my all time favorite margarita that I've ever had. 

When the weather permits, sit outside on the patio! it is shaded and has lots of hanging fans to keep you cool but in the fresh air. There are light and colors everywhere and being here is definitely my happy place!"}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out after hearing some good things and I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed.  It was kind of a busy night (on account of a groupon?) and I won't count that against them... although I did feel bad for the family of five that came in seconds after us and had to wait... and wait... and were still waiting even after we left because there are only a few tables that can seat more than 3 people (and an obnoxious group of four who had finished eating before we arrived were just sitting there chatting).

Where do I begin?  I guess I'll start with. \"if Barroco Grill was a food truck, I might give it a three\" because it is basically that caliber of a meal (right down to the paper cups).  I found it quite humorous when an over-dressed group of four waltzed in with two bottles of wine.  I was sad that we had to leave before they were seated because I wanted to see them drink their wine out of paper Pepsi cups (I imagined the plastic lid with the \"merlot\" dimple depressed).  I guess that brings me to my gripes:
  
The fountain Pepsi products were the only beverages.  The spoonful of \"wasabi\" coleslaw came in a plastic condiment cup and I could scarcely detect the hint of wasabi.  The fries were pretty bland and barely seasoned.  I'm not sure why the only cheese that they serve is mozzarella.  I also didn't care for the sauces everyone else is raving about.  They were disappointingly mediocre.  I like spicy stuff, but the only spicy sauce was also peanut and the spicy clearly came from Frank's Red Hot (which, at full strength, isn't all that spicy).

The cheesy corn looked good.  I kind of wished we tried it because I'm not so sure I'll come back."}
{"text":"I love happy accidents. 
We were going to a show this evening and decided to stop, last minute, at Barroco as we'd never been there before. 

We are now INSTANT FANS. 

When we first went in, we thought the place was fairly tiny, but then after looking we found that the place only looks like a small cozy bistro from the front;, it extends pretty far back into the long, winding building. One thing that struck me immediately was that we were greeted warmly, and got a really nice seat by the front window, and then...we saw the menu. 

I love Mexican food, but I've been schooled on your standard fare that is fairly Americanized. Firstly, we got an appetizer called Cheesy Corn; this was a pleasing fondue of spiced chicken, corn and shallots combined with dipping toastettes of fried corn squares. Absolutely delightful. We chowed on than and then, we were introduced to Arepas.  these are sort of like pocket sandwiches, but filled with amazing spiced meats and cheeses and made of (again) fried corn meal. Best...Sandwich...Ever. I had a Hawaiian Arepa with a cup of their spiced black beans; it was awesome. Patty had a chicken one with fries, and we also got to sample...

THE WHEEL OF SAUCES!! 

They bring out a serving carousel of 5 sauces, one was a tasty pesto-like sauce, there was a hot Shiracha, a wonderful sauce that, well, it tasted like what you'd get on a Quarter Pounder, but better of course:) There was also a heavenly garlic and a pineapple puree, all in one chilled set! 

With this, we got to sample a huge number of flavors, and it was worth it. I'd also like to add that our drinks were never empty, the service was great and we saw many, many happy people both coming and going as they picked up huge orders in shopping bags. 

Now, this explained to me, two things. 1. Why there were so many awards on the walls from all around Cleveland, and 2. Why many, indeed MOST, of the walls, from the front as you walk in to the restroom in the back, were covered in the HAPPIEST graffiti I've ever seen. Apparently, the clientele is encouraged to make their opinions known in the most literal way. 

Parking for this little gem is street only, but it's worth it, even if you have to park a mile away. I am now, and shall be, a fan of Barroco, and plan on making it a stopoff if any of my friends come here from out of town, because frankly, I want to show how good we eat in CLEVELAND!! 

BTW, I have under good authority that \"Barroco\" means \"Baroque\" in Spanish, so, my opinion...and please forgive me people, If aint' BAROQUE, don't fix it...

I would like to apologize to all funny people everywhere. Go eat their food, it's really awesome:)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something yummy and unique in Lakewood, look no further! The food and drinks are delicious, the staff is knowledgeable and fast, and the experience all around is exciting. But beware, if you're on a date, steer clear of the (amazingly perfect and delightful) garlic sauce -- I only had to learn that once."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Great food and great service!! I've been here quite a few times, and never once have I been disappointed. Actually, every time go I am more and more pleased! The Arepas really got it going on! Keep up the great work barroco!"}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite places in Lakewood since it first opened. We love the uniqueness of their food, especially the arepas ($12) and side dishes. Mixed drinks are great as well, especially my Brazilian Caprinha (which gave me nostalgia of my time in Brazil). We went here the other night, and they've made some major renovations including adding a bar, extending the restaurant, and adding a more diverse menu. To be honest, I selfishly liked it better when no one knew about it and they were BYOB, but I can't hate them for expanding! Skip the Barrio craze one night, and drive a little further down Madison to check out Barroco!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Loved the cheesy corn dip! Love all the house made sauces too!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I know it has changed a bit since they opened, I am now under the impression that they don't make the corn wraps for their arepas which is kind of disappointing. But that aside, it is yummy, greasy, carby food. It is also BYOB, so bringing a nice bottle of Malbec pairs pretty well with the food you will find. The sauces are good, except for they all seem to be mayo-based. It would be nice to see a real chimmcuri. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant from the SWFL area to the Westside Cleveland area, I am accustomed to some great Colombian restaurants.  Or so I thought.

Barroco Grill is a small unassuming restaurant on Madison avenue in Lakewood, and they are cranking out some the BEST Colombian food I have ever experienced.

My partner and I started out with an order of the Cheesy Corn.  This is so wonderful that I could eat it with a spoon and consider it dinner.  One small caveat, you might ask to substitute tortilla chips for the arepa fries, as we found the fries to be a tad unwieldy and a little heavy for an appetizer.  The blending of corn, cheese, chicken and bacon was a tremendous delight, and will be a must order on all of our future visits.

My partner opted for the Cubano sandwich, but thinks he might have liked the Barroco Loco better (same sandwich with shredded beef instead of shredded pork).  He is positive that he will order the garlic aioli on the side next time as he felt it was a little overpowering to his tastes.

I had the Punta E' Carne, which is tender beef tips and mushrooms in a tangy mustard sauce served with grilled cheese arepa triangles.  Let me just say, I loved this dish.  The tender beef with the delicious sauce was phenomenal.  The arepa grilled cheese triangles were a little repetitive after the cheesy corn appetizer, but I will know how to order/substitute better next time.

On my radar is one of the traditional Colombian dishes known as Bandeja Paisa, a total comfort food delight.

Our waitress was friendly and efficient.  We went at an off time (@2:00pm) and there were only 3 occupied tables, including ours.  The graffiti walls/tables and the festive Latin music really helped set the tone for a great dining experience.

Don't be afraid of the menu offerings.  All the food is made with care and Barroco Grill is now in my must do rotation.  It is one of my favorite restaurants in the area and I will be a loyal patron as long as they continue to offer the service and quality that I now know to expect.

Barroco Grill, you have won my heart and I cannot wait until we meet again."}
{"text":"While we waited for our table (maybe 5 minutes) we were offered FREE tequila shots inside halved limes with sea salt.  What else do you need to know?!?!  A free drink in Lakewood; home of the overpriced cocktail???

The ambiance is great; crowded but cozy.  Graffiti on everything, but in a good way.  The drinks are excellent!  The service was polite, humble, efficient, and fast!  The food was outstanding.  Highly recommend the Arepas."}
{"text":"Tried this the other night, walked in and recognized it as the old Cobalt Club that we had been to a few years earlier.  They have fixed it up nicely still maintaining the exposed stone and wood beams, quite a nice bar area, overall great ambience and feel about the place.
The meal itself was very good !  Bison tartar to start, heavy on the seasoning with a spanish flair about it but still very good.  Both mains good as well, kitchen got a bit backed up so we had a bit of a wait but didn't really notice, its the sort of place that you don't feel like you need to be in a rush to eat.  Waitress brought us a couple complimentary glasses of dessert wine to make up for the wait which was quite nice.
Overall great experience, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cheesy corn dip is delicious; hard to stop eating. Braised beef was awesome. Black beans are the best I've had. Service was a bit slow and infrequent but be patient and enjoy the meal! ;-}"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, and the byob policy makes it that much better. I've gone twice and had a steak both times. Cooked to perfection and topped with peppers onions and an egg. It's fantastic. My friends had the various sandwiches and things that they make and I've never heard a bad review from them. I love this place, we use it as a nice, relaxed place to start a Friday night. I'd recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in without a reservation and the hostess was able to accommodate us, because a reservation had cancelled. Their cocktail menu was impressive and a bit overwhelming. I ordered the passion dream, which had actual passion fruit juice, pulp and seeds along with a flame. We both enjoyed stellar appetizers: the summer salad and local cheese plate. My husband devoured the best paella he has tasted thus far. He also enjoyed a glass of (expensive) red wine, which I think was overpriced. I unfortunately ordered the short ribs, which were under seasoned and fatty for my liking. I should have ordered the fish to avoid disappointment. The restaurant is housed in an historic stone building and is comfy, with tables being very close and I'm not sure if large parties would enjoy the lack of elbow room. Romantic: yes value: no"}
{"text":"There's often times a wait, but it's worth it. I just.... Well.... the place.... The food leaves me speechless. 

Everything is hot and fresh, the flavors layer well, and the service is good. I get the arepa puerca (which I probably spelled wrong) and most of the time the hubby gets maduros with chorizo. The flan is good as well. We haven't had much of the menu because what we have had is so good that we keep getting it."}
{"text":"Great authentic food! Love the chorizo arepas - w/o green peppers. I think the gp's overpower the flavor of the chorizo. Cheese corn is outstanding, A bit pricey, but if you're making the trip, you probably don't care too much about the prices."}
{"text":"I love Barroco. I've been stalking their instagram for months waiting for this location to finally open. Still waiting for their liquor license, so no delicious mojitos or sangria for now--but they do have wine and beer and you can also byob. Arepas and tostones for everyone!"}
{"text":"Super romantic spot!  The short rib is amazing.  Other mains are soild but not as exceptional as their short rib or Paella.  They really excel at cocktails and the service is good."}
{"text":"OMG!  Flippin' amazing food!  

I've been reading the amazing Yelps and I completely trust Angela S's taste in good food so I really wanted to check out Barroco.

Last night I asked my mom to join me for some errands and dinner at Barroco.  Neither of us has had Colombian food before and were excited to try it.  Barroco is a little lacking on set up on the inside, but it was clean and bright with some interesting artwork.  Our waitress Rosa was just the cutest thing, she was so excited to tell us about everything on the menu and to make sure our first experience was great so we would come back.

Mom ordered the Hawaiian Arepa with black bean soup.  I ordered the Chicken Tostones.  We also had an appetizer that was heaven sent and so rich and heavy it could have been a meal itself.  I must say I'm typically not a Hawaiian fan of food but this Arepa was like meaty sweet and salty goodness in my mouth!  (Please sir, I want some more!).  I LOVED the Chicken Tostones.  In fact, I loved everything so much I can't stop talking about it to my friends and co-workers.  There were six sauces for the food too and the Garlic was amazing as was the spicy peanut!  

Seriously, I cannot wait to come back and try other menu items.  The food was very heavy and some of it so heavily fried you can only eat a little.  The nice thing was that I probably have several meals sitting in my frig at home for me to enjoy over the next day or so.  The price is right too!  Average entree is $10.  If you're a vegetarian you can certainly find some Veg-friendly items amongst the carnivorous menu options.

The kitchen is making your food to order so sometime you have to wait a bit, but lemme tell ya!  Barroco is WELL WORTH THE WAIT!"}
{"text":"Amazing gem in the heart of the old port. So romantic and quaint. 

The service is amazing, the drinks are great and the food is delicious. My husband and I are both vegetarian and every time we have gone the chef has offered to make us something special off the menu that was tailored based on our tastes, and every time we were delighted.

The ambiance is perfect, nice music, not too loud, puts you back in another era... Like an old romantic hollywood movie.

Would highly recommend- but make reservations."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Got a gift card for Christmas. For starters I got the Agua de Panela to drink. It was light and refreshing with a kick. My ONLY complaint this entire review would be the size of the straws for this particular drink. The macerated fruit kept getting stuck. But all that aside, we got the guacamole appetizer with plantains and chips. I think the plantains were my favorite. Crispy yet tender. Yum. My entree was Carne Asada. The skirt steak was ultra thin and tender. So flavorful. The rice and beans side was delicious. My husband got the Mexicana Arepa. He was in love. The black bean soup side was very good. For dessert we shared the vanilla flan. All we can say is OMG! We are new found flan fans!!  ( say that three times fast lol)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The staff is always friendly and the food is  delicious. As a vegetarian I sometimes have issues finding good entrees but here I get the perico arepa with avocado instead of chorizo and the tostones. This is my favorite but I haven't had anything here I didn't like."}
{"text":"Been here so many times.  Always a great experience.

The food is unique and delicious on it's own, but they also give you these tasty sauces in squeeze bottles as an added bonus.  You don't even have to ask for them..they just drop them on the table and walk away and let you go crazy.  The waitress usually explains what's in said sauces, but I always forget and use them indiscriminately.  I imagine someone with more refined taste buds would be able to select the perfect flavor combination and ratio of sauce, but I am not that person.  Still good, regardless.  

I usually get the veggie arepa.  I read another review that called it bland, and, it could be, but I always, ALWAYS add pineapple and jalapeno (duh).  Problem solved. Every time I eat here, I wonder why arepas aren't as mainstream as burritos.  They're similar in theory, but so much tastier.  Maybe because burritos have a tortilla that completely encloses it's fillings, and is, thus, easier to shove in our mouths without actually looking?  An arepa is more like a sandwich made with thick corn tortillas, so you kind of need to look at it when you eat it.  
 
When I went yesterday, I broke tradition and got the huevos rancheros.  I've had many a huevos rancheros, but this was the best I've had in recent memory.  It's served on a cheesy arepa (instead of the traditional tortilla) and comes with chorizo and peppers.  Terrific. 

Also, for a side, you should ask for fried plantains.  For some reason, they don't usually offer them as one of the options, but whenever I ask for them specifically, they let me get them instead of fries, tortilla chips, or the soup."}
{"text":"One of my absolutely favorite restaurants of all time! All the food I have ever gotten, or tried that a friend has gotten, has been amazing. I love the cheesy corn appetizer and Hawaiian arepa.... that's my regular order. I'm sad that it is no longer BYOB, but both their white and red sangria is so tasty that it almost doesn't matter. Love the atmosphere, staff is great, food is even better."}
{"text":"Holy shit. This was amazing. So full we didn't even get to try the enormous ice cream towers but they looked incredible too.
Arepa chips and Arepas in general were to die for. Spicy peanut sauce also a winner. Love."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time because a friend recommended it and YES I recommend it as well. It looks very small from the outside but once inside you are transported out of Ohio and into a quaint location in another country. The decor is so authentic and comforting. The waitresses were very attentive and nice. I had a caipirinha drink and I loved it. It had actual sugar cane in it. Other places don't include that. It was delicious. I had the ropa vieja arrepa and it was absolutely delicious. I chose the platanos as a side. They were huge! The sauces you get to add to your food as customization were delicious as well. I loved the pineapple sauce. I know, sounds weird, but it's great! The portions are huge! I saw someone at another table order dessert and it was massive! Definitely a great place to visit and enjoy food from a different culture. It's worth the wait. I can't wait to try this place during the summer when I could sit on the patio! Go support this location. They are truly great! You won't be disappointed in the food or drinks!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here not to long ago with a Groupon.  He had heard many good things about it and wanted to give it a shot. I was game so we went.  It is kind of a small place and the building itself is kind of in a odd location.  It looks like it was once a house.  
They only have about a handful of tables in there so it looks like it would fill up quite fast.  When we sat down a server came over and she was very friendly,  She made sure to explain to us what everything on the menu was and what was the most popular items.  She also explained to us all of the homemade sauces which were quite yummy especially the garlic sauce.  I could eat that just out of the bottle itself....... 
I got a chicken arepa with peppers and onions and cheese and my boyfriend got a burger. We also got their cheesy queso dip with their steak like fries.  The dip was really good but also really rich and it had bits of corn in it which sold me. I love corn especially when it is in a cheesy dip.  The fries with it were kind of to hard for me and they didn't give you enough with the amount of dip that comes with them.  I just used the fries that came with my arepa which worked for me. 
All in all it was a pretty good place and I will for sure go again. The corn like tortillas that come with the arepas are unique and take some getting used to but it is not something that would knock down my rating for them. I had a really good experience there and I will for sure go back."}
{"text":"I dont understand long reviews.  No one wants to read your book.

Size: small-avoid busy times to get a table
Price: Very affordable.  2 people can eat like kings for under $25
Location: Easy to find but parking can be a challenge
Food: Very good and very unique.  Its like modern mexican....if your looking for traditional mexican go to MiPueblo.  If you want something funky and different then come here.
Staff: Very friendly but the service is a bit lacking.

OVERALL:  Its definatley worth stopping in just for the cheesy corn if anything else."}
{"text":"Why haven't I eaten here sooner? What a treat to be ushered to a table in the back patio and listen to some fun live music! All the food was very flavorful. The waitstaff was in a good mood it seems ( a rarity) and my friend and I had a really enjoyable evening. Try the guacamole, it's chunky and a little spicy!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in town for any kind of food at any price point and when I find out what sad nerd has cost this place a perfect 5 star average rating I'm going to make sure that they can only eat room temperature Arthur Treacher's and Tab cola forever. I don't know how yet but don't doubt my resolve and the vengeance that lives in my black heart. It has 5 flavors, one for each kind of delicious sauce that is served to customers."}
{"text":"One time while I was eating at Barroco, I was reading the writing on the walls and one line said \"if you like Barroco watch the movie Chef\" (or something like that).

Barroco is one of the few places in Cleveland you can get Colombian food and it is GOOD. I can't help but get the Super Dog whenever I go, even though I always end up only eating one hot dog (comes with two). The FRIES are amazing because of all the sauces. The maduros are also really good, as is the chili. This place is pretty authentic, according to my Colombian boyfriend. They even have Colombian sodas. The prices are right and the atmosphere is kitschy--a perfect place for foodies (hence, the Chef quote was spot on).

I am so happy that these guys decided to open a Colombian restaurant near me, so now I don't have to travel to Miami to get this amazing food :)"}
{"text":"Nice little spot, food was different. If there is ropa vieja on a menu I will usually get it and theirs was great. The only reason for the 4 stars is the slow service. I really wanted to get a second drink but by the time the server returned we were full and it was time to go. There were also two ceviche dishes on the menu, one creamy and one with fish and shrimp. I guess I was not specific enough and recut he incorrect one."}
{"text":"One of the first places I ate at when I moved to Lakewood a few years ago, and I have been back many many times since.  Felt I should finally write a review for this place.

I loved seeing this place grow and expand as they deserve all the success they have achieved in the past few years as this is some of the best food I have ever had.  If they every sell their garlic sauce, I will buy it by the gallons.

While I always recommend their famous Arepas, I also recommend exploring the rest of the menu and trying other things such as their pastas, which may now be my new go to for Barrocco.  An orgy in my mouth to quote Stewie Griffin. 

They are quickly becoming an institution of Lakewood, if they aren't already considered that."}
{"text":"Never a failed visit!! Yummy!!
Great atmosphere and service 
Very clean and also kid friendly"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! One of my new favorite places, great atmosphere and homemade food and drink!"}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian Arepa, and it did not disappoint.  It was loaded with ham and pineapple.  As my side I got the Yucca fries....by far my favorite part of the meal.  The sauces provided are also very tasty.

Definitely a great place for a flavorful meal!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great place for Colombian street food. 

Came here with a groupon deal (yesss) for the arepas. We heard a lot by word of mouth from Rachael's friends that this is the place to go for delicious sandwiches. We got there, and the environment is laid back, colorful, and unique. (Lots of pics and even writing on the wall.) 

Our server was really fun and candid! A+ for the service here. She made some recommendations (like, don't destroy the cheesy corn otherwise you will be too full for the main meal!) and we took them to heart.

Now, for the dishes....

THE AREPAS AND SIDES: I got the vegetarian one and bf got the chorizo one. For sides, we both got the black bean soup, which came with a little scoop of rice. There was also a small side of coleslaw. I have to say, it's really hard to make tasty vegetarian food, and this place was SO GOOD! So much flavor. It definitely had more of a sweet flavor, so I recommend the chimichurri and/or the pineapple. For the chorizo, my bf said it was excellent, and he liked the spicy peanut sauce and garlic. Very very good flavor overall. 

THE HOUSEMADE SAUCES: Pineapple, garlic, chimichurri, spicy peanut, and ketchup+ranch.

THE CHEESY CORN: delicious but huge! Definitely good for a group of 4+. It comes with pieces of toasted corn chunks (fail.) So cheesy with corn, chicken, and bacon.

The only thing was that I found it to be very pricy -- $12 for arepa+side. I'd come back and pay the same amount tho.

I will come back for more!"}
{"text":"It's small, and like many ethnic restaurants in or near big cities, it is rather dumpy and easily overlooked on the outside.  The food and service are excellent, and I can't add much to the above comments by others.  You will not be disappointed. By the way, they are getting a liquor license very soon."}
{"text":"Every time I go, I eat until I almost puke.  It is so good, I can't stop.  Guacamole, plantains, all the sauces, lean meats, super fun decor, good pricing, BYOB... I don't really know how I could do it justice with a yelp review.  Stop contemplating where to go and start driving to Barroco now."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was awesome! Everything came out on time and BYOB with no charge was a bonus!!"}
{"text":"Ok so i've gotta say awesome and different amazing everything!!!!Let's start with cheesy corn served with the arepa fries mmmm....for some reason I crave it try it and you'll know why also had the chicken arepa and was very good the person I was with ordered a barroco burger and was so wowed over it made me try it  was soooo good (chips bacon melted mozzarella) and the sauces were gooood im ordering it next time I stop in also it's B.Y.O.B. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Rumor has it they're opening up downtown and can't wait it's closer to work"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is here. when we sat down, they were out of a fish dish, the dry aged steak, and two side dishes. considering there are only about 10 entrees, two missing seemed like a lot . the wine list was ridiculously overpriced.  I had a decidedly average paella for a decidedly above average price. I felt like they wanted you to spend more money, and given our initial reception, I was not inclined to. I don't mind paying a lot for great food, but I do mind spending a lot for average food."}
{"text":"Had the empanadas very good! Can't wait to try something new! Been here twice. Very nice spot for a date"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. I saw all of the yelp reviews and was super excited...

Came here around 1 on a Sunday and had no problem getting sat right away. 

Service was nice, but extremely slow at times. We had our appetizer, food, and beverages picked out before the server came to greet us. I did like that you pay up front after you're finished. That's quick and efficient. 

My boyfriend's cocktail was very good, a decent size for around $8. 

We started off with the shrimp ceviche, which was the biggest disappointment. It was a bunch of tiny sized, heat cooked shrimp in a too-sweet tasting tomato salsa. I'm merely speculating, but the tomato salsa tasted like any jar salsa you'd find at the supermarket and perhaps had been \"doctored up\" with cilantro and diced red onion. Really unimpressive and misleading. $12? Not a good deal at all for what the dish ended up being. 

My mexicana arepa had chorizo, cheddar cheese, pickled jalapenos, and a one ounce portion of guac on the side. I barely finished it but I figured I'd just take it home and throw in whatever contents were left inside with eggs for breakfast tomorrow. Perhaps I just don't like arepas, as this was the first time I tried them, but the texture was so hard to get past. It was crumbly, somewhat flavorless, and hard and chewy on the edges. I got the yucca fries which basically taste like a very starchy, dry and flavorless potato. There was no seasoning on them. I didn't finish this, either. I barely got through one fry.

My boyfriend's dish was much better. It had braised beef topped with and egg. He said it wasn't bad and finished it all. I had a bite, and I thought it was okay, too. He got the red bean chili which he said was good, I tasted it but I was unimpressed.  

For one cocktail, one appetizer and two medium sized dishes the check came out $56. I haven't been this disappointed in a really long time..."}
{"text":"I could never emphasize enough how amazing the food is here. If you're reading this trying to figure out where to eat right now, I hope your decision ends now and you don't even make it to the end of this review because you're already on your way to barroco."}
{"text":"Great Colombian food!  Tried their chicken arepa and the carne asada, so good!  Setting is so laid back and prices are very decent. Must try their yuca fries!  Just like how we used to make and perfectly cooked crispy:D! Can't say enough about their sauce selections... I wanted to buy and take home. 

Besides what we ordered, I'm sure everything on their menu is a safe yummy bet!  If you're in the area, must try their food... Find it On Thrillist top choices too!"}
{"text":"Single best cocktail bar I have ever been in. I more or less eat out for a living. I am in sales and do not worry about the price related to my meal. I used Yelp to find this place and had the pleasure of not entertaining and sat by the bar by myself. It was a treat. The bartender is a true craftsman. I had a \"Smoking Gun\", \"Machete\", and an \"Ernest Miller\". All I can say is - wow. The meal was fantastic too! I could not recommend more."}
{"text":"The BEST Colombian food I've had since the last time I was actually in Colombia! Reminds me of home. Very authentic, excellent service. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night. It was packed but seated almost right away. They must turn them fast. But we were never rushed. Didn't seem like those around us were either. Live music was a nice touch. Brought out the inner dancers for a lot of the diners. 

Service was friendly and fast. Listened to requests and accommodated all with a smile. 

The strawberry cocktail and the one with watermelon were on the weak side. Server suggested caprihana which was great. 

Ceviche was well done. Bacon wrapped plantains were even better. 

Both entrees we ordered were ample on quantity. The ground beef and the filet tips. Both tasted great. Nice to have such a flavorful place on the Westside."}
{"text":"Got the Cubano sandwich and a side of fries to go. The sandwich was very good (although I was surprised that there were no pickles or mustard) and a great portion size. The fries were also very good and fresh. I am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We had the best experience on a Friday evening. Excellent burger and arepa. Patio setting. Live music (Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday). People dancing. Their wheat beer with fresh fruit and passion fruit flavor was awesome. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was very good, seasoning was well done especially the sauces. My personal favorites were the chimichurri and peanut sauce. The service was good too. I had the arepa montañera, which was great, i just wish the arepa was a bit softer as it would have allowed the food and sauces to blend nicely."}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING!! He food was great, the ambience was calm and romantic and the service was stellar! You won't regret going here"}
{"text":"This is an original and very good Colombian restaurant.

Very good service, super cool bartender, delicious appetizers and food.

By far, my favorite Colombian place ever!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable dining experience all around! My coworker booked this place for a team dinner of 6. The decor is very uniquely different, a little bit of romance, Jazzy to funky, to vibrant. They also had a very different track of music that was playing from jazz to 80's rock to 90's hop. 

Service was more than you can ask for. You can tell this is the place to be when your waiter is really enjoying what he's doing and is provide the best service to his customers. Waiter recommended Ripasso to my colleagues which I sampled and was very rich, full, and fruity. 

I had the famous seafood paella and it did not disappoint. It was one of the best seafood dishes I've had. It came with really fresh crab, lobster, shrimp and scallop. We also ordered everything in the appetizer menus and they were all delicious. The bison tartar and heirloom tomato were the best."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great location. Started with the taste of autumn salad, fantastic blend of flavors. I tried the short ribs, a tender flavorful meaty dish. The polenta was different, the base was very good, the vegetables, fruits and herbs were a little much for me. My associate ordered the vegetable plate, it was a full blend of grain, vegetables, etc. I would recommend. 
We skipped desert and ended with an espresso. 
I hope to go back some day."}
{"text":"First off, BYOB so that is an added bonus. There have a cheese dip that is really, really delicious and I often fill up on that before making it to the arepas.  The arepas are good and they have a decent selection. Fried plantains are also quite tasty. My favorite part is maybe their selection of sauces. Wish I had some at home!"}
{"text":"Great Place,Love the Idea and the service,Fantastic Drinks Specially the Drink Menu,i'm a Fan and i will Visit Again Everytime i'm in Canada"}
{"text":"This place is soo good and one of those places you will most likely feel way too full when leaving. Also the service here was really great, the servers were fast and gave a whole shpeel (sp?) about all their sauces and menu items. We got the cheesy corn as an appetizer. It was amazing. Those little corn chips are so good that they give to dip with. This 'appetizer' however was enough for us both to be full. we took most of it home. Then we had chorizo arepas. They let you add in or out any of the arepa ingredients. It was a perfect vehice for trying all the different sauces at the table. The garlic one was super garlicky and good. I couldn't pick a favorite though. The fries were just standard. I'll be back. I would like to try something from the gourmet menu like the shrimp ceviche or the steak with chimchurri sauce."}
{"text":"We went early around 5 on St. Patrick's Day so we didn't have to wait. We were seated immediately and we waited maybe 10 minutes before our server greeted us. 

Everything we ordered came in a reasonable amount of time and the food was very good. I really liked the place and the atmosphere. I loved the eclectic decor and the overall feel of the restaurant.  

The problem arose when there was a table of maybe 8 people who were seated next to us. I think that particular party underestimated how many people were supposed to be meeting them. There were 3 people that came later and had nowhere to sit. So this is when the manager started coming to take our dishes away, took our dessert away when I was still eating it and brought us our bill, essentially rushing us out. My daughter got this $10 ice cream sundae for dessert and had barely made a dent in it and he kept checking in on us.. not our waitress, the manager.  We were seriously only there for one hour and 15 minutes from start to finish. 

We were getting ready to leave, my husband went to use the restroom and while he was gone I was approached by the manager. He asked me if we could go sit at another table across the way because he had some people that have been waiting a long time and they needed our table.,.they were part of the large table next to us. Are you kidding me? We literally just spent $100 on some sandwiches.. I won't go back, I was really excited about this place and wanted to bring my son when he came home to visit. You treat every customer like they are important. I hate waiting too but we went early so we didn't have to wait. I could see if we were sitting there for 3 hours but we didn't."}
{"text":"I had my best meal of the year at Barocco, everything about our experience was absolutely exceptional.  The only seats available that evening (a Tue night!) were at the bar, which turned out to be a stroke of luck as we were privy to not only watch the kitchen at work but also admire the various drinks the bartender was preparing for patrons.  Every single thing he used for the various drinks was fresh.  Passion fruit was freshly squeezed, orange zest was lit on fire to ensure a smoky orange flavor, and lychees freshly peeled.  Needless to say it made each drink order a labor intensive ordeal.  The staff was exceptional, they were  helpful, friendly, and always on top of things.  I can't recall the last time a 3 hour dinner flew by  like the blink of an eye.  We will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"This is my go to place if I want the best guacamole in town.  Excellent,  fluffy,  fresh,  delish.  Love the many different options you can get as far as what can go into your arepas and other interesting optiobs for anyobe who is not familiar with some of the dishes.  Sauces add a new adfiyion to each bite changing your flavor as yiu wish."}
{"text":"The good reviews here must be fake. We had high hopes, but Barocco was a total let down. Awful food, dry, salty, oily, and not in a good way. The meat was so rubbery and the tagliatelle was underwhelming. We are sad that we spent our only night in Montreal in this place. Total tourist trap. Waste of time and money. More importantly a waste of time because you can't get that back! The place looks nice, but do you really want to pay double for terrible food that's not worth eating even for free? Total fail."}
{"text":"Don't forget to BYOB (beer store on 117th/Madison).  The arepas come with a side- ordering an appetizer makes for a meal too large.

A down side of the otherwise excellent arepas: they are somewhat dry and rely on your application of the cornucopia of sauces provided.

Service = Some of the best I've experienced.
Atmosphere = Quiet, mellow, with warm decor."}
{"text":"I know, I know. The food is amazing. Everyone knows that. But have you tried the margaritas?  Whooo Buddy! Best in town."}
{"text":"The ambience of this place was avant-garde! It was a great place to eat and the food was delightful! Their maduro con queso was delicious and I will return every time I go to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Very small but cozy restaurant. I liked cocktail menu made with a real book as a part of cover.  Cocktail was good (I asked something like mojito which wasn't on the menu) but not out of the world...

I thought pasta was overpriced.... same for mashed potatoes.. I guess the flavor of food was pretty well-balanced but not very memorable..especially for the price.

Complimentary bread was warm and OK."}
{"text":"I was really excited from all the yelp reviews and the atmosphere after I walked into this restaurant. But this was honestly the most disappointed and led astray that I've been in a long time. The restaurant has a really great environment, with Colombian-esque relics and trinkets adorning the walls, fun paintings on the walls, and tons of graffiti left by adoring guests. It's a really cool atmosphere. 

However, the service was pretty bad. It wasn't all that busy and the waiter was no where to be found most of the time. The food also took a really long time to come out. 

I ordered a beef arepa with a side of chips and could not have been more disappointed. It was boring and pretty much tasteless. It needed sauce, which was no where in sight. And my side of stale tortilla chips came with no salsa or anything. When I asked the waiter what the other sides were, he was so unhelpful, I got annoyed and simply ordered chip. Who serves chips without anything to dip them in?! 

Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent! While Colombian is rather limited in the Cleveland area, Barroco provides a diverse menu offering up some common dishes that are sizable and delicious. The service is attentive, friendly, and prompt! I had the vegetarian arepa, which was superb and slightly crispy, a real treat! For desert I splurged and had a piece of flan, a sweet escape that I will surely seek out again!"}
{"text":"Food is quite heavy and lacks a diversity in flavors that one would expect from their cuisine. Good environment, good drinks, and good staff."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed me. Their garlic mayo is to die for, great to dip your fries in and goes great on every sandwich. Very cute atmosphere and a place I will alway visit. great prices too!!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. It's beautifully done, small and quaint. The menu is great and the food was amazing. It was suggested as one of the best restaurants in the city and certainly delivered."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. They have nailed it! Food is amazing, staff is awesome and entertaining, and the atmosphere is phenomenal. We had the rib eye, burrata and oysters and they were all superb. The sommelier makes this place. His energy is contagious. They played great music all night and it turned into a party after dinner. I will definitely be coming back here during my next trip to Montreal! Cheers to you guys for hosting us and making us feel at home!"}
{"text":"In town for a concert. Great place, friendly staff, but most of all really delicious food. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice people ... neat place and a lot of people love the food ... I get it .. homemade sandwiches and a few other things ... but just did not love it  ... they have 5 sauces but could not find one I liked.  Definitely worth a try ... many people rave about it."}
{"text":"Like RBJ, I wasn't prepared to like this place as much as I did. It was pretty darn good.

I remember this place used to book shows. I saw Clan of the Cave Bear here years ago when it was a pizza joint. But now, it serves some pretty delicious Latin American inspired noms. I had never had an arepa before. I tried the pork filled (har har) arepa and loved it. Arepas are very filling, so I could barely finish more than half of mine even though I was starving. 

Everything was seasoned pretty well. Having had \"Mexican\" the previous evening that was extremely bland -- yeah, this place was just what I needed. 

My favorite part of Barroco was the different sauces they brought to the table. I liked them all and it was pretty awesome to have so many choices to dip my french fries in. I love dipping. 

This place is great for lunch or a really cheap dinner. It's not meant to be fine dining. 

The only negative was that it was super hot in there. It was a 90 degree day and they had a window AC unit. The poor kids working in there. Uggh. Hopefully if they do well enough they can invest in some central AC. Yikes."}
{"text":"This dinner was trip-making for us.  From the moment we walked in, the service was attentive and perfect, including the manager taking our coats and the server being friendly and cool.  The food was really excellent, and the cocktails were amazing - I've never had a gin and tonic with fresh sage, nor has my wife ever had a drink topped with a flaming guava rind - both tasted incredible.  Really endearing vibe inside, with music curated by someone who knows what he's doing, and an atmosphere of young-ish urbanites enjoying a good meal in a stone-lined, candlelit room.  Beamed ceilings, wood floors, stone walls, and a great bar made the ambience, but the food and the service exceeded our expectations.  We loved it and told the Manager so on the way out.  If you visit Montreal without booking your dinner at Barroco in advance, you are doing yourself a disservice.  As the concierge at our hotel told us - in Montreal, there is nothing else like Barroco.  We unfortunately learned this the hard way when we had to settle for another restaurant on our second night after finding out they were booked - would have loved to have gone twice in a row (it was that much fun), but alas, we are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"We went to Barroco Grill for the first time tonight.  It was 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated right away and had very attentive and quick service.  We ordered the Cheesy Corn that was delicious.  My husband had the chicken arepa and I had the pork and they were both excellent.  I loved all five sauces, the chimichuri was my personal favorite and my husband preferred the garlic. 

The staff was super friendly, very accommodating and I loved the friendly casual atmosphere.  You also can't beat the prices.

We will definitely be regulars.  Wish it were closer to home."}
{"text":"I came here because my friend recommended the paella here and I absolutely love paella. However, upon arriving here I feel as though we were treated pretty rudely. 

Originally, we arrived without a reservation and were asked to come back in another hour and a half. Totally understandable, not an issue, but when I asked if they needed my number to alert us that our table was ready, the hostess looked at me and said to me curtly, \"No, your table will be ready at the time I already specified...\" Fine, so we left to walk around and wait.

When we came back and were finally seated, they didn't give us our menus for 5 minutes. They seated a party of 3 and gave them menus even though they arrived after we did.

The paella itself was okay. Nothing too special that I would rave about to anybody else. The foie gras was this restaurants saving grace, really the only thing that I was impressed by.

To be honest, I probably wouldn't return or recommend this restaurant to my friends unfortunately."}
{"text":"The food is delicious (plus all the \"salsas\" that come with with dish\"
Cheesy corn (per yelp recommendations..) was amazing! pretty heavy but it didn't stop us from eating it all!
byob Is super fun BUT they charge you a fee which I guess is understandable but we had twist off beers! so they didn't even need to do anything!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Super wide variety on the menu from amazing apps to arepas to pastas. I got the cheesy corn appetizer to start and those massive milkshakes are merengadas. Lots of different arepas to choose from and they are really big and filling! Nice environment too."}
{"text":"Barrio is nothing compared to the menu Barroco has! The food has a Columbian flare to it and tasted refreshing and delicious! I was recommended by a friend that they had the best arepas in Ohio, and she wasn't wrong! I will happily be back at the Larchmere location for Pina Coladas and lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Ohio and a must visit if i am within 1 hour drive.  The neighborhood is sketchy, but it is so worth it.  Beautiful, happy, unpretentious, delicious place!"}
{"text":"I went to Barrocco for the first time tonight and had an absolutely fantastic experience! The staff was so welcoming and accommodating. From Oscar (who was the manager I believe) to our waitress and even the woman who filled our water, their customer service was top notch! 

To start, we ordered the tostones. They were delicious! Next I got a veggie arepa which did not disappoint either! 

As far as the atmosphere goes, it was so much fun! We happened to come when there was live music and we were so excited! The band and the singer were fantastic and very talented :) they seemed like they were having so much fun on stage which only made us enjoy ourselves even more!"}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious food in the world. I have been coming here for four years and have watched them grow their business.  It is so nice to see them doing so well, but sometimes I wish they weren't so popular so that we could have the place all to ourselves again. A must try if you are in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Very very authentic food. My friend and I went there  for dinner around 7:30pm on a Thursday night. We didn't need to wait at all. Unfortunately the patio was full, so we sat inside. The restaurant is pretty small, but the atmosphere is great. The walls are painted and decorated. There were dangling lights that went on once it got dark too. 

We ordered our drinks and the fresh guacamole to start with. The guac was amazing. The plantains were crispy and flavorful. Our main dishes were the Barroco Salad and the Chicken Arepa with fries. The salad I got was so flavorful. It was tangy, crunchy, and fresh. I'm pretty sure I got a whole avocado. There were slices of avocado across the entire salad. I took half of the salad home because it was big and I kept eating the guacamole. Our waitress brought out a basket of sauces for my friends fries. We had fun trying them all out and couldn't pick our favorite. We stayed after finishing our meals just chatting and watching the Olympics that they had on. It was very relaxing. I would definitely recommend for some quality Colombian food."}
{"text":"We got off a 6hr train ride from Toronto, opened our suitcases & changed, and walked in the cold and ice (1st time in Montreal; from LA ) down to the gorgeous location of Barroco! We started off with the Maple Old Fashioned (very smooth, mature feeling, just enough sweetness) and oysters. There were two varieties. I tried the special tiny sex on the beach oyster 6$ that came on top of black rock salt and was topped with foie gras & a fancy fruity something I can't pronounce. Living in CA I've had some incredible oysters but this creation blew my expectations out of the water, by far the best oyster I've had in my life. My mom ordered the two regular varieties; standard sex on the beach & a bigger variety, both came with delicious house sauces to try, a huge upgrade from the common lemon/horseradish/cocktail sauce I'm used to! After that we ordered the opposites because that's just how good their oysters are! We then had a half order of the buratta, & their house olives with pimento peppers. The cheese was topped with an incredible olive oil & sardines, served on toast (slightly burnt on one piece but not a big complaint), which was utterly mesmerizing with our second round of drinks; the Rococo (good refreshing semi sweet cocktail) & the Upside General (reminiscent of a classy boozy iced tea, very herbal, creamy, and earthy). For our entree we split the short ribs which was actually one giant rib full of meat! We added the mashed potatoes & mushrooms which brought it all together adding the sauce & puree on the potatoes literally it all melts in your mouth! Ended up with a tiny bit of leftover entree to take home sooo good! Finally we split a Death in the Afternoon and the creme brûlée! For such a staple dessert I was a bit apprehensive, but Barroco delivered yet again! So silky, like a creme pudding made of velvet with a perfect crunchy caramel layer on top! And not too sweet the perfect balance of flavors! The Death in the Afternoon included Absinthe (my first time trying) & was heavy with anise flavors as well. Not sure if it was the anise or the absinthe but I personally could barely drink it due to the flavor, it just didn't sit well with me but that could be just a personal preference. Simon kindly added a mix of different flavors to make it a little less bitter (though I felt bad about asking; I didn't want to waste it), still it was a bit of a challenge to down the rest of it. 

The ambience was great! We sat at the bar as recommended by Yelp, & got there early enough that the crowd wasn't too bad. By around 8/8:30, it definitely was getting packed so a reservation is probably a good plan. A bit dim lighting; I can see this being a good date place, bright enough to see, but dark enough to conceal any flaws in your eyeliner . When we arrived we were greeted by the sweetest hostess, who waited patiently while I struggled to get off my coat. Our amazing bartender Simon went through the entire menu in detail, explained every single drink he made, and gave us great tourist ideas for our trip! Seriously Simon helped make our experience that much more special at Barroco! Throughout the night, wooden stylized speakers played an eclectic mix of bomb jams, including Frank Sinatra, Niel Young, BeeJees, & Billy Stewart. Plus everyone at the bar was very kind and friendly & talked with us for a bit. Overall Barocco provided us with some of the best food I've had in my life honestly and I would consider myself a foodie! Incredible balances of flavors, and a well curated menu! The whole experience is easily an 11/10!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My husband and I both chose an arepa, he the puerco and me the mexicano.  They were both delicious!  Each was served with a spicy sour cream on the side.  He chose chili for his side and it was spicy but not hot and delicious.  I had the black bean soup.  It was by far the best black bean soup I've ever had.  All of their meals are served with 5 homemade sauces that compliment the flavors of the dishes.  I found it interesting that they're a BYOB with no corking fee.  Be sure to take your own beer or wine with you.  It's a small place but very clean and inviting.  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Compared to a lot of places in Ohio and Lakewood, this is a little pricey. But, from what I experienced it's worth it. I'm also used to paying this much for a meal in California, so keep that in mind as well.

One gripe is that they only give you 4 maduros with a side order, and if you want cheese, it's extra (3 bucks), so if I come next time I'm in Lakewood I'll get the appetizer version.

Cocktails are a great price during happy hour,but I'm unsure if I'd order them at the normal price.

I've heard the music is great, and I wish I stayed a little later for the live bands."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and WOW were we blown away how fantastic the food is here. Great atmosphere, really cool graffiti work on the wall all around the restaurant that the owner hand painted himself. Really nice outdoor patio in the back. They hand make all the arepas and everything is super fresh, they also have gluten free and veggie options. And service is exceptional. 

For appetizers we ordered the cheesy corn (corn al-gratin, grilled chicken and queso). Served with tortilla chips and arepa fries. The arepa fries we the best. The dip itself was really tasty, the only downside is that as soon as it gets cold, it seems to get super thick. Next we tried the maduros con queso (plantains, feta cheese and queso fundido). The plantains were nice and caramelized, sweet and a great addition to the cheese. For our main entrees we had the arepa Puerca (chorizo beans, chicken, fried chicharrones, and mozzarella). Arepa Paisa (fried chicharrones, chorizo beans, fried egg and mozzarella). Both were absolutely amazing. The arepas were really fresh and the chicharrones were the star of the dish. They also have a nice selection of house made sauces to add to your food (spicy peanut, pineapple, chimmi-churri, ranchero and garlic aioli). All the sauces are unbelievably good and refreshing. They range from sweet to spicy. The garlic aioli is like crack. It will definitely knock your socks off if your a garlic fan."}
{"text":"We are so addicted to Barroco! The food is outstanding and consistent every time. After hearing they opened the new location in Larchmere, we had to check it out. The atmosphere is beautiful and modern. When we spoke with Juan he is as kind as can be and an unbelievable artist! Amazing menu and delicious food. 

Today we ordered the shrimp Ceviche, bacon wrapped Maduritos, Arepa Paisa, and the Chorizo Arepa. All was spectacular. This is definitely a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Cleveland area locally-owned and operated 'hole in the wall'.
Arepas are outstanding, and well priced. 
I always opt for the Hawaiian Arepa, b/c the pairing of ham, bacon and pineapple creates my ideal flavor palette: salty/sweet/crunchy/smooth.
Staff is always pleasant, courteous and willing to go out of their way to accommodate all guests. 
I am not a fan of the fries, but that's only b/c I'm always smashing at least two arepas.
Black bean soup is a great winter treat - and not too salty, which is important to my taste buds. 
Lakewood location does not have a liquor license yet, so it is BYOB, which many people seem to prefer. 
My only small complaint is they lack sugar-free/non-soda beverage options.
I've gotten into a habit of bringing my own bottled Iced Tea, when I stop in for lunch - which is at least twice a month."}
{"text":"This place is special. I had one of the top meals of my life at Barocco. 

The short ribs were amazing (so tender, so flavorful), the salmon trout gravlax is not to be missed, and the cocktails didn't disappoint. 

I loved the ambiance -  stone walls, romantic, low lighting, good music, a mixed crowd (a middle aged couple drawing sketches of how to remodel their home on their table paper, a group of five lively/drunk american guys who were just shy of annoying, a couple seemingly going through a quiet, sad break-up, a few tables filled with dates, me and my mother on a last minute escape from LA & NY).

The wait staff was friendly and attentive, but not all overbearing and gave a great recommendation for a bar to go to following our meal.

Go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Columbian food in style! I tried this place because I kept seeing Groupon deals for them. Now we just keep going back...
The food is amazing and you must try the recommendations from the server since some things you may have never heard of before! Have not yet had a bad dish there! Very nice environment and friendly service! This is a true gem in Lakewood! Will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I went to this place due to a voucher purchased from Groupon.

It is a very small place but wow is it amazing! The staff is very helpful and nice. Being our first time there the waitress explained the menu and even made suggestions.

We tried the Chicken Arepa and Cuban Sandwich. Both items were WONDERFUL! The Cuban is a foot long!  The arepa was great. I am not a big corn masa fan but theirs are not as strong, and it is more like a crispy pita, than a corn tortilla. 

Parking is a little difficult. We had to park down a side street and walk to the location. But it was well worth the walk. 

I can not wait to go back and try other items. The food the people got at the table next to us looked very tasty."}
{"text":"Every trip has been pleasurable. Great atmosphere (love the love music), food, and drinks. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service is not that great. My husband and I had a steak maduro, which was really good and a decent size and price ($15). We went on a Sunday and had no problem getting a table, we ordered water and beers together with the food but our waitress forgot to bring the drinks, we had to ask somebody else. Another waiter brought our dishes (which is not a problem at all), our waitress never came back to ask about our food or to ask if we needed anything else or the check."}
{"text":"As a New York Colombian, I have had my experience of delicious Colombian food both in NY and Colombia.  Let me tell you--Barroco may have the best Colombian food in the world.  I've never had empanadas with such a perfect crust.  Their ahi was even better than my dad's (sorry dad).  The dipping sauces were all great and different.  It was an amazing take on traditional Colombian food with a modern update.  We were in Cleveland for 48 hours and went twice."}
{"text":"My first visit (definitely not my last) to Barroco!   I had originally wanted to have a family birthday dinner here, but unfortunately they don't take reservations and we were planning for at least 8 people.  So I made a reservation elsewhere for the birthday dinner, but thought that my daughter's and I would kick-off my celebration a day early and visit during happy hour.  We are SO glad that we did!   The place is pretty small, but parking was pretty easy and we were seated right away, even thought the restaurant was pretty full at 5:15 on a Friday evening.  Our server approached immediately.   We placed our drink orders, and food orders.  I had Sangria, which was yummy and happy hour priced at $5.00.  We order 1/2 priced happy hour appetizers....empanadas and guacamole.  We also ordered arepas, for our entrees.   The appetizers and drinks arrived a short time later, and everything was delicious.  The empanadas, although fried, were not at all greasy and were very flavorful, accompanied by homemade salsa and guacamole.  The guacamole was accompanied by tostones and tortilla chips.   Our entrees arrrived, and my steak arepa was stuffed with tender beef, corn, cheese.  The 5 sauces that are placed at each table were the perfect accompaniment.  I enjoyed the spicy with my arepa and the ketchup mayo with my fries.  The portions were generous and price was right!   I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Probably 5th or 6th time visiting and the consistency and quality makes this one of my favorite places in CLE. I've tried a lot on the menu and so far my favorites are the Empanadas & Cubano sandwich. Might sound \"dumb\" but when you get the sauces ... mix the spicy Thai with the garlic & dip your empanadas or whatever you're having in it  ."}
{"text":"A little small on the inside, but the food was amazing! My first time eating Columbian food and I was impressed. The empanadas were delicious and the chorizo arepa was spicy, but tasty. Will most definitely go back."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here. You must celebrate your birthday here as the birthday crew is top-notch!

The food was all super amazing. They make street food a delicacy. When I bit into my arepa the blanket over my taste buds was thrust away as it awoke from a long hibernation.

Come early. Even with a reservation we had to wait a bit since the location is small. But do not  despair, IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. The decor is unbelievable and everything is authentic Columbian, even 99% of the staff.

After your meal, you even have the option to write your name with your crew anywhere in the restaurant for a great memory.

I'd come again with no hesitation."}
{"text":"We have been to Barroco twice and will make this a regular place to eat. Food was fresh, delicious, prepared well and good size portions. French fries were plentiful and crispy! Loved the arepas. I got the veggie arepa which was stuffed with all kinds of tender crisp veggies and cheese. Sauces on the side. I also got the black bean soup which was so good, we ordered another one to go for dinner later. The soup came with fried cornmeal bread. All homemade. 
Very clean place, although small. Waitress and all the people working there were very friendly.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to fill up on great tasting freshly made Columbian food!"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing! The cheesy corn is out of this world! I've never had anything like it. When you first walk in it looks kind of small and it is kind of small.Quaint even. The seating  is very close together So if you are not a fan of small places or being crammed in with a bunch of other people this is not the place for you. However, if you can live through the cramped feeling, all the food is excellent! When I'm back in the Cleveland area I definitely plan on stopping in again. I miss good food."}
{"text":"This place is damn delicious. I love that their food is actually different than a lot of restaurants. The Patacons or Maduros are really damn good. Now I want to go there just thinking about it. The service has always been awesome and I really like the small cozy atmosphere in there."}
{"text":"Wow. We came here for Valentine's Day/anniversary and it was soooo good. Love the plantains mixed with savory meat. It's Byob! The service here is AMAZING! Our server gave us some rest suggestions I had the steak Madura and he has the tops vieja and iwe were very pleased!! I am so happy with this place if you can't tell already. Also has a fabulous atmosphere! You will be missing out if you don't come by."}
{"text":"For our \"fancy night out\" dinner, we chose Barroco, at the recommendation of a helpful bartender nearby (and yes, we went back for lunch and tipped well to thank her). 

The atmosphere of Barroco grabs you right off the bat.  It's dark.  Not \"spooky, lurking figures in the shadows with cudgels\" dark, but \"appropriately dim and romantic, with candles in all the right places to illuminate just enough to see\" dark.  Our server was pleasant and accommodating, with plenty of suggestions, but in the end, I had to try the short ribs, and boy, was I happy with my selection. 

On a trip where I enjoyed pretty much everything I put into my mouth, the short ribs at Barroco were probably up there at the top of the list.  I grow ravenous e'en now as I recall their tender, moist and rich flavor and texture, and while the presentation was a bit slap-dash, I couldn't have really cared less.  I've found a restaurant that competes with Stella for \"best short ribs ever\", and I don't care who knows it.  

The lovely atmosphere, great food, and helpful waitstaff are all very positive recommendations - though it is a teeny bit more expensive than you might want it to be, as a treat for an out-of-town fancy dinner, Barroco is a great bet."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, drinks could be better, but overall definitely a good neighborhood spot. Loved seeing older couples dancing to salsa and tango."}
{"text":"The hype around Barroco set the bar high for my first visit, and I thought that with all the business on a Thursday night there was no way the combination of food + decor + service could live up to it. But less than 10 minutes after walking through the narrow entryway, I was knocked off my feet, had a $5 Pina Colada* in one hand, the other deep in a bowl of chips, and fell in love. (*Look out for other $5 Happy Hour deals throughout the weekdays!)

The menu is a dangerous tome of catchy Latin names and tantalizing pictures - I didn't know where to look, much less what to order. The solution? Bring friends, lots of friends, who don't mind sharing. Or one friend who shares your problem of portion control. Especially if you plan to indulge in one of the monstrous Merengadas desserts.

We finally settled on Fajitas con Arepa, and Ropa Vieja Arepa w/ Yuca Fries**. Both dishes were photoshoot ready and popping with tender, juicy flavor. The Ropa Vieja puts all other pulled meat to shame, while the tortilla triangles were puffy like pita bread and stuffed with cheese. I don't even like cheese. But I honestly couldn't get enough of this. The Maduros were a sweet treat, slightly caramelized on the outside and not soggy as is so easy to do when cooking en masse. Yuca Fries reign supreme over French fries in my heart, and Barroco's did not disappoint. Every main course is served with a basket of 6 different sauces to dip, mix, and match as pleased. The cilantro aoili was the evening's favorite, but the pineapple was a close second!
(**We actually were served Maduros, but after pointing out the mistake they just left them for us to enjoy without switching them out for the Yuca Fries.)

The hospitality at Barroco felt like being at your hip friend/aunt's um, garage party? The graffiti art fits in with the colorful vibe. The covered patio strung with lights feels a little grungy, a little edgy. The merch and signature-covered wall next to the cashier's is proudly welcomes people of all walks of life. Unfortunately, the only women's restroom is also along this wall, but you'll have plenty of time to read all the messages and admire the various awards Barroco has won over the years. 

I was a little sad walking out to the cashier to close out our tab, so you can imagine how excited I am about the new location a stone's throw away from me in Larchmere. If they've learned from all their years of consistently on-point delivery, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I write this review with a heavy heart and stomach as my expectations for Barroco were high after eating at their Lakewood location. At first glance, everything at Larchmere seemed to hit equally high marks. Friendly staff, cute front and back patios, live music, and the free-for-all marker wall. They don't have a liquor license yet, so until then it's BYOB and the liquor shop across the street gets to reap the benefits.

We had to wait a bit for our party of 4 since this Barroco also doesn't take reservations, but it was a nice evening and the music was shimmy-able. One glance told us the menu survived the transplant in one piece as well. 

A table along the wall with bench-style seating opened up and we knew to order the Cheesy Corn appetizer from previous recommendations. It was a hearty start that should definitely be split among 3+ people if you each plan on getting your own entree as well. Our waitress was very attentive during this time. Since they ran out of wine glasses, she brought us little Mason jars for our wine, and our water glasses were refilled on a regular basis even though we were sitting in the corner of the room.

From here though, things started going downhill. It had been busy on arrival, but the dining room emptied to 1/3 capacity and all 4 of us were wondering where our entrees were as other diners came and went. The musicians packed up. Wine glasses bottomed out. Just as we were planning to check in after 40+ minutes, the waitress appeared with our entrees. The much anticipated Chorizo Arepa was filled with burnt meat and the Cocacola Rice was bland compared to the popping flavors we experienced at our last visit. La Gringa Arepa was decent, but the ultra juicy beef in the Arepa Burger was probably the saving grace of dinner. And of course, we had the faithful sauces to rely on. 
**As one Yelper has tipped, mix the Pineapple sauce with any of the other ones to pimp it up a notch.**


A few words from a guest Yelper who also dined with us that evening:
What were you expecting going in?
I was yearning for the crispy yuca and mouth-watering chorizo that had wowed me at their Lakewood location just weeks before. 

What was the highlight of the evening? The worst part?
My friend left her Angus arepa unattended as she got up to go to the bathroom, allowing me to take one savory bite. Her cold leftovers were lightyears ahead of the bland cocacola rice and burnt chorizo that had come \"fresh\".

Would you go back?
I'm not sure if we ordered the wrong things that night, so I would give it one more shot. But if Barroco disappoints again, I'd go back only if McDonald's discontinues their value menu."}
{"text":"This was our second visit but First after their expansion. The place is huge now. Good vibe. Menu has expanded as well. We went on a Wednesday so $5 margarita all day. It was yummy. They have 5 signature sauces that can be added to the food giving a wide range of flavors. Food is reasonably priced and portions are huge. Borroco skewers were grilled very well. The chicken arepa with black bean soup was flavorful. Ambience is trendy. Efficient service. Looks like it is dog friendly. Didn't see a kids menu. Lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Literally the most authentic Latin American food in the city and the BEST sangria. I crave pitchers of it on a warm day!!! The service is always super friendly and the food is truly fresh and flavorful--you cannot go wrong with anything. It has the most casual, chill- yet fun vibe. There are a decent amount of options on the menu so there is something to please just about any taste bud. Live music on the weekends and good weekly specials. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Great Food!

It's usually fun to go to a \"Bring your own booze\" kinda place, but Barroco is much more than that. It all starts with the heavy, artsy, bohemian decor; the painter that's actually painting as you dine (or the live band playing tropical hits). When you get your food you get the best of surprises: unpretentious food with deceivingly complex flavors. Finally, when the check comes, it brings the last pleasant surprise of the evening. 

Barroco is probably the coolest place to dine in Lakewood, and a secret that the East Side of Cleveland yet to know about.  Just be patient, because it's BUSY and for a weekend dinner there will be a wait (and the place is small). But it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"After a disastrous situation with our accommodation in Montreal, it was clear that the girlfriend and I needed comfort.  Soul-soothing.  Seriously, anything to take our minds off the previous 12 hours of ridiculousness (think gross sheets, malfunctioning toilet, the works).  Yelp to the rescue: dinner for two at Barroco.

We were seated at the bar, waited upon by Max the bartender, who quickly had our wine glasses filled and our orders sent to the kitchen.  It can get dicey when trying to serve four unique parties at the same time, but Max handled it like a pro.  The restaurant itself was gorgeous; intimate lighting, gold-framed mirrors, blackened brick walls made for a chic yet cozy feel, an ambiance perfected by few.

The Mediterranean Branzini was utter perfection - with a side of risotto (Max's recommendation), it was the perfect meal.  I liked that the fish was slightly undercooked, giving it this awesome texture that's hard to describe.  She had the home-made black pasta with mashed potatoes, which tasted like home.

Liking the place so much, we brought a few friends back for late-night drinks.  Highlights were the maple Old Fashioned and the cucumber mojito.  Apparently they make their own cranberry juice here, fresh crans/simple syrup mashed right before mixing.  Will have to try that at home some time!

If you're looking for a fantastic dining experience, look no further.  This place embodies the 5/5 rating."}
{"text":"Food was very good, plates were large, and the waitstaff was pretty responsive.  

Note that it is a pretty small building and seems fairly popular, so expect a bit of a wait if showing up during peak hours.  Also, it's a street parking location."}
{"text":"Our waiter was so so friendly and made excellent recommendations when the entire menu all looked appealing. Love those maduras!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and artistic environment. Friendly staff. The pocket sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"Have heard bout this place for years and just didn't go because they do not take rezos and I hate 2 wait! Finally went and had to wait but only bout 15 min. I believe this spot is run by a large family. Everyone was friendly and provided good service. Restraint itself is a lil small but we dug the vibe and enjoyed the live acoustic music. Tons of food , yummy drinks. Recommend the Empanadas W a lot of yummy dipping sauces. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I love the variety of sauces they give you to try with your meal. The food is always delicious. One of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Exceptional, friendly service. This was my first time at this location as well as my first time eating Colombian food. I was with a small group, so we ordered the tostadas con todo to share and I had the chicken arepa. The plantain chips were amazing; I had had plantain chips before but nothing similar to the larger, heartier ones they serve here. Must try all the sauces that come with the meal, you can't go wrong with any of them; my personal favorite was the spicy peanut. I wouldn't consider myself to be a big pork fan, but the hogado here is flavorful and tender enough to melt in the mouth. Great portion sizes, everything tasted fresh and extra points for traditional drinks such as the Colombian coffee. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My favorite go to restaurant in Old Montreal.  I sit at the bar and have the plate of the day and one of the best martini's.  The plate of the day is always unique with the freshest meat or fish and vegetables.  Last Tuesday night, I had fresh grilled asparagus, slices of avocado, and branzino.  Their paella cooked with lobster stock, steak tartare, steak, whatever you order you will not be disappointed.  Great atmosphere and I love all the music they play which is a combination of nostalgic rock n roll and jazz. Excellent service by Chris, Rachel and all."}
{"text":"The food is great! The portions are deceiving. They appear small but are sure to fill you up. Very inexpensive. B.Y.O.B and sign your name on the wall. All they need is more space, an extra bathroom, and an alternate route to the bathroom instead of through the kitchen."}
{"text":"Wasn't as good as everyone says it is, overpriced, wouldnt be able to enjoy it without the 6 sauces they provide, but i guess it was ok."}
{"text":"Just...wow. The atmosphere, food and drinks were amazing. Best sangria I have ever tasted! The arepas were so delicious and extremely filling. We got the bacon-wrapped plantains as an appetizer, incredible! 

My only real complaint was the chairs. They were very uncomfortable, with bars that dug into my hips. 

We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"The location is easily accessible off of I-90 or I-480 and is located in an up and coming area, so lock your doors. The food is very good, and the service, while a little clumsy, is attentive and pleasant.

Get the guacamole. It is perfect. The prices are a little high imho, but if you're looking for a bargain, go to Burger King, they're right on W 117."}
{"text":"This place has been open since August and shame, shame,  shane on me for just now visiting!
Family owned and operated, with a few friends in their new East side location in eclectic Larchmere,  it is a welcomed spot to hang.

Family Angie,  is a fresh breath to help you navigate the broad and extensive menu. She is honest with sharing the 411 on what is more filling, what is a lighter fare and what you must absolutely need to order today or next visit.

We ordered the Sancocho de Dona Liliana Sopa (soup) deconstructed with a bowl of rice,  sliced avacados and an aji salsa to mix as you enjoy. Served HOT and savory... Yum tum tum!

The Arepas are enough for me to eat dinner,  and share the leftovers the next day with my Mommy!

The Bosa Nova and Latin Vibe's are filling the air with incredible free music,  no cover!

Oh,  last but certainly not least...the Bartenders are on point with the cocktails! Ooo, are they lovely!
Tequila shots come in a squeezed out lime!

Will i return... Oh hell yes! Will be one of my new stomping grounds! I could go on and on...
Come support local!"}
{"text":"We had a very different experience and very disappointed. We booked a table for 8 and they didn't have a table that big so they ask us to go to next door at Bocata and they can serve foie gras for us. We did agree because the foie gras for this restaurant was rated by Montreal Blog top 16 restaurant. When we got the foie gras it was a paste. This was the only evening we had left in Montreal. I wish they specific what they are serving. Otherwise we wouldn't be there."}
{"text":"I remember when this place got bought and renovated and made into the Barroco Grill from the old Mama Mia's pizza or whatever it was. About a month in I walked in to have something to eat. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich that was dipped in hot sauce(they had this at the time when they opened by not anymore). It was amazingly delicious nice big potions. I came again after that, got a buffalo chicken arepa, amazing, fabulous, just AWESOME. The Arepa is a very original corn bread? That they make to of course make their specialty sandwiches. YOU CANT GET THIS ANYWHERE ELSE. I've been going here for well over 3 years.

The atmosphere is very friendly, very Latin with it's music, interior design, and of course it's food. The staff are very friendly, from the owners to the servers to even cooks, all very friendly people who love to talk to their customers and connect with them. They are a shining example of what small business restaurants should be like."}
{"text":"The venison was extraordinary! The rest of the dinner party reached a concensus, the food was very good and well worth the price! I had the rib steak and maybe it's cause I was pretty hungry but this could have been one of the best steaks I had in mtl.  This is my fourth five star review!"}
{"text":"Very small inside.  Food is great! Its something you can't find everywhere.  Make sure you try all of the sauce options. Order the chorizo arepa and thank me later. BYOB!  They have a new location opening soon on W6th downtown."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for delicious food. Authentic and fun. Great service. And a nice craft beer selection now."}
{"text":"Meh is the word. 

Usually Groupon does better. 

This place was terrible. I got a burger (I did not feel like a pairing of mozarella and chorizo yuck) it had the usual tomato, cheese, lettuce, and it also had potato chips. Well you would think with the extra salt of the potato chips it would have enough salt. Well the burger was soggy and bland. I can deal with a greasy burger as long as it tastes good but this was BLAND! The sauce was glorified thousand island dressing. The fries were frozen from a bag and were beyond overcooked. He had the buffalo chicken arepa. A corn pita. The buffalo sauce was meh. The after the fact sauces (their special blend of condiments) were the one redeeming item. They were tasty. Granted they were mayo with spices but they were yummy. We were told we had to try the cheesy corn. The corn was cheese sauce (kinda like qdoba's 3 cheese nacho sauce) with some frozen corn and bacon. It was runny, too rich, and most certainly not worth 6 bucks. 

Now if the food weren't meh enough you had the service. It was SLOW. not slow and steady wins the race, it was we are incompetent slow. 4 people in the kitchen could not manage to make the food for the maybe 7 tables in the place in a timely manner. A burger and arepa took 45 minutes!? Really people?! 

The groupon made it ok. Paying full price for this place would have been a colossal waste.

{"text":"Still new. But already great.  BYO until they get a liquor license (which is a plus for me, though the drink menu looks very good).  Great food (apps are awesome and arepas are also good), excellent service.  Kid friendly (at least it was tonight). AMAZING atmosphere - customers bring good vibe, and live music really delivers.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Forgot to take photos....   The vibe is authentic Columbia.  Food is outstanding and the drinks flow freely."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an excellent meal, service and ambiance!  Great flavors and spices! Our waiter was wonderful and the portions abundant. We called ahead and were seated following about a five minute wait.  Seriously, the food was great and well worth the drive from the East Side!"}
{"text":"We tried this place after purchasing a Groupon, and we are glad we did.  We tried the Ropa Vieja and the Cuban Sandwich, both of which met our expectations.  I was excited about the variety of flavorful sauces made available with my sandwich.  We will likely try it again.  I'd like to try the black bean soup for sure, and now that we know about the BYOB option, we may take advantage of that as well.  

First experience there was a good one.  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Cleveland. They have great happy hour options.   The hot dog sandwiches are great. Drinks were good and service is great too."}
{"text":"Was invited to this place by my boss for a business lunch. Knowing my  previous experience I really tried to keep an open mind and give it a fresh chance. 

Going with someone who understood the menu, I was helped with what to order and what is what. This time around the food was much better. I had the Mexicana Aprena with yuca fries and it was great! The sauces were amazing. I couldn't decide which one was my favorite. The price point was still a little high for a sandwich though.

The service was, as others mentioned, extremely poor. I think they had one girl running the entire lunch shift. She just seemed over whelmed. Took forever to be initially greeted, another while for drinks. About 30 minutes for the food order to be placed, and another 30 before we were served food. My drink was constantly empty, and I never got the box I asked for. Our lunch experience lasted 2 hours from start to finish, which is just unacceptable.

They had two specials on their special sheet but we're out of both..... So why bring the special sheet over at all? Also had no juice of the day. 

Although my experience was better than before. I'm still unlikely to return."}
{"text":"This place hits the mark on so many levels. Location wise, it's perfect. It's on a charming, slightly less trafficked section on the far west side of Old Montreal. It's open air and a beautifully designed space. The interior atmosphere is rustic, but not stuffy (judging by the wild boar on the wall that's proudly wearing a #foiegras hat). 

Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Everything we tried was great. Taste of Summer was a great starter. The Paella is excellent. Probably the favorite dish overall was the shortribs. Just incredible all around. The Maple Old Fashioned sounded like it could be gross and overly sweet on paper, but worked really well.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Had a totally authentic Mojito, highly recommend.  And for main meal ordered the Mexicans Arepa which was spicy and hot...woohoo. If you like heat and spice DO IT. Our waitress, Ellie, was superb."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but 1 star because it's outrageously expensive for what you get. Latin street food at fine dining price. $28 for limo saltado... beef tips, fries, vegs and rice. You gotta be kidding me."}
{"text":"An angelic choir started singing when the chorizo entered my mouth.........beautiful restaurant, kind and friendly staff, amazing food and drink."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fabulous meal here the evening of our 20th wedding anniversary.
A small, intimate, romantic setting matched by truly fine cuisine make this a must-go-to-place when visiting Montreal.
My wife had the foie grois and I had the short ribs, I cannot recommend the short ribs enough!! Highly recommended."}

{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing!! Very charming place! Service was great! You could really taste the freshness and quality of the ingredients! Their arepas are to die for! It's very cultured! I felt like I stepped into a vacation spot in Colombia! I can't wait to come back!"}

1. a corn pancake, sweetened or unsweetened, eaten in Venezuela and Colombia.
2. a life-changing food experience that will have you stuffing your gullet like you're at a Survivor food reward

I had no idea. Like most white guys raised in suburban America the word wasn't even in my lexicon. And I thought I was happy. I was wrong. I entered Barroco as a boy and left as a man.

Tucked into a tiny little house on Madison Avenue, Barroco is single-handedly bringing South American comfort food to the Cleveland masses. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile. The hostess was friendly, how about that? To the left, the kitchen pumped out aromas I had never experienced. How could smells that big come out of a space no bigger than a closet? The front of the house belies what comes next. We walked down a hall, walls littered with scribblings of customers past, to the back room. This is where the true personality lives. Painted walls, nightclub dark, hanging lights, music full of bongos and zzzzt da da zzzzt dum. A tiny two-top table against the wall beckoned us. We sat.

The menu is concise. We were starving. The perfect combination. The stars of Barroco are definitely the arepas - sliced in half and stuffed with spicy combinations of fresh vegetables, meats and cheeses that will have you feeling, if just for a moment, that you're hosting your own Bourdain-esque Travel Channel show, wandering the streets of Bogota, making couch potatoes jealous. We started with the empanadas. Crispy dough shells, sort of like South American pierogi, stuffed with potatoes and shredded beef and deep fried. You get four of them with some guac and salsa verde. A meal on their own or perfect for two.

So what's this about the sauces? When they bring out your food it's accompanied by a carousel of squirt bottle magnificence. The five sauces, spicy peanut, pineapple, chimichurri, garlic and ranchero, should be bottled and sold at every store in Cleveland. I found myself putting them on tortilla chips and eating them on their own. Be forewarned, with the exception of the super-sweet pineapple, the sauces are full of heat so they will get your attention. One recommendation? Label the bottles. 

Of course we got arepas. You get a choice of a side and believe me, you are getting plenty of food. The sides, tortilla chips, fries, black bean soup and red bean chili. Let's talk about how it went down:

Arepa Puerca and tortilla chips - The innards, chicharron (pork rinds), beans, chicken and mozzarella. A perfectly spiced textural cumbia. The tender chicken, the stringy mozz it all worked. A slight misstep in execution, the chicharron became rubbery bits, soggy from the rest of the mix. Find a way to keep those crunchy and you've got a hit. The yellow corn tortilla chips were warm and dusted with a spicy powder. Great for sampling all of the squirtable sauces.

Ropa Vieja Arepa and red bean chili- Old clothes? I think not. I was blown away by the flavors crammed inside the flat corn pocket. Shredded beef, potatoes, black beans, rice, roasted red peppers, sweet tomato sauce, Feta and mozz. Spicy, sweet and ridiculously addicting. The red bean chili, topped with white rice and salsa verde was mild and delicious.

I'm typically hesitant to try places with such stellar Yelp ratings. Mostly because I'm really picky and inevitably I wind up disappointed. This place was definitely an exception. The food was amazing and unexpected. Eat this and your brain can't help but create new connections. It's culinary neuroplasticity. Our server was delightful, constantly refilling drinks and always smiling and the atmosphere was festive and cultural without being corny. I get why they've thrived and I will be back - just as soon as my distended belly has had some time to recover.

As an aside, I want to share what I believe to be a moment of brilliant customer service. We had a slight issue with a few of our empanadas, perhaps as a result of the kitchen's want to expedite our eating experience. I brought it to the attention of our server and it was handled with class, humility and expedience. Not only was the dish remade and brought back to our table the entire item was removed from our bill, at their insistence, no questions asked. I was made at once both speechless and a return customer."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service   also have special on cocktails, I had a mojito that was excellent and 5$ every Monday"}
{"text":"Brilliant,  the bartender Max is amazing.  Order an old fashioned.  The fish was stellar, the oysters were fantastic.  I am a NYC restraunt snob and this place kills it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Well. I would like to say something good about this establishment, I am unable to do so. We arrived and were promptly seated outside, several tables were seated after us. We waited for a server, but they seemed to wait on everyone else around us, even those seated after us. After being seated and watching everyone around us get drinks and waited on, and patiently waiting 20 minutes we got up and left. On leaving we told the two ladies at the desk that we never got service. They neglected to apologize or simply even care. I will not be going back and will not be recommending this anytime soon. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Now that I have found Barroco, I want to keep this gem of a place hidden from everyone else.  But then again that would not be fair to Barroco or to the rest of the yelp community.   I'm not one to easily give an eatery 5 star but Barroco deserves every single star from me. 

Barroco is a very unassuming of a place both from the outside and inside.  Tucked away on Madison avenue, you would miss it in a blink if you were not specifically looking for it.  They have converted, what seems like, the ground floor of a small house (that comes complete with a driveway to the back of the house for very select parking spots).  Inside the decor is pleasant with only about 2 dozen seating spots along with a few right at the counter opposite to the open kitchen.  The indoor decor is nothing to write home about although some of the pictures that adorn the walls are interesting mix of modern-abstract art.

What makes Barroco such a gem of a place are its food and the friendliness of the kitchen as well as serving staff.  From the moment you walk in,  even if its busy you feel a sense of down-home, welcome-to-our-kitchen-in-which-we-proudly-serve-some-special-food ambiance.  The serving staff are friendly and actually take an interest in you by chatting you up.   Despite the close quarters, Barroco creates a cozy atmosphere where they let their shining star - food, speak for themselves.

My first visit (I'm sure it is a start of a trail of many visits) got me to try their AREPAS (grilled all-white corn tortilla) stuffed with a variety of meat/non-meat fixings.  One look at the first page of their menu easily lets you take your pick.  From the first bit to the last,  I could not put down my Chorizo Arepa ( with grilled onions, green peppers, and mozzarella), especially with couple squeeze of their chimichuri sauce in it.   The chorizo was moist and had a great kick to it.  The whole combination was an excellent combination of flavors.   The Chicken AREPAS was oh so delicious just as that of the previous one.  The AREPAS themselves alone could be a little on the dry side.  One important point to keep in mind - AREPAS are not meant to be eaten by themselves, they are always to be paired with fixings and sauces.   In the past I have found some eateries offering limp AREPAS that when paired with fixings simply fall apart.  Barroco  I feel,  has found the right recipe and right grilled preparation of the AREPAS that hold well when stuffed and provide a great combination of crunch and texture to the stuffing. 

We also tried the AREPA fries crunchy on the outside but potato french fries like softness on the inside.  When paired with the any of the 5 different sauces served on every table, where mouth watering.   We ended the meal with beautifully served Ice Cream served with Strawberry compote, in a ceramic ice-cream cone shaped bowl (cone).  I could not find this on their menu, however, it was a surprise as compliments of the house.   

Barroco is a must go for enjoying some really tasty South American cuisine in a  casual atmosphere.  They have a BYOB policy,  pair their food with your favorite red wine or sangria, and you have a winning combination.  You don't feel rushed at Barroco but do be generous to the staff and other patrons in sharing the space, and if you happen to see me waiting for a seat, please be so kind and offer me a seat at your table.  I promise to be a great company.  :-)"}
{"text":"How have I not paid homage to Barroco yet? I've been here a handful of times and always order the same exact thing (Arepa Puerca con maduros) because it's too delicious to stray from!
Everything from the decor and music to the array of yummy sauces are fun, quirky, and fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Ambiance is super cozy with live music playing. Food was bursting with flavor."}
{"text":"This place was top notch. Came recommended from our Hotel lobby man. A good distance from the tourist traps. The service was quick, friendly and the waiter was extremely knowledgable ( also happened to be the sommelier). The Wine he recommended was excellent and he stated that the short ribs were excellent. I can say there was nothing short about the ribs. By far the BEST short ribs I have ever had! No knife needed. The garlic potatoes were a bit too garlicky and (dare I say it?) too creamy. 
  My wife ordered the fresh pasta dish and that was excellent too. 
  The ambiance was great and seemed just the right size for a restaurant. 
My recommendation is- if your in Montreal, Go Now!!  I don't believe there is a bad dish on the Menu.

  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Barroco! I crave their arepas on the regular. The chorizo arepa and Hawaiian arepa are both pretty much the bomb. I haven't tried much else on the menu because I am in love with these, but I'm sure everything else is awesome, too.  The staff is great - very friendly and accommodating. They packed up about 20 sauces for us when we ordered carryout without any question or rolling of the eyes. :)"}
{"text":"Ate here with friends on Sunday drinks were good service was not waitress would take long to come and check on us saw her standing in the kitchen talking we ordered our food it was ok but we waited about an hour maybe longer for our food will be awhile before I return"}
{"text":"We read very good review and decided to try it. Servoce is excellemt and our waiter was top of the top. Food was 10 out of 10.
We had a winter sald magnificent and cold meat entry super tasty. 
Main course: i had the pork rib that was as soft as ever I had before and an incredible taste.
My boyfriend had pork chops which were excellent and with a touch of botarga which sounds crazy maybe being fosh but was a perfect choice. Too full for dessert... aperitives were excellent too as the glass of French red wine. We will be back."}
{"text":"Terrific atmosphere with music and great food. Loved the chorizo arepas. Good guacamole with plantain and tortilla chips.  Sauces for the arepas were all taste sensations. First time here and will be back soon."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Barroco Grill.

The first thing I noticed was, \"WOW, they raised the prices, and by A LOT.\"  I'm glad I wasn't the only one to notice, as the table that sat down next to us made the exact same comment. It's one thing to raise an entree 50 cents or a dollar, but some of these items went from 8 bucks to 12 bucks with smaller portions! Needless to say this place has been dropped from my \"I don't feel like cooking and want to grab a good, but cheap dinner\" list. 

The Arepas are good, but not worth 12 bucks. The food is greasy and the place is kind of a hole in the wall. Hence, if I want to spend at least $15 for a dinner, I'd rather go to a place with a nice atmosphere and gourmet food. If I want greasy street food, I'd gladly pay $5-8 in a hole in the wall. Unfortunately Barroco Grill doesn't fit either of those."}
{"text":"Long ago I had my first arepas in Caracas. They were served as the bread at every meal. They were warm, soft cakes made of finely ground corn flour that needed the melted butter for flavor. Quite forgettable. 

Not too long ago I found arepas for sale at festivals and farmers' markets all over Florida.  In Florida they take two of the soft cakes, which also contain kernels of corn, place a soft melting cheese between the arepas and slowly heat them on a grill. Boy did I like them.

Thanks to yelp when I searched for sandwiches in Lakewood I discovered Barroco. I went there yesterday afternoon and experienced a  third type of arepa. Not as soft as the previous two but far more variety in fillings. Not sure I prefer this crispier arepa but I sure know I like the fillings. I had a beef arepa with the works. Every bite was a bit better than the previous bite. I squirted any and all of the five sauces after each bite. Seem to favor mixing them over using just one taste.

The room is quite cheerful despite the dark walls, but the most cheery parts of the experience are the cook and the young woman at the counter. She is desperately needed by the Cleveland Public Schools to give seminars on how to behave in public places.

Low prices, good food, and pleasant help make me know this will become a regular stop as I drive from Tommy's Bakery to the perogies sold at Sts. Peter and Paul Orthodox Church."}
{"text":"I went on my first trip to Montreal.  We went with a group and had French speaking guests, which was good because the waitress spoken broken english at best :).  The restaurant is small - not many tables and no space between the tables, but it was still a good experience/atmopshere - rustic and dark, but you didn't feel like you were on top of everyone (even though you were).  The menu is pretty small, but good selections and the portions were good sized.  Great Old Montreal restaurant - definitely make a reservation if you have more than 1-2 people and/or don't want to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Food is incredible.  Service is excellent.  Portions are quite large. They serve alcohol now. Four solid tap selections and a full bar.  Wife had the pulled pork Arepas with a side of Madura. I had the Crema Patacon. Awesome sauce with mushrooms and chicken served on a savory plantain crisp.  Whole lotta food.  Good stuff. Would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Inside this quaint stone facade is one of the best meals we have had in a long, long time.  Order the dry aged rib eye. I've never found better. Also, the drink menu is in an old book that they call the bible. It's beautiful, artsy and unique. The staff is fabulous."}
{"text":"I looove this place! I really can't wait to go back, I had a great experience.

The food was incredible! We got the chorizo arepa and steak arepa, as well as the cheesy corn. The cheesy corn was insanely good - anything that combines corn and cheese and bacon is a winner in my eyes. And the sauces that came with the arepas were delicious! I loved the pineapple sauce with the chorizo, and the spicy peanut sauce was perfect with the steak. If they bottled those sauces, I'd buy all five of them.  Besides their regular menu, there's also a gourmet menu on wine bottles on the table, and everything on that menu looked delicious as well.

The dining area is small, but it definitely added to the funky charm of this place. The servers were friendly and cheerful. Love!"}
{"text":"The first time to Barroco Grill, won't be the last time to Barroco.  I went to work bragging about the food and the entire experience.  Excellent!!! Buen Hecho mis amigos."}
{"text":"I have always heard good things about Barroco, so I came here with my family for a late dinner on a week night and we enjoyed it very much. We all ordered something different, so there were 4 dishes to sample from, each one just as good as the next. 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros arepa. It came on a cheesy arepa with delicious chorizo, black beans, and a fried egg. I chose the black bean soup as my side item, and it was great. Next time I'll try the red bean chili, as it looked really good in other yelpers' photos. 

They also bring out 6 different sauces for the table. One of the most interesting was a sweet pineapple sauce almost like a jelly. I liked the garlic sauce best though. 

The service was friendly and everyone was very nice. It took a long time to get our food, and they brought out one of the wrong dishes to our table, but since the food was excellent I'm still giving a 5-star review."}
{"text":"Funky Atmosphere, Terrific Food & Crafted Cocktails made for an enjoyable experience.

We started with Mojito's and they were really good!
The house made Guac was spot on & Plantain chips were unique and different than your average chip.
The Braised Beef and the chorizo sausage were both fantastic and i would highly recommend either one with many of the meal choices here.  .
The Sweet Plantains with the Pineapple Sauce was a sweet finish to a great meal."}
{"text":"Visit this restaurant frequently but the last few times have been horrible. 15 minutes to get the waters we ordered. The last two times orders have been messed up with incorrect sides and have had to wait longer to get food because the waitress did not write down the order and then gave the cooks the wrong one. Will continue to come here because the food is so fresh and delicious but hoping to have better experiences in the future."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best resturant around. Everything about this place is awesome. The service, the atmosphere and the food is out of this world. Call ahead if you are going to have more than 4 in your dinner party and they will try to accomadate. It's a very rough reservation, but it helps when the line is out the door. They have something on the menu for everyone, highly recommend checking this out!"}
{"text":"Please note : I can only comment on the drinks, staff, and ambiance of this place ;) we did not come here for the food on this particular night

As a group of three ladies in town to celebrate a 30th birthday, we were happy to stumble upon this place after getting the \"no\" vibe from Flygin (shady club) across the street.

Christophe is an amazing bartender and can literally concoct anything you feel like imbibing. He was witty, warm, knowledgeable, and friendly. I enjoyed all of the fancy drinks he created for us that evening, including \"The Candice,\" a delicious blood orange cocktail, named after my birthday girl best friend. Be sure to order it next time!

The staff and owners here make you feel very at ease and welcome, and we spent a very long time hanging out and enjoying the AWESOME playlist. Seriously, the music was killer - a mix of old school hip hop, pop, and even some local Quebecois jams. We stayed until the wee hours and had one of the most fun experiences of our lives.

Thank you, Barroco, we intend to return next time and try the food!! ;)"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Sat outside for lunch with my wife baby and mom. Good beer choices, and again, food was delicious. Cheesy corn."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was a fan from the start!

Being a former owner of a Latin restaurant, I know how tough it is to sell people on something other than the 'traditional mexican' they're used to here in Ohio. That being said, I absolutely love Latin food of all kinds, but it has to be authentic to keep me coming back...Barroco does that for me!!

Every friend I've taken there has loved it and I can't help but get my fix once every couple of weeks. The space is perfect...quaint, small, lots of local art and some of my fav Latin music to make me feel right at home. Also heard wind of some expansion of their dining room in the near future...super excited for that!! Nothing better than seeing a local business grow and prosper!

As for the staff, they're top notch! Always friendly with a smile on their face and excited to make your experience the best! I can't help but strike up a conversation every time I walk in.

The food...well lets just say out of this world! I'm so addicted I have to try a little bit of everything. I've had arepas...even better than what I served at my own restaurant, I have to say. Arepa fries...tender, moist, and the dipping sauces are to die for! The cubano...I've had a lot of them in Cleveland...this is the best! And now my newest fav, the empanadas! I am an empanada freak and am always leary about ordering them. I was way beyond empressed!! Filled with potato and shredded beef, served with limes, and a side of aji. That amount of filling is worth way more than what they charge!

Overall, I give this place way beyond 5 stars. They found a niche, found a way to work it without losing their tradition and are still making waves in the Cleveland food scene. Way to go guys...you deserve it!! keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"For the first time, I found myself out in Lakewood for a meal.  I knew we were going to Barroco, and I checked Yelp quickly before leaving to see upon what culinary adventure I was embarking.  I had never had Colombian food before, but I entered with high expectations... and left satisfied.
Barroco is located in a small house-like building, and the walls are coated in bright colors and scribbles of its past visitors, many of which are written in Spanish and praise their writers' countries of origin.  The service was average, and at times felt a bit slow, but at the same time our server was extremely helpful, asking if we had any questions and explaining the five different sauces on the wheel provided.  
We started with the cheesy corn, though neither of those two ingredients are the star of the dish.  Rather, the juicy, cheesy chicken immersed in a queso sauce in which you can dip the toasted corn triangles really shine.
I then had the chorizo arepa.  The arepa itself is a crispy, soft, yet sturdy corn shell, holding what must have been a massive amount of chorizo mixed with green peppers and onions, and somehow cheese meticulously mixed throughout to add to the flavor without being overwhelming or gooey, allowing the spicy, flavorful chorizo to be the star.  I chose the chimichurri sauce and a white sauce to dot it, but with the flavor of the chorizo it was barely necessary.  Others at my table raved about the spicy peanut sauce and the thousand-island-esque sauce.  With the arepa, I picked among the many side choices: fries, tostones, black bean soup, red bean chili and maduros-- the maduros, fried sweet plantains that tamed the spice and satisfied my sweet tooth.  The portions were large, so I brought some sandwich home for my family.  It quickly disappeared, a testament to its qualities.   Overall, it was quite the lunch, and I can't wait to return both with my family and hungrier."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place yesterday when me and my friends wanted dinner. It was as good as they said it was! The outside of the resturant looked small and simple, but once you went inside, I was impressed with the decor.The resturant decor and the food items on the menu brought an authentic atmosphere that was different compared to other Mexican resturants I have been to.

We had the cheesy corn as an appetizer and I had a steak arepa. It was amazingly delicious! The cheesy corn was very good, the arepa steak meat was very tender and everything was very fresh and flavorful. The portions were large and flavorful and I couldn't get enough of it! My arepa came with 5 different sauces and tortilla chips. I loved the ranchero and the chimichurri sauce the best, but the garlic (very garlicky!) and the pineapple sauce ( like pineapple sauce) was good as well!

The menu also showed  that the food network rated this place. I can see why, it was worth the money spent here! When your in the area, definatly go to this place, you cannot get quality food like this anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Borroca checked in and waited for and hour only to be told that that they mafe a mistake and we couldn't havw dinner tonight! WTF! Went next door to Bocata. Great place that accomodated us at the last minute! FASTISTIC FOOD, GREAT PEOPLE!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! This Colombian restaurant cooks amazing!! I had the churassco which is a flank steak with chimichurri sauce, tostones (fried plantains) and rice!! I am hispanic so I am very tough on Hispanic Restaurants. However, i felt like I was eating a home cooked meal! It was absolutely wonderful. We had the amarillos as an appetizer, which were loaded with ground beef and cheese... Perfection! I would not mind eating here every weekend if I didn't gain a pound!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place out and it just fell flat on a lot of levels. Had a break during lunch the other day and decided to try it with a friend. 
Decor / energy was good, I like larchmere, and always good to see a new place there.
Menu was fine: appetizers where a bit pricey, I also like to get an app to share generally, $12 for dips just felt high (portion was BIG but there were only two of us)
Food was a B/B-, the sauces were fun, the play on sandwich was enjoyable but not great (could be I was so mad about the service at this point I wouldn't have liked anything.)
Service. I expect lunch out during the week to be able to be done in 45 min unless I am the one taking my time or they are packed (neither was the case). We informed our very nice server that we needed to get in and get out, for a dip and 2 sandwiches it took 1h45m, I had to push a meeting and after asking for my check a few times walked up to the Register and said I need to pay you right now or I have to leave. She apologize and took payment but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. The service on occasion can be a little slow due to how packed this place gets but it's worth every bit of the wait. Be hungry when you go, don't worry about it if there's a line out the door (they usually have free tequila shots going around), and plan to take your leftovers home."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand why this place is so popular. I have been three times now, and I won't be giving it another try.

I don't mind waiting for a popular restaurant, and I expected to wait when coming on a Saturday night. I do mind, however, being told when putting our name in that there is only one table ahead of us, then twenty minutes later, being told there are only two tables ahead of us.

When we were finally sat, we were immediately moved for no reason. This happened one other visit. 

Some of the food is very good, but much of it is incredibly underwhelming, especially for the price. I had the arepa with the braised beef. The beef was, honestly, bland. A fellow diner got the Barroco burger. She asked for it medium. It came out solid brown, and the beef tasted like a pre-made, frozen patty. Another diner asked for the vegetarian arepa, with a simple substitution of avocado in place of some of the veggies that came on it. Despite the fact that it comes with cheese on the menu, it arrived with no cheese and almost no veggies. A single, thin slice of tomato, stuffed mostly with corn kernels. There are not many vegetarian friendly options.

None of the food is worth the price. There are far better ethnic eateries in Cleveland, especially Latin American cuisine. It seems like you're paying $8 for a sandwich and fries and a extra $4 for the atmosphere, which is ruined when they shout a happy birthday song like it's TGI Fridays.

Honestly, I felt very disrespected by our waitstaff, especially when they asked us to move.

Edit: I don't often complain, but when asked directly, I did mention some of the issues. The owner came to speak with me, and he was kind and apologetic. After our conversation, I would consider possibly returning, but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I liked this place so much, we went back the last night of our stay in Montreal.  Ann Marie and Mehdi were outstanding (she managed to snag us a table) and Mehdi was our waiter both times.   The Taste of Summer was excellent, followed by the veal tartare - yum!!    We loved the short ribs and paella and the lime goat cheese dessert was to die for....if you're in the area, you must stop in for a fabulouos meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in New York and decided to take a trip to Montreal for his birthday. We ate at Barrocco our first night in Montreal. Upon arriving we sort of felt like we were back home. This place has a lot of character and looks like it's run by a bunch of cool Brooklyn hipsters. The sommelier was fantastic. He recommended some great oysters and recommended that we try the steak carpaccio which were all amazing. He gave us some cool flaming absinthe shots to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and some delicious desserts. We had such an experience at Barrocco that we can't wait to go back to Montreal just to eat here again. 

Definitely my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to Barroco for a long time. The food is great - if you ever get it.  We have been waiting over an hour early on a Sunday evening for two dishes. We were assure twenty minutes ago that our food was coming. No sign of it. Unless you have two hours to waste, don't come here.  It used to be great, good service, affordable. No longer."}
{"text":"Excellent food and awesome happy hour ($5 cocktails; margarita and the watermelon juice one are the best but all are quite good). While the arepas are good, the entrées are way way better."}
{"text":"OMG each dish was better than the next. We started with the waiter asking us our possible choices and allowed us to try three wines. We then had the oysters. One was a special with fois gras. OMG. The charcuterie was duck and I literally licked my finger to get what was left on the plate. Dinner. I had the Cornish hen the meat was outstanding the sauce to die for. My husband had the duck. The duck is a different bird than Long Island duck. A bit meaty but absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection with an orange chip that was unique and flavorful. We were offered the mushrooms as a side and they were phenomenal. He explained a traditional drink to cleanse the palette before dessert. It was an apple brandy that not too sweet and a perfect transition into our chocolate creme fresh salted chocolate incredible dessert. This was one of our top meals. The waiter was amazing. He deserves accolades. The music was so odd but it fit so well from Stevie Nicks to Chuck Berry. I have nothing to say but Wow. We will be coming back!  Thank you for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"No flavor. There was one vegetarian entree option, it was terrible. The black bean soup was too salty. The service was awful. Horrible quality for the price."}
{"text":"We went here for a second time using a groupon.  The food was once again great but the service not the best.  We called ahead for seating and they said that would be fine yet we still waited 30 minutes for a table.  I understand waiting for a table but they corral you in a hallway while you wait and you're just in the way.

Otherwise, the plantains and guacamole appetizer was great.  Our arepas were delicious."}
{"text":"Barroco Grill is nice place to go and get something different from the ordinary. Great for those that are gluten intolerant and craving a sandwich. First off the place is very colorful inside with just a few tables. The service was warm and friendly, my server was very helpful and took the time to explain the menu to me. I was already familiar with Arepas spending time in South America, but let her explain everything  anyways. If you are not familiar with a Arepa it is a tasty cornmeal cake kind of like a small pita that can be fried, baked or grilled. There's was fished off on the grill and then stuffed with your choice of meats. Debating between two meats, the sever told me I could combine any two meats if I liked. I had mine packed full of delicious pork and chorizo, combined with melted mozzarella cheese grilled peppers, onions and corn. The Arepa was served with wonderful hot seasoned fries and a small side of coleslaw. On the side they also served several different sauces, my favorite being the garlic sauce (garlic aioli).  The restaurant does not have a liquor license, but will let you bring your own, so I'll keep that in mind on my next visit. By the way these Arepas where better than the many I have had in Columbia."}
{"text":"What a very pleasant surprise! I came in not knowing anything about the restaurant (fiancee told me we were going when we got in the car) so thus had no expectations.

The place (on the inside) looks like a pimp my ride version of a big renovated garage. There are    garage doors in the place to boot. It's totally decked out with funky chalk boards and hippy wall beads. I was wondering what type of Latin American fare this was until I saw the Columbian flag.

I kind of got the vibe like this would easily make 'Diners Drive Ins and Dives' whenever they next come to CLE. It has a very cool atmosphere and keeps you looking around at all the unique art work and items on the walls. Definitely very thoughtful and not chincy or thrown together.

Food was delicious! I had beef sitting on a bed of fried sweet plantains. The flavor was definitely there and our service was great. 

I will only add this as a slight negative: she had suggested a fried plantains dish to us for the appetizer but then also directed me to the entree as well. I should have known better because it ended up just being wayyy too much fried sweet bananas for my taste and I probably would have picked something else. Overall was very intensely rich as an entree after the app.

Regardless, the dishes were very flavorful, I can't wait to come back and try the Arepas!

I'll leave with this thought: this place sort of reminds me of eating at an awesome spot in Austin, TX. It has that kind of vibe, FAN!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of ordering things in restaurants that I can cook at home. But the lobster carbonara was so amazing I almost wanted to lick the bowl, the lamb shank was cooked to perfection, and I was ready to throw down and attack the couple at the next table for their bread so I could sop more jou. If you're in old Montreal, this is the one restaurant you cannot miss."}
{"text":"My three friends and I went to Barroco for the first time on a Saturday night at about 7PM and were seated immediately. I want to bring up our waiter, Abby, first because she was probably the most enjoyable part of the night. She was funny and charismatic, but also knew the menu from top to bottom and made some wonderful recommendations. I also noticed that all of the other tables she was serving loved her too... Abby made sure we had a great experience and I really appreciated it.

We ordered the Guacamole with Plantain chips and the Cheesy Corn Dip (Abby's suggestion) first. Both dips were flavorful and delicious. The plantains with the guac were crispy on the edges with a very slight chewy-ness  toward the center... YUM. The triangle-shaped dippers served with the Cheesy Corn Dip were made from the Arepa dough and were like little dense and savory cakes that were crispy on the outside... also wonderful.

Barroco was a suggestion from a friend of ours and she said to get the Arepa Puerca (chicken, bacon and beans in an arepa shell). Although the Arepa Puerca was still really good, it was probably my least favorite part of the meal. It was just too dense and rich for me. Even with the flavored sour cream on the side (maybe flavored with cilantro and lime?) and the pineapple sauce that was on the table,  it still didn't really have anything that lightened the flavor of the dish. I would probably get something different next time. I couldn't tell you exactly what my friends got, but they were all loving what they ordered! Again, the Arepa Puerca was great... just not quite my style.

Oh! We brought our own wine too... No uncorking fee which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing and authentic Colombian dishes.  I've been to Colombia many times and have friends who cook.  This place is awesome, friendly and clean!!!"}
{"text":"Pork arepa WOW! What a nice change of pace and new flavors. The guacamole was fantastic, and the side sauces were great. My favorite was the cheesy corn dip. We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! The worst meal I've had in a very long time! The bandeja had nothing paisa about it and the ropa vieja was horrible! The meat was over seasoned with horrible tasting spices and the beans were probably canned. The rice was over cooked and salty and the service was terrible. As a Hispanic it is embarrassing to know they are restaurants calling themselves Latin and offering horrible tasting food. In just a few words expensive and horrible tasting food. Will never ever return or recommend."}
{"text":"This is a 3 star review for our set course menu on NYE. 

Upon reserving our table our reservationist kindly mentioned that we will have only two hours to finish our set menu for our reservation. We agreed because it was very understandable considering it was NYE and they must be busy.

From the set menu I'd have to say to say the little piece of snow crab was the most satisfying and delicious.
For the appetizer I had Rainbow Trout sprinkled with caviar with Blini and chived sour cream was good however I wish I knew it was slightly smoked and marinated before ordering as I wasn't feeling for raw food that night.
The sea bass with assortment of sea food was okay there was too much going on in the plate; we didn't really enjoy that.
The other dish we had was the venison. I was surprised since this is considered a higher end restaurant they should have at least asked me how I wanted my venison... Med? Rare? Well done ? Nope no one asked .

The cool thing is they had cocktails in a bible. I did enjoy scrolling through that. We ordered wine by the glass since the hostess reminded 3 more times upon arrival at the door that we have a time limit of 2 hours. 

Another thing we did not enjoy so much was the uncomfortable little tables and the music that did not go with the ambiance. There were cool seats in the house we just didn't get to sit there. That's ok tho.

Anyway this review is for the set course menu on NYE they may have better food on the regular days. I was just not impressed with what we had."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!

I'm from Los Angeles and was looking for some unique south of the boarder flavors and Barrio just wasn't cutting it for me. 

This place came up on yelp and happened to be near where I was staying! 

The food was 4/5, delish but pretty heavy and kinda greasy-my only complaint. However, it was good enough that I came back so I guess I didn't seem to mind. 

I love how they have a variety of sauces since I'm learned I'm a sausy kinda gal ;)

They also play some really good live tunes so be sure to come early to grab a seat! The place is small and can get packed quick!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Barroco for a REAAALLY long time so my sister and I decided to try it out one cold, snowy evening. The food and drinks were amazing! For a starter we had the Cheesy Corn, it was the perfect blend of deliciousness and the arepa fries?? So good! My sister decided to have the Empanadas Colombianas as her entrée and I went for the Chorizo Arepa with a side of yucca fries to share. Both dishes were great! Well-seasoned, ingredients tasted fresh and portion sizes were good. They also have an array of sauces to pair with your dishes, all of which are pretty tasty. I wasn't a big fan of the yucca fries, they tasted a bit chewy but they weren't horrible. We both had the Paloma de Sandia cocktail and it was cool, refreshing and light. They definitely weren't stingy with the alcohol either. Not overwhelming but you knew it was there unlike some other \"fruity\" drinks that taste like frozen sugar. The only reason for the four-star review is that its very cramped! We went on a Friday night so it was crowded as expected but they don't have a real waiting area so we ended up smushed in a small little hall area across from the bathrooms. Then we were seated right across from the door. I mentioned it was a cold, snowy evening, right? 

Aside from those small shortfalls, everything was A+ and we're definitely planning to go back soon! Maybe in the summer so we can sit in the back patio area. It looked nice!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here with my cousin for the first time due to mentioning it to her and she said it was awesome! Well, she wasn't wrong. The seasoned beef arepa I had was very tasty as well as the tostones, chips, and guacamole we had on the side. Also the sauces they provide as a side topping are a must, my favorite being the Chimi churi and the garlic sauce. Our service was top notch as well. The waitress we had was very attentive and super sweet. I was also told hey have a dog friendly patio when the weather permits which is a double plus for me. I'll definitely add Barroco to my list of Greater Cleveland favorites."}
{"text":"Went here for first time last night.  OMG The food was soooooooooo  good; and our waitress was so sweet and knowledgeable about the menu.  Loved the wheel of sauces ...  Gotta feeling this will be my new go to hot spot..."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, ingredients were imaginative and we'll executed in the cocktails. Not crazy about the food.  Ambiance is ok. I would definitely go back for a few drinks of I was asked to meet friends in vieux-port."}
{"text":"I think this is the best restaurant in Cleveland.  If people come from out of town, this is the place I take them.  The environment there is fun and colorful and I've never had a bad meal.  Make sure you start out with some plantains :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Barroco three times now and am a fan! The location is in a little house like building in Lakewood and I am not sure that they have air conditioning, but there is street parking right in front and the staff is friendly. I am still exploring local ethnic cuisine and I took French in school, so the menu is a little hard for me to pronounce and decipher, but there are good descriptions and lots of pictures on Yelp to help you figure out what you want. 

-Cheesy Corn Dip: Soooo good! It has chicken in it as well and the crispy chip things go great with the warm gooey dip. 

-Empanadas: Four to an order but they are pretty big, just eaten plain they are eh, but add salsa or sauce and they are pretty yummy. You'll be sad when they are all gone. 

-Bandeja Paisa: A little pricey, but a lot of food. You do get a variety of things, but I think this dish is better at El Arepazo Y Pupuseria and it's cheaper there. 

-Chicken Tostones: Tasty. The Plantain Chips on their own aren't that great, but they are more of a way to carry the rest of the food to your mouth so it doesn't really matter. 

Also the portions are on the bigger side, so whether you want to feed a family of four or just want to be a fatty, I recommend this place for some tasty Latin food."}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend for groups bigger than two people. 

I host a monthly supper club at restaurants around Cleveland and since Barroco in Lakewood has such a great following we were all excited to check out their new location on the east side. I contacted the owner, Juan, in advance and again the day before just to keep things smooth since we were a larger group. However we were meeting at 6:30 on a Wednesday night so I was assured everything would be okay anyway.

A couple of us arrived early and were greeted by a friendly bartender. We were told they they were going to sit us on the patio, but then said they couldn't. No big deal, we were the only people inside the restaurant. Our server seemed personable and I really enjoyed the colorful decor.

BUT, things went downhill immediately. It took a while for all of us (total of 10) to get our waters, then we had to wait more to get our drinks. Our server was also responsible for the people out on the patio and said that there was only one bartender so we tried to be understanding and patient. Our server kept saying she'd be back to take our order but would disappear for long periods. After some time goes by I'm like we need to order, I like these people I'm sitting with but good chats can't overcome hangry. Server apologizes and thanks us for waiting, but she takes only the order for one appetizer then rushes off and we don't see her again until the appetizer is delivered. Finally she stops by again and we are able to place orders for dinner. 

8:30pm, we've been at Barroco two long hours. People are coming in and getting their food and leaving before our table is properly taken care of. I mean, we have people eating the sauces on the table because they are so hungry. We have one elderly diabetic that we're lucky didn't have a health issue waiting so long to eat. We have people wanting to get up and leave but when the server rushes by to fill up our waters she keeps reassuring us our food is on the way. Again we are seeing our server attend to multiple other tables and get them their drinks and food before us. 

I flag down another server and ask her how much longer for our food. Our server eventually comes over and says it's coming it's coming. She drops off one small guacamole, no chips, for 10 people to share to make up for the long wait. 

9pm hits and another member of our group tells the server we want our food now. Server says the wait was so long because they are bringing all of the dishes out at once. NO. It has been long enough. It doesn't take  hours to fry up some damn empanadas. Start bringing each dish to the table. One by one we slowly got our meals even though we had placed food orders long ago. 

With how things were happening you could tell our server was overwhelmed and not handling her tables properly. It appears the kitchen was not handling orders properly either. Was the kitchen deliberately not making our food and taking care of only the small food orders first even though they were placed after ours? It appeared there was no manager around to oversee things. 

The wait was not worth it. With meals arriving 2.5 hours after you were seated you're just over it and tired. Most dishes were left half uneaten because people just wanted to go home. I know I took two bites and asked for a box. I was done. We were the first table to arrive and the last to leave. Our server was nice the entire time, but this poor experience was just unacceptable and disappointing. We had new people at supper club that night and I was legit embarrassed that I had brought them there. I would not go to Barroco again. Sure they are popular, but it seems quality food/service has gone down with their expansion."}
{"text":"Barroco is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland and it's sad it's taken me 3 years and countless check-ins to write this review.

My favorite items on their menu are:

1. Montañera Arepa: I love their hogado sauce and when it's with rich beef and toped with a fried egg, it forms a satisfying combination.

2. The classic Arepa made with pork: their vegetable are cooked perfectly and are well seasoned.  The pork tastes and feels like carnitas, fatty and also well seasoned.  This arepa is incredibly unctuous.

3. Bandeja Paisa: this is he ultimate sampler entrée with delicious meats and side dishes.

Miscellaneous food notes:
* Always order the Cheesy Corn appetizer because it's heaven and reheats nicely
* The Arepa sandwiches are hearty portions, so pace yourself with appetizers
* Instead of fries, ask for Arepa Fries; they're made of yuca and are crispier and more flavorful
* Add a fried egg to ANY arepa for extra richness and fun
* Ask for little to-go sauce cups to bring a little of your favorite (or all 5) sauces home for leftovers (or other food requiring a boost of flavor)

While my favorite is their spicy peanut sauce, all five of their signature sauces are excellent and go well with anything on their menu.  Try the spicy peanut on the Bistec a Caballo and the garlic aioli with arepa fries, fries or plantains.

The service is consistently good. I've been here when it's been super busy and orders are flying and I've also dined here alone (literally, I was the only customer) and the servers have always been knowledgable, efficient and friendly.

Lastly, while I miss the dark back room with four tables, the post-renovation dining area is awesome with more seating and artwork.  Also, the new outside seating area is excellent and you can bring your pets along.

I enjoy this place a lot. The next time I'm here it'll be for brunch, which they just recently begun serving on the weekends."}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Columbian food. Arepas were great. Awesome maduros. We lived in Venezuela 5 years and this was a real reminder of those days. The bandera paisa was super, especially the chicharron,  and reminded me of pabellon criollo. Among the family we tried several different dishes, and everything was great."}
{"text":"First time I've ever had an arepas.  I had a veggie version of the huevos rancheros.  It was very good and it came with a side of black bean soup (also vegetarian).  My husband had Arepa Paisa and he was impressed as well.  I'm was another huge portion with a side of Maduros (plantains).  Those were good too.  W did take out and didn't eat our dinners for a good hour after purchase.  The food was fresh and not soggy. 

Hostess that took my order was so friendly and informative.  She shared about the culture of the food and background.  

No liquor license yet but you can bring your own beer and wine which is awesome. 

Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent place for cocktails!! Our bartender was Simone, she knew what she was doing,  great Maple old fashioned...we had a great night!! Food was good!! The place is very small, so reservations are key!  Although we were expecting a little bit more Spanish ambiance since it is a Spanish-style restaurant."}
{"text":"I've watched Barroco grow and grow, and mostly it's only gotten better and better. I was lucky enough to try them for the first time just after they opened, and since then many things have changed, but the arepas are still delicious, and the sauces are still fantastic (pineapple!), and the charm has only grown with the expansions. 

It's hard to try everything, because so many things are now \"my favorite\" and I want to get the same things over and over -- but I'm glad I try something new every time I do. Today's hit was their take on fajitas - with cheese arepas. Thinly sliced steak with what is essentially a classic fajita seasoning, with onions and peppers and sour cream and guacamole -- with a little side of arepa triangles grilled with melted cheese. Delish - and more than enough food for two meals. 

The pineapple sauce will always be my favorite of the sauces. Seriously, it's like crack. But each of them have their fans -- the spicy peanut sauce is remarkable to me because it is hot -- really hot sometimes -- but still tastes mostly of peanut. The only thing I've tried on the menu that I'm not completely in love with is the plantains -- I'm just more of a fan of soft and squishy plantains than the hard fried versions they serve up. Most of the sweetness of the fruit is lost in their prep, so it's just sort of a bland chip like thing to me. 

They've upgraded from disposable cups to glasses over time, and have slowly become more of an eat-in place, though I have to admit most of the time I prefer getting take out from there. Everyone there is super nice and friendly, but it always feels crowded to me, even when there are only a few other people there, and the service can sometimes be a little on the slow side. (Always crazy friendly though - I will never fault them for that.) I actually love the atmosphere - lots of fun art, lights, sanctioned graffiti - but there's something about the setup of the tables and the space that just always feels cramped. 

Definitely worth a try if you've not been there yet."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Unique atmosphere, very pleasant waitress, excellent food! Don't forget to try all the sauces - authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with my friend Cody who never had plantains before. Needless to say our order of plantains con queso quickly made him a fan. Afterwards we both had Maduro plates (bed of sweet plantains) ... He had the Hawaiian Maduro and I had the steak Maduro. We cleaned those meals up within ten minutes... That's how good it is. You can't go wrong by coming here! Also we had a great server by the name of Chris.... He was funny and kept our waters filled"}
{"text":"I love this place for the most part, but every now and then I get an arepa that's dry to the point of being hard to eat. But when the arepa is good, this place is great."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going here. I didn't even know it was here. I was also excited to find that the menu is 80% gluten free. However, the wait time once we ordered was about 45 minutes to an hour. My friend couldn't even ER his water for a long time. The server said she was cooking too but that seems weird. I was also surprised with the cost. A drink and entree were $28. Wasn't worth that price."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant in a perfect location. Atmosphere is very European and cozy. Food was good and drinks are reasonable. Just don't ask the server what he recommends - always points to the most expensive item and contrasts it with a second most expensive item. Then when you choose something he didn't recommend, you can tell he's not happy about it and looks at you like you're cheap."}
{"text":"Our waitress was amazing! Probably the best i have had! Her recommendations were perfect to fit her positive vibrant attitude! Beautiful restaurant. Very cosy and open, beautiful bar. 

My boyfriend & i spent a weekend here in MTL to visit my family/attend a wedding & one of the days we spent for date night :) and of course me being obsessed with yelping everything before i go there this place was on our top 3 because we heard great things about their seafood paella. 

Our appetizer was the lobster gaspatcho definitely did not go wrong with that. I ended up dipping the complementary bread into it  and for my main dish i got a salmon plate served with  bread similar to pita bread & carrots. It also came with this cream sauce which was delicious. My boyfriend of course had the paella. 

The star of this show was definitely not the paella even though it was very good but the beverages.!, 

I will go through drinks by round and it should give you an idea of how our night went. 

1. Me:passion fruit mojito 
    BF: double crown & coke 
2. See #1 
3. See #1 
4. Me: a blueberry cocktail w/thyme leaves (obviously at this point i didnt remember the name) 
BF: an awesome drink with smoke and liquor that tasted of candy. 
We were obliterated. One of the best date nights we have had just because of the drinks."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and luckily made reservations because they were turning walk ins away. Fantastic ambience and very friendly and helpful staff. We got there early so we took a seat at the bar. Since neither my wife or I drink alcohol, we asked for virgin cocktails and I'm glad we did.....their cocktail menu looks like an old first edition book with recipes to select from. Black tea syrup, caramelized ginger, fresh herbs an array of ingredients went into my black mule tea cocktail which was simply amazing. My wife's Bloody Mary was the best I've ever tasted....numerous ingredients blended together to make the perfect drink rich in flavours and smells....she was like a scientist at work and the results were a delight for the senses. 

The food was similarly made from the best ingredients sourced from across Quebec and farther away. I ordered the Nova Scotia tuna tartare with smoked potato mousse. The fish was delicate and tangy with just the right amount of fish flavour with the creamy and smoky flavour of the mousse. Highly recommended!!

The next thing we ordered was a special of the day which was a quail fusilli. The quail was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside where one could taste the gaminess of the meat.....it's just so much better than chicken! I think I really should have more quail from now on...I haven't given this the attention it deserves. Again, I highly recommend this dish

Lastly, we ordered the beef short ribs. What got my attention was the fact that they've been braised for 12 hours.....and for sure you could taste the flavours of beef in the stewy tender concoction which just melted in your mouth. It was just so rich that I think it overwhelmed my system after just a few bites because I was full and couldn't eat another bite. I'm not so sure about this dish because I felt uncomfortably full after just a few bites of this....maybe I/we were allergic to one of the ingredients because I'm a huge fan of beef stews...but it really unsettled both of our stomachs and we both felt the impact of that for the next 8 hours. I doubt very much that there was anything wrong with the food....that dish just didn't sit well with either of us so I'm not sure I'd recommend this one. 

All in all, I'd definitely go again and I'd recommend it to my friends"}
{"text":"This place had been on my bookmark list for a while so I gave it a try while a friend was visiting from out of town.

Upon my entrance I thought the decor was so cozy, rustic and welcoming. People looked cool and young. So I thought this place was right up my alley. Little that I know that I was about to have one of the worst meals I've ever had.

I ordered the Chimichurri Bloody Ceaser.. There were way too many unknown \"seeds\" in it making it difficult to drink. 

Oyster were yummy.. But it's mother nature's creation. You can't ruin that.

Our paella was a disaster. The rice was raw, and DRENCHED in oil. Unseasoned, bland... I added salt, pepper, hot sauce... Nothing could save it. After waiting a long while for it I ultimately had to send it back.. We both did. 

The waiter politely offered me to order something else.. So I ordered the tagliatelle. 

That was another disaster. Long strings of pasta swimming in oil. I could scoop up full spoons of oil!! It was inedible. I didn't eat it. 

My friend ordered a salad to replace his paella so he was safe.

Don't be fooled by these positive reviews on here. I took a closer look today and they are mostly tourist reviews.. American tourists. They love greasy food. That pool of oil my pasta was swimming in... Well I'm sure they call that a \"sauce\".  I'm an avid foodie. I've dined at top rated restaurants all over the world. But let me tell you that the $61 tiny paella is not what paella should taste like. 

Our bill was $260 without tip and I left completely famished."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite restaurant in Lakewood.  The food is absolutely amazing, authentically made, and unique.  You can't get this type of food just anywhere (in Cleveland).  We always start with the plantain chips and guacamole.  So good!  Also, they don't serve alcohol, but you can bring your own.  We usually bring a few beers for the meal.  

Also the staff are so friendly here, which definitely adds to the charm of the place. Just lovely people.  They just recently re-modeled, and it can get pretty crowded and busy on the weekends, so expect to wait.  They really pack people into the back room, which is colorfully painted, so the atmosphere is lively and upbeat.  This would be a great spot for a fun dinner with a group!"}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise! A friend and I had agreed to meet at a place down the street which ended up being closed.  We wandered down the street in search of grub and stopped here. The outside didn't particularly draw us in but it was close and there were a good amount of people inside who looked satisfied. We were soon some of those inside, satisfied folks

We sat in the back room which was a bit dark but the place is covered with eclectic, Latin inspired graffiti-esque art. Very cool. 

The food was great too. We both had arepas which were bomb and shared the guac with a mix of regular and plain rain chips. The plantain chips are a must try! 

My buffalo chicken arepa was delish although a tad spicier than unwound have liked. I'd rather add more spice myself but that's just me. It paired great with the pineapple sauce. The variety of sauces definitely added to the adventure, I just wish 4/5 weren't mayo based. 

Last thing to mention.... Service was good but being in the back room alone we had to call their attention a bit. Nothing major, just a call out to them to not forget the people on the back!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back!

My husband and I went a few weeks ago and had a really good time. They had live music which was awesome and the food was great. It was pretty busy being on the weekend and the service was quick and attentive which is always very important to me! 
Drinks - TRY THE RED SANGRIA, its delicious! Also tied the mojito that was also thumbs up! 
Food - I had one of the Ceviches and my husband had an Arepa, both were very good. (I will say however the ceviche was a little different that i'm use too, I believe the shrimp were cooked and it was a little on the saucy side) 

Over all we will defiantly be going back!"}
{"text":"Our first time having Colombian food! Our waitress was fantastic and the food was absolutely delicious!!! The cheese dip was my favorite. Soo good."}
{"text":"Top 3 favorite meals of all time. Get there asap. Everything smelled wonderful and tasted even better. The live music was perfect!"}
{"text":"I ventured here because of a Groupon, but will venture back because it's amazing, start to finish.

First thing you need to know:  This place is BYOB.  Yes, bring your wine, bring your beer, even bring your liquor although that's more of an after dinner thing.  I wish all restaurants were like that!

The kitchen opens right up into the dining room. You get a real \"homey\" feeling, like you're in someones house and they're serving you straight from their oven.

Our server was so sweet.  She was so helpful with recommendations and very attentive.  They bring a tray of sauces out for your food and she explained what each one was.  The food came quick and she actually acted like she enjoyed being there.

I had the Hawaiian Arepa.  This little corn dough pita may be bland itself (they're supposed to be from what I understand) but it's absolutely packed with flavor!  I guess the chorizo one is their claim to fame but mine was stuffed full of ham and bacon, topped off with a perfect amount of pineapple and mozzarella.  It looks small but was so filling!

And yes, we  tried the cheesy corn.  It was really freakin' good!  It was a bit too rich and heavy for me though.  I felt like it lined the insides of my belly, which I guess isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I like the little cornbread-like fries or wedges they served with it though.  They should substitute all their fries for these things, and they went really well with the sauces.  The Chorizo sauce and the Garlic sauce were my favs.  If you're looking for spice, the Peanut sauce is where you'll find it!

The price overall, sans the Groupon, was pretty reasonable.  It was about $30 for the both of us but we left stuffed and with a lot of leftovers."}
{"text":"Best Columbian food ever , the service is quick and the environment is amazing and different"}
{"text":"The place and atmosphere are very nice and cozy.  Great mix of music.  Their menu is very limited.  So you sort of expect that whatever they are serving is going to be amazing.  The food is good. I wouldn't say it's absolutely amazing and out of this world. Their paella was very good. Their pasta dish was good. drinks could be stronger. The restaurant is very expensive overall."}
{"text":"Barroco is a fun CLE find--Columbian food on the shores of Lake Erie. However, I've been there multiple times and the service is often slow, and the food is super heavy. I always feel so weighed down after eating only a few bites. The plantains are to die for, but the actual entrees and the service leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Great arepas and cachapas! Portions don't look big but somehow are extremely filling and I couldn't finish the food at all. Overall, it was delicious"}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life. Everything is perfect- the location, ambiance, wine, and service was superb. Try the veal tartare and paella and thank me later."}
{"text":"Really enjoying the music. Food delicious. Very friendly service all around. Small. Beautifully decorated. Open brick wall. Interesting photos. Food delicious. Very warm and happy.
Black cod was crunchy on top and perfectly cooked, delicious. Rib eye steak was tender and tasty. Must say everything was spot on. 
Pete can't get over the music that took him back to college.
Drinking Azmarac cognac and chocolate decadence for dessert. Heaven.
At end of night Antoinette (our waitress) brought shots for us with tequila, hot pepper and some other concoctions. So nice."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to go. Super good food, amazing Sangrias, excellent service. Fun place. The wait can be very long if you go during peak time."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and both times it's been amazing. The building is small, street parking or there's a very small (5 spaces) lot behind the building.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in.  They don't have any liquor there, but I honestly didn't miss it...the food more than makes up for it.

We started with the Cheesy Corn which is an absolute must get.  The arepa fries they are served with is the perfect compliment to the cheesy dish.  The first time we both got arepas (the Mexicana and the Paisa) both were delicious but I think the Mexicana was just a little bit better.

The second visit we got Patacon Pisào's (steak and the chorizo).  Both of them were delicious and full of flavor.  The steak was falling apart and it was topped with an amazing guacamole.  It looked like there was a lot of cheese at first ( I was kind of expecting it from the \"queso bed\" description) but it was actually the perfect amount if you kind of mixed / dipped the steak in it.  

The sauces they bring out are tasty as well.  We loved the chimichurri one so much we got 16oz of it to go.  The ranchero also is very good.

It's a bit of a drive for us (45 minutes) but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is fairly small  and unassuming from the outside, however the food is great. Its something different than the usual food spots in Cleveland. In addition to the food, they offer live music on Friday's. **One cool thing about this place is that they do not serve alcohol. HOWEVER you are allowed to bring your own alcohol to the restaurant to drink with your meal!**Awesome concept. They have a pretty good selection of choices of Columbian foods. I will say on the weekends, make sure you get there early or make a reservation because you will have to wait otherwise. Typical for any popular food place.

**As an update to my review, now they do have a full bar and serve some pretty good drinks which made the place even better!"}
{"text":"So, this will prove to be a difficult review to author.  This was the first time anyone in my family has visited a Colombian restaurant, and we actually did not care for this style of food.  I will do my best here, but please keep the previously stated in mind...

Visited yesterday - a Sunday afternoon - at approximately 2:15 p.m. and found Barroco to still be about 3/4 filled even at this strange time.  When you walk in the front there is a dining area just big enough for one large group of people - a party of maybe twelve people were dining in this area when we arrived.  Also in this area is the cash register, part of the kitchen, and a small area with 216 Clothing that is for sale.  Since there isn't a sign to indicate if you are to seat yourself, we just kind of stood around for a couple of minutes wondering what we are supposed to do.  Eventually we were seated in the back by a waitress.  In the back is another food prep area - maybe where they make drinks - as well as restrooms and two semi-separate small dining areas.  Even further beyond this area is a large back patio area that is presumably only open in the warm months.  The interior decor is eclectic in a good way and is LOUD.  Like REALLY loud.  Do not get loaded up on caffeine before visiting Barroco - you may want to jump out of your skin.  

My wife and daughter order the condado cheese dip appetizer (chorizo, hogado sofrito, and cheddar jack cheese), which came along at about 15 minutes, and loved it.  As the official pickiest person on earth, I did not participate in the devouring of the dish since I do not like chunks of tomato, onion, etc. (probably not a great place for me to eat).  Our meals came along at the 30 minute mark.  I ordered the Montanera arepa (braised beef, fried egg, and mozzarella) with fries on the side.  An arepa is naturally gluten-free tortilla like pocket that is made out of hominy corn.  I had never heard of an arepa before Barroco.  I did not care for the texture, or flavor.  The braised beef was tender and flavorful, but I didn't care for the combo of braised beef and soft cooked egg.  I also didn't care for all the chunks of tomato and onion in the beef.  The fries were pretty good I suppose.  My wife ordered a Hawaiian arepa, but substituted grilled chicken for the ham.  This also had mozzarella, bacon, and pineapple.  My wife initially liked the dish, but tired of it quickly.  The bacon was very fatty and she also did not care for the texture and flavor of the arepa.  She also had yucca fries (yuck) which we weren't fans of either.  My daughter ordered the Barroco skewers with steak, fries, and a boogalu salad.  My daughter didn't really didn't care for any of these items in her dish.  I tried the steak and found it to be ok - a little tough and the flavor was amiss (they put some kind of green sauce on the steak).  

It took at least 10-15 minutes to get our check and the damage was $54 without tip.  Our waitress was young and I am thinking was part of the family that owns Barroco.  She was very sweet and was also helpful in explaining the various table sauces and what was in some of the dishes.  The woman at the cash register, who I perceived to be an owner, was so nice and threatened to put our waitress in a time out for not bringing us our check in a timely manner.

Trying to quantify Barroco's star rating was difficult for me.  We liked the decor and energy, but didn't like the noise level.  We liked our waitress, but failing to bring us our check was a misstep.  We didn't like 3/4 of our food, but feel it was *maybe* due to our preferences and not a reflection on the food or preparation.  Nevertheless, three people in our party and we tried three different dishes and no one liked their food.  Based on all the great reviews here I believe that most people will love Barroco, but we weren't fans.  Three stars is probably being a little generous."}
{"text":"Great place to spend time. I have been in this place several times. Great great ceviche. You should try it. It is one of the best ceviche that I have ever eaten. Staff are so friendly and nice. You would have a great time there."}
{"text":"First off.  Let me start by saying I Love Arepas and was excited to cap my trip to Cleveland off by eating dinner here.

I enjoyed Barroco.  It was especially a nice surprise when we walked in and found a live band setting up for a night of great music.  The tequila shot that was offered by the nice gentleman seating us was also a nice touch and definitely welcoming.  

After we got seated our server came over and greeted us a short time later and took our drink order.  I of course ordered the mojito.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't knock your socks off either.  Kind of sad that I couldn't order the house punch.  It sounded better and it comes in a large bowl. My husband ordered the El Socialista.  It was essentially a rum and coke. 

We ordered the Empanadas Colombianas and Maduros con Queso.  The Empanadas were hot and fresh with perfect seasoning.  The Maduros were heaven.  You put plaintains and queso together and you have a winner. 

For the entree I ordered the Mexicana arepa sub the braised beef for the chorizo with a side of Maduros. Fantastic! This to me was also the perfect time try all 5 of their sauces.  All paired well with my meal except for the pineapple one.  As good as it was by itself it didn't go with braised beef.  But Omg did I want to take a bottle of the other ones home with me.  Soooo good.  

Other guest at the table ordered the fajitas con arepa,  the steak arepa, and ropa vieja.  Everything looked good and I didn't hear any complaints.  Everyone seemed to busy chowing down and listening to the awesome live band.  

If I go back I will definitely try another arepa or get the Barroco Picada or Tostadas con Todo. Both of these options are good for groups and seems like it has something for everyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Columbine food and I loved it. The arepas was to die for"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Lakewood! As you will be able to tell as soon as you step into the place, you are seemingly teleported into another world. You'll forget you're in Lakewood all together. I've never had a bad experience here and every new person I bring loves it equally as much!

While I usually go for an arepa, a staple of the restaurant, today I decided to go with a plantain dish. It did not disappoint! It was the perfect mesh of flavors. I also recommend ordering one of their cocktails. The mojito is a safe choice as I could possibly be the best I've had, and the sangria is very fun. Check out their weekday specials for the drinks as well! The only complaint I've ever had with this place is the slower service but that's usually because they are slammed!"}
{"text":"This place has a \"I'm not in Cleveland anymore\" feel.  The arepas are what they are know for.  I really enjoyed the pork arepa I had and the cheesy corn.  The black bean soup was good but its essentially black beans marinated in lime.  The arepas are large and I was full after half of the meal.  The food is very flavorful already but they have a wide variety of sauces to try from garlic to spicy peanut.  They will soon be able to serve alcohol at this location although bar was not yet running why I was here in mid February.  Service was quick and accurate and the place was crowded even at 6pm on a Saturday evening.  I was most impressed by the flavor profile of the pork and the cheesy corn."}
{"text":"Super tasty. One of my favorite restaurants in Lakewood. You must try ALL the sauces!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. I would recommend the tea mule and the machete from the cocktail menu. We sat up by the bar and watched our drinks being made. Our servers were really nice. I would definitely come back if I ever find myself in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, squeezed us in when a reservation app screwed up our plans. Great custom cocktail to go with dessert and a very friendly bartender."}
{"text":"This place is pleasing on so many levels. We walked in an were greeted by warmth from the staff. Looking around at the decor you are treated to so many colors, pretty lights, and different walls all around. Once seated Our super sweet waitress came over, made sure we understood the menu, suggested drinks, smiled with us and laughed in a very unforced way. The Food:...omg. *cries of happiness*. Just go eat there for yourself lol."}
{"text":"the food was very good and the atmosphere was great! only downside is that the food comes up slow, but after all its worth going!!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! I went with the arepa (Ropa Vieja Arepa to be exact) the first time I went here to get a feel for one of the signature dishes. While I would still absolutely recommend this option, I have since ventured onto the Steak Maduro and will have a really difficult time trying anything else and giving up the opportunity to eat this next time we go. My husband is a big advocate of anything Barroco offers with Chorizo. Overall, great atmosphere, wonderful staff, and amazing food."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite restaurants! The cheesy corn, pina coladas, steak patacon are my favorite items.  The restaurant's vibe is so fun, drinks are always cold, and the food is fresh.  It can be pricey and the restaurant can get very crowded or warm,  but it's worth it! Dining in is a must to try their delicious sauces -especially the pineapple and chimi-churri sauce!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive things about this amazing restaurant- first of all, the majority of items are naturally gluten-free, which brought us in for the first time a month ago. The patio was great, as was everything we ordered; it's got friendly service, delicious food, and it's great for takeout! Thank you for coming into my neighborhood ;)"}
{"text":"I really like the decor of this place as well as the design of the menu. It feels young and hip. The food is good, I had the mexicana arepa sandwich. Be warned it is pretty greasy, which I'm a huge fan of but I know not everyone is. The maduros were yummay! I came here for a weekday lunch at noon and we were the only ones there, but still it seemed like a long wait for the food..."}
{"text":"Steak Patacon and Maduros con Queso are the best! Love this place! You can tell that the owners poured their hearts and souls into this place."}
{"text":"The service was great even though they were packed. The food was excellent as was the live music. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dined at Barroco a few nights ago during our first visit to Montreal.  The paella and steak were absolutely delicious.  Well worth the money for a special dinner out.  From the hostess greeting us, to the server, bartender and sommelier, all whom stopped by to ensure all was going well, the experience was just what you want when dining out.  The cocktail list is excellent as well!  (Can't remember the name of our drinks, but a smoky-tequila drink and an old-fashioned style drink were delicious!)  We returned last night just to sit at the bar and have a drink, and were greeted right away with \"welcome back\".  Never thought they'd remember us from a few nights before.  Again, the hostess and bartender were both wonderful and kept up perfect, friendly conversation.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"so i was craving some guac and plantains and HAD to make a spot at barroco for some dinn.

Let's just say this time around it was even better! I know you're thinking how could this be possible (it was carryout too!). The plaintains were seasoned to perfection and the guac is seriously like the best thing i've ever eaten in my life.

I got the chicken arepa this time since i'm not doing my vegan thing (thank god) and it was SO SO SO SOOOOOOOOOOOO good. A lot better than the veggie and i didn't get jap's on it this time around which was a smart move."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Hispanic Resturants!  Home made food with large portions! Great service as food was fresh, hot and quickly served.  Despite being very busy we were served in a timely manner. South American dishes with a few American dishes available.   I had the barroco Ceviche.  It included chilled shrimp cocktail made with fresh lime juice, onions, cilantro and our ranchero sauce served with tostones. Lightly spiced sauce was divine.  I topped it off with Guacamole with fried plaintain. Creamy Guac with a robust flavour!  Desert was homade flan,  a traditional dessert"}
{"text":"Barroco is my \"happy place\". Any time I need homemade, fantastically delicious food, Barroco is it for me. I've loved this place since the first time I tried it well over a year ago. I've never been disappointed and love that they add new menus to the menu. Also, the environment inside is eclectic, fun, and perfect for a date or for out-of-towners."}
{"text":"Hands down, The best service I've had in a long time. I told our server to surprise us and he did! The food was amazing, the service was amazing and the atmosphere was superb! Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"There are places where their menu is so large that it takes a long time to figure out what you want. This is not one of those places. Barroco Grill has a reasonable menu (two sides of a single page), but it still took me a long time to figure out what I wanted, because *everything* looked really yummy!

I had the Guacamole with Plaintain Chips and Arepa Paisa with Black Bean soup, and it was one of the most delicious meals I've had in a very long time! The arepa filling tasted so good as it was delivered that none of the equally yummy sauces would have been needed at all! I was wishing that I hadn't eaten all week, so I could have finished everything and ordered more!"}
{"text":"All the staff are so friendly, the sangria is amazing, and the live music is so fun. Love trying different arepas each time. I have been avoiding ordering anything with chicharrones again because the first time they were very very hard and inedible. Everything else has been good though"}
{"text":"Me and my friend were seated quickly and the waitress was super nice. The food was amazing. For appetizer we got fried plantains with queso. And I got a veggie arepa for the main course. The flavors were fantastic and the sauces were even better. I will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend & from Ny We missed having some home cooked hispanic food found this place on google & it was sooooooo good. The service from our waitress was great. We went there around 5-530 it wasn't busy at all so I was glad. We found ourselves reading all the signs and looking at the decorations. The cilantro sauce was definitely our favorite sauce. I love places were the service is just as good as the food. Will definitely go back when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"This place is DIVINE. I think it may be a portal to heaven. 

It's BYOB, so it definitely helps to know that before you go, but forget about drinking - this place is all about the food. 

We ordered the the Cheesy Corn appetizer to start. It was so big, we had to take some home. Words can't even describe how delicious it was. It had chicken and bacon chunks served with arepa fries - HOLY COW.

I ordered the Ropa Veja which was needless to say, incredible. I was so full from the appetizer, I had to take most of mine home, but I really didn't want to stop eating. Everything was divided on the plate, which I prefer, but once combined for a singular bit, created the perfect pairing of flavors. It came with fried plantains, black beans, rice and braised beef. I'm just at a loss for words how amazing it was.

I cannot wait to go back, I don't think this place could have one bad option on their menu!"}
{"text":"If food could talk, black beans would have totally told you that good looks in life is not everything: they look like mud and taste like heaven. The ones that are from Barroco Grill of course. Same applies to arepas: authentic Colombian hotpocket with a crunchy exterior and gently delicious ( meat, potatoes, anything) interior.
According to my Colombian friend Alexandra Bastos, this tiny place represents her country proudly.
Of course Colombian street food in reality is much cheaper. But I heard besides the air fare, trying it sometimes may cost you your shoes, wallet or both ( yep, I personally spoke to someone whose shoes were stolen  while he was buying some arepas). So for my non-Spanish speaking, non-globe-trotting friends, Barroco Grill is the best next thing."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like you're on a mini vacation! We went for lunch on a weekday, so it was not busy. Parking is on the street (free!). It was a warm day outside and inside. It made you feel like you were at a resturant outside, by the beach. All of the food was great. We ordered plantains as an appetizer and each got different meals. Everything was huge! The sandwiches with yucca fries were enough for 2 meals and the chicken platter (that's what I seen it as) was big enough for 3 or 4 meals! The prices are $$, so watch out if your on a budget. We spent about $33 per person with no alcohol (1 appetizer, 3 meals, 1 dessert). It may take you some time to get a drink refill, but everyone was nice and trying new sauces together was fun."}
{"text":"Yum... Kid friendly'ish earlier in the evening. Good variety of items. Over all good quality. Nothing knocked my socks off but over all pretty great meals at reasonable prices. A bit of parking issues with road construction but worth parking 2-3 blocks away. I'll be back."}
{"text":"delicious authentic latin food. the decor on the inside is nothing earth shattering....kind of looks like a dive......but the food is so good. 
a HUGE array of dipping sauces which i absolutely think is the greatest thing since sliced bread. so many to choose......can i have one of each, please?!
the arepas are so good, but the cheesey corn............can you bathe in this stuff???? no, like i am being honest. 
the cheesey, yummy, hot, bacon goodness is FABULOUS. the little potato things you dip in it, are equally as good. 
i typically get carry out here and i am never disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Cheesy corn is to die for!!  I am not sure i liked the globs of fat in my sandwich, but if that is why they consider a chicharrons, i will just avoid that bit.  I could eat a sandwich from here a few nights a week. The arepas are just that good."}
{"text":"Wow Wow wow ! Great food and friendly staff. The food was fresh,well made and generous.  My wife had a chicken dish and  I had Chorizo. All so tasty!"}
{"text":"Great find on our way into town with our dog.  Back patio with fans.  Food was AWESOME. Had arepa's with fried plantains."}
{"text":"I was looking for Spanish paella, and I found this place.
It is not a very big restaurant that I imagined, the cocktail is very unique, it looks like a BIBLE. 
We ordered foie gras and octopus as starters, and steak, short rib and paella as main dishes. The most stunning one is the foie gras, but my friend likes paella better.
And two desserts we ordered as finishers were also fabulous. Not too sweet but very fruity.
I'll definitely go back again! It's pretty pricy tho lol"}
{"text":"Amazing! One of the coolest restaurants in the area. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Came here last week while in Montreal for a wedding. The decor is very cozy with a nice contrast of old Montreal with a modern flare. We sat at the bar because we thought we would just have a drink or two. We were instantly impressed by the cocktail \"book\" and were given some recommendations by the bar tender (who was fantastic!). He let us try some of the ingredients and was really friendly. Throughout the night we watched some amazing looking dishes come out of the kitchen and decided to order a few things. The burrata cheese and tomato dish of phyllo pastry was incredible. We had oysters and the cheese cake, which may have been one of the best I've ever had. We ended up staying much longer than we planed to (and many more drinks than we planned to!). Next time I'm in Montreal, I will make a point to return!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious if not earth shattering. After getting lost and going to the wrong 312 St Paul, we finally made it to Barroco. The place is tiny and lovely to boot. I think it is connected to the restaurant next door, which seemed livelier btw (i kind of wish we would have made reservations there instead). 

i had the salmon (a perfect balance of crispy and juicy with some sauteed green tomatoes) and my husband had the paella (good, but the rice was kind of hard and chewy he noted). We shared the chocolate lava cake for dessert though in retrospect we should have tried the dessert of the day. The cake and sorbet were delicious, but again, not the most amazing we've ever had. 

The service was great and the folks were attentive. However, for a $100+ dinner, we would have liked to be wowed by something.. anything?"}
{"text":"I never write Yelp reviews, but felt like I had to- mostly to give a shout-out to the staff. This review is a little long, but I encourage you to scroll through to the end for service-related stuff.

My wife and I made reservations for a Sunday, to round out a little vacation on Montreal. It's one of my favorite cities, and we thought a \"fancier\" dinner would be a great way to do something nice for ourselves. We call ahead to ask about dress code, and were cheerfully told to \"come as you are\". The hostess was polite and kind, and that kind of thing goes a long way with me.

We started with some cocktails: I had their version of a Bloody Caesar, with absinthe and truffle salt. It was tasty. I don't think I'm super used to the Caesar vs. Mary, but that's on me. My wife couldn't decide. Our lovely server (also sommelier) was very sweet and offered to decide for her. He brought out some sort of Mezcal drink. I won't describe it, because I don't want to butcher it. Whatever it was, it was delicious. I had one as my second. Our server picked again for my wife, and brought another delicious drink. I'd come again for the cocktails alone. It's clear the folks at the bar know what they are doing. We found the options to be eclectic and creative.

For starters we had some oysters, a board of ham, comte, grilled bread, etc. and some olives. All were tasty, with my favorite being the ham and cheese board. The fig jam was a nice addition, and I appreciated the way the comte was shaved into ribbons. It really melted on your tongue. 

My wife and I split the paella for two. Overall, the dish was delicious. To be fair, I haven't had a ton of paella in my life, but compared to the ones I *have* had- this one blew them out of the water. The rice was creamy and almost risotto like. Well seasoned. The one criticism we had, was that for 75.00, we would have liked to have seen more seafood. We really don't mind paying for a nice meal, but you'd like to feel like you are getting what you paid for. We had one scallop each, and one shrimp each. Both were delicious, but two shrimp and two scallops seems skimpy in a dish that's meant to be shared, and is mostly rice otherwise. It made the mark-up feel excessive. Then again, coming from Boston- who knows. We're so close to the water, our cost of goods could be less.

The service is really what I wanted to write about though. So, let me start by saying- it wasn't *perfect*. Our server disappeared for long (real long) stretches throughout our meal, and when he was present, he felt pretty rushed with us. He also just talked fast. I went to add tip for example, and I was trying to explain that I wasn't sure how to use the key-pad. He whisked it away from me, before I could figure it out, saying I did it. When he realized I hadn't, he was sort of like..\"oh! no, I guess you didn't add tip!\" It wasn't meant in a rude way. My wife just added it on her end for both of us- so no harm no foul. But if he had just slowed down, it wouldn't have been an issue.

I have to say though- because the place is so small, we really got to \"people watch\" at some of the tables around us. DAMN. What an eye opening experience. It really made us appreciate what these servers must see every night. We saw some outright RUDE behavior by several tables, as well as some strikingly bizarre (like the lady with a *flashlight* reading her menu. Um. Please stop shining that in my eyes?). Despite all of this, the staff hustled along, ever polite and courteous.  As I said, our waiter wasn't *perfect* but overall my wife and I found him to be totally charming. I'm assuming that he was gone for long stretches because he was busy. We saw him answering the hostess phone and greeting guests as they arrived- when the hostess was seating parties or checking on things. 
The women clearing out plates and swapping out dishes was delightful. The hostess was wonderful, as was the busser who took our coats. It's clear that someone is training their staff well- and it shows. 

I'd give Barroco 4 stars for the price value- but I'm bumping it up for sheer class. It's a lost art, and these guys are doing it and doing it well."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. The first time was fine. Tonight, I am NOT impressed. I just waited nearly 50 minutes for \" Shrimp Ceviche.\" There is no excuse for a person ordering ONE appetizer to wait longer than the 4 dinner entrees. As I was waiting, I started to watch the video ads and decided to request the green sauce (that has Cilantro) in the mason jar. I asked the waiter how much the jar cost (pointing to the tv). He said $5, can't beat that! He returned with a VERY miniature Mason jar, which was not even shown on the tv. I'm from Cincy, that jar wouldn't even last me one day smh. I requested the only item that is on their TV, how do you get that wrong? I AM DISSAPPOINTED and I will NOT be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a friend and finally decided to try it out. The decor and atmosphere was very nice, fun and cozy. Our waitress was maybe a little over zealous in her explaining the menu but I would rather have that than an absentee wait staff.

I honestly don't remember the arepa I got but it was great! I usually don't go for the corn tortillas, especially when they are soft. These are home made and wonderfully crispy. My arepa was filled with chorizo, red beans, jalapenos and cheese.

It is unfortunate that they do not sell their sauces because they were wonderful and a real highlight of my experience. I asked the waitress what kind of food this was and she told me the preparation is Venezuelan and the method of cooking is Colombian.

All around a great experience."}
{"text":"columbian food that is very authentic to taste and region. great flavors and well prepared.  you can't find food as tradition and made with love as my mamma use to make it.  and the staff was A number one.  nice to find a place like this here in downtroden cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, and both times I had wonderful food coma after eating their food. On my first visit, the staff were very nice and walked us through the menu and explained what arepas were etc. I think it's GREAT how the restaurant takes time to explain to customers what their speciality is, and what the dish is made out of. Sometimes, customers that are new to a certain type of ethnic cuisine have no clue what to order, or what dishes are famous for that region. ::high-five to you Barroco Grill!!::

Food: For appetizers, get the empanadas! If you love potatoes like me, you will enjoy this dish a lot!! Marinated beef and potatoes in pockets of fried deliciousness- yes, please! You must order an arepa as well! I got the chicken one this time around, which was good. I think next visit I'll have to get it with some chorizo, mmmh. The portions are also fairly big, so it's hard to leave hungry...unless you are a big hungry bear in disguise. I also tried the cheesy corn, which was a bit too heavy for me. But if you are in the mood for something rich and filling, and you love cheese and corn, this dish is perfect for you! Also, you must try their four different house made sauces. My favorite is the pineapple, because you can actually taste pineapple in it...and it's not some watery pineapple flavoring liquid. The saltiness of the chips, and the sweetness of the pineapple is great!  

This is a great place for food, and I heard from friends they have great live music during special days. I guess I will have to come back during these live band music nights so I can enjoy yummy food AND hear good music!! Stimulation overload?"}
{"text":"How good is too good? That's the question you'll be asking yourself after eating here. The wait list is no joke, but sign-up early, it's worth it! The knowledgeable, attractive and friendly wait staff is always helpful and kind. Drink the wine, you won't be disappointed. If you're hungry enough, order everything, do not leave without having the octopus appetizer!! The desserts are insanely portioned, usually on the too big side, and too good. Start to finish it was perfect. Be ready to spend some cash, but it won't matter how much when you stumble out satiated, your smile will be worth any price"}
{"text":"What a great Cleveland find! The cocktails were wonderful! The food is delicious and flavorful on it's own, but they have an assortment of homemade sauces that are awesome. Use them. My favorites were the chimichurri, garlic aioli, and the spicy peanut sauce. We ordered a variety of items- appetizers like dips and guac, arepas, burgers, etc- everything was loved and devoured. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Can dine inside or out. When you're ready to leave, bring the check to the register (in the front near the hostess stand) to pay. They accept reservations which may be a good idea as the restaurant isn't massive and was fairly busy on this Friday evening. Nice place for a date or a group of friends. Free street parking. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Last night my friends and I came here. It was my and 1 of my friends first time, the other friend had been here before. I was so impressed by the decor and the vibe I got when I walked in. We got chips and guacamole; so amazing. I'm really not a fan of fried plantains but yours are so so good. I got a chicken arapa with yuca fries as dinner. I couldn't tell you the last time I was at dinner, and every single bite I took, \"mmm\" or \"oh my god\" escaped. The sauces you bring to the table really bring dinner together. Add a pitched of margaritas and some laughs; I really REALLY can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"A super lovely dining and drinking experience in Old Montreal. We moseyed in with a group of four and no reservation around 8pm on a Wednesday, we were greeted so warmly and with a fluid Franglais that is the best of Montreal and smilingly offered a perfect little booth. The room is dim and lovely and quirky and fun with fat grey stone and a large bright front window looking out on the cobblestones. Oysters were clean and fresh and perfect, my fish of the day was so cosey and good and all our cocktails and wine suggestions were perfect. I don't remember what my friends ordered just that we sat for a long while laughing and perfectly comfortable and happy with all our decisions that day."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little restaurant. The staff is very pleasant. The tables are close. Not much waiting room. I had steak which was extremely tender and grilled to perfection. Dance floor is small."}
{"text":"Barroco is a game changer. I have been here many, many times and my food is always delicious. I've always had good service, and never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table and you can BYOB. The cheesy corn is amazing, the ropa veija is mind blowing and the steak maduros are what dreams are made of. I'm happy to see a small, family owned restaurant do so well, so even those the prices have gone up I'll keep coming here."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. My expectations weren't too high because I love Colombian food and the location made me wonder. Once you go inside you see how friendly the atmosphere and staff are. The menu is very simple, not good if you like your decent amount of choices, but if you really love food you won't mind, since the few selections are all delicious. And you can adapt your favorite combinations of toppings to your arepas, for instance. Also, do a favor to your self and order the Maduros con Queso as appetizer - delicious fried banana with cheese - decadently good!"}
{"text":"Came to town on business with a couple of associates, and while I'm very familiar with Catherine Street over many visits, this was my first walk through Old Town. We just happened to stumble upon this place. Service was fantastic, waitress was lovely, the decor is old school. The menu is small, but we all had something different and everybody was thrilled. My buddy Al had the osso buco and said it was the best. The salmon I had presented well and tasted amazing. 
It gets a little crowded in there, but it was still relatively quiet. Good wine selection. I wish I had been able to convince my wife to come along on this trip, as she would have loved this place. Definitely a return destination."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with the family.  Awesome place!  Had the Chicken Arroya (spelling?), and the chicken was premium white meat nicely seasoned.  We also had the chees and corn appetizer (the name escapes me), and that was just the best cheese sauce that I have ever had.  My young boys and I really enjoyed this place.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a terrific atmosphere! The staff is wonderfully nice too. I highly recommend their cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"Barroco Grill is a place of wonder and excitment. No Willie Wonka or Oompa Loompas. No, none of those things. It's a place of wonder because of the unique cuisine they serve there. Yes, there'll be things you've never eaten before but it's not an endangered species nor are you sampling something from the yonderparts. 
The thing you'll see on their menu that stands out are the Arepas. White corn mesh, mashed and shaped. Griddle fried then stuffed. Yep it's a Columbian (I think) grits (that a whole new category of good from the south) sandwich. Way south.
I ordered the arepa fries and paid little attention to its taste. It's cruchy stiffness lends itself perfectly to the sauce tasting journey that was already at the table when we sat down. I liked garlic sauce the best.
Our chorizo arepa was as you can imagine good. Good crunchiness of the arepa with the nicely sautéed pepper and onions with cheese and tasty chorizo. Yeah, that little sucker had it coming when it landed on my table. 
The best part about Barroco Grill is not the food. It's not the ambience (small but decent, really nothing to write home about). It's the fact that it's located in Lakewood. Welcome, Barroco."}
{"text":"Great for dinner with friends! Bring your own booze is encouraged since they do not serve alcohol, and you MUST try the ariapas your first visit. Be daring and try something new on the menu, I haven't been able to choose something not delicious yet!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely incredible. Food was absolutely amazing. Drinks were awesome. They have a drink Bible and an incredible wine list. Ambiance was very nice with a nice vibe throughout the restaurant. I had the quail with pasta Ragu, which was the special for the evening. It was absolutely incredible as to flavor and tenderness of the quail. Portion sizes are just right. The wait staff were very attentive and kept our wine glasses and water glasses filled throughout our stay there. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed their dinner. One person ordered the pasta, another order the oysters, and another ordered the duck. All of us were very impressed with our meal and restaurant experience. I would definitely recommend Barroco if you are in the Old Town area of Montreal."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with my kids and we all love it.. Can't wait until they open the downtown location so we don't have to drive as far."}
{"text":"Loved the place and food! The plantains were great as an appetizer. Fried with your choice of 5 different sauces to eat with it. Service was a little slow while there was no one in the place but overall I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Awesome time! Awesome food! Live music made the atmosphere even livelier!  The menu is as colorful with variety as the decor. We danced all night. A must see!"}
{"text":"Barroco has a wonderful wine list and terrific specialities offered every night. The staff are knowledgable in both the menu options and the wine list. We had the cheeses for our appetizer along with the oysters. Both were very good. For dinner we had chicken and pasta both were outstanding. Musical playlist made the evening!"}
{"text":"We took the family here to celebrate end of school and had a great time.  While easy to classify the food as Mexican, It was clearly not and had lots of Colombian influence that is harder to find.  Appetizers of empanadas and guacamole served with fresh made plantain chips were both awesome.  They serve many varieties of are arepas that our server Eduardo encouraged to be customized.  I had the chorizo maduros (Sausage with added chicken  over a caramelized bed of plantains  ) and really enjoyed

The atmosphere is fun and layed back with BYOB if you want"}
{"text":"Holy cow, what a great reason to go to birdtown.

I never expected to find fantastic authentic Colombian food in my hometown, but Barroco delivers. Fantastic fresh food (yay empanadas), great sauces (pineapple sauce and the chimichuri are great), and gratuitous use of cilantro. 

Another five star reason? BYOB! They've got live music and allow you to bring your favorite brew. The owner served us, and was a truly proud owner that was passionate about the food he served. 

So yeah, get here, it's great."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim after seeing it on yelp last night and man were we impressed!! The decor is \"Mexican street style\" very unique and fun! 
Neither of us had tried an arepa before and ohhhh goodness it is the best thing in the world! Made with 100% white corn, they're gluten free!!! Every thing is made to order, fresh, and delicious. I could not have been more impressed and we will be returning very soon! Arepas.. Who knew?!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to eat when I'm craving some Latin American fare. The arepas the way to go, plus their cubano is top notch. The cheesy corn dip is great and so is the guac; really in a place where everything is handmade you can't go wrong. It is a very small place though that has expanded with a great deck but the kitchen is still small. If you're a person that writes a review  based solely on the speed of the service you will not like this place but if you want to sit and enjoy your self you can't do much better."}
{"text":"300+ reviews can't go wrong.  Our group started with Caiparinhas and Mojitos.  The mojitos are different as they contain Kraken spiced rum in addition to white rum.  Cheesy grits, steak paticon and pork and steak arepos.  Never had any of them.  Please open a location in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food here is never disappointing. We've  used Uber eats on several occasions & was never disappointed. 
Also, visiting this establishment is always equally pleasant. 
Excellent food, awesome service, wonderful environment!!!
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the great reviews are for.  Food is truly just okay. Ordered the carne asada and wife ordered one of the arepas.  Flavors were there in both dishes but nothing to wow the taste buds.

The 45 minute wait for food and 30 minute wait for our check was more than annoying."}
{"text":"Great food and environment.  Friendly staff. But three people is far too many for the table size.  The anxiety from being so cramped was reason enough for the low rating."}
{"text":"Wow - what a hidden gem! My fiance and I went to dinner here on a breezy Saturday night around 7pm and had to wait about 20 minutes - was not bad. When we first walked in though, I instantly got in a giddy mood - the atmosphere is just so lively and fun. The greeting staff are very nice and accommodating. 

By suggestion of the waitress, we ordered the bacon wrapped maduras (new on the menu) and wow were we in heaven. For a concoction you would rarely think of, they were so flavorful - I literally wanted to order another order of them when we were done. For the main course, this was my first time having an \"Arepa\" and I was a bit confused as to what it was - basically it is like a thick corn tortilla, that is soft on the inside and a tad crisp on the outside. Barroco makes them super authentic and delicious, I dont think I would try them anywhere else. I ended up ordering the Ropa Vieja Arepa and was not disappointed. It was so delicious and I would get it again and again!

The drinks were great too, I got a mojito that came with real sugar cane which was sweet and refreshing and my fiance got the margarita on ice (actually he got 2)!

Not only was the food so amazing, we absolutely loved the live music which helped make the atmosphere and experience just so great for a fun date night! This is the spot in Lakewood and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am loving the vibe here.  It's energetic and colorful, much like the food at Barroco.  This is my second time here and I'm definitely going to be here a third time.  There's just so many things to try and surprisingly, my stomach isn't big enough for one trip. I tried the Arepas this time and although I'm not a huge fan of the texture of the arepa itself, I was wowed by all the flavors going on in my Reina Pepiada.  I never thought avocado and feta would go so well together.  The sauces that the server brings with your entree is pretty exciting....I just love dipping things, especially fries, which is what I did.  My favorite was the hot sauce.  If you are into trying different foods and appreciate exotic flavors, give Barroco a try."}
{"text":"loved to ambience. great food. average drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in lakewood.. The Hawaiin arepa with tostones and pineapple salsa is the best!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and unique to this area, prices are reasonable and it has a great vibe. Oh and it's BYOB...need I say more?"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Great food and service. Had the beef ribs and steak.  Steak was good but the beef ribs is the standout dish.   In the middle of Old Montreal so plan to arrive a bit earlier if you are driving as parking around here is nuts."}
{"text":"I absolutely CRAVE Barroco. Everything is delicious. If you haven't been before, get an arepa on your first visit. Don't be shy with the sauces - try and mix them all. It'll be hard, but try to keep a little room for a merengada for dessert (the milkshake to slay all milkshakes)."}
{"text":"You guys...this is one of the best meals I have ever had.  

Thanks again to Yelp and a helpful clerk at the UDF nearby, we got to experience arepas that could get me to make a special trip back to Cleveland.  

The chicken and chicharrons in the one I ordered were marinated in some kind of awesome that just made the entire thing incredible.  We got sides of yuca fries and crispy plantains that could have earned the place 5-stars on their own.

The sauces that are brought to the table will leave you wondering which one you like the best, and continually alternating between them.  

A great portion size for a hearty lunch, super flavorful filling, and topped off with a delicious flan. 

This will absolutely be on my list of recommendations for friends visiting the area in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for my 2nd Anniversary and I was really excited to try this place out after reading all of the reviews. Fortunately they did not disappoint!

We had a reservation for 6:30, they open at 6:00 PM so fortunately it wasn't very packed, we were seated quickly by our hostess who looks a tad bit like Jennifer Lawrence. The restaurant   is very cozy and beautifully decorated and the staff is very attentive. 

For Starters we had the charcuterie board which was De-li-cious. Unfortunately, I cannot recall what the different cuts were but if you love charcuterie, you will love this. It also included a side of toast with Veal and Tarragon butter, that just melted in your mouth. 

Drinks, we had the Maple Old Fashioned (which was very smooth and very strong, loved it) and the Pimms Cup (which disappeared before I could even have gotten a taste)
 
For Entree, we had the Ribsteak and the Beef Shortrib which were the highlights of the meal. First of all the Ribsteak was humongous, I have never gone to a restaurant and gotten such a large piece of steak. Better yet it was so soft and the chimichurri sauce just knocked my socks off. Each bit was a small taste of carnivore heaven, I wish I could re-live that moment over and over again. Next was the ever-so-tender Beef shortrib, this was fall off the bone type of meat and it was so delicately flavored that I had to stop myself from stealing it from my girlfriend. Two amazing entrees, sent from the heavens that I would drive all the way back from Boston for (Hmm..maybe next year). 

This meal was definitely something, I would love to experience again. Thank you for the phenomenal meal Barroco!"}
{"text":"Been back a couple more times since this review and absolutely have to upgrade this place to five stars. Perhaps my favorite restaurant on the west side."}
{"text":"Can we just talk about their hot sauce for a minute? OMFG, their hot sauce is what dreams are made of.  Seriously, it's as addictive as heroin.  It's spicy (not too spicy) and peanuty and f***ing delicious.  Our server wisely mentioned to me that they bottle it and sell it for $5.  I would have paid $100.  Now, on to the rest of the story:
The atmosphere is laid back and cool, kinda like momocho.  The arepas were fantastic.  We also started with the cheesy corn appetizer (which they made vegetarian for us) and it was super good.  Also they note on the menu which items they can make vegetarian and they offer to add more veggies instead of meat.  Score!  Our server was friendly, quick and very knowledgeable.  Great experience overall, and we will definitely return.  Wait, did I mention how amazing their hot sauce is?"}
{"text":"tellement fantastique avoir trouvé un restaurant qui offre une paella digne de ce nom! Apres avoir goûté à ce met en Espagne, il est difficile de trouver un endroit à Mtl qui en sert d'aussi bonnes! J'AI TROUVÉ! Elle était délicieuse, si bonne qu'on en mangerait à chaque repas! Et que dire du mi-cuit de cerf en entrée! Tout goûte le ciel içi! 

L'endroit est parfait en plus ! Du style baroque, taverne underground tu te retrouves dans un endroit intime et sympathique !! 

Bref, j'ai adoré! A refaire !!"}
{"text":"A small and very quaint place in a stone house built in 1802. The service is amazing as well as the food the hostess even brought and shared a birthday shot with us. Everyone is super friendly. The food superb. Try the Foie Gras and the Beef Rib."}
{"text":"I ordered an arepa with chorizo and i got one with meat which was raw and dryad. The guacamole was good, but the plantains that came with were horrible  again dried and hard. People think this place its the best but in the land of blindness the guy with one eye is king. Im not going to say anything else. Maybe i ordered too late, but I'm never going to ordered food from this place again way over rated"}
{"text":"When you walk in, you feel like you've teleported to a Colombian restaurant where you'd see locals and regulars hanging out, having a cocktail, and laughing while enjoying good food. The decor has such a fun yet relaxed feel to it, that if you go with just another person or two, you'll have the urge to come back again with a bigger group. The drinks were well made and had a nice kick. The menu has so many good looking items on it that it's hard to pick -- everything sounds so good! I ordered the Bandeja Paisa, which came on a large wooden plate. The braised beef with plantains and beans were tasty, along with the Colombian chorizo and chicharrones! One of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The service, atmosphere and food are all fantastic at Barroco! My friend and I dropped in on a Wednesday night, and even though we did not have reservations (which I HIGHLY recommend) Anne Marie was more than happy to find us a seat...albeit it did require some musical chairs. The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor. The service and attention to detail was spot on. (Thank you Anne Marie, Nicola and Adrian)! If you find yourself in Montréal - make a reservation in Old Montréal and eat at Barroco!"}
{"text":"Barroco Grill is one of family's go to restaurants.  Being a hispanic family, we are always trying new hispanic restaurants to find some good Latin American food, and this is definitely the top of the top.  

Their arepas keep us coming back for more!  I always get the chorizo arepa (my favorite), but have tried all of the arepas and all are top notch.  Plus, their sauces are amazing, and i always try to take some home with me.  

Besides the arepas, another must try food is the cheesy corn dip.  What seems like an average appetizer becomes a staple in every dining experience.  

The staff is very friendly (and speak spanish!), and you're able to write on the walls of the restaurant, making for an excellent atmosphere.

Highly Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Birdtown's weird, but Barroco isn't. This place is a true gem, the kind that you can only find in a city. I was so, so excited to learn of an authentic arepa spot in Cleveland!

My mom has been dreaming of arepas for the last 15 years, ever since our Venezuelan exchange student introduced her to them & cooked them from scratch for us with some regularity. She's only had them once since then, but she talks about them often, so when I learned of Barroco, I knew we'd have to make a pilgrimage up from Akron.

Everything on their menu looks awesome - like, truly. I can only speak to what we had, but it was all delicious - the Mexicana arepa was spicy & overstuffed, with sweet maduros (plantains) on the side; I could've eaten three times as many as they gave me, they were that good. My mom & boyfriend both got the Montañera - a \"grilled arepa with melted mozzarella served flat on its back then topped with carne (braised beef on our hogado sauce) and with a fried egg\" - & they had about half leftover to take home. They both got tostones (savory plantains, smashed flat & fried) on the side, which served as platters for the bevvy of creative sauces Barroco makes available to every table just before they serve you. 

The atmosphere inside is fun & funky, with paintings & writings all over the wallls & Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling. On sunny days, sit outside on the patio in the alley. Barroco is BYOB, & they'll bring you glasses for your wine and/or a bottle opener for your beer, if needed. Bring whatever you want! 

I believe the Food Network named Barroco the Best Sandwich in Ohio, & I'd believe it. There's not a damn thing on the menu that I'm not interested in devouring. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A lovely place with great food and amazing flavors in the middle of Old Port. The waiters were very attentive and described all the dishes and specials in detail. We tried the burrata (loved it! highly recommend), tuna tartare (nice, but would not recommend), duck magrit (delicious and well made). 

Only problem: The restaurant is too dark, we could barely see our menu."}
{"text":"Colombian food that's flavorful, rather than spicy. Barroco is known for their arepas which are simply amazing. I recommend the Montenero arepa with a side of maduros (sweet plantain). In warmer weather, there's an outside patio. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing here! Exposed brick, very dark lights, secluded tables ... right in the heart of Old Montreal.

I ordered the short ribs which were delicious but absolutely not worth $39.  My date ordered pasta - this was a very small portion with no protein whatsoever - for over $20.  It really should not have been priced at more than $12.  Although the quality of the food was good (including the pre-dinner bread), the prices at this place are simply too high."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!

For a pre-birthday celebration, my fiance and I ventured from downtown to Lakewood for some dinner and drinks. We kept hearing about this awesome Colombian food joint with daily specials, so we thought we would be spontaneous and stop over to Barocco. 

BEST DECISION WE'VE EVER MADE!

First off, the margaritas were $5 all day. Mason jars filled with yummy tequila, and salt of course on the rim. You definitely get a bang for your 5 bucks. What a treat.

We ordered the Condado Cheese dip for a charge up to our meals. Cheddar jack creaminess with chorizo and sofritas, served with warm tortilla chips hit the spot entirely. You get a variety of sauces just placed at your table, ranging from spicy chipotle, to garlic, to vegan sweet pineapple to eat with your chips and add to your meals. I'm a \"Condiments Gal\" so this was right up my alley, and they all tasted amazing.  I was almost too full for my meal, until it came out. 

I ordered the Reina Pepiada, a chicken arepa stuffed with feta, peppers, avocado and mozzarella. There was no way I wasn't going to devour this gorgeous dish.  HOLY CORN TORTILLA. You can definitely tell the arepa tortilla was made in house, as it was light and fluffy to perfection. The combination in my arepa was perfect in taste and amount, and the maduros (because let's face it, if plantains are on the menu, you gotta get them) were caramelized to perfection. 

There were so many options I wanted from the menu, that I will be getting back here sooner than later. The ambiance, the help, the food, the drinks...all worth a drive to Lakewood."}
{"text":"The food is good and priced well. This place is good to throw into the 'every day' rotation but isn't going to wow you . No reason not to support this local business. The fries are nothing out of the ordinary but great with the garlic sauce. 

Keep in mind that the restaurant is small and the service may struggle to keep up when it gets busy. The menu is so simple that any confusion can be sorted out quickly."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambience, service, meal and wine list.  My boyfriend and I had a late night meal here on our first night in Montreal: oysters, oysters with foie gras, charcuterie and cheese, venison tataki...all mouth-wateringly good!  The homemade horseradish sauce for the oysters led us to order seconds....absolutely delicious!  Highly recommend for an intimate dinner with a beau or a couple of friends!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, an even a better service.

Cheesy corn was amazing! It is rich so make sure you leave some appetite for the main dish. Changua de platano (a Colombian stew) was a perfect mix of flavors. I felt like I was back in Cartagena, Colombia.

However, the powerful flavors of the meals would make this only a nice restaurant. Everyone on the staff was incredibly friendly, as friendly as they can be!

They allow dogs in the patio and they made my golden retriever feel like she was queen of the place. They even gave her organic chicken.

My puppy would be happy to know that as we are relocating to Cleveland during the week, we will be becoming regulars."}
{"text":"I have one totally amazing word that rolls off your tongue like magic - Chicharrones. Mmmmm.
My husband and I ventured out on a Date Night (and when you have a 3 year old and a newborn, a wonderful night Date Night is!) and tried something new. 
The arepas are really tasty and it was definitely something new for us. Of all the cuisine I have tried, I don't think I have ever had Columbian. We will be back for more treats from their menu and the array of dipping sauces that arrives at your table is divine! I love to dip!! 
We both got an entree (and hello! The yuca fries are amazing!!) and my husband got a beer and it was very reasonable in price. 
If you are on a date or at least in a situation where you want to chat with your dinner mate, I do recommend not eating near the back. There was a lovely little old man playing guitar, but the restaurant is small and they sat us right near him so I asked to be moved. I love good live music but I was just more interested in connecting with my hubs over some mouth watering food. Lakewood kicks culinary buns again with this winning restaurant!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY highly overrated.  Service is just mediocre -- food isn't great.  There are so many terrific restaurants in Montreal, why go to this overpriced place?  Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Very friendly, helpful staff. Beautiful interior. All the drinks and food were top notch. Perfect for a date. Try to find parking beforehand online because there is none available in the narrow streets of old town."}
{"text":"Barroco is a favorite of mine and my husband's and definitely our \"go-to\" when we're craving something different. 

We made a trip out yesterday for my birthday and per usual it didn't disappoint! 

One of our favorite things about this restaurant is that it's BYOB, glad to see that's still around. It certainly is a big influence in why we pick going here and is what initially got our interest to make our first restaurant. Nice to not be limited to certain beer choices. 

We FINALLY GOT THE CHEESY CORN!!! I always see it highly recommended and never bothered. Oh. My. Tastebuds. Absolute perfection and pairs so well with the arepas. We both agreed that we'd probably next time just order 2 of these as our entrees. Very filling for an app! 

I got the fajitas con arepas, I think what my husband ordered was the montanera, it came in a corn husk with a friend egg and a complimentary side, he chose the chili. My entree was good but it didn't blow me away, I've had several other dishes here that have though so I'll just attribute that to personal preference. Loved the arepas it came with though! My husband was initially unimpressed with the portion size of his but after finishing the meal noted it was actually very filling. We both enjoyed the chili."}
{"text":"Sangria is awesome 
Queso chicken dip yummy  
Sat outside. Beautiful day. 
Live music. 
Excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"We actually were going to grab takeout from somewhere else but that place was closed.  So we popped in to Barraco.  We both got arepas, I got the La Gringa and my husband got the Chorizo.  They were both PHENOMENAL.  The host and guy at the counter were super friendly and our food was up quickly.  We'll definitely be back to dine in as the atmosphere of the place is great and they have a nice deck on the back.  This is also very near to our house and I can't believe we've waited this long to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and nice waitress.   I had cuban sandwich that was good, but served on a normal roll-type bread, not pressed, but was still good.  Table Sauces were good, garlic almost too garlic and I love garlic.  One in our party had a dish with the plantains and said they were tough to eat.  Guacamole was AWESOME.  Would definately return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Yes - the cheesy corn dip is as good as everyone says. Good appetizer for a group, as it would fill up two people before the main course! I've only had the arepas so I can't speak to the rest of the menu, but they were delicious and the sauces compliment any of them nicely. It is BYOB and they will give you glasses and open any bottles that you need opened. Only 4 stars because the price has gone up quite a bit."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal a coupe weekends ago and this place was recommended by a friend. It was also recommended by the hotel concierge - so we knew it must be great.  The food was outstanding and the atmosphere cozy and typical old Montreal. The stone walls looked several hundred years old and they'd kept the historical charm of the building intact while adding a clean modern look. Service was outstanding as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!,
We had a summer special, \"rope vieja\" , the cheese corn appetizer and a pork/chorizo arepa.  They're known for the arepa, so don't skip that, but the special was simply amazing.
The cheese corn with bacon gratin is so rich that you'll need four people.  A little sale goes a long way as you'll have plantain chips to dip into it.
We two ordered these three dishes, 2 drinks, total about $35, filled up on less than half, and took the rest home for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Barroco Grill hit every check box I have for a lunch time restaurant. It was quick, cheap, and delicious. Plus, the food was authentic and by default Gluten Free!

I had never tasted an arepa prior to my visit, so being the wimp that I sometimes am when trying new foods, I opted for the original steak arepa. It was good, and the sauces you could add on made the arepa even better. My favorites were the spicy peanut and the pineapple sauce. The spicy peanut had a nice kick to it and cleared up my sinuses. The pineapple was like pure sugar. I added it to the arepa and it made it taste like dessert.

I would give a heads up that the meal could potentially be messy. I will definitely try to go back to master the art of eating an arepa without getting anything on my shirt."}
{"text":"We chose Barroco for our splurge night dinner in Montreal. The restaurant is beautiful. Dimly lit, with candles everywhere. I especially loved the large, open windows which made it feel like we were dining outside.

We ordered the cranberry drinks, which were mixed to perfection. I tried the mediterranean branzini which I can't recommend highly enough. The fish was flavorful and topped with roasted nuts. I was starved so I ordered the risotto on the side. I'm glad I did, because the portion size was on the smaller side. 
 
My date tried the lamb chops along with the mashed potatoes. Holy amazing! The food was so good, we finished each and every last morsel - which is wonderful, but sadly left no room for dessert. I did look through the dessert menu though, and it was to-die-for! 

I'll be back here next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Yuuuuuussss. simply amazing colombian food,=."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Unfortunately, I was reminded of how much I love it when the new W 6th street location completely destroyed the whole concept for me this afternoon. It was like Chipotle had stolen the arepas, stripped them of their authenticity and freshness and put them on the assembly line. Sorry folks, you still have to drive to Lakewood for this one, I promise it's worth it. Amazing service, consistently great (like, oh my god I have to tell you how good this is while I am still chewing, great) food, reasonable prices and BYOB."}
{"text":"Beautiful new location, same unbelievable food! I love the veggie arepas, fries, black bean soup and maduros. Great service, great alternative to the Barrio scene. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. The service is good but the food is dry and a little bland. The decor is awesome but everytime we eat there, we are disappointed."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm...Num Num Num!  Did this for a food group a few years back as a \"Cheap Eats\" with a few Groupon deals as well.  We love it!  Cheesy, chicken corn dip, Arepas...Everything is awesome!  So glad they opened that back area because when they first opened, it was CRAZY compact (but yummy nonetheless)"}
{"text":"Very Nice and It's a Great addition for The City of Lakewood Food is Great!! A Must Try For Those That Never Had :)"}
{"text":"Meh. I went here about a year ago and never Yelped about it, so keep in mind that this review isn't recent. However, I just wasn't that impressed. It tasted like, apart from one or 2 of the sauces, something I could easily make at home by myself, and much cheaper. Didn't taste authentic to me. If you're looking for authentic Latin food that will blow you away (and a similar concept to an arepa) at a buck sixty a pop, get pupusas at Pupuseria La Bendicion. I know, arepas are Colombian and pupusas are Salvadoran, but my point is--Barroco was nothing special. La Bendicion is."}
{"text":"Cute little place. It was packed but luckily there wasn't a wait. Service was fast and friendly. Good food and decent portion. They have great sauces that are at each table. I recommend trying them all. If you're used to chips and salsa, make sure to order it or another appetizer as it is not complimentary (I'm assuming this is not complementary since it's a Colombian restaurant and not Mexican)."}
{"text":"Charming, cozy atmosphere, friendly service, excellent cocktails and the best short ribs you'll ever eat.  I can't recommend this place enough. Vegetarian friendly.  The prices are reasonable.  

Ordered:
 - Beef short ribs (phenomenal)
 - Smoking gun cocktail (so good I ordered another one for dessert)
 - Tagliatelle with burrata and an arugula pesto
 - Gin rosemary

It's small, so you'll probably need a reservation.  This is in the old city, so it's easy to walk to and there are plenty of other options for pre-gaming or a nightcap.  This is a place for foodies, but it's not pretentious.  It's not white table cloth dining but the food is par excellence.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this place - unless they are a complete asshole.  I'd take my mom, my gf, my boss and my tailor (together or separate)."}
{"text":"Pour une ambiance feutrée et romantique, vous avez trouvé l'endroit idéal! 

Éclairage tamisé et pièce chaleureuse faite de pierres typique du Vieux-Montréal. 

Les plats sont bons et les prix raisonnables.

Bien situé sur la rue St-Paul, il est facile de le manquer car c'est plutôt discret."}
{"text":"Perfect. Ambiance, uniqueness, deliciousness. Favorite restaurant in town. Nothing compares absolute one of a kind."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was really good!!! Loved the chicken with mushroom hot dog! It's only $4 during happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"We came on a weekend night and had to wait about an hour, but that's because we had a group of 8. We sat on their covered back patio, which had heaters. 

To kill a little time, we ordered drinks. A house beer and a mojito were $17, but they were both really good and worth the price. The house beer has a bunch of fruit in it and was right up my alley, very smooth. My wife thought it was the best mojito she's ever had.

I appreciate how informative the menu was. It even has a dictionary on the front page with all of the different types of fillings that you may ha e never heard of. They have pictures of what each sauce looks like. People that may not be familiar with Colombian food definitely don't have to feel uncomfortable ordering. 

I think what I really love so much about this place is how different it is. I could never re-create this type of food at home, and I had never had anything resembling an arepa before. I got the Mexicana with chorizo and it was awesome. It had the perfect amount of spice: where you feel it, but don't need 19 glasses of water to make it through the meal.

The sides are so different and scrumptious. The maduros and the tostones were unique, way better than getting fries. You can get fries anywhere, I enjoyed going out of the box.

The sauces- wow. I was eating the green chimmi-churro with a spoon when people weren't looking. I think I went through half a bottle. The ranchero was also amazing. 


FYI- As of the time I'm writing this, they do offer a Groupon."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this spot by some friends and could not have been happier.  The food was amazing and dinner for 4 came to $54 - really can't complain about that.  I've been thinking about it for the last few days and my husband admitted he's been craving it as well.  Can't wait to go back.  Only downside - maybe I'm old but I thought this place was SO LOUD!  I could barely hear the folks at my own table.  Loved the BYOB aspect though - wish more places would do this."}
{"text":"Thanks to a Venezuelan friend, I've long been a big fan of arepas, so I was excited to try this. Maybe I just went at a perfect time, but it really just hit the spot. I went for the veggie arepa with an order of arepas \"fries.\" My husband went for a cubano, as he's been seeking one since Lelolai apparently went out of business after moving to the Old Arcade. We both really enjoyed our meals, though the arepa fries - even shared - were a bit of overkill for us. Delicious, but sooooo dense on top of the rest of the meal. The BYOB factor kept the tab really small, and we enjoyed the service and cute tiny space. It's a really nice option in a town with few similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Outstanding Latin food! I'm a world traveled foodie, especially foods from Latin countries and I must say that they got it right! A casual and uncomplicated atmosphere that is reminiscent of many places in my travels. The service may seem hectic but they get it right. Helpful servers that deliver their yummy food with a smile.
Only been there once but will def be heading back!"}
{"text":"My search for the perfect speak will have to continue. I ordered a steak, ribeye, but they said it only comes medium rare. It doesn't matter how they cook this terrible piece of meat, even I cannot of salvaged that thing on the grill. There was maybe four good bites of the whole steak, the rest of it was fatty gristle meat. I truly believe, had it been a better cut of meat it would've been delicious. I will not be going back anytime soon. Sad face emoji."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Shrimp ceviche served w/ plantain \"potato\" pancakes 

1st Entrée : Steak Maduros (marinated shredded steak over a caramelized bed of plantains  

2nd Entrée: Ropa Arepa (braised beef and red peppers in a corn meal bread shell
 

My girlfriend and I were on our way through Cleveland and stumbled across Barrocco Grill on our lunch web search. The high reviews are for good reason. BG is definitely deserving of the praise.

I tend to be intrigued when I'm unfamiliar with the majority of menu items offered. Pan-Latin cuisine is a refreshing palate change and was seemingly well represented in BG's dishes. 

Whether you have a taste for meat, fish or veggie, BG can accommodate you.

Be sure to try all five sauces they offer. They range from sweet to spicy and everything in between.  

We will definitely make a stop on our way back to Chicago."}
{"text":"I visited Barroco for the first time tonight with my friend. We had a Livingsocial deal and were quite excited to use it. Latin is one of my favorite cuisines, so I had high expectations. 

We started with the empanadas colombianas, which are filled with shredded beef and potatoes. They were crispy and flavorful and the potatoes were just soft enough. They were delicious. My friend had never had plantains, so we went with the chicken tostones, which are large plantain chips covering in fried onions, peppers, corn, chicken and mozzarella cheese. I wasn't sure what exactly to expect when we ordered these, and we were surprised by just how large the plate was. This appetizer really is meant for a group. But we split it as our entree so that worked out. The plantain chips were fried to absolute perfection and the toppings were tasty. The only problem I had with this dish was that there was too much cheese on top - we scooped most of it off and put it to the side.

The servers and staff were very friendly and welcoming. The wait time for food was very reasonable in my opinion, maybe about 10 minutes for each dish. The atmosphere was nice as well. The lights weren't too dim and the music wasn't too loud. 

Overall, I will definitely be visiting Barroco many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on our last night in Old Montreal. It was highly recommended by the staff at our hotel. Aesthetically I can see why it was recommended for a romantic dinner, the setting is dark and cavernous looking with romantic lighting and decor. However the food was ehh, very overpriced, and the waitstaff was very pushy with the wine list.

We ordered:

Seafood Paella- Delicious only thing worth going to this restaurant for. We should have just ordered the paella for two. 

Braised Short ribs- ehh I've had better, I didn't  like the cilantro flavor.

Goat cheese salad- nothing special.

Risotto- not worth it, it was very soupy. 

Chocolate layer dessert-not impressed

This restaurant is supposed to be a fusion of spanish and french cuisine, however the fusion doesn't seem to work in the palate. sorry,"}
{"text":"It's been two amazing years for Barroco.  Every time I've gone, they've found a way to improve something, and that's saying something given the frequency with which I'm over there.  Everyone I've taken to it is in love with it.  

I can't help but wonder what their next trick will be.  If you're choosing between Barroco and another place, it's not really a choice;  GO HERE."}
{"text":"So many people have raved about this place that I was champing at the bit to try it, and so I took a shot today after an exciting bout with my laundry. Inside, it was bright and the walls were covered in neat artwork and handwritten testimonials. A lot bigger than I expected, too, although that might be just memories from the other two or three restaurants that occupied the space before. I got the cheesy corn and a chorizo arepa and took them home. The cheesy corn was very good - very heavy, though. The cheese was obviously real cheese, which was nice. The arepa was tasty, but dry, and the chorizo overpowered the mozzarella cheese, peppers and onions that accompanied it. As for the fries, the potato fries were good - not too heavily seasoned or salted, which is kind of rare. The arepa fries, on the other hand, I just couldn't get into. They were bland and they had that \"chewy-crunchy\" texture that I associate with cold, old french fries. Maybe that's how arepa fries are supposed to be, I don't know, but I will definitely be substituting regular fries next time. I tried three sauces, the spicy peanut, the garlic mayo and the chimichurri. The peanut sauce was the best of the three, and would make an outstanding base for cold noodles. The garlic was decent, very garlicky but without the bitter tang that can kill a garlic sauce. The chimichurri was  disappointing, since it was basically a chimichurri-flavored mayo (and not real flavorful, to boot). The wasabi coleslaw was blah, wholly unredolent of wasabi or any other spices - but then again, how many places actually have good coleslaw (seriously, I'd love to know, I love coleslaw)? I'll be coming back, because there are lots of other dishes I want to try, but until then three stars is about as good as I can go."}
{"text":"Barroco is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Without a doubt some of the best authentic food, drinks, and always great service. 

If you have the opportunity to sit outside on their patio in the summer and listen to local music absolutely do it!"}
{"text":"This Columbian restaurant is so vibrant that looking at all of the wall decorations and paintings can take up a large chunk of your time. It's a very hip place and I'd been hearing good things about it. We got a group together and picked a weeknight to check it out. 

There was no issue seating a table of ten on a Monday but we called ahead to reserve and make sure. Looking at some other reviews on here, people recommended their cheesy corn so we got that as an appetizer and the condado cheese dip.  The condado was definitely better in my opinion, but both were very tasty. 

The menu is pretty extensive and I'd recommend checking it out ahead of time if you're indecisive.  I'm by no means an expert on Columbian food so fortunately there was a dictionary in the front of the menu which describes some of the more obscure items. They've got a different $5 cocktail from Monday-Thursday that are crafted and garnished well enough to make you think you should be paying more. Barraco had phenomenal service as our waitress was very attentive to all of our drinks and needs. 

Many of the group tried various styles of their arepas. No one seemed to have any complaints. As for my food option, I tried a CocaCola dish which is primarily a rice dish...almost like the results of a hibachi meal. The menu indicated it came with a potato salad side. Mine did not but instead included a normal salad. I didn't bother to question it because I figured I'd need some greens to complement all of the carbs I was about to devour.  Top it all with their chimichurri sauce and you'll be in heaven. The entree ended up being three separate servings for me and I'm still working on the leftovers. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I honestly had no idea what Colombian food even consisted of before coming to Barroco, but I'm so glad Barroco was recommended to me because I discovered arepas! (and now I actually crave them...) Arepas are basically these white corn tortilla pockets filled with meat, cheese, and vegetables! 

My go to here is the La Gringa arepa. There are some other items on their menu that look / I have heard are great and worth trying too but I like the La Gringa arepa so much I'm always reluctant to order anything else when I come! Maybe next time I'll just have to order 2 entrees...haha. You also get to pick a side with your order - I highly recommend the maduros (sweet plantains)! Barroco also has some great all day happy hour deals, so I definitely recommend coming on a weekday to try one of their cocktails ;) 

Barroco is a little bit on the more expensive side, but I think the food is well worth it. Overall, Barroco has delicious food, awesome happy hour deals, and great consistent customer service - seriously, if you haven't tried arepas yet, you should!"}
{"text":"Super nice folks who take care of you and let you customize your meal if you want to try a few things at once.  I'm sad that I don't live a few blocks away any longer."}
{"text":"Killer food. Tasty mojitos. Good service that'll guide you in the right direction. Sauces are top notch. Mojitos Mondays $5"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's not terrible, but to be a Latin restaurant I was expecting more. If you come from any latino background you know this place is not what you get from abuelita, it's like that nuevo latin fusion. Their arepas here are not like traditional arepas, nothing like it at all, which is kind of frustrating especially if the restaurant is going to deem itself as South American. The cheesy corn appetizer is awesome. I could have that all day. The empanadas are decent. Ropa Vieja has something missing. I have gone when they first opened and it was BYOB which was a chill vibe. It was great relaxing in patio with a bottle. Now they have cocktails which aren't bad. They also have live music which is great. The guitarist is fantastic. He played songs I requested which I loved. The service is good.  I might visit here to get grab take out because I do love the cheesy corn dish, but I wish it were a bit more authentic; if I want fake Latin food I can just go downtown."}
{"text":"I was mildly concerned given the location on St. Paul. The menu certainly wasn't as ambitious as at our previous night's dinner spot, les 400 Coups. But good restaurants exist in tourist neighborhoods; and a simple, well-prepared menu is a great virtue, too.

Barroco turned out to be not as good as les 400 Coups. But that's not a fair barometer. Barroco was certainly better than I'd feared, and also certainly better than it needed to be.

Burrata came with a nice variety of ripe heirloom tomatoes. It wasn't laden down with oils and heavy dressing. A pleasant surprise, especially given that I hadn't intended to order it (sometimes things just come out of my mouth). The cheese was creamy, but not excessive.

The branzino (another unexpected order on my part) also turned out to be quite good. A little oily. And it did not require the valiant service of macadamia nuts. But again, very, very passable.

I also enjoyed panna cotta, partly because I am a dessert baby. It came with some sort of inscrutable minty green topping. But I cannot say that I was too disturbed by that."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very quaint with terrific service. Excellent wine selections as well as unique choices for dinner.  
I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is not your usual Mexican restaurant, but a great spot to try very unique dishes. The Lima beans are a must!"}
{"text":"Delightful intimate space with superb service and delicious food to back it up.  

Came here desiring a solid bowl of pasta and got that plus a to-die-for risotto starter and a spectacular vegetable terrine.  Drinks were excellent, too (I was treated to a refreshing take on a Pimm's Cup).

Although we were without a reservation, we were accommodated with no hassle.  Overall, visit this place!  Go if you like low key, intimate settings where the focus is on the food first."}
{"text":"My friend Krizz invited us for their anniversary celebration and the food was great! Will eat at Barroco again"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. The ropa vieja is incredibly flavorful. The tostada starter is huge and mouth watering. Our servers were super sweet and helpful. Only complaint was music was too loud. I'm only 33 and I couldn't hear my friends next to me. Plus the style of music was bizarre. Slow and old. Loved the atmosphere and vibe though. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a unique place that I'd suggest going out of your way to try! The sandwiches are wonderful and very different. It's BYOB and the sauces are incredible!  

For me, someone without much experience with hispanic, latin or columbian food, the majority of the menu is an acquired taste... but once you warm up to it you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Great food, kind of tucked away on Madison and wonderful find. Columbian food isn't as popular in the area, but this restaurant shows that it showed be. It's really as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Came here as a group, at first sight, we thought there wouldn't be room for us; there's tons of room for parties of all sizes. Another group twice our size arrived shortly after us. Service was fast and very pleasant. I ordered the Ropa Vieja Arepas.. Delicious! Great atmosphere and lighting. The smaller party platter was enough to feed four hungry men. Will have to come back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Old Montreal. Highly recommend. Definitely try the beef tartare and the paella - very very delicious."}
{"text":"Great drinks and food! Our waitress was very thorough in explaining the menu. The arepas are so good and recommend a mojito! Fun atmosphere as well with live music and dancing. Perfect addition to the East-side!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here. My partner had squash soup and guinea fowl (special of the night). She loved it. I had rib steak -delicious.  Service was very good.  Loved the ambiance. 
I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Ugh, if I could give 3.5 stars, I'd be all over it. I just can't bring myself to give 4 stars for one reason.
First, let me just say: cool atmosphere, great service, good food, and it seemed clean. All good things.
However, the menu is TINY. And kind of intimidating and weird at first. My boyfriend and I couldn't really decide on anything because it all sounded so strange, but we liked what we ordered. The variety is sparse and the options are sparse, and that's why I can't give higher than A-Ok. I feel by ordering an Arepa and a Superdog, we've sampled their entire menu. If they expand the menu, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped by mid-week for lunch and had a pork arepa.  The pork was flavorful and cooked properly and thought if every arepa is like this, I'll be back again and again.  (Though, I'll try the cubano-- I've had a hankering since Lelolai vanished.)

I loved the selection of condiments and the feel of this little hole-in-the-wall on Madison.  A pleasant quick informal place for a sandwich.  I also enjoyed the photos of the Gordon Square-Detroit Shoreway area adorning the walls."}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I go, it gets better and better!!! Last night was epic! There was a wait but it didn't feel like we waited long at all.. let me just say our server was outstanding and very friendly! Our food came out looking and tasting amazing! Thanks for being great!"}
{"text":"I've been to Barroco twice now and I will admit that my first experience there did not leave me with an awesome first impression. It was by no means bad, I just didn't find anything special about it. It was before they revamped their menu and started serving alcohol. My most recent trip last night, however, has completely changed my mind. 
     They have daily drink specials, with Monday being mojitos, Tuesday sangria, Wednesday margaritas, and Thursday Piña Coladas. The mojitos were $5 instead of 9 which is an awesome deal and tasted great. We could hear the bartender crushing the mint from where we were sitting. 
     Their new menu is a little overwhelming being very large with a ton of choices, but I wanted to stick to an arepa because that's what they're known for. They are kind enough to give you a mini \"dictionary\" section on the menu for words and foods that you may not be familiar with. We used it a lot! For my meal, I went with the Mexicana Arepa, which was chorizo, jalepeno, beans, and cheddar cheese. It was just the right amount of spicy and I never wanted to stop eating. It was much better than I remember my arepa experience being last time. As my side, I got regular old French fries, but there were about 8 or so options including yuca fries, black bean soup, fried plantains, and more. 
     One thing I love about this place is all of the different sauces they have at the table to put on your food. There's a pineapple one, a garlic, a chimichurri (pesto like sauce made with cilantro), a ketchup/mayo mix, spicy peanut (so spicy but so good!), and I think that was it! I put a different one on each bite and it was a different experience each time. 
     There were about 9 people in our party and we were easily accommodated. It was about 6:30 on a Monday night and the place was decently crowded, but not packed. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here yesterday and can't wait to go back! The arepas and tostones were phenomenal. Their liquor license is limited right now, but I'm sure when it's a full license the bar will be just as good as the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and fun atmosphere in Lakewood. You have to try the appetizer called \"mazorcada\". It's not on the menu, but is delicious: pieces of chicken breast, corn, cheese, onions and crushed potato chips (sounds odd, I know, but believe....it's great!)

I ordered the ropa vieja arepa with fries. For all you meat lovers: there was so much beef that I had to eat it with a fork! Definitely good value for the serving sizes.

Oh and it's BYOB and no uncorking fee! (sorry, I'm from the DC area where they charge for EVERYTHING!) :)"}
{"text":"Gets a one because I was treated like a criminal for bringing beer into a place that was, until recently, byob. Unfriendly service made the visit unpleasant from the start."}
{"text":"This place is great! The cheesy corn dip is delicious. All of it is really good. If you have trouble kind of understanding what different kinds of foods they have there the staff is super helpful in explaining what every different kind of dish is. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for great veg-friendly places around the Cleveland area, so I was excited to try the Barroco Grill last night with my family. I like little hole-in-the-wall type places, so I enjoyed the atmosphere; however, I can see how insane the tiny place could get on a weekend evening. (We were there around 4:00pm.) The \"small parking lot\" in the back is actually just four spaces that appeared to be for employee use - don't bother going back there, just find a spot on the street. 

I ordered the veggie arepa with the menu's recommendation to add the pineapple and jalapenos, and a side of black bean soup. Even with, I have to say I was surprised that the arepa wasn't packed with flavor. The sauces were a nice bonus, and we liked trying those on our arepas and fries. The corn wrap was kind of hard - not what I was expecting. The black bean soup was decent, but I was not wowed.

For $12 per arepa, I would not go back here again. It really is just glorified fast food or food truck food, but with gourmet pricing. There are many other places in Cleveland I would rather spend my money on, where is would go much further. 

So, while we agreed that the food was decent and different than the norm, it was not worth the money and we will probably not go back, especially with so many great restaurants in Lakewood."}
{"text":"It's good but I guess I wasn't as wowed as other yelpers. My fiancé and I came here a few weeks ago on a Sunday around 3ish. There was only 2 other tables occupied which we were pleasantly surprised about. I will start by saying I was literally floored and disgusted at how filthy the 'velvet' cushion on the long communal bench in the dining area is. It literally looks like people wipe their dirty hands on it and then I'm expected to sit on it and also put my purse down? Absolutely not. 

I can't remember our waitresses name, however she was nice. To drink, I ordered a mimosa and my fiancé ordered a punch. Our drinks came out probably 10 minutes later (I was literally facing the bar, to which I just saw the waitresses congregating and chatting). The drinks finally came over, my mimosa was warm and my fiancé's drink was huge and meant for two people (two straws). You would think our waitress would tell him that. 

For apps we had the ceviche and my fiancé had a few things that are slipping my mind. The ceviche was good but the fish wasn't cut up small enough. It lacked quite a bit of flavor but that was made up by the arepa triangles, which were fantastic. For entrees, I had these open faced small chicken tacos and they were absolutely delicious. I ordered plantains as my side which were also yummy.  My fiancé ordered a shit ton of food and I really can't remember all of it but he really enjoyed his stuff too. We had sauces on our table, however none of them were explained to us until we asked, which wasn't helpful seeing as there was like, 4. I took the leftover ceviche home and cut the fish into smaller pieces, added more red onion + lime and it was bomb. The arepas triangles don't reheat well (to be expected). I will say the elephant in the room was the fact that my fiancé had this dumb punch half drank on the table the entire time. He couldn't finish it since it's basically just sugar and I didn't want it so it was a huge waste of money. Had he known it was so big he wouldn't have ordered it. Again, this could have been mentioned from the waitress seeing as we then got beers and it just.... sat there. 

Like I said, everything was good but the service is slow, lackluster and I refuse to get over the dirty bench. I'm not dying to go back but would go if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Barocco! My husband and I have been meaning to eat there for 6 months since we moved within walking distance. First of all, the space is amazing. It's small (hard to get in on the weekends), intimate, fun decorations. They do a great job of transporting you to another world. Eating there is an immersive experience that goes beyond just the food. The FOOD! It's so amazing. You can tell it's so fresh and made from scratch. I have loved plantains ever since discovering them in the Domincan and I'm so excited to find a place that makes them so good. Fantastic flavors. The seasoning on the tostones is delicious. The ceviche was amazing and a huge portion! The arepas are huge and stuffed with delicious meats and veggies and spices. We conveniently went on Margarita Wednesday($5 margaritas all day). They don't mess around with margaritas. Each one made by hand, good chunky salt, fresh juices and no skimping on the tequila. The special flavor at the time was passion fruit and it was definitely one of, possibly the, best margarita I have ever had. This place is an absolute gem and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"true to my word, rolled into Montreal, and Barroco was my first stop for dinner. Amazing food once again, and so pleased with the consistency of the great food, and fantastic staff. This time tried the osso buco with eggplant gratin, as well as paella. Heirloom tomato salad to start, and some sort of lemon and raspberry gelato to end. Symphony of flavors, each bite as delicious as I remember from 2 years ago."}
{"text":"The Pina Colada was yummy and it was happy hour! Service was excellent. The kitchen was quick! Authentic food...very tasty with lots of options. The waitress helped us make our selections and we loved it."}
{"text":"Recently got the opportunity to get back here and I need to NOT wait so long next time. It's as good and fun as it's been every time I've visited--which is a lot more than the number of reviews I've left for it. 

Side note: I'm sure most Yelpers understand there are sometimes other than altruistic reasons people leave reviews. When I read below how \"the horrible artwork ruoins (sic) the mood\" and then see the same person gave a bowling alley down the street FIVE stars, well, not hard to figure out what's going on.  Then when you see those are his ONLY two reviews, credibility just put on a party hat and left the building.  Of course, maybe it \"ruoins\" (sic) his mood because he views Latin American food as impressionistic and his favorite style is contemporary. Yeah, that's probably it. Heck, anyone would get queasy in that case. 

Barroco Grill is one of the most fun little gems in the entire city. We are blessed to have a place like this and I'm damn glad we do."}
{"text":"Awesome
Had the cheesy corn dip app and some amazing arepa
Very good waitress who took care of us.
The margaritas were ecellent"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Julie, she was the absolute best server that we have had in any establishment near or far. The food was to die for. Cubana was amazing! 
Keep up this great place! We will all be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing on the menu justifies the high prices!  Don't be fooled by the very seductive atmosphere; it is all show and no substance.  Food was edible but the prices leave a less than \"buttery\" (heard that before? - $19 glass of chardonnay!) taste in your mouth.  Short ribs are a tasty signature dish here...for inexpensive marinated meat priced at $39 we should have seen a substantial plate of ribs, we did not!  Take a seat at the bar if you must, listen to American pop standards (yawn) and share a glass of wine; eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"HUGE FAN!! Barroco Grill is my go to place. Great service, delicious food!!! I usually do take-out, only ate there twice. My order is veggie arepa add grilled pineapple and jalapenos with either black bean soup or fries. The spicy peanut sauce is my favorite!! The staff is always friendly. It is BYOB."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 more times (just a bit obsessed). The black bean soup and rice is awesome! And our waitress is always super sweet."}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich is amazing. Empanadas Colombianas are bomb, the Arepas you get the point a must try place to eat, it's a byob! They have live bands sometimes. It  gets a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came here early on a Sunday morning and was not disappointed! We started out with the Condado Cheese Dip, which was okay. I don't think I'd order it again, because there are other options that I'd want to try but it was tasty. I got the Reina Pepiada steps which was delicious and my husband got the  Ropa Vieja Arepa, which he also enjoyed. The portions were huge! We took most of it home. I think my favorite part were the delicious sauces that came with the meal to try with your arepa. My absolute favorite was the chimichurri. It was so good I opened up my arepa to slather it in sauce for when I had my leftovers. Our server was extremely attentive and very helpful with ordering and telling us about the sauces. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"A cool hideaway in Bird Town, Lakewood.  Wonderful food and ambiance.  All are welcomed- they can handle folks with diet restrictions."}
{"text":"The Barroco Burger was amazing. I love the guacamole with tostones as a starting appetizer. Service was a it slow  and didn't come to our table for a while but then explained there was a big to go order, other than that food was great definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Barroco was quite the wait.  Two minutes in Columbia is 40 minutes in the US.  However, it was well worth the wait.  Their sauces are phenomenal.  Our meals and appetizer were AMAZING!  You will not be disappointed with this food.  The service could be a little quicker. We saw our server once throughout the course of our dinner. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat, but they can't handle many costumer at one time. The person taking your name will get confused and call people that just got there, living peope that been there for 45 minutes waiting."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had a Groupon to this place and asked if I wanted to go with him. I love trying food from different cultures so I was very excited to hear of a Columbian restaurant in Cleveland. 

I tried the Chorizo Arepa (Best Seller) and it was one of the most fantastic things I have ever eaten. 

The food was so great I took my sister & her friend a few days later. I highly recommend trying this Cleveland gem. The service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Went to the Lakewood location last summer, then saw the Groupon for the Larchmere location and decided to go! We got the Mexicana arepa with tostones and choriza arepa with maduros. So. Much. Food. Doesn't look like it but the fullness grows on you after the meal... It expandings in your stomach.

We also got the Auga de Panela and the Caipirinha brazilera drinks. Both were a little on the lime side but still good.

Went during dinner rush on a Saturday night but were able to snag a seat at the bar instead of having to wait for a table to open up. Win.  Bar staff was awesome and attentive!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pleasant service. The guacamole is excellent, as are the plantains and the ceviche. 
Not many options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Barroco! From the friendly quick and attentive service to the beautiful rustic, cozy yet elegant decor inside to the delicious food. We made a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday night and even though the restaurant was very busy we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. We had some wine and oysters to start - the oysters were so fresh and came with really nice sauces. We did also try their foie gras special oyster which was just ok the foie gras didn't really add much to it , stick with their classic oysters fresh and delicious ! Their paella was to die for such great flavour with chorizo shrimp octopus scallops and the option to add lobster (extra cost), I loved the paella delicous and very filling. We also tried their guinea fowl special stuffed with wild mushroom/lasagna which was also very tasty but I have to say the paella was the star. For dessert we had the lime goat cheese cake it was so smooth and zesty it was like a cross between cheesecake and key lime pie and their classic creme brûlée which was just perfect. They do have one beautiful table/booth area for a group but other than that I would say space is limited so definitely make a reservation even just for two people since this place fills up fast and understandably so. This is a great place for a nice dinner for an occasion , a bit on the pricey side but the food is outstanding , the decor is lovely and the service is excellent !"}
{"text":"One word:  unremarkable.

Burgers and fries.  The \"famous\" arepas are simply pita pockets... made... out... of... corn.  C'mon people, the entire menu is just pretentious \"sandwiches.\"  The food was overcooked, and the service was beyond slow.  Four employees couldn't keep up with 6 orders during a 45 minute period.

Word of advice, get a coupon or something... You need about 50% off to bring the value in line with the price.  One redemption was the cheesy corn, but honestly, how can you screw up melted cheese with chunks of chicken and (bagged, frozen) corn kernels.

This is a fad restaurant, and I'm honestly surprised that it's managed to stay open as long as it has, and shocked at the level of notoriety that it has reached.

Hands down there are better, more interesting \"ethnic\"/fusion restaurants in Lakewood.  Try any of those, and skip this place."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect walking into Barraco on a Friday night but sure am glad I did. A 25-30 min wait was well worth the relaxing atmosphere & live music that awaited inside. 

The kitchen smelled delicious & proved to be with hand-made corn tortillas, the cheesy corn appetizer & the arepas. At first I thought the portions were a bit small, but I was proved wrong. The flavors were fantastic & all reasonably priced for 2. 

Each of us had a mojito at around $9 each but it was one of the best I've ever had. The combination of the fresh food, great drink, music & relaxing atmosphere made me feel like I was far away from the cold winter on vacation!"}
{"text":"Astounding. Great autumn salad, incredible bluefin tuna, great oysters, lovely presentations, and everything was absolutely delicious, including  many local gins and a house-made tonic.  Bar seating was a plus, but the entire interior looked great!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how amazing Barroco is. Amazing, authentic environment, quick and friendly service and ugh the Food is just so so great. I always get the huevos rancheros arepa wth fries, perfect every time. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came from Orlando Florida to Cleveland was drove by BARRACO and decided to go in and try it out. It was such a good decision to try this place out. The food is to die for and the menu has so many different entrees from different countries. I'm Colombian and the Bandeja Piasa is so good. Just like the ones I get back in Colombia. The environment is very welcoming. Good music, good food, and good drinks you can't go wrong with that. They also have a very cute patio in the back to eat as well. Definitely will come back and will recommend people to try it out."}
{"text":"YAAAASSSS. I have been looking for a good arepa for a while now, and my prayers have been answered. Although a bit pricier than expected, Barroco delivered with a sizable portion and excellent ambiance and service. And did I mention how goddamn good is tastes? 

Their arepas are not necessarily traditional, although made in the traditional process. They use a white corn and cut them square, but the fluffy goodness is all that you need to satisfy that rumbling gut. Throw in the delicious fillings that they offer and you are well on your way to a solid nap after eating more than your fair share of chicharrones, maduros (sweet fried plantain), tostones (savory fried plantain), and even my personal favorite, yuca fries (think a slightly more fibrous potato).

Also, do NOT miss out on their mojitos. Best I've had in Ohio, hands down. Possibly ever, but the memory gets foggy after a few. Appetize yoself with some bacon wrapped maduritos, and fill yourself up with the arepa that best fits your tastes. I personally went for the Paisa (chicharrones, chorizo, beans, fried egg, mozzarella) and I don't know if I'll ever have anything else because it was so damn good. 

Do yourself a favor - grab a friend and make your way to this charming house-turned-restaurant, sit yourselves on the patio with a mojito apiece (or a pitcher), enjoy some live music and a slow, satisfying meal. You'll be back."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing. Great vibe, incredible food. Very unique flavors you won't find anywhere else in NE Ohio. Has made many, many people that I've taken there very, very happy."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, service is great and I believe that they have live music on the weekends. You can also sit outside and the bathroom was cool !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in CLE
- Cheesey Corn is fantaaaaaaastic. You must order.
- If you get fries, get them as Arepa fries....delicious.
- Try all the sauces...each one brings a different flavor.
- BYOB....they'll even bring out glasses or mugs for you if you bring your own bottle/6pack"}
{"text":"The food here is so great! Dining in can be a bit odd if they're busy but otherwise it's fun. The atmosphere is different and almost romantic? Would be a cool date spot and they seem capable of accommodating larger groups. All the sauces are awesome! Service can be slow so try to go on a weeknight. Also it's no longer BYOB, the last time I went I didn't know and had to put my 6-pack in the car."}
{"text":"super nice people.  good food. we got the chicken/feta & mexicano areapas as well as the guacamole & plantains.  glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Before coming here, I had no idea what an arepa was, let alone what Colombian food was.  Thanks to a great Groupon deal, my brother and I discovered this place and decided to try it out.  When we got there, our waitress was very friendly and helpful in recommending dishes to us and explaining what everything was.  Service throughout our meal was excellent.

Arepas are thicker white corn tortillas shaped kind of like a pita pocket that are grilled and stuffed with a variety of ingredients.  They make these fresh in house.  I ordered one of these with a side of yucca fries, while my brother got a side of tostones (savory fried plantains).  As an appetizer, we got cheesy corn, which was corn and grilled chicken in queso, served with arepa fries and tortilla chips.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  The portions are very generous, so we had plenty to carry out for dinner the next day.  To put things into perspective, I usually finish my entrée at restaurants even when it's a generous portion.

Update: I went back for a second time and still loved it.  Only thing is that the food is pretty heavy (lots of dense carbs), so you may not feel so good if you try to eat too much of it. 

I highly recommend trying this place out if you've never been."}
{"text":"Well what I liked most was that the food had so many surprises and surprising tastes.  I was there about 6 weeks ago now and am sorry this is a later review.  But I had a great time. Food was good, very good not great.  Some of the items are very unusual and I liked that. Give this place a try for sure. Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and an overall great experience. The food is authentic Columbian. It is family ran and the staff is very warm and open to all customers that come in. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Service was prompt. It was my first time there so I relied on the waiter for recommendations. I ended up getting the braised beef with rice and black beans. It was very delicious. I would not hesitate to go there again. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I came here wit two friends last night for my friend's B-Day and it exceeded my expectations. I couldn't remember if I had been here before or their sister restaurant Bocata but once I stepped in I realized I hadn't been here before. Turns out I went to Bocata and that was also delicious but that will be another review.  I really liked the decor at Barocco. It's a small resto with candles everywhere. It's romantic but also a good place to go with friends.  I would come back. So I started with a Truffle Caesar which is made up of Russian Standard vodka , Scorpion silver Mezcal, celery bitters, red pepper, and truffle paste. It was garnished wit pickled beans and iberico ham. My friends didn't like their drink though. One had a strawberry drink that tasted of soap (perhaps there was too much thyme in the drink) lol and my other friend had a grappa cocktail. I don't know the names of their drinks but I did end up finishing my friend's strawberry drink because let's be real no drink should be left unfinished! We shared one appetizer. It was called panzanella and crispy squid. It's made of n'duja ( \"spicy, spreadable pork salumi from Italy. It is typically made with parts of the pig such as the shoulder and belly, as well as tripe, roasted peppers and a mixture of spices\"- thank you wikipedia) spread on a slice of baguette bread with Stracciatella di bufala cheese and deep fried squid on top and garnished with cucumber and celery. It was delicious and it had a kick to it. My friend made a comment that it was good but it was something he could make at home and not sure if it was worth $24. We then shared three mains because sharing is caring and we wanted to try as many dishes as possible. We had the duck magret, beef shortribs and paella for 1. The duck magret was delicious and fatty. I've only had good duck magret once before and after that it's been one disappointment after another but this time it did not disappoint. The shortribs were also delicious and fell off the bone. What impressed me the most was the paella. I haven't had really good paella in Montreal but this one was so delicious. My friends too were surprised and we only ordered it because the waitress said it was one of the only dishes that have consistently been on the menu since the opening of the restaurant. FYI the shortribs and the ribeye have also been on the menu since inception. The paella has squid, scallop, chorizo and blood sausage. We were worried that it would be very seafoody because when we walked in the resto it did smell unpleasantly like fish but apparently the smell was due to people ordering the islandic cod. We didn't order dessert. We were actually quite full. I felt it was all worth it."}
{"text":"I will start this review by telling you this is the first restaurant in Cleveland where the positive yelp reviews didn't disappoint me. In fact, this place deserves all 5 stars. When you first walk in, it appears to be very small, but after walking down the hallway, there is a large seating area in the back. The decor is eclectic and perfect. There are twinkly lights adorning the ceiling. There is graffiti style artwork on the walls, with Spanish quotes scattered randomly. I loved it. It exudes cool. On to the food, it does not disappoint. I went with my family, who were new to Colombian food, and they left obsessed and telling me this is where they want to go the next time they visit. I had the bolognese. One word: divine. My family members all had a variation of the arepas. Ssooooo good. This place is a must go in Cleveland."}
{"text":"THIS IS NO LONGER BYOB. I learned this after I brought some beer and was told I couldn't drink it. They also don't have their liquor license yet, but they promised it would be coming soon. It's worth it for just the food, anyway. 

I've been here twice around dinner-time and it's never been crowded. The walls are basically chaos with all of the decorations, lights, and hand written notes everywhere, but it doesn't come off as trashy or unorganized. It just gives it a relaxed feeling. They keep it dim inside. 

You could probably order anything on this menu and be happy with it. There are a lot of flavors to consider, and many items I was unfamiliar with, but the waitress was happy to explain my questions. There are also some definitions of the back of the menu.

I ordered a beef dish and it was fantastic. This place is uniquely Colombian and it's not like anything I've had before. I ate everything on my plate and still couldn't stop staring at other peoples' dishes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything on the menu looks delicious and it was way hard to choose. We went for lunch and had the cheesy corn dip, a chicken arepa and the beef maduro 'slider'. The 'slider' name was a bit misleading but I don't care what they call it...it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Ever. Delicious plantains perfectly cooked, with a huge serving of flavorful shredded beef, cheese sauce and guac on top. Not to be missed!!!! I think we inhaled it! Beautiful presentation and so flavorful and my new favorite comfort food. 
The cheesy dip was amazing. We could t stop eating it! The arepa was also delicious! We literally had no more room in our stomachs but we ate it anyway. Thankfully, I doubt we will be hungry again today! Prices were good, staff was amazing! So nice and really helpful with the menu and answering questions. 
The decor is super cool and the fact that it is BYOB makes this place epic. I will definitely be back!! Don't miss it if you are in Lakewood!!"}
{"text":"Food quality and service is excellent here!

Tonight, my wife asked if we could visit Barroco with the kids.  I have been hungry all day, so I said, 'Yeah, lets go!'  Upon arrival, we were promptly seated and given menus.  Our waitress was friendly and she spoke Spanish.

We ordered an appetizer of tortilla chips, avocado, and fried plantains.  The plantains were delicious, especially when dipped in the five different sauces offered here.  The sauces were really, really tasty.  The guacamole was good, but not amazing.

I ordered the Ropa Vieja Arepa and it arrived shortly after.  It was difficult to pick up off the plate because it was loaded with Latin goodness.  It was very tasty and very filling.  I couldn't eat every last bite of it.  My wife couldn't finish hers either.  

They do not serve alcohol, but you can B.Y.O.B.!  How cool is that?

The very existence of this restaurant in Cleveland is a welcomed surprise for us.  I'm sure we'll be back to try the Cubano and the Churrasco.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Love the arepas and get the black bean soup as the side!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Decided to try the new location because it was closer, and we were not disappointed. Beautiful patio area with the perfect ambiance for a date night. 

The appetizer selections were great and we tried the cheesy corn which is basically a yummy queso dip with lots of chicken and corn, served with chips and arepa fries. 

For dinner I had the Chorizo Arepa with fries. Another highlight was their array of sauces including a Pineapple Sauce that was A-MAZING! 

The servers were super attentive and helpful another plus. 

They also have live music Fridays and Saturdays at this location! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a cozy romantic dinner!  Hubby and I were staying at the Nelligan so chose this place based on the reviews as well as proximity to our hotel.  We had a wonderfully long drawn out dinner.  The cocktails we had were fantastic (he had an Old Fashioned, I had a cocktail with Aloe) as was the wine (the Barbera) and the appetizers (a seasonal salad and squash soup).  The entrees (paella and short ribs) were also very good, tho a bit disappointing after the phenomenal drinks and starters. We had the profiteroles for dessert - also delish, though I would've preferred fresh cream to ice-cream as the filling.  Our server was absolutely lovely - willing to help and checked in on us often, though was not overbearing.

Overall we had an absolutely fantastic time and thoroughly enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Barroco. I heart you.

The same Colombian friend suggested that we try out Barrocos, for some good Colombian food. Okies, we said, and off we went... I went once just for the cheese corn, and the second time, I actually got the arepas.

A small hole in the wall place in Lakewood, this place is always full when we frequent it. We sat down at a small table and took in the view of the place. Super colorful, with unique art along the walls, scattered with writings, and a view behind the small bar, to where the chefs are cooking the food. Cool.

Not that I'm a super pro at Colombian food, but I must say, the food here is quite good and definitely the \"heart-warming\" type of food. Filling and hearty and tasty. Mmmmmmm. The first time I went, I got the cheesy corn with chicken/bacon/melted mozarella and arepa fries. We shared one and it was HUGE and oh so good. The second time I went, I got the actual arepas- I mixed mine with a chicken/chorizo combination, and he got the pork. Omg, they came out piping hot and so so so good. The meat was flavorful, tender, and moist and it was just the right amount for my big appetite and left me super satisfied.

What's cool too, is that they have their own house made sauces- garlic aioli, pineapple, spicy peanut, some type of ranch, and ... something else I can't remember. All were really really good. I like the spicy peanut the best- mostly because I just like spice.

Big kudos to the owner though- he has definitely stopped and talked to us, each time we're there, suggesting items off of the menu or whatever it may be. The last time we were there, he suggested having us do a combination- thus, my chicken/chorizo. Cool. He's a cool guy- I always love that personable feel. 

Mmmmm. Go go go to Barrocos if you haven't tried it. Fast service, fast food, good price, and good people. Mmmm. Definitely a great place if you're in the mood for arepas! Mmm."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, and great service. There was live music when we went which was a fun addition, almost felt like we were on vacation!  I got the arepa with braised beef, chimichurri, avocado, and feta (can't remember the name of it), but it was very good! Beef was tender and had great flavor.  Plus all of the sauces they leave at the table were fun to try and add to the arepa for some different flavors. The mojitos and margaritas were great and had a nice strength.  We also got a queso appetizer and that was amazing!  All in all, it was just a great place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the Lakewood Barroco.  This Larchmere location has a nice atmosphere but my experience tonight was horrendous. We were with a party of 8. We got there at 6:30 and didn't get our food for 2.5 hrs. There was nobody else in the restaurant when we arrived. While waiting for our food they must have served meals and appetizers to 40 other guests that arrived after us. We should have just left but our server kept insisting the food was coming right out. I don't want to penalize the entire restaurant for one bad server, and I do believe it was the servers fault (remember the other 40 guests got their food) but the experience was just so terrible. The other waitresses noticed and spoke to our waitress but at that point a manager should have stepped up to the plate. I will never go back to this location. The food was mediocre at best. No where near as good as the Lakewood Location. This was a Wednesday evening, so it's not like we went on a super busy weekend. There is no justification for the lack of preparedness of this place. So disappointed."}
{"text":"What a wonderful spot.  I've been here a couple of times and been fortunate enough to get seated without a reservation, which frankly seems like a miracle, I would recommend making one.  Great food, great service and a great atmosphere.  Getting the one outside table they have in the summer time will forever be one of my best memories of Montreal...  sipping on  glass of wine, eating excellent food and watching the world go by is one of my favorite things to do...  even when the world is speaking French."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Tons of gluten free options. Food was outstanding. The house punch is a must have"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were trying to find a new place to try and while looking through Yelp we came across Barroco Grill. Reviews were good and the pictures looked good so we decided to head over to Lakewood. Parking was nonexistent (as in most Lakewood restaurants) so we parked on a side street. As we walked up, I got a cozy vibe as the place reminded me of a little house. As we walked in we noticed there was a front part of the restaurant and then a hallway to the back part of the restaurant. We didn't make reservations so we were told a 20 minute wait. We were offered a spot at a small \"bar\" like area in the back but we declined as we preferred a conventional table for our meal. The place was packed so we thought this has got to be good; boy were we wrong.
 
We were seated in 10 minutes at the front part of the restaurant at probably at the worst placed table in the whole restaurant. The table was wobbly, chairs uncomfortable and we were located right next to where customers pay for their meal or where patrons who are picking up their to-go orders. Also my fiancé was seated directly in front of where the servers grabbed patrons plates, it was a miracle she didn't get bopped in the head.
 
To be fair our server was friendly when she greeted us and with it being a Colombian restaurant & our first time, I was pleased she went over the menu with us beforehand but after we ordered she basically vanished until we received our bill. She explained that the cheesy corn was \"the bomb\" in her words and to get arepas's for our first time. Our cheesy corn came in about 15 minutes which came with arepa fries. I truly don't understand how so many people enjoy this dish. A bowl of what tasted like crappy velveeta, canned corn and unidentifiable meat mixed together served with cornmeal triangles really was to be blunt, gross.
 
After eating about a 2 bites of the appetizer each,20 more minutes went by when our server stated that our food would be out shortly. After 20 MORE minutes of waiting our arepa's arrived. The arepa's are like a cheese pita pocket sandwich. Mine was called the Reina Pepiada (chicken, avocado, roasted red pepper and feta). More like flavorless chicken, nonexistent avocado or pepper and feta more on the plate than in the sandwich. The arepa tortilla tasted like hard glue paste. Truly a miserable sandwich, my fiancé agreed that hers was terrible as well (I maybe ate 10% of mine). Even my side of fries were lukewarm and soggy.
 
I normally do not give 1 star reviews (I have only one other time) but this place truly deserves it. I won't say for sure that I got food poisoning but I was stomach sick and barely moved from the bed the rest of the weekend. The server was a ghost, we were surrounded by other customers the entire time because of our seating arrangement and paid 50 dollars for 2 crappy pita sandwiches, soggy fries and some crappy cheese corn. I would have 100% gotten a better meal at Taco Bell for a fifth of the price. Skip this place, not because of the lousy food and service but because I don't want you to get sick like I did for 2 days. I wouldn't come back even if they comped me 100 free meals. This may have been one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"My Second Visit Was Even Better!

Who knew my last visit to Barroco would overshadow my first one?  I really didn't expect my second visit to be better and that is saying something!  Here are my menu highlights from my latest visit:

The Pomme D'Api Cocktail
\"Mad Max\" doesn't know how to just be regular.  He has the mind of a mad scientist when it comes to cocktails.  I am always excited to see what new concoction he has created.  

Upon my arrival, I saw him at the chalkboard writing out the drink special for of night.  When I asked him what it said he told me \"have a seat, you will enjoy it\".  I knew not to question him so I took a seat.

The Pomme D'Api is made from spiced rum, apple juice, Benedictine liqueur, vanilla citron and paprika and is pure deliciousness.  You really can't drink just one--trust me I tried.  Max was correct, I did in fact enjoy it.

Appetizers
These two starters made a lasting impression on me.

   Foie Gras
   The Old Fashioned Foie Gras was phenomenal but this one was just as good!

  Beef Tartare
  Yes, that is an egg on top and it was good.

Meat
I was torn between the short-ribs and the duck.  The lovely couple sitting next to me were kind enough to let me sample their duck so I went all in with the short-ribs and I am so glad that I did!  Don't get me wrong, the duck was outstanding but something about these short-ribs were ridiculous.


Seafood & Fish
One of the restaurant patrons highly recommended the Paella Barroco.  He told me that he gets it every week--no joke.  With that type of testimonial I had to try it.

After my first taste I understood why the gentleman gets this paella every week.  This is not like other paella dishes where you have a mouthful of rice.  Every bite is filled with squid, shrimp, scallops, morcilla and chorizo.   

Sides
The side dish selection at Barroco is not lengthy but it doesn't need to be with such a rich menu.  I managed to try a few of them all in the name of research!

   Potatoes
   Mashed, scalloped, or stacked.  These potatoes are great.

   Garlic Rapini
   Some call this Broccoli Rabe but nonetheless it is delish.

   Brussels Sprouts
   These were not actually on the menu but they were the special for the night and    
   they taste as good as the picture looks.

I am looking forward to my upcoming visit to Montreal so I can eat at Barroco again.  I can only imagine what the third visit will bring!"}
{"text":"If nothing else, stop by for a signature cocktail and watch Barroco's spectacular mixologist work his magic.  The food is delicious as well.  Charming and worth a wait."}
{"text":"There were many positives to this place, but then there were some not so positive things as well. The place is very different and artistic inside, and the patio looks awesome making me think that summertime would be a lot of fun here. Service was nice and she was very attentive, I just did not care for the food as much though and that is where I was disappointed. I ordered the empanadas and I also ordered an arepa la gringa. The empanadas were very good, but they were burnt so it made them hard to eat. Then came the arepa that I felt lacked flavor. The meat was tender and the ingredients were fresh but it was just lacking in any flavor and turned out to be a let down. I tried to add flavor by using their several different sauces but none of them seemed to fit my palate. I can tell that the place is trying very hard to be fresh and authentic and so I give them props, I just would like to have more flavor in the food. Overall, nice experience and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food! Best flan I have ever had! Solo guitarist on Tuesday plays beautifully."}
{"text":"For being a restaurant hidden in a house in lakewood, I felt like I was on vacation. The fun, colorful atmosphere gets you in the mood to try something new, which was great for me because I didn't recognize anything on the menu. I tried a buffalo chicken arrapa, which was cubed buffalo chicken and cheese inside a homemade folded rice toast/wrap. The consistency was new for me but definitly something I could get behind again.

My boyfriend ordered a plantain app, topped with peppers and cheeses, as his meal. It was huge, definitely meant to be shared with a group or split as an entre. He was skeptical about bringing home the leftovers thinking they wouldn't heat up the same but they warmed up great in the oven the next day.

Overall it's a place I'm happy I experienced. I definitly loved the vibe and wouldn't mind trying some other menu items in the future. I'd say it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Authentic Columbian food fused to accommodate even the Pickiest of American palettes (like my kids). Even better this place is owned by a great couple and the atmosphere is super fun and inviting. The cheesy corn dip and empanadas are where it's at!"}
{"text":"Old school latin restaurant feel, good food, friendly people. Highly recommend the plantains."}
{"text":"Out of this world freshness and quality of food.  They make their own corn arepas in house and the flavor really shines through."}
{"text":"Great, innovative menu with something for pretty much everyone.  Cool South American soft drinks, interesting flavors everywhere.  Beer coming in a month after remodeling, they said!  The waitress was very pleasant and attentive, though she might've been the only one in house at the time who could handle customers...but she explained the menu very clearly for us and other first-time diners who arrived after us.  We were there for a late lunch at an odd hour, and it was pretty empty.  Loved the atmosphere in general.  Their long string of recent awards seems well-earned.  I'm planning to tell everybody in the area about this place!"}
{"text":"Static to have found an authentic Colombian place! Great food, plates are huge and well worth your money. Stuff is very friendly too. Have been a coupe of time and plan on becoming a regular. They seem to have dancing in the evening, gotta check that out. Lastly, make sure to try their chicharrón! And put that pineapple sauce on everything!"}
{"text":"A friend sent me a link to an article announcing the opening of Barroco, and I started chomping at the bit to get in and try it.  

Located in a tiny white store front toward the east end of Madison, the small dining area is adorned with colorful art that is a perfect companion to the bold flavors of the food. 

The menu consists primarily of sandwiches with a Colombian take, as well as a couple of other dishes based on Arepas (ground white corn meal patties).  

I'm a sucker for a cuban sandwich, so once I saw that on the menu there was no question as to what I would be ordering, but I couldn't stop there and ordered the Cheesy Corn too. The Cuban was a stellar example of the species, perfectly grilled and melty.  I also opted to go with the pineapple sauce rather than the garlic mayo which really went well with the pork.

The Cheesy Corn is a piping hot bowl of Chicken, Bacon, White Corn, and a hot white cheese sauce.  It was also delicious, though it's super rich, and after the sandwich I could only manage to conquer about half of it. 

Both were accompanied with Arepa fries which were pleasantly crisp on the outside and soft inside.  These were a really nice change from the usual french fries and made a great dipping tool for the variety of house sauces -Ranchero. Pesto, Hot, Garlic Mayo, and Pineapple (my favorite) as well as the Cheesy Corn.  

The staff was super friendly, and very forthcoming with information about the food, which was helpful for making the difficult choice of which delicious looking dishes to try.

Barroco Grill is a great addition to Lakewood, inexpensive, delicious, and most importantly bringing some new flavors that had been lacking in the diverse culinary offerings on this side of town.  I cannot urge you strongly enough to visit and fill up on the goodness."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio with top notch service. Some of the best food I've ever had. Highly recommend trying the juice while here."}
{"text":"The arepas and empendadas are excellent but the cheesy corn is the best menu item! The menu is different than most restaurants which is refreshing. The service has been great every time I've been there. Its BYOB which I like and also don't like at the same time. The waits on the weekend can be really long and the place is small and very crammed but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is one of the most amazing restaurants I've been too anywhere. It's romantic, eclectic, warm, welcoming, and filled with impeccable wine and food choices. This is a must-stop in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.     The hospitality starts with the host staff offering a drink.   We came at a busy time, but we are lucky and only had a short wait.   We sat in the enclosed patio.    Weirdly, I was shocked by the metal sides, but was moved.   It didn't seem like it shocked anyone else which was weird.   Regardless....


The food was amazing.   Probably one of the best food I have had.    We started with empanadas.    There is a group of 5 sauces.   I will be honest, I never like every sauce.   I loved every sauce.    Our dinners were also amazing (I was skeptical of rice with Coca-Cola... But it was decent).   The service was very good.    The server even took the time to explain the menu and specials they have throughout the week.   

The decor is cool and kitchy.    They had live music which was also nice.   The only issue is it is loud in there."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good.  We always go for the corn fritters and cheese (corn triangles).  Be sure to try all of the sauces - I especially like to mix the pineapple with the spicy one.

it can get quite crowded, but if you go in the summer you can sit outside in the back.  

We've never gotten service quick here, but the experience has made up for it."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Everything I've had her is amazing, and the staff is wonderful. I just wish they had a location on the east side."}
{"text":"Tonight we had a wonderful dinner at the Barroco Grill in Lakewood.  We started with the guacamole.  Excellent.  Creamy and delicious.  My entree was the Ropa Vieja.  I decided to order it without the chimichurri sauce since I don't like cilantro, and it was outstanding.  Very lean braised beef in a delicious sweet hogado sauce, served with perfect caramelized plantains, and black beans and white rice.  A perfect combination of flavors. My dinner companions thoroughly enjoyed their arepas, the restaurant's specialty.  I'm looking forward to my next dinner there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and servoce but the way they do a chrck out for a large party was absolutely horrible. Im pretty sure we paid more then once for some of the items. But other then thats and the sitting it was great. Highly recommend the food."}
{"text":"I stopped at this place based on the yelp reviews. It was a very small closed place. I came here on saturday around 7 p.m. I got seated immediately but it was very loud in there because they had a man playing the guitar with speakers. The place was overly crowded and the tables next to us were an inch away from us. Overall I like the theme of the place. I had one of the best drinks. It was called padre nuetro. It was so refreshing and tasty. The food itself was tasty and the spicy peanut condiment was very flavorful."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, amazing flavor and unique neighborhood atmosphere are the strengths of this restaurant.  The black bean soup, something I wouldn't order anywhere else, is a must order here as well as the cheesy corn appetizer and any of the arepas... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's great Latin food spot in Cleveland. I had chicken arepa and it tasted great, fresh and savory. Margaritas are also on the point. Parking is generally very easy to find for their Lakewood location. When I went they had live music and really nice patio. So definitely a place to checkout if you are looking for live music and great food."}
{"text":"I have never been to an authentic Arepa bar that uses feta & mozz instead of the cojita, queso blanco or queso fresco. This is disappointing. Food is tasty but compared to NYC Arepa bears the arepas are thin. Good not great."}
{"text":"If only I could move this place to East Cleve.. I'd be compelete. An awesome father and son duo. Very kind and helpful when ordering. The specialty is arepas-- so it was an easy choice. My fiancé loved it! Very crispy on the outside, and soft and chewy on the inside. My choice was impulsive, and I ordered the hotdog. We shared the queso dip. All delicious! I wanna go back to try the sandwiches.

**disclaimer: kinda hard to see because it looks like a house, so go slow. Also, be patient, dynamic duo didn't have an extra hand, so the latin street fast-food wasn't so fast."}
{"text":"A girl at work was saying that we should try out this new place in Lakewood. I couldn't wait to line up some dinner plans so I decided to check it out on my own. Barroco took over the former Kraus' Pizza building. They knocked down a wall and it is a way better use of space. There is artwork hanging on the walls available for purchase and good music playing in the background. They had on an all reggae playlist while I ate. You place your order at the counter and they bring it out to your table once complete. I had the arepa and cuban sandwich. I ran into some old classmates from high school who are regulars. They said they have been there 4 times already and I think it just opened. The girls were eating the cheese and corn dip and offered up some for me to try. I was being extremely bashful, as usual, and declined. The arepa was delicious. All of the sauces were good but the standouts were the spicy and pineapple. The service was outstanding. Really nice guys. I am glad they chose to open this business in Lakewood. Birdtown too, a neighborhood that could use place like this. I just wish it was closer to Tremont so I could eat there more often. It is an excellent option if you want to eat something that tastes really good and affordable."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are both energizing at the Birdtown location. We went on a Friday night and were treated to live music. I highly recommend the sangria. I've had it on a few occasions and it's always perfect."}
{"text":"I learned of this place via the Food Network's 50 States, 50 Sandwiches. Barroco won best sandwich in Ohio. The arepas are all they're cracked up to be and more. They are so good that I don't even mind that the Food Network is now much cooler and hipper than I am.

We went to the Lakewood location and had the arepa puerca and the arepa paisa. My friend said, \"I just got a bite of something that tasted like pure fat. It was so good.\" Those would be the chicharrons and they are decadent deliciousness. The chicken was an explosion of flavor. Normally, I can tell what spices are used, but I have no idea how they spiced this chicken so exquisitely. I have never tasted anything like it. Instead of my normal I've-already-sampled-everything-the-world-has-to-offer state of food ennui, the completely new tastes made me feel like an excited-to-try-everything food noob! However, you should know that I'm a complete sucker for homemade corn tortilla type things, be they tortillas, pupusas, sopes, or even just grits. Arepas and Columbian food are now at the top of my corny cake list.

The fried plantain chips/discs were outrageous. I've never had better. 

I'm going to go back and sample everything and I will keep you posted on the results :-)"}
{"text":"Tasty Columbian food served in giant American-sized portions. On our most recent visit, my little family of three found this to be enough food for two meals each (including what leftovers we took home in a doggy bag):

* Sancocho de Doña Liliana - Chicken, vegetable and plantain soup with a fried egg on top. Served with about a 1/4 of an avocado sliced and small bowl of rice. This alone could be an entire meal for someone! Delicious chicken soup. 
* Guacamole with tortilla chips and tostones - Fresh and simple guacamole: avocado, diced tomato, lime and cilantro. The tostones were piping hot and clearly freshly made. Possibly some of the best I've ever tasted.  
* Veggie Arepa - Made our kid happy. Veggies and mozzarella, with a side of maduros (fried ripe plantains). 
* Montañera Arepa - Braised beef, fried egg, served open faced with mozzarella. This was HUGE! The beef was succulent and so, so, SO tasty. 

They've got a nice patio in the back, so be sure to come earlier in the day to snag a seat out there. Great service, too!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Columbian food with cozy impromptu decor that just adds to the experience. Variety of sauces adds to making the dining experience tasty and individualized. Staff is wonderfully welcoming and accommodating."}
{"text":"There are not word's for Barroco's pure deliciousness. It's the best parts of Southern American cuisine mixed with freshness and lots of options to customize. I got the Mexican Arepa with tortilla chips and guacamole on the side. The guacamole was incredibly fresh tasting and not too overpowering on the spices. The marinated beef is simply to die for; not too spicy and falls apart in your mouth.

They put out a bunch of different sauces on the table to make your food even more delicious. This place is a picky eater's dream because you can pick and choose different ingredients to put in your arepa. For those not into the corny goodness of the arepa, there are sandwiches that are quite tasty. The cuban sandwich was also very good!"}
{"text":"Yes, $12 for a sandwich and side sounds pricey. But the sizes of the servings are deceptive. An arepa and a cup of chili is a full meal. And they were exceptionally good. 

The cornmeal \"bread\" works very well. Firm enough to hold up to the last bite, neither dry and crumbly nor wet and messy. Not as strong a corn flavor as in your average tamale, so the flavor of the filling dominates, 

The tray of sauces made for fun experimenting. I didn't consider most of them to be hot, and the one exception was easily tamed, if need be, with the sour cream that comes on the side.

The chili, too, was more about flavors than heat.

I'd say I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place just based on memory from last year.  I just remember loving everything about it.  The Bison Tartar with Quail egg is still in my memory, so was some fresh fruit dessert with wine.  A restaurant whose menu changes seasonally to take advantage of delicious food items in season.  The wait staff seemed intelligent and willing to explain the depths of some of the dishes.  This spot is a Montreal gem and I intend to eat dinner here every time I come back which is usually once a year."}
{"text":"This place exceeded all expectations! First of all, the vibes are great in here. Even though the place was packed and we didn't have a reservation, we were seated very quickly. Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable about allergies (which is one of the most important factors for me). The arepas were delicious, as were the sauces and chips. There was fantastic live music and it was just a happy place with a great atmosphere and cute little decorations and lights. So glad we tried it out!"}
{"text":"I must've come on the right day because the hostess offered me a tequila shot upon entering the door. Great food, large portions, great atmosphere. Try eating one of those giant ice cream Sundays in a mason jar with liquor in it. You might hate yourself for eating the whole thing, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I left stuffed.  Everything tasted great.

Chorizo arepas were delish!

The guacamole and chips platter was good.  The guac itself was excellent, but the chips were dull and I found the plantains slightly chewy.

The environment is fun... relaxed... service was mediocre for our first visit, but they were having an off night.  It's been great since.

Will return.

UPDATE:
We have returned.  Again and again.  It's really nice food, fresh, genuine, and not something you find everywhere.  If you're suffering from culinary boredom, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Saw all the great reviews for this hidden gem in Lakewood and decided to try it out! My friend and i both got arepas and were definitely pleased! It's a lot of food and a decent price. The sauces were all really good too! Oh and you can't beat the BYOB policy! The only down side of this place is that its pretty small, but the service is relatively fast so we didn't see anyone have to wait too long."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and a laid back atmosphere. The back dining room has a really cool vibe and the ceiling is impressively decked out. Fast kitchen service. Decent sized portions of food. In and of itself I'm not sure I would be a fan of the (dare I say bland) grilled white corn arepa, however the various options for stuffing the area are wonderful. For my first time I tried something simple - a Chicken Arepa with green peppers, mushrooms, onions, corn & mozzarella. Next time though I think I will try a Maduritos (loaded Sweet Plantains) because the maduros I got as a side with my arepa were really good!"}
{"text":"Excellent!

I found Barroco on Yelp while in Montreal and decided to give it a try.  The bartender at my hotel also said it had a good reputation.

I liked the atmosphere when I entered.  The hostess told me I could have a bar seat up until a certain time.  I heard her tell others a similar limit for a table.  It was a bit weird at first but It was plenty of time for me to have a glass of wine and eat dinner.

The menu had some nice choices.  I went with the duck dish which was served with some celery root chips and a celery root puree (I think) :) along with some black mushrooms which were excellent.

I ordered a side of garlic rapini which was very similar, if not the same as, broccoli rabe.  Very good to round out the main dish with a green.

The service was excellent.  Prompt, attentive and very nice people.  The bartender also made what looked like very interesting cocktails for others at the bar.

Good music in the background too.

It's in the Old Montreal part of town so it makes for a very European-feel walk before or after.

Nice."}
{"text":"I come here often but just now decided to write a review. I only wish this place hadn't become so popular lately. I used to just walk in and get seated right away, now I usually have to wait about 30 minutes to get seated. 

I love this place. It's super close to my house and now they serve drinks. They didn't before but you could BYOB. I love the caipirinha which comes with a little piece of sugar cane to stir your drink. On the weekends they have live music with a fun Colombian flair. 

Let's talk about the menu. I tried the arepas the first time I visited, but they're not for me. I liked what was inside, but I'm not a huge fan of the thick corn tortilla. Not to worry, the menu is huge, and I'm sure there are many delicious things on it, but I only order one thing, the Choo-letta. The Choo-letta is a breaded pork skirt. I get it with fries and rice. It's awesome and they have all these fun sauces to eat it with. I think it was taken off the menu briefly, but it's back now. It reminds me of German pork schnitzel, one of my favorite foods. I wish I could talk more about the menu, but when you find something great that you like it's hard to break the habit. 

I have tasted bites of the kebabs and they were delicious, and I have had the cheesy dip appetizer and that was good too. The service is usually very good, but as I said they are very busy nowadays but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time ever.  Unique decor of rustic, brick walls, fireplace, eclectic decorations & dimmed lighting.  Food was fabulous. Service excellent & personal.
I had halibut.  My husband had paella.  Bread delicious too.  Charming place.  Location in Vieux Montreal."}
{"text":"In summary: it was awesome.

Borroco grill is a great place to just hang out with friends or maybe bring a fun date. The atmosphere is very friendly, with a mismash or seemingly random decorations. But everything fits and works together. It's different but not so hipster it's uninviting.

Between two of us, we shared the empanadas and the montenara arepa. The empanadas were great. Crispy, flavorful, and the \"appetizer\" portion was actually quite large and a meals worth. And the arepa? Damn that was good. A very generous portion of pork tops the great, homemade corn shell. As for the sauces - I really enjoyed the ranch, chipotle peanut, and 
chimichuri."}
{"text":"The location is great. Friday night, arrived there at 5:50 w/o reservation, waited until 6 and arranged in the bar area. 
Started with taste of winter, which was fantastic, a great mixture of sour and sweet. The paella is also a good one except the rice is a little bit hard.
Had a super nice waitress and would like to visit again!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding. Service was great. Ambiance was amazing. I can't say enough great things about this establishment. If you're in Lakewood, make your way into this place. If you don't, you're missing out on one hell of an experience."}
{"text":"My kids won't eat here because they're picky eaters and this restaurant doesn't serve traditional \"kid food\" but I LOVE it. The flavors are so wonderful, and different from any other place you'll go!"}
{"text":"Barroco is SO GOOD! I loved it so much, I felt like I was cheating on tacos. They serve Arepas, which are thick, fried corn tortilla pockets - sort of like a pita/tortilla hybrid that are filled with your choice of beef, chicken, veggies, chorizo, etc. These come with seasoned fries and wasabi coleslaw - all for $9. The arepas themselves are about 4-5\" in diameter, but they are FULL of whatever delicious choice you have made. They bring you a bunch of napkins, which is good, because they are so stuffed, that it can get messy. I had the chorizo, which was combined with peppers and onions. My fiancee had the veggies, which was mushroom, onion, peppers, tomatoes, jalapenos. Both were incredibly delicious. 

The fries are nothing too special, seemed like seasoned Oreida's, but there's nothing really wrong with that, but what makes the fries is the SAUCES! They bring you a holder full of 5 sauces: a spicy peanut (like a mexican hot sauce, thai hybrid), a creamy garlic sauce, a ranchero sauce, a creamy chimmichurri sauce, and a pineapple sauce. These go on both the fries and the Arepas. They have a \"no ketchup\" sign and for good reason - I never want to have ketchup with fries again - I want to choose a sauce individually for each fry like I could here. 

We did one Arepa with fries and one with soup - THEIR BLACK BEAN SOUP WAS BY FAR THE BEST BLACK BEAN SOUP I'VE EVER HAD. Black bean soup with rice, with a big ole scoop of chimichurri on top... I almost regretted being the one who got fries (almost).

One thing that fell short was the Wasabi Cole Slaw - it sounds awesome, but I didn't really get the wasabi punch I was expecting.

Over all, delicious, good, friendly service, cool little atmosphere and I would definitely go again and again and again!

OH - KEY POINT - BYOB! If you're going for dinner, you'll save $$ on drinks and bring whatever you really want to drink!"}
{"text":"Authentic and extremely delicious food. Being from Venezuela, my expectations were high and Barroco grill exceeded that! We came with family and everybody chose a good variety so that we could try as much as we could and everything was on point! The chimichurri (green) sauce and ropa vieja arepa with maduros were some of my favorites! Also, definitely try the yuca fries! 

The environment, the mom & pop feel of it and the service were also tip top! Highly recommend and will be back anytime we are in town!"}
{"text":"No longer BYOB!!! We were one of a few people people that had to go back to the car to return. It doesn't help that the drinks are priced extremely high. Other than those changes, this place is amazing! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"For what looks like a cute little house from the outside, this place packs a serious punch. There was a nonstop rush from the time we entered until when we left. The scrumptious food and lively atmosphere lives up to all the hype I've heard. We had a great server, Chris, who was really friendly and made some great food and drink recommendations. 
The mojito was so different and one of the best I've had. It was made with real sugarcane juice and had a very unique flavor that was not excessively sweet. 
We asked to substitute mushroom and green pepper for the chicken to make a vegetarian cheesy corn which was delicious, but very filling. 
For our main meal we ordered the Mexicana arepa and the Veggie arepa with sides of maduros and black bean soup. The combination of the chorizo, cheddar and beans in the Mexicana was to die for and the chimichurri sauce and garlic aioli were the perfect complements. The sweet maduros were basically our dessert. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome place with a wonderful ambience. Really loved the paella and beef tataki. The food quantity was generous as well. Will definitely return. 
I will say that the only reason I didn't give this a 5 is because wine was expensive. The markup on a $13 bottle of wine was quite pricy. We paid $55 for it....

Great otherwise. Would be even better if it was byow. Just sayin'!"}
{"text":"Super friendly server and an awesome eclectic vibe.  Most of the food was very good with very generous portions.  The tostones that we received at our table, though were somewhat cold and soggy, and I've had better arepas."}
{"text":"(June 2013) EXCELLENT atmosphere. Got cheesy corn as an app - delicious. Then we got a chicken and a chorizo arepa, one with fries, one with plantains. All amazing. Highly recommend mixing the garlic and hot sauce and the chimichurri and garlic sauce. Every one of the sauces is good alone and mixed though! We had the coffee flan with strawberry syrup for dessert which was right on par with the rest of the experience. And the wine that we brought was good too! (Gotta love BYOB). One of the best restaurants in CLE, can't wait to take friends."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Next to the dearth of Middle Eastern and Persian restaurants in town, there's an equally unfortunate lack of good Latin American food.  And while I probably prefer Peruvian cuisine to Colombian, Barroco Grill is definitely worth a try.  Many Yelpers are extolling the virtues of the arepas (I had the pork and it indeed was overflowing and quite succulent), the accompanying black bean soup is the real winner in my opinion.  As an added plus, it's BYOB and the waitstaff is so genuinely nice, you can't help feeling the good vibes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very authentic Latin/ Spanish cuisine. The menu is decent sized with a front page dictionary in case you aren't familiar with Spanish. Great place, fun atmosphere the patio is really awesome price ranges start $14 and up, but its Family owned and everything is made in house from scratch."}
{"text":"Here's an idea. Try greeting people when they come to your restaurant and stand at the front for 10 minutes and  make eye contact with over 3 staff members - at some point somebody should say hello and maybe find out what's going on. Should not be that hard to get a table, so I'm out. I don't know what the food tastes like - maybe it's good maybe it's bad but on a somewhat empty Monday night there shouldn't be any delay in greeting someone for over 10 minutes. Kept walking found someplace friendlier. Not coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are wonderful. I ate the duck while I was there, and it was deliciously splendid. I loved how the cocktail menu was within the pages of an old book, I thought that touch was charming. Classic rock played as Einstein light bulbs lined the bar. It was all well put together in the rehabbed old Montreal building. 
Altogether, this place was lovely, and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Holy Moly!  I had to check this place out because I've been hearing crazy buzz....and now I see why!

We ordered an Arepa and a Cubano plus the side of cheesy corn.  I am pretty sure I had an out of body experience with the corn...the cheese was perfectly melted in with roasted corn and bacon/ham.  OMG!

The Arepa's corn tortilla was delicious but it was hard to tell because I was enjoying trying all the many sauces on my super stuffed chorizo arepa.  The Cubano was excellent too and huge...with enough to save for lunch the next day.

Totally check it out.  These guys are passionate and they're doing some great things!!  I'd also like to note that they made our food fresh and it was impressively quick!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh man. Ok Cleveland I see you.
Legit hands down the best Salvadoran food I've ever had in my entire life.
I wasn't impressed from the outside. Like can there really be a bomb restaurant in there?! The answer is YES.
The vibe inside is amazing and full of color. The employees here are the sweetest. 
But let's talk about the food. Ohhh man! I can't even recommend one dish. All the food is so dang amazing. We shared a cheese chorizo dip, chips  and guac and something else I can't remember the name of. The guacamole comes with plantains which are to die for. Our kids shared chicken and streak skewers which were just as amazing. Their food came with a side salad that had mango in it. Also so good. You can even order the salad as a full size dish - highly recommended.
If you come during Happy Hour you can snag yourself a delicious piña colada or sangria for 5 buckeroonies. 
Do yourself a favor and don't over order. The potions here are huge, flavorful and filling."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was possible for Barroco to get any better, but it did!  They now serve alcoholic beverages and they are super tasty.  Between all of the orders at our table, I was able to sample most of them.  They also have a happy hour from 3 til 6:30 on weekdays.  Most of our cocktails were 5 bucks!  Best of all, the drinks are made with higher-end liquors and fresh juices.  There's nothing worse than ordering a margarita and being served a lime-green concoction that's been sitting in a plastic container all day.  

My favorite drink that we tried is the Padre Nuestro.  (see picture).  Forgive me for not remembering all of the ingredients, but trust me on this one.  You'll love it.  It's vodka based, and I believe there was a little lemoncello in it as well. I also enjoyed sampling the Paloma (made with 1800 silver and watermelon juice), Red Sangria (with lots of fruit to snack on), and a pina colada.  

To go with our cocktails, we ordered the Tostadas con Todo for our table.  It is a large platter with many different samplings of their food offerings.  The fried plantains that come with it are the best I've ever had. 

It's rare for me to spend an extended amount of time in any restaurant because I get antsy.  However, we were at Barroco for over 3 hours catching up with old friends, enjoying the atmosphere, and best of all, the cocktails."}
{"text":"This is now probably my favorite restaurant on the planet. The foie gras was the best I've ever had, ever. The paella, also incredible. I can't remember the other items but I know there were great. The vibe was super cozy and I already want to go back and we haven't left town yet."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for restaurants, but the experience I had here was so spectacular, I need to rave. By far, one of my favorite restaurants I have ever been to.  Excellent food, top notch service, and the atmosphere really makes for a romantic and fun night. And the sommelier is so knowledgeable and friendly, he really makes your experience even better. 
We had the burrata, rib eye and cheesecake - all delicious. A must go to!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite eats in Cleveland! The empanadas were delicious and don't even get me started on the drinks. I will be returning very soon with an entire list of prime choices!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend of mine ...
We had the Paella dish and an octopus starter 
Both of them were outstanding
I also had the best cocktail i have ever had( the waiter suggested it ) a Mezcal and jalapeño cocktail.
I liked the stone walls and the whole decor of that place .!!
Very elegant and beautiful .. prices are on the steep side ... but hey is a top restaurant in the old port .!!!
Food 5 stars ... decor 5 stars ..!!! 
Service was excellent 
I have been planning to go back ... and i will soon"}
{"text":"Awesome food and happy hour! Service occasionally a little slow, but worth the wait! Mint mojitio and pina coloda are awesome. Empanadas and guacamole yummmy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, quite dark with candles, good music (may be loud for some), old stone walls and exposed beams, cool bar with about 10 seats on the back wall. Very romantic. Date tip - ask for the booth that's basically carved into the stone. Other than that, regular tables and one other group-sized arched bench with a table on the opposite side of the restaurant. Walked in on a Saturday night at 10 pm and we were able to snag a table. Got completely full within 5 minutes. Montrealers definitely eat later. Place was totally full. Quasi-Spanish menu, paella with morcilla and chorizo and a bunch of seafood. Much more like risotto than paella; would never have thought it was paella if it hadn't said it on the menu. Came in a decorative bowl, none of the desirable soccarat (caramelized, almost burnt bottom from the paella pan), not seasoned at all. Great dessert - apple tart served in ceramic dish with a cute jar of vanilla cream on the side. Great service; free drinks when we waited forever for oysters."}
{"text":"Borroco is a unique place. It doesn't stand out as a traditional restaurant from the outside, but don't let that fool you. The food is very authentic, and the Arepas were wonderful. I cannot wait to try more on the menu next time I stop there. I would be happy with about 50 different items. The service was very friendly, and prompt. Big serving sizes too, there is always enough to take home for a midnight munchie. The workers all looked like models as well. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The food is always hot and tasty! Great addition to the Larchmere area. Get a Arepa first!"}
{"text":"Restaurants can't be perfect but this place is as close as it can get. My husband and I have been there a few times and every time we go we have not been disappointed. The food is absolutely amazing and the service is wonderful. Even when it is busy the staff couldn't be friendlier and are very attentive. Sorry I would of posted pics of the food but it was so delicious we couldn't wait to eat it!"}
{"text":"Omgyummy. Yeah - this place was incredible. 

The boy often has this look of dread on his face when I recommend a new place - especially when I warn him that I think it will be a \"really good hole in the wall joint\". So - my assumption was dead on. But, the inside was mad cool. Very industrial in a put-together way. 

Now the bad news... the cheesy corn? Yuck. My fellow Yelpers had built it up so much that I couldn't wait to try it. It was melted cheese - lots and lots of melted cheese - with a little bit of corn and chicken in it. Umm... Cheesy corn sounds like it should be more cheese than corn. It was like fishing in cheese sauce to find corn and chicken. The corn cakes served with it were good though. 

Now, the arepas. YUM... on mine. I got the chorizo arepa. Because - well... I get chorizo on anything. It's on the bacon level in my book. It was amazing. And, the different sauces that they serve were incredible... especially the chimichuri sauce. It wasn't normal chimichuri with oil... more like a dressing. But, SO good. 

The boy got the Hawaiian arepa. It wouldn't have been my first choice. But, I am not a huge fan of ham anyways. He liked it... but it was too much ham and not enough flavor. Not bad (I mean, he ate it all...) but, he'd probably pick a different one next time. 

Next time... yeah. We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"What a fantastic, quaint restaurant. The atmosphere is a mix of modern with a touch of Caribbean and South American flair. The guacamole is hand-made and served with a semi-sweet fried plantain (delicious!). I ordered the La Gringa arepa and my friend got the Huevos Rancheros served open-faced on a fried arepa. The flavors are eccentric and are spiced up even more with a choice of 5 different sauces. Perfect lunch destination."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high but definitely worth it in terms of quantity and quality! Food is absolutely delicious and the menu has a great range of options. Service a bit slow but not bad. Atmosphere is really cool, great decor and music. Only real suggestion is better air conditioning, a little hot in here!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak my husband and I have ever had. And I should mention we've eaten at quite a few steak houses, my husband has even been to a high end steakhouse in Calgary. It beats them all, and it's a better price per oz than you'd pay at a typical Keg. Been here 2 times now, first time was the night my husband proposed 1.5 years ago, second time was on our honeymoon when we spent part in Montreal. We always get the 31oz ribeye steak. I dream of it when I'm home in Halifax. The local cheese board never disappoints, either.
It's a small space, cozy, warm and inviting atmosphere. The service is among the best we've ever had, from the greeter to the servers, all friendly, polite and willing to answer any and all questions we had. We will absolutely be back again and would highly recommend Barroco to anyone wanting great food in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. I have yet to discover anything disappointing. The service was a bit slow. Our server however was adorable, informed and earnest.
But the food...totally wonderful. Three of us dined together and shared lots of different selections. Every single thing ordered was excellent.
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"On Friday night, we went to this great arepas place. I had the arepa burger with fries. Arepas are this kind of Venezuelan corn cakes and this place took that, put a burger between and added in pepper jack cheese.

It is this kind of, hole in the wall place but the best thing about it is the sauces that each table gets. There was a tomato sauce (their spin on ketchup and it was my favorite), a spicy chili mayonaise sauce, a cilantro/pesto like sauce, a pineapple sweet sauce, and a garlic mayo sauce. These sauces made the meal go slowly since we kept on squeezing more onto fries and the burger so you are so full afterwards since you ate so slowly."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Ohio. Chorizo, peppers, fried eggs, hot sauce, cheese, onions, avacado...if you like these things, you're going to fall in love.  The empanadas are the best I've ever had, the cheesy corn is delicious and the arepas are killer.  They bring you 6 sauces, all of which are awesome.  The pineapple sauce has one ingredient: pineapple! Service has always been great and their bathroom is cleaner than mine at home.  Remember to BYOB."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Barroco serves up authentic Columbian street food.  
Arepas are their specialty and they have a great variety to choose from, with fillings such as chorizo, steak, chicken, pork, eggs,  they're pretty much like a stuffed sammich where the \"bread\" is like a homemade pita pocket made from corn.  They were awarded \"Best Sandwich in Ohio\" by The Food Network! They make everything from scratch and the ingredients are fresh fresh! 

They offer a good variety of homemade sauces you can try on your arepa.  There's Chimichurri, Spicy peanut, Garlic, and Pineapple.  I think the Chimichurri is my favorite.  Sometimes the Garlic can be TOO garlicky, as was the case during my last visit.  If you don't want an arepa, their Cubano sammich and Ropa Vieja are also excellent and very filling!  Be sure to try the Cheesy Corn for an appetizer..so good!  You definitely won't leave this place hungry.

Oh and they don't currently have a liquor license, but it's BYOB, so feel free to bring any beer or wine to accompany your meal.

The ambiance there is cool and casual...very laid back.  The servers are quick and super friendly.  You'll feel welcome at Barroco. They usually have some Latin music playing and you can write on the walls...it really takes you away.  They have live music on the weekends.  Check their Facebook page for details!"}
{"text":"Omg...what a disaster of a night! I've dined at the original Barroco location in Lakewood since about the time they opened and the service, food, and atmosphere has always been superb.  I figured I would enjoy a similar experience at the newer east side location.  Boy was I wrong. 

We came in at 6:30 on a Wednesday night with a reservation for a group of 10 and at the time we were seated, there were no other diners in the restaurant.  The server was nice and took our drink orders, wich took a while to come out.  Once we placed our food orders, we waited for over 2 HOURS to receive our food.  Table after table that were seated after us were served their food while our table sat and waited and waited while getting hangrier and hangrier... No apologies were issued by the waitress until after some people in our party spoke up to another server.  I started squirting sauces on my plate to eat since there was no real food in sight.  At the 2 hour mark, we were planning to just pay our drink tab and leave, but our server said the food would be right out, so we continued to wait.

When the food finally started coming out, it was served luke warm, but I was so hungry I didn't care and inhaled everything.  My Arepa was pretty good, but not up to the original location's standards.  My girlfriend's mom ordered a salad and it was so saturated with dressing, she only took a few bites and had enough.

We asked for the check and they apparently couldn't separate the bill, so we had to go up to the cashier and tell them what we ordered to get rung out.  Ugh...

I'll stick with going to the Lakewood Barroco."}
{"text":"I recommend that you go to this excellent restaurant. I am giving it 5 stars because of unique-ness, taste, and ambiance. The place was super cute! Really made me feel like I was somewhere else. Hubs and I had the cheesy corn. Honestly, I didn't find it so amazing. the arepa fries that come with it are thick wedges, and there was diced chicken in the app, and I couldn't, like, scoop the chicken onto the wedges, but we just used our forks... and it kind of cooled and thickened quickly. So... meh. I had the guabayana drink or whatever it was - there were two different fruit drinks available - both setting a person back $4.50 each with no alcohol but it was interesting and delicious and was the consistency of a slushy. I had the ropa vieja arepa. The flavors were amazing! And it got the carmelized plantains as a side as the very sweet waitress recommended them as a good flavor match with that arepa (which she also had recommended for a newb) 

The arepas are a certain amount of money, but kind of awkward to eat so not really sharable. Hubs got the burger and while boring.. it did look quality. There were like 5 sauces on the side and I liked the chimichurri aioli. 

I really have a good memory of going there. We went on a Sunday and it wasn't as busy. It is so beautiful in the restaurant... and the staff is so sweet and nice. I would really suggest giving it a try. I could go on and on - it is just such a unique place and the cuisine so individual. - loved"}
{"text":"Probably closer to 3.5 stars...but the price was too high

First, the ambience is very enjoyable...the place has a good vibe.  The atmosphere is as others have described it - intimate, cozy, warm, a little loud and a little crowded if you are not in a booth.

The food was pretty good to very good - the short ribs were not as good as hyped.  Perhaps it is something about people not getting short ribs very often that makes them think the ribs are better than they really are.  My wife makes them often, slow cooks them and they are every bit as good as Baroccos.  I had a bite of someone's seafood paella and it was very good to excellent.  The amuse bouche that night was different - oyster and pate mix, liked it.  The sides were okay and the appetizers were good.  The servings are big and if you want to bring some home you will be able to do so.

Cocktails were good, although I was expecting more maple taste in their maple old fashioned (they use maple syrup in the cocktail).  Others very much enjoyed their cocktails.

Service was great at the start but as the restaurant got busy was a little less attentive.  The servers and bartender are all polite and entertaining; no one was stuffy or treated us english speaking Americans with any less respect than anyone else in the restaurant

I guess I was expecting more for the price.  I know Montreal is expensive but for the 5 of us it was over $400 - too steep for what we got.  Was it an enjoyable evening - yes.  Was it worth the price - maybe, but would have rated them higher if it was more reasonable."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Loved! The ambiance was amazing, it was super cute inside, all it needed was live music. Very trendy and quaint. Staff was amazingly friendly and helpful, very personable. The food was delicious and served with a beautiful presentation. If ever I am randomly in Cleveland again, I would definitely come here!"}
{"text":"I really felt it was about time I updated my review of Barroco. In some ways, I have little to add. I still love it, and I still highly recommend it at one of my top 5 Cleveland restaurants. In a lot of other ways though, I think I had to sort of revisit since they've undergone a lot of changes since I first started to come here in 2012. Perhaps their biggest change is that they now serve alcoholic beverages, while for many years they were BYOB only. They've also expanded a bit, extended their patio and added a lot more seating. Finally, the menu has also grown. They've added more than just their standard arepas and now have a lot of sandwiches and even pastas to choose from. They've also raised their prices a bit, but I always felt their portions more than made up for the prices, particularly considering that I've never felt they skimped out on ingredients by for example serving less meat in an arepa while charging the same price. 

Perhaps the thing I like best about this place is that it's stayed true to its roots. They've added to the menu without compromising on what they do best (arepas) and continued to deliver consistency and quality (I've never had a bad meal here). I also feel it's a contrast to restaurants like Barrio, that are really just culturally appropriated versions of vaguely Latin food. There's a huge difference between fusion of food cultures, and just throwing things together because you can. 
To be very clear here, I'm not even talking about that ubiquitous word- authenticity- I'm talking about honoring the intent of something. Barroco and its owner, Juan Vergara, somehow has found a way to keep the integrity of Columbian comfort food, put his own unique twist on it, while also making it accessible to the general public, and that my friends is a feat. 

This may sound weird, but I was actually happy to see the Warehouse District location closed. I felt it never lived up to the same quality as the original, and I respect that they were able to recognize that while some restaurants continue to expand to the detriment of their product (ahem* Melt*). I hope they will continue to do what they do best, and while in time I hope this restaurant grows and become a Cleveland/Lakewood standby, I also hope they can keep staying true to their roots!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I feel like the food at Barroco is Heavy (with a capital H), but it's oh-so-good! As for the atmosphere - romantic, cozy, intimate. Drinks? Check. They do 'em right here.

Standout dishes include the short rib, which is decadent and fall-apart yummy, the steak tartare, and foie gras. When are all of those things not good, I suppose. ;)  But that's the beauty of Barroco: the food here is universally foolproof. I feel like the only people who won't enjoy the food here are those who are in the mood for an airy, light dish, or have expectations for something super different and inventive.

The bar's whiskey drinks are particularly good, even if they are a touch heavy on the sweet stuff (a bit much sugar in the Old Fashioneds, a tad more Sweet Vermouth in a Manhattan than I'd do), but I'm splitting hairs there as a  personal preference.

So, is Barroco cheating a little by serving nothing but easy-to-love food & drink? Probably a little. But who cares? They do an exceptional job at it, so just go there, sit back, stuff your belly with deliciousness, and be happy!"}
