{"text":"SOOO GOOOD. OBSESSED. 

This business is going places. Make more \"Jaburritos\" in my area. It's far from me. UGH. 

But keep in mind, the seafood is raw. You've been warned. To me, it was deliciously, especially the salmon. UNFFFF."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sushi but my boyfriend loves it and he's been wanting to try the place out for the past week or two. I love burritos so I decided to try it out with him. At first it was overwhelming looking at the menu because of all the options and I didn't know half the things that were up there, but just like at Subway you get the option to pick what you want on your sushi burrito and it was easy to just point at the clear glass and tell them you want \"that\" on it. 
For me and him both, it equaled up to $20 which isn't too bad.
Even though I don't like sushi I really enjoyed it and my boyfriend loved it. If you don't like sushi, I still recommend you trying it out and if you're a big fan of sushi then you should definitely go here!
Great food and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"I would have posted a photo if I had remembered prior to the brutal slaughter that occurred on my first ever Waikiki Rice Bowl from Jaburritos.

I live fairly close and, with the construction going on towards Sahara and Decatur, I opted to try it out. I was not disappointed AT ALL! The service was friendly and fast (a rarity in these times of lethargy, computers, and cell phones), the food was hot and very well prepared, and the portion sizes were quite large for the amount charged. I like places where I can get a good bang for my buck and this place is now at the top of that list.

It's kind of like a Subway (but 100x better and without the stigma of pedophilia). They have a pre-constructed menu that you can choose from and have your choice served either as a jaburrito, rice bowl, jachos, or salad (I think...I'm not a salad person). Also, if you like, you have the option to build your own. The sky is the limit!

I am very VERY pleased and I will try my best to add a photo at a later date. However, until then (which may be tomorrow), I can only give you the following vivid description:

Deliciously sticky/fluffy white sushi rice topped with a heaping portion of grilled chicken and slathered in queso de gallo and mango teriyaki sauce accompanied with savory sweet roasted corn, fresh red onion, crispy tortilla strips, juicy jalapeños, fresh cilantro, and shredded romaine lettuce. #YUM!!!!!!

If you are prone to addiction, be careful of this awesome new addition to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"For a few weeks now, I had been hearing about these sushi burritos and I was so excited to try them. If you love and crave sushi like I do, you will love this place. It's a really cool
Concept and a fast alternative to sushi. Try the Rockport! Ask for ponzu and poke sauce!"}
{"text":"Came in during lunch so there was a LONG LINE (going out the door. I would have turned around & left but my friend wanted to still try it)

Ordered the \"Mission\"-- which resembled a Philly roll to me. And I absolutely LOVED IT!! Something about the guacamole sauce that they add onto it.... 

I just wish they had lemons or limes..... I can't eat soy sauce without it! -___- (because everything tastes super salty to me) 

But overall, great service and great food. Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be coming back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I went twice today on my first day being introduced to this genius fusion of Japanese and Mexican influences.  Bomb.  Loved the Long Beach and the Redondo JAburritos"}
{"text":"I had the Kodiak for lunch, then went back for dinner. The food is great and so are the staff. Its very interesting to watch them make your burrito. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this establishment. After spending $15 on a sushi burrito, I asked for a small cup of ice water. The gentleman working there said were out of the ice water cups. You need to buy a soft drink cup if you want a drink. I don't drink sodas and I want a small cup of water with my food. I asked to speak to a manager and he told me the managers not here. I said can you give me a regular cup since you're out of the water cups? He told me NO you need to buy one. I don't feel that up selling your new customers is the right thing to do. 
I may not be the most savvy restaurant entrepreneur, but if you're out of water cups and your customer is thirsty, give him a regular cup so he can be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This is a great place on the strip to stop and grab a quick bite to eat on the strip for lunch or what not at a fair price. Very clean inside and most of the people working there were friendly.

I ordered the Rockport wrap with seaweed and gotta say it was awesome and had a little bit of heat to it would highly recommend this one if you like stuff a little spicy. All the ingredients were fresh and  jaburrito was awesome. 

All though my experience with this place was limited I hope to visit this place again when I go to Vegas for quick bite. It's in a great location on your way to High Roller."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and fresh. Reasonably priced. Only thing,  my wife and I ordered the Long Beach (tempura shrimp w  tuna) and I'll ordered the Rockport (soft shell crab w tuna)  and it tasted the same. I would change it up a little. Will try again"}
{"text":"Considering the location and what you'll be charged the food was worth the cost.  Well assembled tasty sushi burritos and bowls.  Sangria sake was nice.  The young lady, who may have been management, was spot-on with service and making the dining area rounds making sure you had what you needed.  It was very clean, tables were not sitting uncleaned so it was easy to find a places to sit and relax.  Impressive location and a nice option near the High Roller."}
{"text":"So far, this has been the highlight of my Vegas visit, although I haven't hit the tables yet. I got the Redondo less the chips on nori. I noticed the manager taking the temperature of the fish to ensure freshness, so they are serious about the quality and customer experience.  I wish they had one in NY as I would be a regular customer."}
{"text":"What an amazing idea! No more waiting for my sushi rolls or worry about using chopsticks..I am pescatarian so this fusion is perfect for me! quick healthy lunch on the go! No more subway sandwiches for me :)  great tasting sushi-burritos!"}
{"text":"I guess it was good? Its just an uncut sub-par sushi roll for the most part....its not gas station sushi?"}
{"text":"I love sushi. I love burritos. Why didnt someone think of this sooner! Sushitos! I purchased the Kodiak for 11$ it was the perfect combination of flavor and texture! I loved the salmon wrapped with seaweed, with a crunchy center. Will definitely be coming back here considering the value , being on the vegas strip and all. The survice was fast and friendly.  The only thing I can think to critique is the size was a bit small."}
{"text":"Met some friends at the Linq for lunch, and we tried this new restaurant, Jaburritos. Very good! We were greeted enthusiastically when we walked in, our food was delivered quickly, and the food was excellent! I had the \"Rockport\" this time, but you can bet I will be back to try every other burrito on the menu. Loved the mochi pop too... the green tea was my fave. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, very unorganized, and overpriced. They're unable to answer questions about how many ounces of meat you get per serving and they nickel and dime you for everything when you make your own bowl. I asked for brown rice with my bowl and received white instead. They need to hire more competent people to work here. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful, John you've done it again.  Lots to choose from, fun place to eat, We will keep coming back, at least until we've tried everything on the menu.  Love the staff as well, great personalities, fun to talk to."}
{"text":"If you like sushi rolls, then you like this place. Their rolls is the size of burritos! The food is good, same chef from SoHo Japanese restaurant. I only tried the Long Beach role, but it was really good. They have seaweed salad which was also good ."}
{"text":"Best food concept in awhile...skeptical at first...but if u love sushi and love burritos, then this is \"Heaven\"...very reasonably priced and good thing i didnt order 2 cause burritos are big ( but I'm sure I would've ate it anyways cause they're that good)....we were more than pleasantly pleased....have been there 4 times since they opened less than month ago...my new guilty pleasure...get there early though...lines can be long but very well worth it !!! HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Brand new restaurant brand new concept that works! Got a spicy tuna burrito with soy paper threw some seaweed salad and jalapeños in it and was in heaven. Talked to the Chef and he said they are opening 4 more in Vegas and will be going nation wide soon. Definitely recommend this place. Price are great too."}
{"text":"I had a shitty experience today. Me and my husband were there and the day manager or female that's in charge during the day of what seemed to be a Hawaiian ethnicity was very rude and obnoxious she had such a bad attitude. Me and my husband were very dissapointed and pissed. If she keeps continuing to act that way towards other people as well she'll make the restaurant look very bad"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi burritos!! What!!?? Yes, I said sushi burritos. Crazy idea, but it comes together so well; with fresh, fresh fish, as well as all other ingredients. I had the Baja; nice and spicy with jalapeños, spicy tuna, ahi, cilantro, cabbage, and a few other ingredients. So good, I want to try everything on the menu! This is a must for any sushi lover looking for a fresh take on the way we eat sushi!!"}
{"text":"The three amigos was so so so so so good.  Great concept. Everything else we had was good but too spicy. I like spice but they should tone it down a bit. Their soy sauce is very good but too salty.  All in all i would definitely keep coming back.  Many times a week if possible!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, it really is a fusion of Mexican and Japanese. Great service, very friendly. Restaurant is very clean and burritos are pretty big, hence reasonable prices. Definitely a must!!"}
{"text":"OMG who ever thought of sushi burrito is a genius. So damn delish! I had the Rockport & hubby had the Baja, both was so good! We got taro chips & miso soup, the combo. It definitely filled our tummies."}
{"text":"We don't have anything like this (that i know of) on the east coast so we planned to try this place out during our yearly Vegas trip.  It was amazing, we were not disappointed!  I had the Laguna on two separate occasions, on the strip and at the Spring Valley location.  Both were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Excellent combination of sushi and burritos. Tastes very delicious. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"The staff was great about taking care with the food prep because of my allergies. Awesome attention!"}
{"text":"Per owner of this restaurant, they've been open for only 4 days.....and they're doing well, lots of people!  Best sushi burrito I've ever had!  I tried the Redondo & Long Beach burritos, both were delicious!  Staff was very friendly and professional.  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. Food tastes fresh, service was very fast and workers were very sweet, patient and friendly. I had a burrito and I fell in love with the taste. Definitely going back! Thank you guys, you're awesome! 

I had the \"Long Beach\" with Nori wrap. (Loved the tempura crunch! Delicious) Made it a combo for an additional $3 I think. I got miso soup and a drink. Came out to $20 with tip ."}
{"text":"Super amazing place for Sushi Burritos. A definite must try if you're in the area! The fish is fresh and the burritos have great flavor :)"}
{"text":"So so so good, if you have a craving for sushi and don't want to go broke!  This is the place the food is fresh and a large portion.  But most of all the people that work there are friendly and have great energy, Christian took our order and gave us the run down of the menu and that kids got mad selling skills!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool. Pretty inexpensive for Vegas. Healthy if you want it to be. The food is fun, tasty and plentiful. I wish there was one near my house.  The Long Beach is amazing."}
{"text":"New favorite place! Came durning the lunch rush, had the Huntington and Long Beach.Both were great ! Very speedy service considering how many people were in there, only downside not enough seating."}
{"text":"Love the idea of serving sushi this way! You can order it in a bowl or burrito, good either way. I ordered the Long Beach pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Good sushi - tastes fresh and portions are very good sized. The sushi burrito concept was new to us and the reason we went in. It was actually pretty cool. We felt like we had something new wrapped around an old favorite. It's more of a fast food or diner vibe than an upscale sushi place but the food is a good value and tastes good. Sometimes quick and casual it the right fit. I have a feeling we will be back here regularly."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Sushi in a burrito! I had to give it a try and it did not disappoint! They also have other options for those of you that aren't on the sushi train. 
The service was awesome! And the overall vibe was fun from the pops of color to the environmentally friendly decor. You gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"I had their Long Beach, the worker told me it was their best seller...I got the burrito with Soy Paper. It was SOOOOOOO Delish! They were fast and it is affordable, I am just trying to decide which day before we leave I want to go back it was so good."}
{"text":"Vegas finally got a sushi burrito place! 

I got the Rockport with soy paper but subbed shrimp tempura for soft shell crab and subbed salmon for spicy tuna. It was really delicious! My only complaint was the sauces was only on one-side of the burrito so the parts without the sauces were kind of bland. I may also try it with seaweed instead of soy paper next time. Also I wish they have unagi as one of the choices, please add it to your menu! 

The setup is like Chipotle, however, the line was moving kind of slow when I went. I understand that they just opened and have to train the employees as some of them still have to look at the cheat sheet for what ingredients goes into each burrito. I expect the line to move faster once they are more familiar with the products."}
{"text":"I had a build my own sushi bowl. Salmon was still frozen on the inside and didn't have good flavor. It was also not cut properly against the grain and it was very stringy to eat. Disappointed with the bowl. Couldn't even finish eating the salmon."}
{"text":"So I saw all the hype on my social media feed and decided to check it out to see what's all the hype is about. This place looks very clean and nice on the inside, minimalistic decor and decent amount of tables for you to eat. I ordered the Redondo sushi-burrito from the menu and wasn't impress at all on the first bite. It tastes very bland, and the house soy sauce wasn't good at all with it. The sauce was extremely salty and thick, which doesn't compliment the roll very well. 

The price is a little pricey and the serving wasn't fulfilling enough to justify the price. 

Overall, this is another over hyped spot in Vegas that doesn't live up to its fame and I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Sushiritto in San Francisco but I always miss my chance whenever I'm in town. So naturally I wanted to try this place out once I had heard of it. I got their Huntington wrap, which was decently portioned, but I didn't expect a large portion considering that it's sushi and they tend to be in the upper range of prices anyway. The preparation was clean and the flavors complemented each other well. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend to try out if they're into sushi-burrito styles. Expect to pay around the $9-14 range if you want a filling meal."}
{"text":"I had some pretty high expectations for this shop since they were \"rated the best sushi in Vegas\". I ordered the Redondo bowl ($14) and got a free hot sake with Yelp checkin. The best parts were the fish and sauce. The toppings didn't add much (anything really) to the flavor and there was also a TON of rice. Being on vacation, I welcomed the break from the usual greasier foods, but this really was just so-so. To be brutally honest, I kind of debated whether or not I wanted to use my stomach space on this halfway through.. since I only had 2 days in Vegas. 

 other random notes: nice staff, odd lighting (red lights, so my bowl's contents were all red too), mild/watery sake (but I preferred it that way on that day)"}
{"text":"Good fresh take on a Mexican staple. Ingredients are fresh.  And the soy wrap with the sesame seeds is a unique spin on the traditional flour tortilla."}
{"text":"I would love to try this place and write an awesome review but they're not open on Sunday's! Open up on Sunday's please. There are customers who go out to eat on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! This is one of the best experiences I had in Las Vegas, it's not just \"oh yeah it's a sushi just rolled as burrito\" kinda thing, give it a try and I am sure u will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Coming from LA where there are tons of \"sushi burrito\" spots, I thought I'd get something a little bigger and with more flavor. It's a small meal for what you pay for. Nothing special. Might as well be called a poke place. Not worth venturing out for."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place in the need of a quick bite. Not only was it quick, it was very delicious and easy to eat. The staff was very helpful and polite and brought our food out to the table. I highly recommend getting the Taro Chips and Queso, those were a great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Bomb dot com if you like sushi/poke. The hot sake was gross but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Great location ! Right in the middle of all the Vegas  fun! The service was so great, they were helpful and always checked on our water.. but it wasn't a sit down restaurant so I was impressed!!! The food was so good! Great taste and flavor! I had the Long Beach whole my husband had the laguna. We both really enjoyed our food. The size of the burrito is just enough to fill you up. They had choices for you to make a bowl or burrito as well has different wrap & rice choices. You could totally make it your own. 

Resturant was clean and staff super nice!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos... Brilliant idea! The food was delicious and very filling. I spent about 15.00 total for my burrito, a seaweed salad and a drink... Compared to a sushi roll  it's the same price and 3 x's the size. Highly recommend the Long Beach."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about the \"sushi burrito\" for a few years now. Up until today, I hadn't had the pleasure of tasting. My friend, she's the one who hear about this place, and I park the car, then approach the building. Not the greatest location of town, but it's around enough restaurants and stores that you don't feel on edge. As we walked in we noticed there was a no eating area outside, something they may want to look into considering the very limited amount of dining in area. Otherwise the restaurant smelled clean, lighting was energy saving, and the staff seemed nice enough. I studied the menu. There are pre-selected types of sushi burritos available (which all sounded amaze balls) or you can build you own, Chipotle style. You can also make it a combo with the salad, chips or mochi. They even allow you to choose between a soy or regular seaweed paper. What blew me away was their option of Taro chips. At the end they have more a variety of choices versus the normal dining area. For example Kern's juice and Aloe Verde was in the fridge. The cashier definitely needed more training.  The sauce bar at then end needs a bigger cup for the stayers. Very good for a week old company, still a lot of room for improvement. Food is excellent though. No fault in that."}
{"text":"Giant roll with whatever you want stuffed inside... So you can stuff it inside your mouth. The only thing that will make it better is if it was longer. Has good girth. Visited them soon after they opened, service was great. Price point was on point"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Better than I had ever expected... Well, knowing that Soho is amazing too, that isn't the truth! The food was just as I expected it to be :) Service was second to none as well!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Finally my dreams of creating my own sushi rolls comes to life!!  And in giant burrito form?!!!  You can choose any of their pre-designed combinations or makes your own.  Of course, I made my own and cannot wait to go do it again!!  Please bring one of these to Summerlin!!"}
{"text":"From the the second we walked in I felt rushed we walked in at 10:30pm they closed at 11. I get it you want to go home but if that's the case have a last call. The employees were rude and seemed like they did not want to be there. The food however was really good and the service was fast but I also don't know if that's because they were closing."}
{"text":"Love this place.. sort of reminds me of Chipotle mixed w Subway. The food is delicious. Takes a while for a fast food place, but none the less is new & something that can be worked on."}
{"text":"This casual Asian fusion cafe has build your own sushi burrito and bowls that are so tasty. The quality is great and so is the services, and the prices too! Definitely a go to place for a fast and delicious fast sushi fix! Orlando, Florida needs one of these!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Sushi and burrito in perfect synchrony.  Light meal, so you can keep going. The miso soup was okay.  Fast service, good location."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi \"burritos\" (glorified hand rolls), excellent service, definitely not worth the price.

My friends and I had decided to stop here because it was on my bookmark list and there was nothing else in the area that seemed promising.

Food: I had asked the lady behind the register to get me the most popular thing on the menu and she delivered. I ended up paying for a Long Beach which was way more expensive that it should've been. $13 for a glorified hand roll that isn't cone shaped? No thanks. We also checked in on Yelp and got the hot sake, which, to be honest, tasted like hot urine. I don't know why it tasted that way, but that's the first time I ever wretched at the first taste of alcohol. Good thing it was free, I wouldn't have paid $7 for it.

Service: Service was fantastic, the lady behind the register was extremely nice, friendly, and helpful. Although good service, it wasn't enough to save this review from being moderately rated.

In all honesty, this place ended up being a huge disappointment.
This restaurant just ended up being one of those \"instagram-worthy\" food with no attachment of actual revolutionary flavored attached to it.
Next time I crave sushi, I'll wait until I get back home to California."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever!!!!! AMAZING CONCEPT! If you like sushi this is a fun, new, TASTY place that you MUST go to! 10/10 hands down amazing! Would go there every day"}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place! This was one of my go-tos when I wanted to grab a quick bite before heading to EDCLV :) I don't think this place existed last year, but I'm so glad it does now because their sushi burritos are AMAZING. Not sure if it's because the sushi burritos in Boston are mediocre and small or not. I've tried the Long Beach and the Rockport - both were super good. However, I prefer the Long Beach (spicy Tuna, shrimp tempura, crab meat, guacamole, chipotle mayo, eel sauce, etc) over the Rockport because the Rockport was super spicy to me. It has jalapenos, which I cannot handle. So unless you have high tolerance for spicy food, I wouldn't order it. Burritos come up to $12, which is really not bad considering how much food they give you. They also precut the burritos for you, so it's easier to consume. They wrap the burritos with two parchment paper so it's easier to grab as well. This restaurant definitely knows what the consumer wants and knows what is convenient for the consumer! I love it! Coming from a girl with small appetite, one half of a burrito fills me up completely, so $12 for two meals is a great deal! Sashimi and other ingredients were super fresh as well. It does take a bit long for them to make it though, so don't assume that it'll be a quick 5 min wait....more like 10-15 mins"}
{"text":"The sushi cupcakes are worth the drive down here. The General Managers customer service is over the top. If you come to the Linq you have to come here"}
{"text":"Yes yes yesssss I love how this place was right next to our hotel. Food is so delicious I wanted seconds. I got a Long Beach sushi burrito and i don't regret it whatsoever. There was quite a long line but it didn't take long at all for them to bring the food to our table. I'm really glad we came here :) they also have bowls but I'm more a fan of the burrito. It's like eating some rolls but in a burrito. Delicious and good service :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out while visiting The Linq on St. Patrick's Day. It was really busy, but the service was quick/friendly and the modern space was clean. I enjoyed the Japanese Mexican fusion by snacking on a Long Beach sushi burrito. I was really surprised at the quality of the sushi; it was super fresh! Besides, on the strip, you can't beat the price. About $15 bucks for a combo. Try the Taro Chips and Queso for a side!"}
{"text":"omg this place is amazing. I tried their Huntington burrito with the nori wrap and the sushi cupcakes. sooooooo delicious. super friendly cashiers and employees there too. clean atmosphere, lots of fish, great balance with the veggies, and sauces are amazing. I want to come back again! definitely recommend it here!"}
{"text":"Good food but I wish the fish portions were bigger.  Spicy tuna was too spicy for my husband, he was practically crying! LOL!"}
{"text":"I love sushi! But I was hesitant to try it in a \"burrito\" form. I'm so glad I did and this place did not disappoint. The portions were perfect they did not skimp on the fish and it was not \"ricey\". My girls and I shared a Laguna and a long beach burrito. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. If you haven't tried a sushi burrito go now and be sure to go to Jaburrito!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Sushiritto in SF.
Well now I'm spoiled because I have JaBurritos less than ten minutes from my house!

Super vegan or veggie friendly. I get the Gardein steak, spicy vegan mayo, nori paper, sushi rice, and alllllllllll the veggies!

I love all the flavors combined. At first I was like \"grilled corn and steak flavor in my sushiritto, hell no.\" But I tried it and it's sooooo yummy! I am a huge seaweed salad lover so I usually unwrap and add some seaweed salad. And of course while I'm unwrapped I add ginger and wasabi! I like it spicy!

I have also tried a bite of a vegan Mex style, the Gardein steak, grilled corn, lettuce, pico, spicy vegan mayo, avocado, tomatoes, soy paper wrap, brown rice. It was also good! My husband usually gets something like that because he is NOT a fan of anything sushi smelling, no nori or wasabi for him! 

I have gotten my combo bowl style also but there is just something yummy and comfort food with that burrito style. Maybe because all the extra tortilla calories?!?! Oh well, just eat it.

The line can get super long at lunchtime so I usually go around 1-2pm weekdays. Never been on a weekend. Since its new I'm sure it's a total madhouse. 

Soooooo yummy just go and get one right now!"}
{"text":"Got here at 6pm on Saturday right before the crowd came.  My friend told me later that when he went it was nearly 50min from the time he got in line to the time he got his food.  After much thought I settled on the Rockport since it was a guest favorite.

This is only the 2nd time that I've had a sushi burrito and while its enjoyable to watch them make it or have them serve it to you, thats where the more enjoyment for me laid.  The seaweed was a bit soggier than I would have liked but not bad.  My friend and I thought that the rice could have been slightly longer tho.  There is not much soft shell crab and most of what I got were legs.  The eel sauce to chipotle mayo ratio was good."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Tastes super fresh.

Especially for the location where your alternatives are barfood and in n out.... this is an amazing, healthy choice 

Only 4 stars because... $10 for something I ate in 5min and had to go to White Castle to fill me up.... kinda killed my experience"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos do I need to say more! Upon walking in the staff was extremely helpful and polite. They helped us choose which ingredients that went best with our chosen proteins, which was super helpful since I'm no expert at sushi ingredients. They also asked us if we want to take home some of their other sauces so we could try them on our burritos. Overall amazing food and staff will definitely be back! P.s. the Diablo sauce is no joke, super spicy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've ate here twice and it has been great. Food is delicious! I create my own burrito both times."}
{"text":"Sooo good. I had a Burrito and my fiancee had a bowl. Both were delicious. would not recommend the Edamame, but I would definitely get the Sake sangria again!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a week day. Not too busy, maybe 5 other groups. SO GOOD!! Reasonably priced. Highly recommend! You can get wraps or bowls. I got mine as a burrito wrapped in seaweed, delicious!"}

{"text":"I am from California and I was completely mind blown about the burrito, I kid you not it made my mouth feel so excited. I would definitely go here the next time I am by the strip in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. I thought the service was really good and the food tasted delicious. You can choose from a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. I got the bowl and asked for half greens and half brown rice. I wasn't a fan of how they made you pick a pre-made poke bowl because it didn't allow you to create your own creation. Also, I felt like my bowl was drenched in too much sauce. Other than that, this place was conveniently located and was an overall great experience."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco, one of the first places to experiment with the whole sushi-burrito hybrid. Strangely, I feel like we get too fancy with it. We put so much special stuff in it that it's more \"sushi-inspired\" than actual sushi. This place literally just turns sushi into a burrito, which I love. Keep it simple.

I was very torn between several menu items, but I eventually went with the Redondo roll. It had huge chunks of fish, and was well-put together so it didn't fall apart as you ate it (a common problem I've had with sushi burritos). I was happy that I could order it without cilantro, as I detest cilantro. The tortilla strips added a nice crunch, and it had some heat to it.

The service was fast, and the dining area was airy and open. There was a little area to sit outside, which was nice since it wasn't brutally hot that day. To top it all off, it wasn't terribly expensive. I think my roll was $11.

I'd definitely return again given the chance."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Don't need to get miso or edamame next time, the burrito itself was plenty filling. I forget what I got, it had spicy crab, spicy tuna, and some other stuff. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group and everyone loved their meal. So many options! I got the vegan burrito and am still dreaming about it as i write this review."}
{"text":"Name may have changed but the food is still amazing. I highly recommend Soho Sushi, Miso soup and any of the rolls...3amigos is #1"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place and will definitely be returning! Like eating one gigantic satisfying roll of sushi... There's the perfect rice to fish ratio and the amount of food overall  is just right. Also, try the house made taro chips with cheese sauce. Sounded weird to me at first, but it really does compliment the jaburrito. I finished the whole thing!"}
{"text":"This place pretty much makes over-sized sushi rolls. Likin' it a lot. 
Service here is quick and efficient, but everyone there is still nice behind the counter. They'll answer your questions about the menu options/ingredients without any hesitation. 
Setting is still new like they're still up to add more, plus the plaza is renovating the outside of the building. Don't let that deter you. Honestly wish they had more seats available though.
I had the Rockport, and when the guys behind the counter asked how I wanted it, I pretty much left it up to them on how to load the thing. Was not disappointed whatsoever. It was spicy, but the other cool toppings balanced everything in the burrito. Considering this place is a sister-establishment to SoHo, I liked how the Seaweed Salad was the same, and I didn't even have to drive there for it. The Taro Chips weren't salted, but they were peppered, which went well with the hot cheese. 
On a side note, liked the way my boyfriend didn't even want to dig into the meal at first, but then he just habitually picked away at the chips like it was all his."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect but I have to say I'm glad I stopped here. Basically think sushi burrito. Then think food tingling your tastebuds in a good way. 

It's closer to the wheel (of death) then the strip about across from in and out burger.  


Ordering is easy. Food was quick. Food was good."}
{"text":"3.5 is the real review.

It's pretty much japanese chipotle. 

Yea I understand it's somewhat a new item I guess, but it's essentially an uncut sushi roll. Why not just sit down at an AYCE establishment and get variety with better bang for your buck?

The overhype is real."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to go to Vegas to get this. I loved the combos and the ability to leave out ingredients for whatever reeason.  Delicious food."}
{"text":"Jaburritos is an interesting concept that I wanted to try. I only eat chicken so I decided to try one of them that had the option. It was filling, but didn't have much taste to it. I only tasted the jalapeños not the sauces. I'm sure individuals who eat sushi and different meats may have a different experience. Definitely want to go back to make my own and see if it is any different."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and well implemented. Took wife and daughter here for s light dinner. Name had changed, but food was tasty, This is for lighter appetites. Didn't really satisfy the ceaving we had for sushi."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this place for lunch. They have a good variety of wraps you can choose from. We both liked it, being our first time. Not too filling for me but for my wife it's a good meal."}
{"text":"Sooooo good sushi burrito!! Would eat there everyday if I lived in Vegas lol.  Staff is friendly and location is very convenient."}
{"text":"This place is borderline addictive. I HAD to give it a try once I found out it was from the same Chef/owner of Soho (Which is an amazing off the strip japanese place). 
     I have not been disappointed with a burrito yet, but I do have some favorites, The Rockport and the Redondo. 
     Brought some co-workers here and they all loved it. Brought my girlfriend, she's got a jaburrito problem now.  lol
     I have tried with the seaweed paper, soy paper and flour tortilla. I think they are all good in their own way. (The seaweed tends to get a bit messy near the end), 
Best thing about Jaburrito is that I always feel pleasantly satisfied without and heavy lunch feeling after.  Light and fresh.

    They definitely need a bigger seating area and more locations around Vegas.   Hope they expand!

Lastly,  To the Review by Robert S.   Why would you rate a place one star because they aren't open on a certain day? How's life at the center of the universe?  You, sir, are one of the very bad things about Yelp. 
    And, by the way, it's Sundays, not Sunday's."}
{"text":"I been looking forward to coming here again! I tried Jaburritos for the first a few years at a different location. I love it here! Wished they could open up a location in Portland, Oregon. 

Highly recommend the Redondo sushi burrito: salmon, ahi tuna, yellowtail, wasabi mayo, masago, cucumber, red onion, wonton strips, jalapeño and cilantro. It's second time I've had and it's amazing every time. 

Eating the sushi burrito can get messy but they have wet towelettes available!"}
{"text":"So, this is really a 3.5* establishment for me.  I got the Rockport with spicy tuna, imitation crab meat, and soft shelled crab.  It was good but they put too much spicy mayo and as you ate, it got too heavy.  I got the sushi bowl and couldn't finish it because it was a lot of food.  I would recommend that over the burrito because it seems like the burrito was a smaller portion.  What I can rave about are those taro chips.  They were slightly sweet and salty with sesame seed seasoning.  Amazing!  The cheese dip was meh, but the chips stand alone on their own.  If you are fan of poke, this is an affordable and good option if you are by the Linq.

PS  Don't forget to check in for free hot sake with purchase! 
PPS There are no bathrooms so you better go before you visit here."}
{"text":"This was amazing!! I wish this would become a chain so I could have one near me here in Maryland. I had the Long Beach with nori. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy. Good portions of the good stuff. I had the Redondo w/o onions and cilantro and really enjoyed it. Staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and arrived close to 1. The line was still out the door. The food was really good, and it was what I would expect from a sushi/burrito fusion. It was similar to a hand roll with guacamole and chipolte mayo. There is limited seating, and you should expect to wait in line. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"There was quick service, and the food was delicious. It was a little late at night, so we ended up splitting it half and half. definitely good food, and we'll be going back here again."}
{"text":"Jaburrito's is Las Vegas' new go to place, a must try. I am a little picky when it comes to seafood and I love the custom burrito option. Definitely great flavors, love the roasted corn and chips added to the burrito."}
{"text":"The sushi itself was acceptable while the service was not. 

It was an overall \"meh. Glad I came, but would not come again.\""}
{"text":"This is a higher rating than I believe I may really feel about this place, but the 3 stars is just due to the idea (original for Vegas but of course nothing new in other cities), the supppppper nice owner who talks to you and was so kind to me and my hubby at his other restaurant. 

Sushi burrito, pick the burritos you want or create your own. Both times here I picked the ones they have on the menu, Rockport my first time in and Long Beach my second time. The Rockport had all the ingredients I love, but the taste was lacking, it had barely any flavor. I got the combo (who does not love taro chips???). Hmmm tell me why is there huge chunks of salt and furikake on the bottom of the tray but it does not stick to the chips, making it completely pointless to have that on there. Now the turn off for me was the canned nacho cheese side for the dip. Taro chips were totally covered in nacho cheese sauce overpowering it and took away all of the are chip flavor. Nacho cheese and regular chips, but not with taro chips it does not work. In addition I saw a girl get taro chips to go and her portion looked 3x my size in a paper bag. Mine had about 8 chips filling up only 1/3 of the tray it was served in. Maybe pick another tray or fill up the chips into the entire tray so it does not look like much of it is missing. I tried putting salsa on top as the owner suggested and I am sorry, but none of the salsas tasted good with the burrito. I really don't get it at all. I tried every salsa there (which they all seem canned salsa. One I swear is Pace Picante salsa for sure.) Not a good match with sushi. I felt the portion was pretty small when my total with the combo was close to $15. 

Second time there, opted for just the Long Beach and no combo since I was not impressed with the taro chips experience. Again, no taste on the burrito. 

I loveeee sushi and I wanted to like this restaurant, but it just did not live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Simply delicious, great food, great and simple interior design! High five and a big pint of beer to the owner!!"}
{"text":"Crazy good. I don't even know where to begin. I had the Rockport and it was incredible. Also tried the taro chips with queso, odd. My daughter had the Kodiac and loved it. I don't know how you could go wrong with anything on the menu. Staff was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Walking the Linq and found this Gem!  Great people. Great food and concept.  Fresh and smart. Had the Rockport burrito and was Amazed. Fan of rolls? well this one you can walk with too.  Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Jaburritos did a great job at satisfying my sushi craving.  The burritos are super convenient, and the bowls were nice for some of the pickier people in my group (so we could eat the pieces they didn't like, lol).  The taro chips were delicious, with or without queso.  I only knocked off a star because our hotel had said we could charge meals here to our room since the restaurant was on site, but we weren't able to after we ordered (even though we had the hotel card and everything).  It would have been nice if there was some sort of disclaimer.  But they were already in the middle of making 2 of our 4 orders, so we didn't want to just leave.  Luckily, I had a credit card tucked somewhere, but some of my friends hadn't brought their purses because we were just going to charge it to our rooms.  

Overall, the food is pretty decent and the fish chunks were fresh.  Just clarify about payment methods beforehand if you're planning to charge it to your room."}
{"text":"A great find along the linq promenade. The food (poke bowls or sushi burritos) is fresh, health and quite reasonable priced."}
{"text":"Arrived in Vegas yesterday and we stumbled upon Jaburritos. I don't eat raw sushi but the rest of my group wanted to check it out. I asked the gentleman what I should try and he suggested \"the kodiak\" with grilled salmon and it was so good! I got the miso soup too and it was good even when it was so hot outside. Great service, friendly staff. I may have to come back to get another one before heading home!"}
{"text":"Super yummy, had to take a star off for cleanliness of the tables, but overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi burrito!  I got the Long Beach before heading out to Red Rocks Canyon, and it was perfectly delicious and satisfying.  I love that seaweed salad was a side option!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. You won't love it or hate it. 
Went here two times and they were inconsistent. I ordered the salad bowl and it didn't come with dressing, it looks like the person that made it was new. Their salad bowl also had very minimal salad - disappointed that I paid $15 for something that barely came with food. 

The first experience was much better as their portions were more reasonable. This time, everything shrank! 

In addition, wasabi and ginger are prepackaged in small packets. Not good. 
Will not be returning."}
{"text":"So delicious. They have an option for everyone. Staff was very helpful and more than willing to make adjustments to our food if needed. The Long Beach and mission burritos were both fantastic. We each got sides with our burrito. The original edamame and chips and queso, both good. Highly recommend this place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and so is the service. I am definitely going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"The Asian burrito/taco phenomenon isn't new, but Jaburritos does it in an innovative fresh and tasty way. Love that you can choose the wrap (nori, soy, or tortilla). I had the Kodiak w/ nori and the perfect amount of salmon, sushi rice, tempura bits, veggies and sauce, twas delicious! It's right near the High Roller, across from the In n Out and water fountain on the Linq promenade. If I lived here, this would def be a regular spot!"}
{"text":"This is actually my first time trying a sushi burrito, and I was definitely not disappointed. Ended up stopping by here with a few friends for a quick bite before a night out in Vegas. The staff is very friendly and patient, which is good because it may take some time if you are new and not sure what to get. 

I ordered the Long Beach, but substituted the tuna for yellowtail since people should not be eating tuna. They were more than happy to oblige my substitution. The burrito itself is very tasty and refreshing, but falls apart very easily. So be prepared to use your hands or a fork. It mostly had crab and tempura instead of the yellowtail, which would make sense since those are cheaper ingredients than the yellowtail. 

Overall, I would come back and try another burrito or maybe one of their sushi bowls. Seating is limited but if worse comes to worse you can always sit outside."}
{"text":"The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, with mexican influences. I dig it! Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.

Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.

The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.
The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.
The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.
TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. 

Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. They're still in their soft-opening phase and busy as hell. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling. 

NOTE: The prices posted on the walk-up menu are a buck or two less than on their takeout menu. Is it foolish to be crossing my fingers that they don't go up?"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a sushi burrito and it went pretty well! Tried the Kodiak. The sauce - mango teriyaki and chipotle mayo tasted great with salmon. The line moves pretty quickly and the promenade at LINQ offers great seating and vibe. Overall, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!! The sushi / burrito  is outstanding . I had the spicy edamame and the  Rockport burrito. The service is quick and friendly and the prices are great !!!!"}
{"text":"it a nice small place not a lot for seating 25 full house, the place looks real clean, food counter clean seen a thermometer at the food counter , service nice and friendly, food portion and choice is very good ."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating the opening of this place since a month ago when I heard about it. I was estatic when I heard two of my favorite things were being combined: BURRITOS and SUSHI. It's a very trendy place, but with that being said it's more about the hype than the food. The ingredients, especially the fish is very fresh, but it was the portion size that left me wanting more. I ordered the Redondo because it had yellowtail, and also go the drink and seaweed salad combo. The burrito was good, and the salad was seasoned perfectly. After I finished my food I was like \"hmmm I'm still hungry.\" I considered getting another burrito, but at that point I thought to myself for the price of two burritos, seaweed salad, and a drink I could have went to an all-you-can-eat sushi joint and left stuffed. Overall my experience was good, but another call out is the noise in the place. There is a strong echo in the building and it gets loud to the point that it's somewhat annoying. I don't like having to yell across the table to be able to converse with company."}
{"text":"Delicious! Cannot recommend highly enough. Everything was fresh and made to order. The Rockport burrito (soft shell crab, spicy tuna, veggies, sauces) was out of this world. There is not enough seating but they still seem to be under construction.  I love this place and hope they open more of them!"}
{"text":"SUSHI BURRITOS IN VEGAS UGH YES FINALLY.

I may have gotten a little too hyped for this place, which means my expectations were a little bit higher than usual... The staff was friendly, but I had to wait 25-30 minutes until I could finally order. I kept in mind that there were new hires who were working the assembly line, so it was understandable.

Redondo - 3/5 // $12.95
The first thought that came into my mind as they were making my sushi burrito was \"that's all the rice they put on it? Really?\" I thought there'd be at least a little bit more rice to make up for the lightness of the fish and toppings. The quality of the fish was pretty good considering the fact that we don't live by the coast. All the other toppings felt like they were a little bit skimped on and there was supposed to be Chipotle Mayo sauce, but I barely tasted any in mine. Overall, there was't really much flavor to it and it didn't really fill me up, which was a little disappointing (and I have a small stomach tbh). My friend told me that I could have gotten sauces on the side, which is what I should've done! Next time, next time...

Other than the food, the atmosphere is refreshing with its white, open space. I got my order to-go, so I didn't really get to bask in the restaurant. When coming here, keep in mind that there may be a line... because there will probably be a few first timers who will take forever choosing which toppings to put on their sushi burrito.

I'll have to try the taro chips and maybe one of the juices next time, but I probably won't be going back any time soon since I won't be dying to have another sushi burrito again."}
{"text":"I like Jaburrito. Best way to describe it is a big ass sushi roll (unless you get it in the bowl). Order the dish labeled as my hometown name \"Long Beach\" and enjoy the tempura spicy tuna and crab meat mix...."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on Instagram and am so glad I did! The food was amazing. Genius idea."}
{"text":"The food is great tasting and doesn't leave you feeling stuffed, in fact it's just the right amount of full. Also, the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It was just okay.
I will visit again to try others.
Maybe, I should try with a wrap. 

Food: Good
Price: Good
Service: Good
Parking: Good"}
{"text":"As a single diner, this establishment was perfect- bright, clean and plenty of seating. End of pros.

I was soooo disappointed by the taste and portion size. Just to get some flavor into my bland roll, I had to eat it with wasabi and ginger loaded on top. I'm not one for extra condiments so that's a big no-no in my book. Also, what's with the skimpy size?? Where my yellowtail at?! I didn't want extra cucumbers!

I was so excited to eat you, Redondo, you $13 piece of sushirrito but you've failed me. Perhaps a Monday afternoon isn't the best time to eat you but there's always Makino's for next time"}
{"text":"Sushirritos are apparently not a new idea, but I have never heard of it before. Sushi and a burrito all in one? I was intrigued. 

Jaburritos occupies a small space across from Palace Station, next to David's Bridal. They definitely need more room, but they probably had no idea this place was going to BLOW UP like it did. When I met my new friend Rachel F. there for dinner, it was packed. There were at least 15 people in line to order, and by the time we left there were another 20 waiting. What sucks is there are only about 6-8 small square tables inside to eat at, and they were all occupied. People were saving seats and pushing tables together to accommodate larger parties. Since there aren't very many tables to begin with, this left us with nowhere to sit so we had to go to the McDonalds across the parking lot, a little lameeee if you ask me. 

So how it works is you make your own bowl or burrito, or you can choose one of their signature selections. I wanted to try a couple different sushirittos, so I chose the Long Beach and Mission, both on soy paper, and sans lettuce because who wants to eat lettuce with sushi?? I enjoyed both, but the Mission was my favorite. I also got to try Rachel's burrito, the Redondo, and it was missing flavor. Apparently they missed a couple items that belonged in hers. I know they are still super new, I am sure with time they will be able to make all the items without having to look at a \"cheat sheet.\" I did like that they do not skimp on the fish or the toppings. If you don't like fish, fear not! They have chicken and steak too! I will come back here when the hype dies down and give them another shot."}
{"text":"I feel like this place was really under whelming considering it's seafood. I got the Radondo burrito and it was just okay. A little dry and even the fish by itself was a little plain. The miso soup was good and so was the mochi ice cream. The mochi was soft and chewy."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. You can make your own sushi burrito or sushi bowl. If you want more rice then opt for the bowl.

Also, i think the staff here is great. The lady with the red hair is very polite and pleasant to talk to. She even offered my friend and i ice water while ordering without being asked. She deserves recognition and raise.

Would def come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try a sushi burrito since the day I found out such a thing even existed,and so when I stumbled apon this place I didn't even hesitate to give it a try.  And let me tell you it did not disappoint. It was like taking all your favorite rolls and supersizing it. To sum it all up I LOVED it!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to try if you're craving sushi... it probably may be the only place around that isn't super expensive for sushi but you get your fix. 

You get to see your burrito being made, but the cool thing is you can choose a seaweed wrap, soypaper wrap, or make it a bowl in a way. 

Delicious and all!!

It's quite a walk, but literally across from in n out. 

Fresh ingredients! I'll be back."}
{"text":"My oldest and I like sushi and she saw this \"sushi burrito\" place and wanted to try it.  As you may know, I like sushi and it's all about the rice.

Jaburritos serves what I call \"faux sushi\", by which I mean it mixes traditional sushi ingredients like masago and raw tuna with a bunch of other things that would never see a sushi bar like romaine lettuce, fried tortilla strips, guacamole and flour tortillas.  The result is pretty tasty with some of the dishes being on the definitely spicy side.

We opted for the traditional nori wrapping but you can also have it on a flour tortilla or soy paper or even in a bowl!  My oldest tried the Redondo which has masago, tuna, yellowtail, fried tortilla strips and jalapenos in it.  With the wasabi mayo dressing it was a bit spicy but she liked it.

I tried the Long Beach which has spicy tuna, surimi and shrimp tempura with guacamole, romaine lettuce and fried tortilla strips with chipotle mayo.  It too was pretty tasty.

While good, it reminds me of carnival food, you know, like the deep fried snickers candy or the teriyaki chicken on a stick.  Again, it's not sushi or Mexican food it's something else entirely.

It was pretty busy when we went but not anymore than normal IMHO.  I mean the line wasn't out the door like some of the other shops.  Yet, it took them a while to get things out and since their line is in plain sight, like Chipotle's, it seemed like they were struggling at times with stuff.  It is busy so expect a wait.

Overall, a pretty decent lunchtime option for those with an adventurous spirit."}
{"text":"Just tried John's new concept of JaBurrito...it is it SOHO Burrito?
Whatever the name the food is amazing...my friend Brian and I split 3 burritos to get a idea of the variety...We drove in from Orange county to try this out before CES....
I recommend this to anyone that loves sushi :-)
Good portions and delicious fixings inside the burritos of your choice......I must try :-)"}
{"text":"As a gal from Minnesota with a sushi-tooth, finding good sushi, nonetheless to-go sushi, is a rarity. You can only imagine how excited I was to try out Jaburritos. Now, you can only imagine how elated I was when Jaburritos turned out absolutely DELICIOUS!

Located along The LINQ promendade, Jaburritos is similar to a Chiptole, just with sushi burritos and bowls. Service is fast, and you can opt to eat inside or outside along the promenade. 

I ordered the Redondo sushi bowl, which I highly recommend. I preferred the bowls to the burritos-- I felt that it was more filling given that I opted for brown rice at the base of my bowl. 

This place is a great break from the lavish, upscale restaurants in Vegas (which I also love). Jaburritos is a delicious, quick option that doesn't break the bank. It was so good that I grabbed another bowl to go before heading back home!"}
{"text":"Omg so amazing I'm literally having to stop to write how delicious this was before I forget! 
Honestly it's perfect! We have a place similar to this called sushi freak in NM... it's got nothing on Jaburritos! 
We got the Huntington. In few words it's 

Soft, crunchy, creamy, SPICY, and exceptionally beautiful. Why? Because all the vibrant ingredients are colorfully rolled up into the best type of food ever... a Giant Sushi Roll.. Jk.. A BURRITO! 

Their miso is also the best soup I've ever tasted, literally couldn't remember the last soup I had cause this one was just to delicious 

If you're in Vegas you must come here! 
It's located on the strip outside the LINQ hotel. Right off the strip and easy access if you come on the MONORAIL which is connected to most of the major hotels and casinos along the strip. In other words... make it your MISSION TO COME AND GET AN AMAZING JABURRITO!"}
{"text":"Customized hand-rolled burrito-style rolls in a fast-food environment. Definitely tasty, but don't come here actually expecting sushi grade quality. Also, don't talk about these with a real sushi chef, you'll probably get smacked in the face.

Expect a fast food environment with somewhat better than fast food quality service.

Worth trying if you are in the area and hankering for a snack that's something like sushi and burritos, but not really exactly like either. Basically, it's alright."}
{"text":"Of course it's fantastic! As a lover of Soho their other restaurant this place has the same great quality and some familiar friendly faces! And a unique menu and everything is super Eco-friendly! It's crazy they haven't even had their grand opening yet and this place is already poopin! Oh and great price too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Long Beach Burrito. I love how super fresh and tasty it was. The Mochi was great as well. The staff is really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is lit asf. Dankest burritos in town. I'm going to tell the whole Squad to come threw. If this place was meme it would be a dank meme"}
{"text":"A little pricey but if you're looking for something light and tasty, this is a good option. Tried the Laguna (our fave) as well as the Long Beach. Both were good but the Laguna was the better choice. For sides, we had seaweed salad and miso soup. Portions aren't huge but we were fine with that. Fish was fresh and we liked that we could customize our order. Outdoor seating is limited. We will certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Talk about burrito reinvented Jaburritos style!! The irony is just recently on my visit to Sacramento saw my first glimpse into the whole concept burrito but sushi style. I became fan the first time but here at Jaburritos they truly take it to another level. It all the little details that really stand out. 

The quality of the fish is top notch with my favorite AYCE spots in town. The tuna and soft shell crab. I would say tuna definitely sashimi quality and soft shell as fresh as can be. It was tough with all the choices then to make matters worst is you can literally build your own burrito. On my first trip I wanted to try something off the menu and the Rockport is one of the more popular rolls. After inhaling both halves in record time can understand the popularity. The crispy fried soft shell crab combine with spicy tuna have perfect blend of crispy texture and one raw. Then you add the vegetables inside gives it even more body and textures going on. Bringing it all together with the Chipotle mayo and Sweet Anguila sauce. LOT LOT going on but all together LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Portion size there no skimpy portion here you get nice size amount of protein and really just looking at the burrito total WoW that burrito my friend. The rice in the burrito totally legit sushi rice! They also have salsa bar that can get even more creative with ideas. First time so never grabbed any but can assure you will the next visit. The way the line is set up makes for not only great entertainment. You get to see them make your burrito to order or if want create one watch your own masterpiece come together. The open kitchen you can really see the freshness in ALL the ingredients, every single item would want in my burrito, and cutting board area very clean. The place is insane busy right now being Hot and New business. I was impressed with the system they have three or four workers handing down the burritos and pumping them out. Still every single one is consistent the size, portion, and think that speaks volumes most part the whole menu burritos. 

Diversity is awesome. The taro chips with furikake. I grew with furikake in the 808. I think its the best thing on rice ever hands down. I would never think put some of it on fresh deep fried taro chips. Da Bomb! Those things are so addicting like everything else at Jaburritos make sure take my time enjoy the food. Lol! If looking for chips munch on these taro chips are delicious! The juices were looking good but saving those for another visit. Not just juices they have assortment of bottle beverages and fountain machine.

The staff is awesome! Talk about high energy, positive, friendly, and making the whole process watching them or creating your own burrito. Fun! The only thing found drawback is small place so there good chance going have wait for table or just eat outside in the parking lot or take out. Thankfully meet another yelper Suzy H got there earlier so I grabbed open table and worked out perfect. Table or not Jaburritos hot spot worth checking out. If you love sushi even more so need spot by."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am a bit of a Sushi burrito snob. I am a Sushirrito (San Francisco chain) fan. Big fan actually. Though, Jaburrito takes it to ANOTHER LEVEL!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! We found out about this place make in March and we fell in love the food is amazing. I really wish there was a jaburritos back home in Santa Barbara. The food is so yummy and it doesn't really break the bank. You have the option of a sushi burrito or a bowl. Sushi as a burrito though you gotta try it its so great. We were just there this past weekend and of course we hit this spot and showed our friends how great it is. The seaweed salad is bomb. I like getting the burrito with sushi but the chicken one is great as well. I kept trying to take pictures of our food but by the time we got it we were so excited and munched down without thinking about the picture, I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Try it!!! It's also in a great location right in between the flamingo and the linq."}
{"text":"Server Wade was incredible. Somebody promote him. He was kind, knowledgeable, and understands the true meaning of customer service. 

My girlfriend and I come here for a quick lunch every time we come to Vegas and have always enjoyed the food but it should be noted that we have never felt taken care of until this trip with Wade. Also, while they are happy to edit any of the sushirito choices, everything could be less complicated for the customer if you just let people build their own, kind of like a subway or chipotle for sushiritos."}
{"text":"What a great idea for a restaurant!!  We were excited to try this place and the menu had so many good options. My friend went with the rendondo burrito with seaweed wrap. I went a little more conservative and went with the wakiki or simply, the grilled chicken made in a bowl with brown rice.  Now, it probably sounds funny to say a place makes sushi burritos but in the end, it is like a huge roll that isn't cut up. We both enjoyed our food. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. I suggest a visit here, it is a gem!"}
{"text":"Top notch place! If your visiting town this is a must visit restaurant! If your a local, make this a new spot to enjoy some awesome sushi burritos! 1 of a kind!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos! I ordered a \"stock\" burrito with soft shell crab and spicy tuna. I asked for a side of cilantro avocado sauce which worked surprisingly well with this. You can customize the burrito with whatever you want. I think this was their first day so there was a brief problem with their payment system. Had to wait a bit but they gave me a discount for the trouble, without me having to ask. Pretty good, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I think I'm just spoiled with food from OC because the poke bowl I got wasn't that great.  Poke tasted fresh but I didn't really care for the sauce that came with my Redondo bowl.  It was definitely nice being able to eat some fiber and greens though between some eventful Vegas partying, ahaha.  Customer service was awful - the lady at the register rolled her eyes at my friend because he was inquring about getting double protein for his bowl.  Instead of patiently explaining if it was possible (it was), she gave us unnecessary attitude before looking at her coworker in exasperation.  No tip for you, lady...."}
{"text":"Sushi roll, burrito-style.

This fusion concept has made it's way from the Bay Area down to SoCal, across the desert to Vegas! 

The hardest decision: do you want a burrito, bowl (think poke-style/rice bowl) or nachos (aka Jachos)? I was on my way to McCarren so I went with a burrito as the most logical vessel for a grab-and-go situation.

You are able to either pick one of Jaburritos' own creations (named after different seaside locations) or customize your own sushi burrito.  Burritos come wrapped up in either traditional nori (seaweed), flour tortilla, or for carb conscious folks there's soy paper!

I opted for a custom burrito. Why? Because I've got old lady eyes and I could simply not be bothered with squinting to read the menu board and messing up my RBF in the process, plus you can't beat ordering your food Chipotle-style.

Need help? The friendly staff can help come up with a tasty concoction without judging you for adding all those extra proteins, extra toppings, extra sauces, etc. because beach club season is over now.

But let's be real here.... I wouldn't really call this a burrito, it's more of an oversized temaki-style sushi. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here and Jaburritos will be one of the options for food when I'm back in the area and need a quick bite to eat. The sushi burritos were pretty filling (I only added one extra protein serving this time) and the ingredients were all fresh, backed by a reasonable price.  We spent about $25.50 before tip for 2 burritos, 2 drinks and a side order of taro chips with cheese.

Pro-tip: opt for the taro chips as your side, or base for the Jachos vs boring tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience. Some of the best sushi I have ever had. Not much seating but delicious food!"}
{"text":"Came to this casual sushi burrito place to grab a quick snack after a long day of walking. While somewhat pricey with burritos ranging from $9 - $13, the food was surprisingly tasty. We got the Laguna which came with unagi, shrimp tempura, guac, and some other goodies. You might consider getting a meal which comes with a side and drink for $3.50 more as the burrito is on the small side. 

Update: Came here a second time and ordered taro chips and a Long Beach. The taro chips were very good and tasted even better dipped in queso. The Long Beach was even better than the Laguna. Service was also very friendly and offered me a water cup. Would definitely come back if I weren't leaving Vegas :( 

Overall, a great place to get a food especially if your into sushi. Definitely one of the best if not the best sushi burrito place I've tried."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this location for lunch. It seemed a little strange to have a sushi burrito, but I am always up for a challenge.

I brought 2 friends and we all ordered something different.

All 3 of us were pleasantly surprised with the amount of sushi on the burrito and the taste of each item.
I am hoping the portions stay consistent as their was plenty of sushi on the burrito.

Only open 6 days they were a little slow, but that was to be expected.
Steady crowd for a new location]

ECO Friendly, and very clean and open seating.

We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Located in the Linq Pomanade, Jaburrito is a fun, fast spot to grab a bite while sitting outside (to enjoy the view and watch the people go by). They let you mix and customize your order, and they do it with friendly, sweet attitude. Yelp Checkin currently gets you a Free Saki. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was recommended the Long Beach sushi bowl by the friendly cashier. My other friends had ordered the same and also a sushi burrito. Unfortunately, none of us were impressed. Maybe the Long Beach wasn't the best choice. The avocado had already started to turn a bit brown. :( The romaine lettuce was an odd choice for the bowl as well. We left wishing we had gone to In N Out."}
{"text":"First time having a sushi burrito, and I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised. Portion size was big. Prices are amazing. Highly recommend anything with salmon!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple days ago and was very pleased! It was my first time trying the sushi burrito trend so I don't really have anything else to compare it to but it was delicious! I got the Long Beach and I have no complaints. Would definitely recommend if you like sushi! And the price point is great considering the amount of food that they give you!"}
{"text":"Awesome food - but I wouldn't expect anything less from the owner of Soho.  I had lunch here today, finally, after hearing this place was open.  Great concept and execution.  I had the Redondo with tuna, salmon, yellowtail.  The fish was fresh and tasted incredible.  The wasabi mayo is awesome. I also got the taro chips on the side which had a nice texture and good flavor.  Prices are very reasonable - around $12 for the entire lunch which, for good sushi, is more than fair.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Jaburrito for lunch! Burrito size sushi rolls at affordable prices, yes please!!! Just discovered one of my new favorite places :) ordered the long beach burrito with seaweed wrap it has spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber(I ordered no cucumbers),tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce. So healthy & divine. All my sushi lovers out there, you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"We've got to learn to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle...

Are they huge sushi rolls or somewhat small burritos?...yes, they're Jaburritos!!! What you're getting at Jaburritos is fresh, clean food you can customize to your liking. Chef John realized the good thing going on in other places like San Francisco and teamed up a sustainably minded partner to bring Vegas their first glimpse of sushi burritos...think over-stuffed sushi rolls, or hand rolls.

Jaburritos is an easy win for me. Price, quality, and flavor. For about the same price as a lot of sushi rolls in town you can purchase a sushi burrito...not Philadelphia and California roll prices, but a comparable value for anyone that regularly orders sushi rolls....and JSB's are larger. You won't find some of the high-end cuts of fish that Soho and other sushi places have, but then again you wouldn't want to \"waste\" those cuts in a roll or a sushi burrito. What you will find is fresh, good quality fish and meat to make your sushi burrito enjoyable. One of the secrets to a great sushi burrito is the sauce. JSB might even do this better than some other sushi burrito spots. As with most sushi rolls, the sauce is where the flavor is. JSB has a lot of great Japanese sauces, salsas, salsa fusion sauces and even some Asian sauces that aren't necessarily Japanese in nature. Ex: Yuzu Guacamole?...Yes please! I would recommend Jaburritos to friends based on these reasons alone. Throw in the customization of your sushi burrito and the fact that JSB is immensely sustainable in their efforts and I find myself with a business I can really get behind!

On your first visit feel free to jump right in to the create-your-own game if you have some ideas to explore before you arrive, however most would do well to check out one of their pre-determined concepts such as:

Redondo - ahi tuna, salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeno, cilantro, wasabi mayo

Long Beach - spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce

Mission - salmon, sushi ebi shrimp, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole, tomatillo shiso sauce

Rockport - soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce"}
{"text":"Cannot build your own bowl but you can substitute as many ingredients as you want? Sounds confusing!

Venice Bowl - Ordered salmon instead of garden steak. Half brown rice and half mixed greens but it was definitely all brown rice. Corn, cucumber, and pico de gallo also included. My bowl probably weighed 3 pounds. It was healthy and had to share with 3 other girls. 

Service - Nice, helpful."}
{"text":"My wife had a sushi burrito with seaweed while I had the same with a flour tortilla. The seaweed easily broke apart and while my wife still enjoyed it, I found flour tortilla much tastier! Highly recommended if you're in the area and never been!"}
{"text":"Hi my name is Jason and I'm addicted to Jaburritos. This is my second time here within a week and I just can't get enough! 

This place is a game changer. It's quick, uses quality fish, gives you your sushi fix on the go and is absolutely delicious. 

Get the Redondo and Long Beach"}
{"text":"Love the concept, great interior, great service. These guys are starting out here but they've already been doing great with Soho over at Jones. Love the flavors and how we can customize our sushi burrito with any filling. Price is what you'd expect for some great ingredients. The freshness on that first bite is what will hook you to come back for another. Really happy that we have a joint like this in the valley. Will be back soon !"}
{"text":"I was so excited to satisfy my sushi craving on the strip without the Nobu prices. The sushi burrito is something I've never tried before and I wasn't disappointed. The burrito is so easy to eat & sooo flavorful.

I tried the Huntington but instead of the sweet chili sauce I got it with chipotle mayo & eel sauce.

Service was friendly & quick. I took it to go (husband wanted in & out across the street lol) & they packed enough napkins, wasabi, ginger & soy sauce for me ... didn't need to add anything to the burrito though since it was so flavorful & fresh. They offered me water while I waited for my order which was only a couple of minutes.

Fish quality was great & veggies were fresh/crisp.

Price was very reasonable for quality & amount of fish. I had trouble finishing the whole burrito. Very filling!"}
{"text":"Same owners as one of my favorite Japanese Restaurants, SoHo, in the Southwest. Of course I liked it! I got the Rockport and my hubby got the Long Beach. We both added something different to ours, so that was an additional $3 to our bill. Wish this place was closer to the Southwest!!"}
{"text":"We came here after a day at the pools and ordered the \"Redondo\" bowl without cucumber and added seaweed salad and avocado for .75$ each. 

The fish was fresh and flavorful and there were  good portion sizes of both the each selection of fish and the seaweed salad. When asked, an employee recommended to get the white rice, and we found that the white rice was perfect with the dish. Particularly, the warmth of the white rice paired with the coolness of everything else on the dish was particularly desirable. 

The outside seating provides a nice location to both enjoy your meal and people watch, with the added bonus of misters during the summer to stay cool while enjoying your meal. Although there are no bathrooms located inside the facilities, they are conveniently located right outside of the restaurant to the left, a quick two minute trip away. 

We found this place to be an equally good and fresh alternative to in-n-out and the pizza place across the Brooklyn bowl, with equally generous portion sizes and amazing taste."}
{"text":"Amazing! Loved the Redondo bowl and was totally stuffed! Taro chips are out of this world! Staff was super friendly! Would definitely comeback when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went with my husband and son today. As non fish eaters, it's always tricky to take them to a sushi type location. Oh my gosh! My son pounded his steak burrito and my soy wrapped spicy tune with creamy ponzu and thickened soy was so good I ate it all even though I got VERY full! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having a sushi burrito! It was amazing! I originally was going to order the Rockport (soft shell crab and spicy tuna), but instead went with some special that had spicy tuna and salmon; they are my favorite. I hope I can find sushi burritos at home!"}
{"text":"Mannn, best sushirito in town. Coming from San Francisco I think this pretty similar to sushirito in sf...hella bomb"}
{"text":"Never had sushi burrito before and this place didnt disappoint! Waited less than 5 mins for my food and was out the door."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I got the Laguna burrito which features unagi and tempura ebi.  Super yum.  I didn't know exactly where the place was, since it seems to be a newer restaurant, but I was walking down toward the High Roller and I knew it was the right thing.  The best part? I was able to expense it for work- paid $20 for a meal."}
{"text":"Have you ever dreamed of one day being able to eat a sushi roll the size of a burrito? Well, thanks for Jaburritos, now you can!

This is my first time ever trying this wildly popular sushi burrito craze and to my surprise, it was great! I had my reservations about eating a giant sushi roll; I feared that the rice would be packed in like a brick, lack flavor, quality fish and enjoyable textures that I've come to love in sushi rolls. Good news, it wasn't a depressing/ soggy rice bomb! I've compared the looks of these to their competitors and I can definitely see the quality ingredients, inventive menu and the presentation offered here. The prep-line carefully added fillings to the burritos like a science! Everything was proportionate and well balanced.

You have the option to select from their signature Jaburritos menu, which offers a good variety to appeal even to a picky eater! If you feel the courage, you can even create your own, just like you would at Chipotle/ Subway/ Pieology (you get the idea.) They also offer Jabowls which are poke bowls topped with their unique ingredients and they even have Jachos, which are house made taro chips seasoned with angel dust, I would assume, and a side of melted queso. I really loved the taro chips, they were delicately crispy and addictive! I enjoyed dipping the taro chips in their house salsas - really tasty pair! The queso wasn't really anything to write home about; some people refer it to canned cheese, but I thought the combination was interesting.

The complimentary salsa bar offered a few chunky house made salsas: Mild, Verde, and Roja - none of them being spicy. The flavor of the salsas weren't too pronounced, which is great since it didn't overpower the Jaburrito; the chunky texture and acid added depth to the Jaburrito. I would have to say Verde & Roja enhanced my meal the most! Ginger, wasabi & their house soy sauce (similar to a thick black soy sauce) is also available and these condiments paired well will the Jaburrito.

Here's what I tried: 

* Rockport $10.95 - Soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce. This one was my favorite! Think a burrito sized crunchy roll! The combination of texture and flavor really shined through. I even asked them to add a little bit more sauce and they obliged, making this an explosion of flavor! Rated: 5/5

* Redondo $12.25 - Ahi tuna, salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeno, cilantro, wasabi mayo. This was good, they were generous with the fish and the unexpected crunch from the tortilla chips added a wonderful surprise. Unfortunately, the wasabi mayo was weak on this one, I would probably ask them to add some sweet anguilla sauce or maybe another sauce to wake it up next time! Overall a good Jaburrito option offering fresh fish. Rated: 4/5

This place is a real hit with the younger crowd & locals; as the word spreads like wildfire, it's only going to get more packed - that line is unrelenting! Also, there isn't much dining room space, so finding seating may prove to be tricky. Crowds aside, I love what they are offering here and I can appreciate the sushi burrito trend. I really hope the proportions remain consistent as they continue to gain popularity; it would be a shame to see them cut corners and lose quality."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try Jaburritos a few weeks back and it didn't disappoint. My wife and I visit Vegas often and we love sushi, poke, and burritos so this spot has it all! You can make your own burrito or bowl, but we decided on the preset options. 

Ordered the Long Beach and Redondo Burritos this time. Now compared to other poke and sushi burrito spots I've tried in California. Their burritos tasted better in my opinion. I like the soy paper option as well. The burritos are pretty big and seem like their about a foot long. It's pretty stacked and really filling. Sushi quality was fresh and taste was amazing. And best of all the burrito stays pretty well intact which is definitely a plus. Overall, any sushi burrito lovers need to give em a try!"}
{"text":"ATTENTION: Jaburritos is not closed, per se. They just did a name change to SOHO SushiBurrito. They're still located in the exact same location, same employees and management team. They claim they are still using the same ingredients and such but I can't comment on that since I haven't tried it for myself. Expect a new review on their SOHO SushiBurrito Yelp review page shortly.





No more waiting for the Foodie Fest to be here so I can get my Jokasaki fix. We now have JABURRITOS here in town!

In a nutshell, it's sushi in burrito form. Please take a moment and take a look at the many pics already posted here. It taste just as good as it looks...if not better.

Our first time here, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We wanted to try everything to our hearts content. You can choose between soy or seaweed paper for your burritos.

I ordered the Rosarito $5.25: spicy tuna, cucumbers, cabbage, tortilla chips, rice and their diablo sauce. Whooo!!!!! Just a word of caution: I LOVEEEEEE anything spicy but that diablo sauce made my lips burn. Yes, it was more of the spicier foods I've eaten in a while.....but it felt sooooo good! ;)

Boyfriend ordered the Rockport $10.95: soft shell crab, spicy tuna, cucumbers, rice, tempura and chipotle mayo. He LOVED IT!!! This seemed like the more popular burrito because while waiting in line, two separate people in front of us AND one in the back of us ordered this.

Then as if that wasn't enough for us, we also ordered the Long Beach: spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce $10.95. We split that one. This was just as delcious but we rather stick with our first choice.

Only downside is the seating arrangements. Very few chairs and tables. If you come during peak hours, hope you can find a seat. No doubt this place is going to do really well so they need to sort this out somehow...someway."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Basically a huge sushi roll. I will definitely return. The chips and queso were ok, the sushi burrito was amazing!"}
{"text":"A++++++. The owner is brilliant!!! I got the redondo. Fantastic. The tortilla strips were odd to me at first but when I tried it, it made sense. It needed that crunch!!! All the flavors were amazing. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came in the late morning because I wanted to try a sushi burrito. When we walked to the establishment there wasn't a line! Yay for that! The waitress up front was very nice and she explained what their best sellers were, so we ended up with the Redondo.

I was surprised at how fresh the fish tasted! But the entire experience was underwhelming...I guess I expected more flavor to explode in my mouth after the first bite but it never came. 

This place is located next to the Linq right in front of In and Out."}
{"text":"Sushi? Well more like sushirito..delicious sushi in the form of a burrito but not as big and filling which is fine. I wish we had one of these back in my hometown."}
{"text":"Las Vegas' Soho restaurant gets a little brother in this Japanese Burrito fusion food joint.  I spoke to the Soho owner, John, who now manages this restaurant and he was nice enough to tell me about his ideas for this food establishment and suggest some food for me to order.

I'd rate Jaburrito more like 4.5 stars but here's why: It's a brand spanking new  and the workers are still learning the ropes.  After minor things like reminding an employee to put the forgotten cream cheese in my Mission Jaburrito and a somewhat lackluster Jachos (nachos) with two tiny pieces of shrimp tempura, the Jaburrito flavor and quality of their food and sushi save the day.

I first had the Mission-  Salmon, Ebi Shrimp, Cream Cheese, Yuzu Guac and all the assorted veggies on Soy Paper.  It was clean, fresh, and delicious.  Adding jalapenos and all the side condiments like the salsa and the house soy sauce made it even better. 

My wife decided to try some Jachos and our protein of choice was tempura shrimp.  I would not select this protein again simply because it came with only two little shrimp tempura and a ton of chips.  The queso sauce was delicious and the staff also gave us a few dipping sauces:  Mango Teriyaki sauce, Eel Sauce, and some pico de gallo.   My suggestion is use bigger shrimp tempura.  I can't imagine only two of these would fill a custom burrito order without being disappointing to the customer.  

I was quite pleased though with my Mission that I decided to go back into the Chipotle-style line for more.  John suggested I try the steak burrito on a wheat tortilla.  I customized it by adding queso cheese, rommaine lettuce, onions, cucumbers and seaweed salad.  I topped it off with John's suggested sauces:  Soy Chipotle and Chipotle mayo.    This baby was exploding with flavor and crunch.  Absolutely in love with this and what I would highly recommend.  

There's great potential and I surely hope this place not only succeeds but also opens more locations so that I can go here every week!   If you're a fan of sushi, this new take on it will surely delight your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"Word on the skreets is this place was the first to launch sushirittos in Vegas. If so, thank you, Jaburritos!

The restaurant was pretty empty, so when we got there, we got to order right away. The girl behind the counter was sweet, patient, and recognized my Baymax hat - holla!

Not sure if it was the free booze that was in me, but my sushi burrito was SO. DARN. DELICIOUS! I had the Rockport, which is their soft shell crab + spicy tuna. I don't even like raw fish -- weird, I know, and this is after having fish at Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo! But anyway, the food was AMAAAAZING! Next time, I'd get it without the jalepenos. I didn't notice it on the list of ingredients at first and wasn't a fan (my bad). We wanted to come back on our last day to get one for the plane ride home, but decided against it since it was raw fish, after all. Get the combo with the taro chips and queso. They don't give you much, but it's really good!

The staff was attentive and came by our table to ask if we needed any refills and offered to take our trash for us. Skip In-N-Out down the street and come here instead!"}
{"text":"Ah, I was so looking forward to this place and it did meat all of my expectations. My husband and I were able to get 2 burritos, a drink, and mochi ice cream for about $25. This was not a bad deal.

The place was small, but the crowd was big. We saw at least 20 people come and go during the 30 minutes we were there. Ordering the food felt a lot like Chipotle in a slightly more disorganized fashion. 

Because of how busy it was, it felt difficult to truly customize your order without holding up the line. It was my fault, because I should have taken initiative, but I do think it would have been nice to be asked.  I got the Baja burrito, it was great, but I personally needed more sauce. My husband got the Redando and he felt the same way. Anyways, next time we will speak up.

I will be back to try the nacho sushi experience, the bowl, and the other suggestions. I hope this place does well and opens up a place in southeast Vegas."}
{"text":"this place is YUMMY! definitely satisfied my sushi craving without the overstuffed feeling of AYCE sushi. the staff here is very sweet and helpful. he gave us some suggestions on what the most popular ones are, and we ordered the long beach and the rockport. both were awesome! lots of flavor but not overwhelming. I'll definitely be back, way to go jaburrito!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times already and I can say the first thing that I notice is the quality. Portions are out standing and the fully loaded nachos are perfect with the cheese sauce. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had the redondo burrito in nori and it was the best.  It satisfies all my sushi cravings and then some. There was no line, but I came on a weds night, and it was ready within a couple minutes. All of the staff I interacted with was really nice. I would totally recommend this place to anyone who likes sushi!!"}
{"text":"very satisfied!!! 
price  not bad at all
location  it will be better if its near strip
design of the store  suggestion, id rather have wood inspired like zen  and have that asian feeling.and add more chairs please. servers should be enrgetic and always smiling.

all in all experience  

YES! i will recommend redondo,long beach 

oh by the way  please add LOBSTER burrito

and i hope locals have discounts WE  LOCALS"}
{"text":"I noticed this place sells veggie meat poke bowls which I have never seen before. I decided to try it out. I ordered the Venice Bowl ($10) and got super full.

This bowl came with tons of veggie steak and a few avocado pieces. It was super Americanized and I felt like I was eating a salad. I do like salad though! The bowl was a bit too saucy and sweet. I liked how the white rice was seasoned. It was a bit smooshy though. 

This place is not bad, although I have seen better poke places in the past."}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are yummy!  Perfect size - not big and not small.  Fresh and yummy ingredients!  We got the redondo and the rockport."}
{"text":"Was walking to the High Roller when I saw this place in the Promenade decided to try. This place is like Pokirrito. You choose one of their 9 creations and u can have it as a burrito (in which you choose your wrapping of nori, tortilla, or soy paper) or in a bowl. We had the Long Beach and the Huntington. Both were good but the sauces in both burritos were a little too sweet for my taste. The service was great tho. The server behind the counter came out several times to fill our water cups and was very attentive to our needs (extra napkins, sauces, more water). Prices are very reasonable for being in the Promenade and a great option to have."}
{"text":"An ok Poke place on the strip. Location is convenient, but the Poke is so so. There aren't many topic options, but I think the real issue is that the rice isn't cooled at all, and there is too much of it vs the fish and other toppings. I haven't had other Poke on the strip so can't speak for other Poke around Las Vegas, but if you're coming from out of town (which the vast majority of you are), don't get your expectations too high. I can't speak for the burritos, they may be better than their Poke."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Wish they had one in Cali. Food was amazing, I tried the chicken burrito I believe it's called Waikiki. Customer service is amazing too, very attentive"}
{"text":"If you are into poke, you will like Jaburrito. It's basically poke bowl in a sea weed in pre-cut form.
Personally, I wasn't impressed, but some may like it. Mine cane out as $18 with combo. I thought it was bit pricey.
Hard to find the location, so expect to park and walk quite a bit. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst thing I ever ate. Soggy and crappy. I love sushi and burritos, but this doesn't mix. I ordered the shrimp tempura, and its still bad. Don't go here. Actually, go there if you have no taste buds."}
{"text":"Sushi......in a flour tortilla.  Amazing!!  Fast, friendly and filling.   10 to choose from.  Or ha e a bowl.   Check in with yelp and get a free sake."}
{"text":"I mean... sushi in a burrito form, what more can you want? And yes, I get that it's basically just a fat hand roll... but the stuff inside is what makes it! The ingredients skew mostly towards sushi (fish, crab, shrimp etc.) but have some burrito-type elements - guacamole, red onion, tortilla strips etc.

I ordered the long beach with nori wrap (you can get nori, tortilla, or a bowl). It was awesome! The flavors were great together and it was a great portion size to share. We also got some of the sake sangria which I would not recommend - just tasted like bad sake. 

There is only one place in my area that does sushi burritos, so I was pretty excited to try them out here. Definitely check it out if you like sushi!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate at Jaburritos when we were in Vegas for the weekend. It was a convenient choice for us since our hotel was nearby. The restaurant was clean and the service was very friendly. I highly recommend the Long Beach sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Victim of the hype once again. The burritos were just...OK.


The quality and taste were on pretty much the same level as Smith's sushi. Glad I tried it but I'm definitely going to a sushi joint for my fix next time."}
{"text":"Las Vegas poke bawl spot. Good food, great service. The rodendo bawl was great. Size was just right for lunch"}
{"text":"Jaburritos was a delicious stop for my boyfriend and I! Located in The Linq outdoor shops right across from In-N-Out. I got the Venice (vegan burrito) and he got the Redondo burrito, both wrapped in the Nori. For sides, we got the spicy edamame and taro chips with cheese. My Venice was absolutely delicious! Tasted like a sweeter marinated meat. The Redondo was a refreshing taste, as well. The taro chips and cheese a must have side because it is so good! Spicy edamame could've been a little better; it's not very flavorful. The sushi cupcakes were spectacular, as well. Each having its own taste and spice. Lastly, the mochi ice cream was amazing! It was nice, big and soft, not like the usual tiny hard stuff you get from other sushi joints. 

Fuschia gave us amazing service, too! Thanks for taking such good care of us despite it being crazy busy. 

We will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great for a lunch break or snack. I ordered two rolls and it end up being way too much food for me. I ordered the baja and the Rockport. Recommend the soy paper for the texture and the little crispies are bomb"}
{"text":"Since my family and I visited Vegas December 2016, the place has been on one of my \"TO GO\" places. Not to say I wouldn't have this to go... anywho.

This trip I decided to take my fiance here and try this Mexican Japanese fusion place. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the cashier in a upbeat and jovial voice.  She handed us a menu and we proceeded to look. Prices were decent with each burrito averaging around $12.

Ordering was easy. If you choose to do combination, it's $3.50 which includes a side and drink. 

Decent place with decent price. Hope people take a look and eat at this new wonder!"}
{"text":"Wow finally fast delicious Japanese/Mexican fusion. Owned and operated by Chef John Lee of Soho fame. So you know everything is high quality and fresh. Tell Vong or John I sent you!"}
{"text":"Pros: Clean, quick, fresh, decent variety, friendly, Super accommodating staff, constantly cleaning tables right after customers, also has such variety of awesome sauces.

Cons: Pigeons in outside seating area."}
{"text":"Wowwwww what a great idea!!!! This little Shop is really new and still renovating outside.  This is the sister company of soho Japanese restaurant, and being a fan of that restaurant, I had to try this one. 

It's the concept of burrito mixed with Japanese ingredients... And omg it's so good!! 

They have some popular burritos already built with certain ingredients, or you could choose to build your own. Since it's my first time here, I decided to get one of the popular ones.  My boyfriend and I had the Redondo and Rockport.  You can pick your wrapping with seaweed, soy paper, wheat tortilla or flour tortilla.  We both got seaweed since that was the most popular. 

Redondo was really good with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, Masago, jalapeño, Onion, tortilla strips.  They were so good together, the sashimi were so fresh! 

The Rockport had spicy tuna, crab, soft shell crab, jalapeño, onion. 

Both were just super yummy, and we got a side of home made taro chips.  It comes with cheese for dipping, but it totally hides the flavour, it tastes the best with nothing because it is seasoned.  

They definitely need to get one of these restaurants in Toronto!!! We went during lunch, and it was pretty busy, like a subway, with 4 people dressing the burritos, and one cashier! Can't wait to come back to Vegas and try another jaburrito!!!"}
{"text":"It's an American sized sushi roll.

Jaburritos isn't a new idea; it's just new to Vegas. There are a few locations on the Western side of the U.S. that serve this style of enormous sushi roll. Yes, this is sushi and not a burrito, but \"Jaburritos\" sounds better than, \"Large Sized Sushi Roll Eatery\", moving on... 

The ordering style is the \"create your own\" model, but they also have pre-made options to choose from for the creatively drained. This was me when I walked in, and after a brief explanation of the menu I ended up going with the Long Beach Roll; spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, Anguilla sauce and a side order of Taro chips and nacho cheese. 

This crazy ass meal was actually very good and very filling. All the ingredients were extremely fresh, fried additions weren't overly fried, the veggies were crunchy and weirdly enough the house made salsas fit-in perfectly with the other flavors. I did have a problem with the nacho cheese on my Taro chips; it definitely came from a can. 

Jaburritos can be a bit pricey depending what you order, but no more than any other decent lunch place in Vegas. I would definitely come back and see what else I can jamburrito into my face."}
{"text":"After a long night of drinking, we needed some food to recharge our bodies. We walked a bit around LINQ Promenade and decided to try out the sushi burrito hype. My girlfriend and I shared the Redondo sushi burrito and we also tried the Sushi Cupcakes. 

The sushi burrito is good, but I don't see the difference between this and a cut up sushi roll. It was surprisingly filling though. The sushi cupcakes was an interesting concept, but it's mostly just for the 'gram. It comes with two spicy tuna, one smoked salmon, and one spicy crab. Honestly, wasn't too amazing, but it was fun trying, I personally wouldn't recommend it. 

In conclusion, worth trying if you haven't had it, but nothing amazing to rave about."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after reading about it on Vegas Eater. Super yummy! I tried the Long Beach, sweet, spicy and fresh with a nice crunch from shrimp tempura. Definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Delicious! When they say spicy, they mean spicy! My mouth was on fire. I believe I had the Huntington. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Yo! Do yourself a favor and eat here asap! 

Food is fresh and delicious. The drinks are great too! Fresh fish, chicken, steak, and plenty of vegan options. 

I have been here twice and both times was blown away. The sushi is so fresh  and tasty you cannot go wrong. Make sure you taste all the sauces and mix and match. 

Also the taro chips were beyond great. They are homemade. Chef Lee has definitely taken his recipe for success from SOHO Sushi and applied it to JaBurritos. 

Enjoy your meal!

**Just added to menu is the Kodiak. It's 10/10 amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Fresh fish, great sauces and unique combos leaving you wanting more. 

Don't forget to add taro chips, miso soup and mochi dessert. 

This place is unique, fresh and delicious. You will definitely want to come back for more!!!

The sushi burrito champs!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie. I came here after consuming countless Hennessy drinks on the High Roller, so the munchies was real. From what I remember this place was good! First time I had a sushi burrito and it was just what I expected. Fresh fish & the burrito was rolled perfectly. I was able to eat it without falling apart completely.

You can choose from a menu or build your own sushi burrito. If you weren't feeling a burrito you could get a poke bowl. Being vegas and it being seafood - it is a little pricer. Was it worth it? Oh yeah."}
{"text":"I found this place in the local paper and for some reason, a sushi burrito just sounded like something I needed to try.  I decided to give it a shot and let me just say, it was AMAZING. First off, I honestly didn't think the burritos would get me full.  I really thought I was probably still going to be hungry afterward because, c'mon, I can kill some sushi on any given day (as long as it's good!) and these burritos didn't look like your average burrito.  So I ordered the Redondo burrito (since I Yelped it before I got there) and got some of those chips with a side of cheese.  When I sat down to eat, I was in heaven. I paid for two burrito combos and it was only about $25 plus tip. To me, that's not bad at all considering how fresh the seafood was and how generous they were with it.  I hate when places cover up their seafood with a bunch of veggies or stuff like that so you can't tell how much seafood is actually in your meal. Nope. Not this place. I got what I paid for and I was extremely satisfied. 

My ONLY complaint about this place was the seating.  I don't live close enough to this place to be able to take it \"To Go\" so when it was getting close to time to pay, I was a bit nervous that I would have to sit in my car to eat.  I understand how it works, but it was kind of annoying that there were people saving seats for people who were at the end of a long ass line. I'm sure by the time THOSE people ate, people like me would have already been done with my food. Lucky for me, I had placed my order to go but right before I walked out, someone had just got done eating and left.  I sat down in a hurry before one of the other scavengers stole a seat for their friends in line. Anyway, I'm sure this place didn't expect for it to be so busy/popular which explains the limited seating. If there's one thing I had to point out, it would be that and only that. Otherwise, I walked out full and completely satisfied."}
{"text":"I have had better sushi burritos but this one wasn't terrible. I'm not sure I like the mexican/sushi fusion approach but the other nearby options were burgers, bar food, or pizza so we went for sushi burritos. 

The service was fast and the restaurant clean. Everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Saw this little gem as I was walking around the strip.  This place is amazing! Delicious"}
{"text":"I love this place! I had high expectations from the accolades given from people I know who enjoyed jaburritos from foodie fest. From their recommendation, I ordered the one with the softshell crab and spicy tuna. It did not disappoint. Paired with the seaweed salad and a drink it totalled to about 14$ which is fair given the quality of ingredients and portion size was ample. The texture and flavor was right on point and seems like a natural progression in sushi rolls. Make em the size of a burrito? Brilliant. :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for the price. It's kind of like a Chiptole except with burrito-sized sushi. I ordered the Jaburrito Wakiki and the texture and flavors were great. The chicken, corn, and crisps along with the seaweed and rice was definitely a great combination. I also had some taro chips that came with some cheese for dipping. The cheese was cold, but I think it was to compliment the sushi. The chips were seasoned, but they were nothing special. The salsa bar looked like the salsa came from a store-bought jar, but it still tasted ok. 

The music that plays is absolutely great, by the way. This place is has a great gimmick. I might stop by again to try another jaburrito."}
{"text":"Isn't this what everyone has been waiting for to happen? Sushi in burrito form. Duh. Anyways, it was as good as I hoped. I ordered a seaweed burrito with spicy tuna, tamago, cucumbers, green onions, hush chili, and wasabi mayo. My boyfriend ordered the long beach. I think if you keep it to one protein and just pack it full of veggies it's a better deal than the signature items. The taro chips are a must, but it was really strange with cheese. I tried to stick to mostly Asian ingredients, but I'm curious to see what it would taste like in a tortilla. 

The place was packed, which is understandable. They had a ton of people working there but it still seemed really slow. They didn't seem to have a good system going as to telling the cashier what people have ordered. I also think they could consolidate some items. Do we really need green onion and red onion? Cabbage and romaine lettuce? Tomatoes and pico? Nice to have the options but they had a hard time hearing and understanding what I wanted for my custom order. Also the salsa station was really random but then again I didn't order any Mexican ingredients. Loved their rice press though.

Overall great experience and hope they expand to other parts of town soon. More seating would be great!"}
{"text":"first time trying a sushi burrito. they didn't have the seafood I wanted. want to try it for sure. it's a bit pricey but definitely different from any other burrito. I had it wrapped with seaweed and rice. a bit small but enough to satisfy you."}
{"text":"I'm a hardcore fan of SOHO and knew I would not be disappointed with Chef John's vision for sushi burrito.  I love the concept and I enjoyed the good quality that I would expect at SoHo.  Can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Jaburritos is such a nice and refreshing spot and the food is even better. In the chaos of culinary decadence and all you can eat vegas culture, jaburritos is the perfect joint to take a break and detox. Actually, I enjoyed it so much because it was extremely fresh tasting without compromising the flavor. So many places we went were so expensive and bland. This definitely was a surprise.

I ordered the Laguna, which has tuna, tempura shrimp, and crab. It was the perfect ratio of protein to rice. I can't stop raving about it, but it was so good. The flavors were rich and the different notes of heat developed into a savory mix that wasn't overpowering. It was like a wave, it build up, crashed with a burst of flavor and heat, and receded before the next bite. I made it a combo with a soft drink and chose chips and queso. The chips were really good and nicely salted. The queso however tasted like melted velveeta with jalapeños...disappointing in the beginning, but it grew on me. It had a nice kick to it. The other order was a rockport. That one was spicier and much juicier. Cant realy say anything bad, I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Jaburritos was very delicious and the first time I had tried Sushirritos.  

Overall, the food was delicious and getting the meal with mochi made my day.  The biggest complaint I have about the burrito though is the amount of rice in the burrito.  By the time I reached the end of the burrito, there was nothing but white rice.  Maybe this is something just to do with my selection and I will give it a try again."}
{"text":"I am in heaven everytime I am here. The Salmon roll, dude. Just get one. Who needs sushi cut up? Fresh everytime. Good location. Take one to go and walk the Promenade, or have a seat in the modern dining area. Tasty!"}
{"text":"I have heard of sushi burritos but I haven't been lucky enough to try it. I stumbled across this place by accident and I'm so glad that I did. I started off with the miso soup and then got the redondo which was mouth watering. The miso soup was a good start off dish as it was slightly salty but not overwhelming. The freshness of the tuna, and salmon made the entree. Their was a slight spicyness followed with a crunch. If you love sushi and you want a new twist, you gotta try this place!!"}
{"text":"BEST thing ever! I decided to try it while I was in Vegas and I still dream about their Long Beach burrito. This is definitely a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with this place. We came here for a quick bite to eat at the promenade and this looked promising. For about $13, I ordered the Long Beach, which had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna,  and crab. 

I ordered my bowl on a bed of greens to keep things light, but I wish I had gotten the burrito instead. The toppings were plentiful and delicious, but there was too much sauce. It was too salty, drenched in eel sauce and spicy mayo. If the sauces were proportioned to the toppings and greens, it would have been much better. 

I love the idea, and I like how generous the portions are, but because my bowl was too salty with the sauce, I couldn't finish it. I bet the burritos are great, but unfortunately I wasn't able to experience that."}
{"text":"Love their sushi burritos! It's not amazing, it's just sooooo amazing! I like their style, and it tastes much better than other sushi burrito places. It's a bit pricey but it's in the linq, we understand."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time because I missed out on eating a sushi burrito at foodie fest this passed weekend. Ordered the long beach & redondo, & my boyfriend & I split so we got to taste both. It was busy, went around 6pm, but it was bomb af! Honestly worth it & it was cheaper than foodie fest prices. Definitely a place to go back too."}
{"text":"Not sure if there was so much hype that my first experience was destined to be a disappointment, but I felt that my Baja burrito was okay.  Diced up medium grade yellowtail, spicy tuna, veggies, and other stuff in soy wrapper.  Decent value at $8 but it's really only a slightly fatter sushi roll.  I felt that the portion was on the small side.  I was hungry a couple hours after lunch."}
{"text":"It's okay. Staff wasn't very friendly and the food was average. A lot of rice, probably over half of the bowl or burrito is rice. The price was good though and nothing was terrible or unacceptable. I probably wouldn't go here again but I'm glad we tried it once."}
{"text":"Holy crap... sooo nasty. I guess if you have never eaten sushi or maybe just California rolls this would be tasty.. and for $14! No thanks jabutthole..."}
{"text":"Great \"sushi burrito\" place. Had the Kodiak and a miso soup, both were very good.
Fast and pleasant counter service, a nice little outdoor seating area to people watch as you eat."}
{"text":"If you like burritos and sushi, here is a perfect fusion of Mexican and Sushi. I have been wanting to try the new concept! I was quite impressed on the quality of the fish, more fish than condiments, and more fish than rice. It's a good portion to share. 1 burrito is a good size for 1 person. You also have the option to eat it in a bowl or with chips like nachos. You can also custom make your own styles too. This location is located at the Linq Promenade towards the end. There are sitting areas inside and outside that holds about 75 ppl. 

My favorite is the Rockport $13. It was a perfect blend of flavor and kick from the spicy tuna , soft shell crab, imitation crab meat, chipotle mayo 
Eel sauce, Cucumber, masago, red onion, Tempura crunch, and Jalapeño

The Huntington burrito $10 was ok. It didn't have as much flavor and I wasn't too fond of the sweet chili sauce. This burrito comes with spicy tuna, Cajun albacore mixed with diced jalapeño, lettuce, cucumber, and tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Loved their sushi cupcakes! We also ordered some sushi burritos and sushi bowls and they were all delicious.  I will come back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a mid afternoon snack and got the sushi cupcakes. Loved the spicy tuna & spicy surimi crab, but wasn't crazy about the smoked salmon. The cashier was super informative gave us samples of their new taro chips and a 15% off coupon for our next visit. Returned the next day and split the Long Beach burrito, did without the guac, and absolutely loved it. Had taro chips & queso with sake sangria. So sad their isn't a jaburrito near my tometown on the east coast. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is amazingly delicious! It's located right off the High Roller. Awesome healthy concept combined with the tasty!"}
{"text":"Jaburritos took my breath away. It is the first and best damn sushi burrito I have ever had. The restaurant itself is clean, neat , and the staff have organized it to where they move fairly quick.

I ordered the Redondo burrito - Ahi Tuna, Salmon, and Yellow Tail rolled up with cucumber, wonton strips, red onion, jalapeno and cilantro w/ wasabi mayo. All of my favorite kinds of fish in a roll...amazing!

The burrito was about $13 at a fair price and they cut the burrito in half for you. 

I really enjoy my food and wished the Bay Area would have a lot of sushi burritos in town instead of too many poke joints."}
{"text":"We were so impressed. We each got different kinds of the burritos and loved them. The service was great and so friendly. And it was clean. Much appreciated. A great option on the Linq."}
{"text":"Special invention of bite size sushi presented like cupcakes - Jaburritos took Sushi to a next level. Keep going !! Must go place for a Sushi Lover ."}
{"text":"There are starting to be more \"Chipotle\" like restaurants, which is a fantastic idea!  I like having to pick what I want instead of settling for what's pre-made on the menu.  

Jaburritos is located on Sahara at the same shopping center as Landry's Seafood and McDonald's.  Plenty of parking.

The place itself is small and a good amount of people are always there.  Luckily, it's never packed enough to where you have no place to sit.  

You enter the line, the menu is above you.  You can either create your own, or select a prefixed item on the menu.  

I went with the Rosarito today, which includes spicy tuna, cucumber, spicy mayo, lettuce, tortilla strips, and other things I can't remember.  I decided to add some salmon for fun.  It's wrapped in your choice of seawood or soypaper.  I like to get the soypaper, plus it looks more like a burrito that way.  The Rosarito was $5.25, but just to add the extra salmon was $1.50 more.  Prices are fair.  

The \"burrito\" is the size of a regular burrito.  Half is already filling enough.  I tried to eat the second half, but couldn't eat it all. 

 I enjoy these creative places."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, amazing concoctions, clean establishment and affordable. If you haven't had a sushi burrito, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Simply excellent! Great food, great service at a fare price! Absolutely loved the spicy sushi bowl with salmon and blue crab! The low carb option with salad in place of rice was perfect. Topped it off with a tasty Sangria."}
{"text":"Fresh sushirritos in the middle of a dessert. Who knew? All the combination of sushirittos are well balanced and delicious! My personal favorites are the Long Beach and Rockport. Great textures and flavors in either one! Grab some ginger packets and you're set. 

Service is always awesome here and there has always been seating available inside, even though it may seem limited.

{"text":"Came in to get the sushi cupcakes what a crazy fun idea. I love it. So unique and different. They come in a pack of 4 i did like 3 of them which was the tuna ones were my favorite had so much flavor with the spicy mayo and sweet eel sauce. The crab one was really good too tons of flavor with the crab,cream cheese and avocado. The salmon one wasn't my favorite just didn't have much flavor for me."}
{"text":"7/10. I've always been a fan of the concept. The Chef definitely knew the demand and created the trend in Las Vegas. The experience was pleasant and staff was friendly. Food wise, I expected a bit higher in the quality side but presentation was above mediocre. The taste could need a little more punch in all five senses. So far I've tried The \"Long Beach,\" Redondo\" and Mission. Oh! I almost forgot the taro chips! They were crispy and not greasy also seasoned with a sweet and salty flavor but you have to scoop it off your plate or sprinkle the seasoning onto your taro chips for the reason that it didn't stick well onto the chips at all. I'll also skip the cheese sauce with the taro chips. Not really my thing... Overall I still recommend for everyone to try! #iam3am airuzz@instagram"}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago with my girlfriends & this place was seriously unexpectedly amazing. The ingredients were fresh, crisp and good to the last drop. This is a definite on the top of my list of returns. Keep up the good work! A happy customer is a happy life."}
{"text":"When I heard that a sushi burrito place was coming to Las Vegas, I could not be more excited. It's definitely a cool concept! For burritos around $12 chock-full of fresh fish, you can't beat it for value.

The restaurant is set up like a Chipotle, where you line up and tell the people behind the counter exactly what you want. You get a choice between soy paper and seaweed for the wrap, and brown and white rice for the inside. There are a lot of toppings, including soft-shell crab, yellowtail, salmon, veggies like red onion, jalapeños, radish and lettuce. Sauces include yuzu chili and diablo (which my friend Emma didn't find hot enough but I was burning from.) You can also add guacamole, avocado, cream cheese or tobiko (fish eggs). I tried the Rockport, which was AMAZING--soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumber, red onion, chipotle mayo and sweet anguila sauce. I highly recommend trying one of their combinations instead of creating your own. I'm sure their creations are highly tested.

Once you pay, you can pick up a few of the excellent housemade sauces, including a salsa verde and amazing housemade soy sauce.

My Jaburrito was amazing--very filling, the fish was of great quality, and the flavors just went perfectly together. I was a little apprehensive about the lettuce, and using the salsas, but they actually tasted great together. 

The setting wasn't much to write home about (there weren't enough tables in my opinion) but it did have what matters--good lighting for photos!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Generous tuna portion and fresh. Got Huntington bowl with greens to avoid carbs. Friendly staff. We have poke spots in NY but this will do. Only $11.91. Not bad price to eat here compared to many other spots."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but BRI OR BRIANA was amazing at customer service!!! She was so nice fast and friendly!! And even refilled waters for customers !!!! Give that girl a raise !!! 10 stars!!!
We tried the sushi burrito and bowl! P"}
{"text":"Interesting concept! Like Chipotle burritos except with sushi! 

There are a lot of set combinations or you can make your own.

They also sell a few side items. Price is okay, portion is decent, service is efficient!

Sorry for not writing more; this review is MONTHS belated, haha.

*Apparently, I can't add photos because the business has moved."}
{"text":"In the imperative style of Nike -- just do it. 

The sushi burrito seems like a novelty out of nowhere and rather overhyped, but one must trek on over to Sahara and Rancho (across from Palace Station) to judge this creation for yourself. You might encounter a line out the door, like I did on a Friday afternoon, but stick it out and get your sushi in.

It was about a 20-25 minute wait from the back of the line to the counter. I ended up choosing the Long Beach (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guac, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce) with traditional seaweed wrap. (I'm not exactly a sushi aficionado, so I always side on the more fully-cooked variety.) Seating is limited, but I luckily snagged a seat in the corner and excitedly unwrapped this thing like a fat kid on a pogo stick. Does that make any sense? No, but neither does a sushi burrito!

Verdict: Pretty good, but a little strange putting a seemingly never-ending piece of sushi into your mouth. Also -- the TARO chips with queso! Favorite part of my meal really."}
{"text":"Fast & Helpful service and caring of your needs. First Sushi/Poke spot where I see them serve flour tortillas as a choice! So delicious.. highly recommended when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Long Beach but subbed the Tuba with salmon *drools*. I would go there all the time if they had one in Seattle!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner before our show at the LINQ. We've been to other sushi burrito places, so we decided to try this one out.

While they were on the pricier side compared to most places we've been, these are also larger and more densely packed. The ingredients are extremely fresh, too.

I ordered the Long Beach and my husband ordered the Laguna. I ate half of mine and was already feeling full.

The service is really quick. It took about 10 minutes total to place and receive our orders. We came around 6:30 on a Tuesday, so it wasn't too packed.

It's really clean, and I like that they list all the ingredients on the menu. If you have food allergies or dietary restrictions, this makes ordering a lot easier.

I definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area and craving some sushi!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here because of the hype and who wouldn't be curious about Japanese-Mexican fusion?! It was kinda sad when my friend and I went because we were basically the only customers in the restaurant. We went on a Friday night too, so I'm not sure what happened.

I ordered the Rockport and made it into a combo for the corn chips and soda for a total of around $14-15. The quality of the food was good, but I don't think it is worth the price for the quantity. The burritos were nothing more than glorified hand rolls. I finished my meal not even feeling satisfied which was a bummer, but it wasn't too bad since I went to go get boba right after. My friend also went here and told me how he went to go get tacos at a nearby restaurant since he was still hungry.

Overall, I would recommend checking this place out, but don't go here if you are hungry. It's perfect for those of you who don't like eating big meals and don't mind paying a little extra."}
{"text":"One of the best things I've eaten in my life! Got the Long Beach bowl with mixed greens and it was amazing, this place will be a staple of every Vegas visit from here on out! Food was fresh, flavorful, and service was friendly. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here at least once a week. I absolutely love it! I decided to add on to my regular order of a mission by adding ahi tuna and poke sauce. Adding tuna is an extra $1.5 but it is absolutely worth it! I will definitely be ordering this in the future or like next week!"}
{"text":"Sushi as a burrito!? So wait, is it just a long sushi???? I don't know, but it's the new wave that has (already) hit Vegas... some people don't like them but I personally do.

This one is located inside the LINQ promenade. Extremely quick service, so long as you are ready with what you wanna order from the variety of options on the menu! The employee was extremely helpful.

I ordered the redondo burrito. It's great being able to see them make your burrito in real time because right before they were completing mine, I noticed a little too much onions were about to be put on my sushi burrito because I forgot to request for less/no onions! They can be really strong especially if there is a lot put, I personally don't like too much on my sushi burrito. 

I like how there's outdoor seating especially in a place like the LINQ promenade. Pretty nice place to people watch and they also sell alcohol in this location as well! I tried the sake sangria and it tasted decent. 

Eventually, my sweet tooth kicked in and I was craving some sweets.... good thing there is a famous bakery at the LINQ that sells cupcakes and ice cream.

Pretty good value, plus they sell alcohol and quick service. The sushi burrito ended up being around $13 and I spent around $20-$25 I'm liking the value here!!"}
{"text":"John Lee, who already owns what I consider to be the best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas (Soho) has come up with an amazing fast-food concept in Jaburrito, a Mexican-Japanese-California fusion product that is absolutely amazing!  We had the Rockport and Kodiak, one sushi style wrapped in seaweed and the other with cooked salmon and cream cheese. (See photos). The flavors were unique and delicious.  Also try the taro chips with cheese.  This place has become my new (and healthful) lunch choice."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy options. While small lines might make a new diner nervous, biting into the sushi burrito took away any regrets. It's a great place and cheap for dinner."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I finally had a chance to have a Jaburrito. I expected it to just be a giant sushi roll but it's more because you can customize it with some alternative ingredients and, maybe more importantly, texture. I had a nori jaburrito with Salmon and Avocado (my favorite simple roll), masago, wasabi mayo and avocado cilantro, lettuce, tortilla strips, and tomato. What sets these rolls apart is mainly going to be the sauces. They add another layer of flavor choices that really makes it enjoyable. I also had a side of seaweed salad, which was pleasant.

My jaburrito was 7.95, which I thought was a good price for fresh fish and great tasting ingredients. Other choices can run as much as 10.95, but I honestly think it's better to choose a favorite protein and make your own rather than jumble 3 or more fish together.

I've also tasted the Jachos with taro chips, which were also tasty, but I don't really know how well it went with fish. I'd think drenching it in sauces and masago and veggies would be the way to go, but I'd have to experiment with that more."}
{"text":"These were our first sushi burrito. They tasted really good although the portions are on the smaller side for the price. They were generous with their ingredients though. The sashimi in Redondo was fresh.

Worth a try if you haven't had it before."}
{"text":"As far as fusions this has to be one of my favorites. Taking sushi, adding some Mexican flare and rolling it up in burrito form using a tortilla,soy paper or seaweed with rice(white or brown). GENIUS!
-I went with the signature burritos and added some other menu items to make it unique. it has the same concept like a Chipotle where you go down an assembly line building your own Jaburrito to perfection. There is a condiment bar at the end near the register where you can get salsas, wasabi, soy sauce and ginger, help yourself.
-So pick from the list of burritos or \"roll your own\" !"}
{"text":"TL;DR
Pricey, decent, good texture, long beach. 

Sushi? Love. 
Burritos? Love.
Pick and choose style eateries? Love. 
Jaburritos? :(

Having eaten Jaburritos 3 times now I can't say I'm a fan no matter what the hype says. It isn't terrible, its pretty decent, but so many aspects makes it a place that I wouldn't eat regularly. It isn't exactly mind blowing, and really more so a giant hand roll that isn't so giant. Smaller appetite patrons may be satisfied after one sushi burrito, but larger appetite patrons may consider getting 2, which ends up costly. Consider quickly though because the lines are tremendously slow and as the place gets busier it'll only take longer. I have been in line for at most 20 minutes, which isn't bad for a sit down, but for a pick and choose restaurant its rather slow. Lunch breakers consider ordering ahead of time.The Long Beach may be the best of the ones I've tried.

The sauces are great here (my favorite is queso, weird eh?) but mask most of the flavors of the fish which seems counter intuitive if you're here to eat fish.                There is good texture though, with creamy and crunchy being most prominent. The salsa cups are paper cups but a larger variation is needed for dine in (there is 2 separate cups for dine in and take out), too small to be useful for chips. 

There is a variety of prices for each burrito ($6-12) but seems to be a bit expensive for the size."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you love sushi and you love burritos - well than your going to be in heaven! Tried it for the first time and I'm hooked. Very fresh, great flavors. Everyone working was very helpful and suggested great options to try. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm confused on this one. 
I would have to say that this might be the most lackluster meal/snack I've ever had in Vegas. (Well maybe not, If you've been to Tom Urban) I ordered the Redondo beach(Sushi burrito with salmon/tuna and some other veggies). The rice is rolled really thin which isn't a bad thing. But the the size of the thing is small. There's just nothing special about it. It's like they just rolled fish and veggies in seaweed with rice and called it a day. Taste nothing like sushi or fresh poke. To top it off they don't even roll their on burritos, they just use a machine. 

If you're from the bay and you've been to sushirrito, Jaburritos doesn't compare in any way. Don't sell yourself short especially for an average of $13-$15 a piece to only be half the size with no avocados in sight. 

As far as the service, it's fast and as it should be. I'm just not sure why folks are so high on this."}
{"text":"Awsome food creative concept loved the kodiack and Long Beach! Mochi balls amazing I had a sake sangria splendid cocktail came again the next night"}
{"text":"OMYGOSHHHHH!!!  i havent been this excited about a restaurant in a LONG time so bear w/me here!! bottom line? 
its freakin deLish!!!! lol
so... i had read about this new 'sushi-style' burrito joint opening up here in town  in the LV weekly and thought, \"what a great concept!\" so, we stopped in tonite to give it a shot... talk about an explosion of only the best flavors on earth mixed with the perfect amount of crunch goin on with each bite you take! im serious, its beyond excellent! 
* hubby had the 'redondo' and had them add some shrimp tempura (wrapped in seaweed) --he can eat!! & thought he'd be ordering more, but in the end he was satisfied with one :)
* i had the 'huntington' and added ahi tuna, xtra jalapeños and diablo loca sauce (wrapped in seaweed) i got additional salsa and jalas from the salsa bar bc i do like my mouth on fire basically, lol. however, i didnt end up using any of the extra bc it was plenty of heat already!!  it was HUGE n i didnt think i was guna be able to finish, but it was so freakin good, i DID eat the entire burrito!!!
* we also ordered taro chips --BOMB! w/cheese sauce to dip em in and some edamame (which we didnt even end up eating bc were so full!)
if u like sushi? go there! if u like burritos? go there! u will not be disappointed!! guaranteed ;) its inexpensive too!! and the staff is super friendly and helpful!! 
ooh! almost forgot to mention the house-made soy sauce, which u really dont need, but i tastes it on my finger and it was amazinggggg!!!"}
{"text":"Back in Vegas for CES, heard John (of Soho Sushi fame) opened a new restaurant...had to try it.  It did not disappoint.  We had the triple S,  the 3 amigos and the high maintenance, all with brown rice and soy paper.  They were excellent, with generous potions of fish and veggies.  Great for dinner as the food is not filling.  I would recommend ordering one of the pre-designed ones first to get a feel of the fusion thrilling your taste buds...and then go back use the custom made option to create your own masterpiece.

The staff were very friendly, patient and accommodating to make your dining experience an enjoyable one.

John you did it again,  AWESOME Buddy, thanks !!!"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Some floor space could be used for more tables and chairs. The first employee to start taking my order went on break and tried to tell another employee my selections, but I guess he wasn't listening so I had to tell him everything all over again.

LIKE  Business is environmentally responsible. Reasonably priced.

LOVE  The fusion concept. The variety of choices when building your own. Quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say, I'm a sushi lover, but didn't think it would do it in a burrito, but I was wrong. It is amazing, they put it together perfectly, so the wrap stays crispy.. take my word for it... Great! We are here at happy hour so the sake sangria is 1/2 price.. very good, second pitcher! The crew that's on today is amazingly friendly, so make sure you tip them... ok? Ok!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place. It's fast food elevated. We went and planned to get three different jaburritos. One with seaweed wrap, one with soy paper wrap, and one on a tortilla.   The tortilla was our least favorite. I can't mark them down for that. The ingredients were awesome. Fun place. Great service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"All of the stars!! Yes, sir, you get them allll!! Wowieee yes please. Okay okay I admit, I was starving so maybe the 11 Stars should really be 10, but I'm a fan. I'm quite a foodie so trust me when I say the Long Beach bowl is where it's at. The portion is the largest, go big or go home right?! The lobby beach has spicy tuna (super fresh tasting), shrimp tempura ( amazing crunch), and crab meat. My friend has the Long Beach burrito and she wished she had gotten the bowl. It comes with Guac, cucumbers, rice, crunchy chip strips and some tomatoes. Sooo good. No bathroom, only downfall. I have to pee so badly but still had time to order and eat and run to the nearest Bush, I kid I kid, I went to the fountain."}
{"text":"Ya know those awesome concept restaurants that come to market.  This is one.  This place is awesome.   Sushi + Burritos.  Super Fresh.  Priced right ($10-$12) Super clean.   Awesome Sushi Burrito roller and Miso Soup dispenser machine.   Just great stuff all around.  Try it.  Look @ the pics and you'll want to go!  Place is packed @ lunch.  Go early!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I got the Acapulco sushi nori burrito and it was spicy and delicious! I was skeptical about eating sushi in burrito format but it totally worked and wasn't messy. The burrito was full of fish and some veggies and wonton strips for a great crunch. We showed up around 6:30p on a Sunday and with the exception of the two people in front of us who took awhile to order, it was a relatively quick ordering and dining experience. There are a handful of predefined items you can order as a bowl, burrito or nachos and some sides you can add like edamame, taro chips & queso, miso soup, etc. They also serve sake sangria which I wasn't bold enough to try, maybe next time. I'd love to be back before my short trip is over."}
{"text":"Came here twice on my Vegas trip and I really enjoyed the food here ! Despite the long line up and little dining area it's great !"}
{"text":"I was so so hungry and sick of walking the strip so I yelped the closest food and found this place. The service was really great, they had a lot of great options to choose from. I had the waikiki without the jalepenos and I swapped the dressing to one without dairy. It was so delicious!! I loved every bite. I also had the miso which was pretty good too. The prices are standard, I think for 2 sushi burritos and 1 miso it was $18. The portions are perfect. I'm going back to Vegas in April and I'll definitely have to grab another. 

Also the location is really cute, I love that little area on the strip."}
{"text":"Sushirritos have long been a trend in California, and like everything in Vegas, we get it years later. At least we get it from the people behind Soho, the best sushi place in town. 

We got the Redondo and the Rockport to share, both sans red onion (he's picky). The mistake was ordering it just on soy paper, like I always have in California. These weren't really \"Mexican fusion,\" they were really just large sushi rolls beside the fried tortilla strips and cilantro. Which was good But they needed a tortilla to really feel like a sushirrito. (Plus, just being wrapped in the soy paper made them a little drippy on the ends, which wouldn't have been a problem on a tortilla.)

The rolls themselves were really great, but I have to give the edge to the Rockport--the soft shell crab was great. It also was more substantial than the Redondo, though the flavors of each were great. But again: these are big sushi rolls with primarily sushi flavors, not burrito flavors. Fair prices ($10.95 each) considering all the seafood in them both. 

As a side we ordered taro chips and mochi. Mochi was mochi--nothing else to say there. The taro chips were great, perfectly cooked and not oily, with some kind of sugary seasoning on them. What was weird was the nacho queso sauce that came with them. It was good...but it mixed kind of weirdly with the seasoning. 

I'll probably be back sometime soon, and I'll definitely try a different roll, on a tortilla this time. They've only been open two weeks but the line was out the door the whole time we were there, so it's safe to expect this place will be open for awhile. (Or until the trend loses steam.)"}
{"text":"Jaburritos offers one of the best plate selections on strip (or nearby) if you want something:
Healthy
Affordable
Fast
Different

My favorite dish is the Long Beach Poke Bowl with mixed greens.  The shrimp tempura comes hot and crispy, which contrasts very nicely with the cold greens and tuna.  

The outdoor seating option is nice because there is often live music playing next door and it sits in direct view of the fountain.  

*high tourist activity in this area.  Often noisy*"}
{"text":"The sushi \"cupcakes\" which are like crispy wonton cups filled to the top with various toppings was actually very good! 4 for $12 is slightly steep but I liked each flavor, especially the spicy tuna.

My friends got the sushi burritos and they were all pretty generous portions. Even saving half for the next day, it still tasted good! Kind of a bummer you can't make-your-own but the fast and efficient service makes up for it.

For dessert, I got the Mochi Ice Cream pops! 3 on a stick for $5(?). I thought that was pretty reasonable and the Mochi sizes are big - green tea and mango were yummy. Ice cream inside melted kind of fast in the heat so I had to eat it before finishing my entree.

Would recommend if you're in the LINQ Promenade!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Wish I had one back home. The employees were friendly. The sushi burritos were really good. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Is it a giant sushi roll or are handrolls just miniature versions of a jaburrito? We might never know the answer to this chicken or the egg question, but this new fusion joint is spot on. The marinade of Asian cuisine neatly wrapped inside a roll is not a new idea. Fusion burritos have been around for nearly a decade with the advent of Korean burrito food trucks. Sushirrito was the original sushi burrito concept to open in San Francisco. I've tried them all, and in the past, I've found this concept to be a poor substitute for actual sushi because the pieces of tuna or salmon were cut in such a way that they were too chewy and stringy. It was, in essence, a larger, shittier version of actual sushi. 

Fast forward to the soft opening of Jaburritos last week. This place takes a step in the right direction. Most of the menu items are affordable starting at $5.25 and up. Not only do they have raw fish, they also add a crunchy option to the mix with the offering of shrimp tempura and soft shell crab. I settled on the popular Redondo, which is filled with three different kinds of fish: salmon, yellowtail, and ahi tuna mixed with tobiko, guacamole, red onion, cilantro, wasabi mayo, and cream cheese wrapped in seaweed (soy paper also available). Each and every bite was delicious. Although I wish I could have appreciated the flavor of the sauce more, the ratio of fish to rice was great. The addition of the different self-serve salsas went wonderfully with each bite. However, for nearly double the price of some of the other fishes, I might have just ordered two separate tuna and yellowtail jaburritos in retrospect. All in all, the fish quality was great and I will definitely be coming back to try some of the other things including the jachos."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and ordered a Rockport Sushi Bowl, instead of Tuna I got it with Salmon instead. I'm not much a fan of Tuna but I love Salmon! Their ingredients taste fresh and I loved the eel sauce and chipotle mayo combo.  For the rice to topping ratio, I honestly wish there was more topping especially since the salmon was too small of a portion to the huge amount of rice that's in the bowl.

Overall the casual ambience of the place was clean and inviting and their fish, as well as other ingredients tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"This is my 5th time here and I am a huge fan. I always get the \"create your own\" on soy paper with spicy tuna. OMG it is amazing lol to me, but I'm sure it sound plain and boring to you ha ha ha but don't worry they have a lot of other yummy things to choose from. 

I really enjoy the concept of this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and over all always have a great experience here. 

Heads up, be prepared to wait in a line for your yummy order because it does get busy BUT don't worry... it will be all worth it. We did come here a couple of time with 16 of our basketball players and boyyyyyyyyyyyyy we take up the whole restaurant. So if you're coming with a big party, plan ahead.   

Location is in a dark area but I'm glad it's near Tarkanian Basketball gym. Great place to grab a bite before and after my games. 

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I'll probably be back. 
I admire their desire to be different, to be adventurous.

BUT Jaburrito has the same problem that sushi restaurants have. The food has no flavor; you have to add flavor....with sauces and add-ons.

Let's be honest here: rice has no flavor. It's like little pieces of styrofoam. 
Most raw fish has no flavor, other than slightly fishy. 
Now combine all that into a flour tortilla (or soy paper etc) which also has no flavor, and guess what: MORE no flavor. 
Oh sure, lots of TEXTURE, but flavor has left the building.
So slather on the wasabi, the hot sauce etc.

Hmmmm. I wonder about this food strategy.

SO to test my thesis: after I ordered my Jaburrito, I drove a few blocks down the street to Mariana's and ordered a typical carnitas burrito. Then I went home, and ate half of each.

Guess which one had more flavor....and therefore more satisfaction?
At half the price."}
{"text":"I can die happy now. I'm so happy that I found this unique place. Sushi burritos are the future. It's like they make a giant roll but didn't cut it into slices. I went two days in a row and didn't even feel guilty (and the staff didn't seem judgmental about it either lol). They're set up like a chipotle or a subway, in that you pick exactly what goes inside and watch them roll it shut at the end. And the prices are totally fair, cheaper than chipotle for sure. I'm in love with their raw salmon~! And their customer service was on point, friendly, and incredibly welcoming. I've been telling everyone I know to go there asap. Go go go!!!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the idea of a sushi burrito and didn't have high hopes, but I was wrong!! This was my favorite thing that I've eaten on my trip.  I got the rock port and added avocado, so delicious!! And the tempura crab added just the right crunch.  It's definitely big enough to share if you're not starving (think of chipotle burrito size).  They have great outdoor seating for people watching in the walking strip!!"}
{"text":"The employee who took my order was friendly and pleasant.  The food was nicely portioned for me and fresh.  I would go back to the restaurant when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The sushi burrito was really good. I got the mission. It was not as filling as I would have expected. Ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. They have a vegan option which is awesome. They lost a star because they messed up my order by not adding my additional toppings, and forgot to bring me my side dish. They also gave my friend somebody else's order. Relaxed atmosphere. Clean. Free sake at check in. Did not know how to do a refund for the items they forgot."}
{"text":"Sushi burrito ?!? Yessss ! It is a great value for Strip pricing and the fact that it's yummy was a big plus!! You make your own bowl or burrito and add the toppings of your liking to make a very filling lunch or dinner. Lots of restaurants to choose from but make sure you stop here to taste what they offer. Seating is outside open and various seating inside but it's nice to people watch outside."}
{"text":"First time trying sushi burrito and I wasn't too impressed. Having been raised in Japan, I grew up eating something similar but under a different name. It is called temakizushi (?????), a Japanese customized hand-roll. In my opinion, sushi burrito is just more creative name for a customized hand-roll. 

SERVICE
Their \"assembly line\" was disorganized and inefficient. I understand they just opened last week but I saw one guy grabbing something over another guy's arm. Then a new hire looking through recipe getting in the way of another guy. They should take some notes from Subway and learn to run the line smoothly. 3 people in front of me and I waited over 20 mins to order. Meh.

FOOD
I ordered Mission ($8.95) which comes with salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce. Took out the pico de gallo since I can't handle any heat. 

There's definitely some texture, but it had absolutely no flavor. Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch and I liked how they are generous with salmon and ebi. However, even with their yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce, a quick dip in soy sauce was necessary. Odd that I only tasted yuzu guacamole on one half of my sushi burrito. Put more sauce please. 

You can totally customize your own in bowl, burrito or nachos. Choose your toppings, protein and sauces. Will try this next time.

CONCLUSION
I paid around $10 (tax and tip included) for a burrito that wasn't filling. Maybe I would've enjoyed my experience more if I didn't wait for so long. I will give another chance in the future but 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time while in Vegas. I actually liked it! The girl that took my order was very helpful! She gave me a menu with everything that's listed as vegan and not vegan when I asked. I didn't feel rushed when placing my order. The guy that brought out my order was really friendly and nice too! I would come back here for a quick bite when I'm in town! Good food, friendly people, fast service! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Jaburritos is run by some passionate cats. I loved going in and meeting the staff and trying their food! The place is very technologically advanced (machine that smushed rice into seaweed) and also Eco-friendly (recycled/repurposed furniture). It made me feel good supporting this business.

Jaburritos does a fusion burrito with sushi concept. You choose a wrap like soy paper or seaweed and then you pick the insides a la Subway type ordering. I opted for one of their pre-decided burritos. 

It had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and an array of veggies. With soy paper I enjoyed the freshness of the burrito. Their veggies were great and the spicy tuna was good. My let down was the shrimp tempura. They give you 2 pieces and the shrimp have very little shrimp in it. The shrimp they use are super breaded. It literally shouldn't even have been on there it was THAT small.  
The price with a canned green tea came out to about $14. Which I think was worth the price. I think for $10.95 a burrito that they could use better shrimp for their shrimp tempura.

I also tried one of their burritos with steak in it and one of their salmon burritos. They were both very good.

Overall I did like Jaburritos, but in my honest opinion I wouldn't go here often. The concept is great and the food is good, flavorful, unique. I would just rather go to an AYCE sushi place is all. I can't be the only one out there. It's really just giant hand rolls. That's just me. To me this falls into the novelty category. I'm glad I tried it, I liked it, but there is an alternative I'd rather go to called all you can eat sushi. 

Go here for a light and satisfying lunch or dinner. The staff is super nice, the place is clean, they are unique, and they won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Great food. A bit different then other food in the area. Very refreshing. Fresh ingredients and very filling. I had the Long Beach bowl. Definitely would get it again maybe ask for a bit more sauce."}
{"text":"So let me start out by saying I love sushi and I also love burritos. When I found out they combined the two I freaked out, it's a American sized sushi roll and they're amazing! The ratio to fish and rice is perfect! Don't take my word, go buy one for yourself, less then 10$!!!"}
{"text":"I walked into this spot because the In and Out burger was so busy and I didn't want to wait around so long. But I'm glad I didn't wait because I got to experience this place! Food was great. You can definitely taste the freshness. The portions are worth your buck. And the staff were so courteous. Definitely a nice place to grab a nice lunch. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ha. Sorry.  You got me,  hook,  line and stinker.  Pictures and hoopla got me so excited to give this a try. The reality is mediocre supermarket quality sushi mascarading in fancy rolls and bowls drenched in sugary sauces.  Try the Asahi.  At least that is authentic. 

I wonder how many of these five star reviewers have eaten at any of the numerous better Poke places in LA or NYC.  If they have,  I'd be surprised to see them give out 5 stars here.  

And for a place that claims to be sustainable and environmentally conscientious I find it funny they don't have a recycle bin for glass bottles"}
{"text":"Hot damn, Ja Burritos nails it.  The first standout is the portions. These are large burritos stuffed full of greatness.  Along with the substantial size, they are crafted with the same precision as fine sushi. 

The price is more than fair, and less than $25 filled two of us.  Friendly staff, quick service, and great flavor.

For sure a new spot to become a regular at."}
{"text":"Amazing custom burritos but their order of queso and chips is a joke. The side of queso  is so small u can't even put your chip inside the small cup."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location it was very busy.  The reason is the food is fresh and Delicious.  It was lunch on a Thursday and the line was long.  I believe they will get this all worked out.  I had a baja burrito with a seaweed wrap.  It is like eating a big sushi roll.  You call what ingredients you want and they roll it up in front of you.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"The food was so good! I don't like sushi really, but the Rockport was great, it had just right amount of kick (spicy) to have me loving it, but not gulping the water. The taro chips had an amazing flavor. The staff was good, very friendly. I would absolutely recommend Jaburritos to everyone!"}
{"text":"When I saw the culinary mind behind Soho in the house, my expectations grew higher. They were exceeded.

I've anticipated the opening of Jaburritos ever since I heard that Chef John Chien Lee of Soho Japanese Restaurant was launching a new place. I finally got to try it when I met up with friends for an early lunch. And yes, the man himself was present, watching the front line and working around the back counter and the kitchen while still smiling to customers. How could that not be a great omen?

Jaburritos is his take on the fusion of sushi and burritos. Unlike other concepts that I've tried (local AYCE joint JJANGA and LA-based food truck Jogasaki, the latter a regular sight at the twice-yearly Foodie Fest), Jaburritos actually incorporates Mexican ingredients into the burritos and provides a basic \"salsa\" bar to boot (mild salsa, salsa verde, and salsa roja in addition to ginger, wasabi, and house soy sauce).

I like the location and the space. It's on Sahara across from Palace Station, so it's not far from the freeway. The inside is bright and welcoming with environmentally conscious decisions (full-on LED lights, anyone?) and relatively modest seating (maybe 30 people max). The line moves quickly, and it's very natural to compare the ordering experience to Chipotle because of the assembly line format, the \"burrito\" bowl option, the possibility of customization (although the pre-designed, beach-named menu items seem like winners), and of course the (sometimes) bagged chips available at the cashier.

I decided not to look into the possibility of \"jachos\" (corn or taro chips topped with sushi ingredients) and I didn't feel up to making a burrito from scratch, so I went for the easy preset options. For the choices available with these, I asked for the soy paper, not the nori wrap, so as to match the presentation of the aforementioned sushi burrito purveyors. I also stuck to the white sushi rice instead of the brown rice because they stated that the latter didn't have the sushi vinegar.

Taro chips with queso ($2.99 for the side order, i.e. not the combo): I must mention this first. I kept munching on this and almost ignoring the burritos because they're so addictive. The taro chips are much like the Terra packaged version except dusted with furikake. They're fun on their own, but something about the combination of the taro chips with that liquid cheese dip that makes it very tough to stop. I somehow tasted a light sweetness with the combo, and it definitely wasn't from the queso alone. Definitely make this a part of your order, whether it's the shareable-size side portion or a smaller portion in the drink combination.

Rockport ($10.95): soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi, jalapeño, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla (eel) sauce. It's easy to point to the two powerful sauces as the reason that this has been a winner with others, but it wouldn't succeed without the other ingredients combining harmoniously. The tempura crunch is the standout of the non-sauce components. I could probably eat this all day, but I shared half with a friend in exchange for...

Redondo ($10.95): ahi, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeño, cilantro, wasabi mayo. It wasn't as purely fun as the Rockport, but it's almost as delicious. The fish stand out in this burrito, proving that you don't need so many sauces to have a good sushi roll. Or a good Jaburrito, one that I'd also order again.

[UPDATE 11/3/15: Went again with different friends, tried the Kodiak ($8.95): grilled salmon, romaine, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tempura crunch, mango teriyaki, chipotle mayo, and furikake. It wasn't very good, and I had to keep adding flavor from soy sauce and the various salsas. Skip this, and design your own grilled salmon combo if you must.]

I tried the salsas with everything. I didn't find that they significantly elevated anything (except for the lackluster Kodiak), but they weren't incompatible and provided a fun accent. The soy sauce helped the Redondo more than the sauce-laden Rockport. I skipped the ginger and wasabi since I feared unnecessarily sharp flavors, but they looked like standard fare at least.

Jaburritos is a great choice for lunch or a light dinner. With fresh ingredients and solid execution, Chef Lee has proven the concept of sushi and Mexican fusion while creating the best rendition of the sushi burrito that I've had thus far. I can't wait to return to try different options and eventually make my own Jaburrito from scratch."}
{"text":"Excellent food and speedy service.  Never had a sushi based burrito and was blown away.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other options. The long beach was amazing.  Fair prices too."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food.  You can customize orders of choose what they have on the menu and are willing to change or substitute for you.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating.

We ordered the Rockport and Long Island.  The Long Island was delicious and has some heat with it, while the Rockport, I feel like, was missing a little something; dipping bits in soy sauce and wasabi.

My only issue with the sushi burrito concept is the difficulty if using the soy sauces and wasabi they give you with your food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  There is a great variety of different things. The taro chips and queso is a must have when visiting here. They do such a great job and always are so friendly. I would definitely recommend anyone to come check them out and eat here."}
{"text":"Ohh-ma-gerddddd!!! Need I saw more... I'm already done with my food and I JUST got it... soooo no picture! Vegans are welcome!!!"}
{"text":"Genius food spot!!

Everyone that likes/loves sushi MUST go here and try this place. The service was great and the sushi itself was fresh and delicious! 

Menu allows you to make your own or pick one of their creations. It's like a chipotle style for sushi lovers! 
Proportions were good sized, price is pretty fair, they have a variety of drinks to choose from and they offer Mochi for dessert.

I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of sushi burritos but I do love sushi bowls. I recommend getting the bowl over the burrito because it's just easier to eat. Also the bowls looked better than the burritos.  I ordered the long beach in a bowl which turned out to be really really good. It was very light and refreshing. The rice was cooked perfectly for us it had a little bit of sweetness to it which sushi rice should. I've had sushi bowls and the rice is just your basic rice. I do feel like they should've put the shrimp tempura on the top because it was buried under the toppings that it made the tempura batter on it a little soggy. The miso soup was a little sad too, just your basic miso that came with 2 small pieces of tofu and a small piece of seaweed."}
{"text":"Pros: got the Long Beach, told it's their most popular. Great customer service. huge portions. Accepts credit cards. 

Cons: no street parking."}
{"text":"Walked by this place a few times then decided to try it. Best choice in my Las Vegas trip, I got the alcapulco sushi burrito. It was fully and had just the right amount of spicy-ness. The staff was very friendly which is always nice."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with my first sushi burrito a few months back because it fell apart after the first bite. Here, my burrito stayed in tact and the flavors blended in perfectly. I'm not a huge sushi fan, but this had a smooth taste. I had to knock off a star for the really high prices. I think we paid $13 for a tiny burrito. I probably could've eaten two."}
{"text":"Ordered two different kind and we split it so we can try different ones. The portion is well worth the money. I could only eat half of it. But everything in the roll was really fresh and they filled it up. The workers is nice and the place was clean. Loved that they had a patio where we can sit and eat and also people watch."}
{"text":"it ain't so hot fam, ya need to make it less bland and more saucy ya feel. you need that extra saucyness if ya want to be lit

the red onion and cilantro kind of killed the flavor of the raw fish, thus it didn't really deserve more than 3 stars"}
{"text":"I am biased because I love Soho and i followed chef John and Nunu over here, but how could you not? They took the concept of the sushi burrito and blew it up and continue to use the same high quality of fish in the process. I love that they are the first ones to bring this to Las Vegas. I love that there are so many choices of fish, toppings and sauces to choose from. And I love that they created this restaurant entirely of recycled materials. 

Who cares if there's a wait? When you finally sit down and bask in the burritos glory, it's worth it. How many restaurants do we go to without a reservation and it's a standard 20 to 30min. wait and when you finally sit down, you still have to wait approximately another 30 to 45min. from ordering and actually cooking your food. I don't think anyone ever thought this would have blown up so quickly so we can't blame them for trying to catch up and figure out their flow. 

Anyways, I like building my own burritos because I get greedy with my toppings and protein. You can use fish, chicken, beef, tofu, tempura or soft shell crab as your protein. You can use seaweed or rice paper as your official wrap to seal your burrito. And you can even get brown rice. 

I also love the Jachos. Something about the queso and lightly sugared taro chips just go so well together. You can even customize your Jachos as well. If you're too lazy to add your own toppings, you won't regret getting Long Beach Jachos. Also I need to know where they are getting these Japanese melon and mango drinks from because they compliment the meal perfectly."}
{"text":"My wife has been dying to try this place for sometime now and she finally did last night before our concert. The place looking inviting and cozy so we decided to check it out. A little wait, but that's expected being at the strip. The workers were friendly. Order was taken quickly. The food was delicious. Thumbs up! We would try this place again, but the location for locals rather than be surrounded by a huge touristy crowd. :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place after walking around in 106 degree heat for a few hours. Loved it! Got the Redondo and the wife got the rockport. Substituted the chipotle mayo for the wasabi Mayo. Delicious! The fish was fresh and clean tasting and they didn't overburden the fish with too much sauce. Had rolled in Nori (seaweed) paper. Ate mine and then proceeded to eat half of the wife's rockport. The staff was friendly and checked on us twice. If you like poke give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical walking into this place based on my previous sushi burrito experience. I ordered the Acapulco burrito and my taste buds were blown away. The roll never fell apart which is a huge plus. The ingredients in the roll worked perfectly together. My favorite part has to be the kick and the crunchy tortilla bits inside. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Located at the Linq near the Highroller. You can either order a Sushi Burrito or a Bowl. You can create your own, a vegan style, vegetarian, and a gluten free wrap or bowl.

I ordered the Mission Sushi Burrito. It had fresh salmon with a crunchy ingredient that helped enhance the taste and texture of the dish. There were Pico De Gallo inside so it was a bit spicy for me, but I'm weak towards spiciness.

My friend ordered the Summer special, the Acapulco. They explained to her that it's spicy, but my friend can handle spiciness way better then I can. She told me that she didn't taste the spicy while eating it till the very end of her second half of the roll, the spiciness hit her. She also had the Sake Sangria, the alcohol was strong, but the flavor was watered down I heard.

When I went, the line wasn't that long. As time goes on, more people come in. I think the reason why there's not a huge line of customers is because there's an In and Out across from them. It's still a nice establishment to get a Sushi burrito.

You can ask them for a refill too. A waitress came around to people who wanted a refill, so that made me happy since soft drink is $3.

I'm not sure if it's for all phones, but my friend and I didn't have good service while we were eating in Jaburritos. Nothing will load when we used the internet or the yelp app."}
{"text":"Finally a sushi burrito in vegas! Just came from there. BOMB!!!!! Our family will be regulars..."}
{"text":"I don't know why this wasn't in my life before. It was really busy, just giant sushi rolls (if you get seaweed)"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Can't believe how good it is! I had the Long Beach Bowl with white rice and added cream cheese. My husband had the Redondo burrito. 
Nice music and quick service didn't even wait like 5 minutes for our food.. I mean umm chipotle who?! 
Great food find!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"That jaburrito place is A-MAZING! I am going to write them and have them open one in Chicago! The Long Beach is extremely flavorful. We are going down the menu! One of the most innovative, interesting, insanely great restaurants I have ever been to. We really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"It's about damn time we get a sushi burrito restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been waiting for a long time since trying jogasaki at foodie fest 2 years ago and my dreams have come true. In a nut shell it's really just an uncut sushi roll but eating it burrito style is awesome.

Setting: Right off W. Sahara after rancho. It's in the mcdonald's parking lot. Pretty big parking lot so you should be able to find a spot. 

Interior: Bright but really not a lot of places to sit especially with how popular it is, so have someone claim a spot and get their order while you're in line if you wanna be those people lol.

Food: It's everything you'd want in a sushi burrito (minus unagi). The redondo was the burrito I selected which really is the best bang for your buck. Tuna, yellowtail, and salmon (I highly recommend adding shrimp tempura) This is sushi heaven rolled almost perfectly (it is pretty huge). Comparing this to jogasaki it is about $5 cheaper, and a lot bigger. Foodie fest won't be the same with Jaburrito around.

Service: Friendly but they're more focused on churning through the customers, especially when it's busy it was like waiting for sushi burritos at foodie fest. 

Drinks: They have water cups but they're the kind you get from the dentist's office, so don't let your water sit in that cup for too long. I opted for their apple soda which had an unusual aftertaste, so I'd go for the melon soda instead.

Overall: 30 minutes away from my house and yet it's quite worth the drive. Jaburritos has staked it's claim as Las Vegas's first official sushi burrito restaurant and it's here to stay."}
{"text":"Unbelievable this place has so many stars.  Worst sushi burritos in Vegas. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We loved it so much on our last trip that we had to come back when we were in town.

It's Sunday night and it was busier than I remember it being before. The cashier (Natasha according to our receipt) was so sweet and friendly. And our Redondo bowl was to die for! 

Thank you, Jaburritos. Hopefully we will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service could use some improvement.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and the line was at about the door when I arrived. It took me a good 15 minutes to get to the register and order, after which I noticed the line was now wrapped around the entire inside of the dining area. I really don't comprehend why it takes so long to take our orders, since our food isn't made item-by-item as you go along (like a chipotle or subway). I still had to receive a number and wait for it to be called to get my food. Don't be fooled by the tabletop numbers they give you, no one will deliver your food to your table. If you want it, you'll have to get up and get it when your number is called.

I got the Long Beach which was very good. I especially liked the wonton strips inside, they added a nice texture that I don't normally get with this kind of food. Overall the wrap was good, the sauce was good, and it was much more filling than it looks. I am happy with my meal, but the process could be better."}
{"text":"Yum. Ordered the laguna, featuring unagi and strimp tempera , in a burrito form wrapped in seaweed. It's very filling and incredibly flavourful. It's easy to eat too. The service is quick. I highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"Adorable atmosphere,  great food choices! Staff was friendly and accommodating.  The food was literally the BEST I was in heaven.  Fish is fresh and the combos and flavors are to die for! Very filling and satisfying. I went twice in one day with no regrets, wish they were in CA! I'll be visiting here every Vegas trip no doubt."}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended this place. I got the rockport burrito combo with sake sangria and taro chips with queso."}
{"text":"FINALLY Vegas has a place like this. It's worth it. Food is good and it's a cute simple environment. You'll love it!!"}
{"text":"Sushi style burritos (imagine instead of a tortilla, a giant seaweed wrapper filled with fresh fish, rice, vegetables, sauces, etc.) and sushi bowls.
I expected it to be more Chipotle-esqe (where you shuffle down the line, picking and choosing what you desire and at the end paying) but it was different. You prepay your selection by choosing from the provided menu and within a few minutes, your order arrives.
Don't get me wrong, the food was tasty and the fish was fresh but I like the idea of customization and creativity. This eatery is in a great location and also serves sake sangria- half off during happy hour."}
{"text":"Wish there was one of these places in my town.   Ate there three days in a row.   Food is fresh and delicious.    Good quality,  excellent creative and clean"}
{"text":"Really cool place! A little over priced but to be expected after all it is Las Vegas.  I had the Long Beach burrito it was delicious ! They have several options and all items can be customized !"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing food! Seriously  if you love sushi you need to be here. It's delicious. Confusing at first because you don't really know what it is your ordering but once you do \"OMG\". Whole notha level. I will be a definite regular. Great staff too!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a night and wanted a quick bite to eat. My bf and I came across this place and decided to try it. 

[Service]
Service wasn't terrible. They just weren't good at giving us what we ordered. The soda we received was only 3/4 filled up. I thought this was weird. We asked them why it was like that and they said that there are free refills so we can come back and ask for more. Maybe they were too lazy to fill it up more at the time. We got the Laguna half rice, half salad and made it a combo which includes miso soup and a drink. They didn't bring our miso soup out with our entree. They also made our entree incorrectly and put only salad in it. After I talked to them, they were nice about getting us everything we ordered. 

[Price]
We ordered the Laguna which is about $13. To make it a combo, it is an additional $3.50. To make it a sushi bowl instead of a sushi burrito, it cost an additional $1. Is this necessary to charge? Our total after tax was over $18 for one combination. This was way too overpriced for what we got in return. The bowl tasted good, but nothing extraordinary to be charging that high of a price.

[Ambience]
Your typical to go place. None of the tables were wiped down so it felt a bit dirty. 

There are definitely better options in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had the \"long beach\" and it was a little expensive, but it was delicious. Staff was nice and decor was good"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! 

When I was visiting Vegas, we had dinner here two nights in a row before heading to the clubs. 

Location - LINQ Promenade - crowded but expected. DUH, las vegas. 
There is indoor and outdoor seating, which is nice. You get to people watch and enjoy the vibe of Las Vegas.

SUSHI BURRITO - yes, hype. YES GOOD. filling for sure. I had the Long Beach and it was great. for $13 bucks I was full. I mean it would be the same as getting a good roll at a sushi joint so why not. 

Taro Chips - different and pleasantly delicious. enough to share. 

So much more on the menu that I wanted to try. Maybe the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"You know what? For Vegas this place is easily worth 5 stars. The fish was fresh and it was a lot of healthy delicious food for a great price! Will definitely come back and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"This is a great find on the strip. If you want a healthy fresh quick bite and not to break the wallet, this place has two of my favorite food combined together: sushi and burrito. I tried the Huntington in Nori first, very good. It's like a big hand roll with a little twist. The gardin Vince was good too. The Redondo in the bowl version was good too, generous portion. I prefer the hand roll/burrito version. But the bowl version can be really filling. I would recommend this place for adventurous sushi lovers. Good quality for its price. I would eat here again when I visit the strip."}
{"text":"I had the Venice & it was vegan & let me tell you, it was so good! They used gardin steak & it was life changing. My vegan friends loved it too. Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"Can't give 5 stars to a restaurant that inexplicably refuses take out orders.  Plus the pricepoint is too high for what you get."}
{"text":"I only rate places when I feel the food and service is superb. This place is just that. Fun relaxed atmosphere with great service and new and exiting tasty food."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place.
It was my first time eating sushi burrito and it was an AMAZING experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, burrito concept is smart. I got the bowl and gf got the burrito, both great options."}
{"text":"This place rocks..basically sushi rolls...made like a burrito. There is a reason this place averages 4.5 stars. Nobody in my group had anything bad to say. As a fast food place, expect to spend $20 for a roll, a side, and a beer. I've spent more for much worse."}
{"text":"You could certainly do much worse in Vegas, but there's a noticeable lack of protein given its focus on the menu, which is made up for with krab, puffed rice, sauces, and other odd fillers (green bell pepper?).

I suggest carefully reviewing the menu and customizing your order accordingly."}
{"text":"I appreciate that they took responsibility for their mistake by refunding my money. We'll definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"If you love your hand rolls, you will love Jaburrito! For the price, you get a large hand roll that will quickly fill you up. They also offer combo options with seaweed salad, chips, and miso soup.

The interior is nice and bright with lots of sunshine. The dining area is not very large and will most likely be full around lunch time. If you've been to chipotle or cafe rio, you will find that the ordering is similar. You can either get a pre-made burrito with your choice of wrap (seaweed, soy paper, wheat/flour tortilla, etc.) or make a totally custom burrito. My first order was the Rockport, which includes soft shell crab, spicy tuna, imitation crab, and other good stuff. It was somewhat spicy with the included jalapeños, but you are more than welcome to substitute anything for anything. My favorite part is the tempura crunch!

They assemble your burrito fairly quickly. They have a fancy machine that builds the perfect layer of rice on which they will lay a sheet of seaweed. At the end of the assembly line is another fancy machine that will wrap your burrito.

I rate it 5 stars because it is just so delicious and fairly quick to order. It's also easy on your wallet, considering you're essentially paying for a sushi roll. Average price for a burrito is $10. Add a couple of bucks and you get a sweet combo deal!"}
{"text":"A must have while in Vegas. It's Chipotle style and everything is fresh. The sake sangria is refreshing and is a creeper. Drink it quick before all the ice melts."}
{"text":"This was my first sushiritto and it was pretty good. It's exactly what you'd thought it'd be - a burrito size sushi roll. I got the Rockport without red onions or masago although the jalapeños were overpowering so maybe I'll skip that next time. This place is like a Chipotle for sushi lovers and I'll be back to try something else!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! I've been craving sushi burritos for a long time since I tried the sushiritto food truck in Cali. I think Jaburrito is close maybe even better than sushiritto. 
I ordered the Rockport, it was soooo good. My favorite part about their sushi burritos is their flavor. There is literally so much flavor inside that burrito. I love whatever sauce they put in there. 
Their soft shell crab was delicious, and their spicy tuna was fantastic. I don't like my tuna too spicy, so it was the perfect amount of spice for me. I also like how you can either have seaweed or soy paper for the rap. 
The place is pretty small, and their place was packed and I went in around lunch time.   They have only been open for a few days and it's already this busy, that must mean they are really good. 
It's a very clean place and the customer service is really nice. There isn't a lot of chairs/tables to sit in so hopefully when you you try this place grab a table quick.
But overall it was a great sushi burritos will definetly go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here like 3 times in the same week. I get the long beach every time I go just without the tortilla strips. Its basically like a spicy tuna hand roll and its very good. Their ginger is also some of the best I've had. Only downfalls are their hours (not open on Sunday, last time I went) and the long line... It took us 30 some minutes from entering to check out which is understandable since they're still fairly new and we did go during the lunch rush. People also take a long time to order since its kind of like subway's set up so that kind of is annoying but what can you do?"}
{"text":"#obsessed #obsessed #obsessed 

Restaurants and cafes in Vegas are always so heavy with their entrees - it's either burgers, steaks, sandwiches, etc. Maybe it's because they know we're drinking, haha. Well, sometimes it's nice to find a place that servers small, healthier, fresh food options. The poke bowls and sushi burritos here are a lighter choice. Their portions are a bit smaller, but their prices are cheaper too. 

This was my first time having a sushi burrito and it was amazing. It was a lot of food. I saved one half of the burrito for later. There's not really an entree that's better than the other. It all about what kind of fish you like. I got one with raw salmon (about $11). 

If you love sushi, this place is a must-try."}
{"text":"I work at the Linq, so with that being said i get a half hour lunch break. I've come here twice and both times it has taken around 18 minutes to get my sushi burrito. There are usually 4 or 5 employees working at a time, but only one is making the food. One time I went and they took care of their friend's order before mine. Food is good, but I will go to the other locations in town and not waste my time and money here."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the sushi burrito (I know I'm a few years late). I didn't want to fall into the gimmick of paying more money for something just because it now comes in a different shape / form. Plus some places are stingy and will give you a tiny portion. Not Jaburritos! I shared the Redondo (ahi, salmon, yellowtail) with my boyfriend and was surprised by how full I got just eating half. The fish was fresh, and I was able to taste it in every bite (so it wasn't just a bunch of fillers). Not bad for $13. It's essentially the same price as a specialty roll.

We also ordered the sushi cupcakes. It came with 4: crab, smoked salmon, and 2 spicy tunas. The \"cup\" part is fried wonton skin, and the \"cake\" part is the seafood and rice. Pretty good, but a little too much sauce on all of them, so it was quite heavy. But kudos for creativity. Not sure how comparable other sushi burrito places are, but this was a great first experience!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Lots of sushi and veggies for the money. Large burrito-style sushi and veggie creations wrapped in seaweed wrap or tortillas. Or in bowls. Fusion of sushi and Mexican food. Great ingredients and sauces. Really personable owner. Definitely will be back when we visit town again."}
{"text":"So this is probably going to be a bit unfair but this is one of the few places I have been that it is really easy to compare it to one of their competitors (Soho Sushi Burrito).

Went here twice on my most recent Vegas trip.  Loved it!  Fusion places of sushi and Mexican are combining two of my favorite things.

Created my own burrito both times.  Got the taro chips and cheese too each time.  The biggest complaint I have was the taro chips really ended up being broken up into pretty small pieces.  Otherwise everything else was really good.

Since this is almost identical to Soho I had a direct comparison.  I thought Soho was slightly better than Jaburritos but Jaburritos has the convenience factor!"}
{"text":"This place was life changing. Raw, fresh sushi IN A BURRITO!! Geniuses. Omg. It's a really cool place for a quick bite. You pick out what you want and what kind of paper you want it wrapped in. It's like a hand roll out of control. One is def enough per person. Upgrade to the meal and you get a drink, soup or edamame or a few other sides. DELISH! We went twice when we were there in July. Can't wait to go back!! It is located in the Linq Promenade across from Sprinkles cupcakes. So much to do down in that area- don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the long beach bowl with mixed greens for $17. The bowl was delicious but this is pretty pricey for a salad."}
{"text":"Better than I expected! The sushi burritos actually seemed bigger than ones I've had in the past. Price is ok considering location. 

The fish was fresh and the burrito itself was great. One of the alcoholic drinks I had were.... ehh. Not the best, I ended up only drinking half. I forgot the name but I'm sure it was a red alcoholic drink. 

The service was also good and friendly, which is always nice. The burrito wasn't very filling, but it was satiating."}
{"text":"Was a little bit skeptic in the beginning but this place proved me wrong. The staff is fast and helpful. Choices were awesome. Prices are reasonable considering they have big serving."}
{"text":"I was in town and wanted to try one of the sushiburrito spots that have popped up recently in the area. Jaburritos is near the Linq on the strip, and was super convenient for lunch while we were walking around. The staff were all really helpful with what to order and the food was delicious - fresh fish, and great amount of topping options. This is a nice alternative to poke (which you would have to travel off the strip for), especially when you've been drinking and want something easy to eat (without a fork, lol)! I would definitely come here again the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Loved the huge sushi roll in nori.  Fast food Japanese that's quality.  Friendly and near the Ferris wheel.  Hopping pedestrian mall."}
{"text":"Love love love! I'm somewhat a sushi connoisseur....it's obviously not a thing close to traditional sushi, but their rolls are AMAZING!! It also beats the prices of regular sushi restaurants because you get much more food for your money."}
{"text":"Decided to pick up lunch here to give them a try again.

Laguna Sushi Burrito - This had a spicy kick, but seems there were two flavors that were trying to overpower each other. Also, pretty small burrito this time.

Sake Sangria - Did not taste good too me. No!

Still a fan of the taro chips."}
{"text":"Just flew in, came down the LINQ promenade, In-N-Out Burger was like out the door, so across the way was Jaburritos. Walked in with my party, line was considerable short, just a few ahead, but gave us enough time to look over the menu and choose what's for dinner.
The restaurant doesn't seat a whole lot but about 8 large tables(at least 4 seaters) and an outside patio sitting. When we got up the cashier worker to order, the man was kind and made small talk while making   final decisions. I asked for recommendations, and he was kind to offer his opinion and trends and likes among customers. We were given numbers, which we took to our table, where the food was brought out to us. There was a condiment bar, that was well stocked: wasabi, soy sauce, ginger, etc.
The food was amazing (had already started drinking prior to that sooooo... that may be a weighted statement.) but the crunch and flavor did not disappoint. I don't believe I ran into an issue during my visit at Jaburritos.
Oh, and price was acceptable, not outside of Vegas, but for being right on the strip, downstairs from a hotel inside the promenade, yah prices were acceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing, wasn't sure about the concept until the burrito touched my lips! It was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"No complaints here! Staff was awesome and the food was great. 

They barely just opened about 4 days ago and said that they don't have their juices available yet because they're still getting things set up but that wasn't a huge problem.

I ordered the mission and baja sushi burritos and they didn't disappoint. The yuzu guacamole was my favorite on the mission and gives the burrito a nice zing!"}
{"text":"I'm not jumping for joy. I really thought I would LOVE this place but I didn't.

First, it's small inside, maybe 10 tables. No big deal but it sucked when we went because it was hot inside. It was like eating a meal inside a backpack. The \"burritos\" were good. They had a great flavor however, it was a snack, not a meal. My husband had a Ja-burrito and I had one and we shared a drink....$24. YIKES!!! And we were still hungry afterwards 

I would rather just get all you can eat sushi somewhere else and get my monies worth. I'm not returning."}
{"text":"I've tried the rest and Jaburritos is by far THE BEST and now they are open at the LINQ!!!! We were there to go try the new In n Out burger but we saw jaburritos had opened so we gave it a try instead and I'm glad we did because it was amazing.    I had the Laguna with the shrimp tempura and it was so good.   My wife had the Redondo and she loved it.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's an amazing mix of sushi and Mexican! Highly recommended for a quick, different lunch. Close to the strip but not in the craziness of it"}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a friend who raved about the sushi burritos here so, when we were staying nearby, we knew we had to try it.

Due to my previous experiences with sushi burritos, as well as raw fish in general, I had a few fears going in.

Fear 1: The fish is low-quality. I have a sensitive stomach so, even if my tongue can't decipher between good fish and bad fish, my stomach will let me know. Thankfully, I did not react to the fish in these burritos!

Fear 2: Sushi burritos that fall apart as soon as you start unwrapping the paper away. I was so pleased when these ones stayed in tact through the last bite.

Fear 3 (this one applies to all food): The flavor is lacking. Here, the Long Beach and Laguna were both great picks for sweeter sushi cravings. We also accidentally received the Mission (we didn't realize we got the wrong burrito until we got to the hotel room), which was closest to a traditional burrito in flavors and ended up being a lot more enjoyable than we expected. My personal favorite was the Rockport, which had the expected sweetness of seafood, but was also spicy and savory.

Thanks to Jaburritos for crushing all my sushi burrito fears! Next time we're in town, I can't wait to try a different burrito option, as we had really great experiences with all the ones this time."}
{"text":"Every time foodie fest comes in town I always go to the sushi burrito truck asap. I'm so glad a sushi burrito place is finally here. It was pretty busy when I went, but soooo worth it. 

I got the Huntington burrito. It consisted of ahi tuna, lettuce, onions, jalapeño, cucumber, tortilla strips, and seaweed salad. Extra extra ahi tuna and extra poke sauce for me . 5/5. I scarfed that burrito down. No ragrets. 

I also got the taro chips. Sweet and salty goodness with a cheese dipping sauce. 

I can't wait to go back again and try everything else :D"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a place out here to serve \"sushi-ritos\" and I am SOOOO glad we finally have one now! JABURRITOS delivers and it is no surprise since the mastermind behind SOHO Japanese is behind this place as well. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi burrito. Yes please. Pricey a bit. But to be expected. It's Vegas baby! 

Hermosa Beach or Huntington Beach I forget which it was. It was a beach named Sushi burrito. Came out good and fast. 
Ate it twice as fast. Its not big to fill you up but deff enough to get you by for an hour or two especially if your walking the strip. 

Ice Cream accross from themfor dessert 

Enjoy and Stay Wild!"}
{"text":"I came in late one evening looking for something healthy to eat after some gambling and fun in Vegas. Found this in the LINQ Promenade and decided to try it out. I got the Redondo bowl and it was delicious. It had a good amount of fish and not too much rice as some other places do. The wasabi mayo was very good and the jalapenos added a nice kick. It was the perfect amount of food and I left there satisfied but not over stuffed. The service was very good and my food came quickly. I hope this concept comes to Dallas soon."}
{"text":"Honestly delicious. Finally got to try this place! Im a cali girl that loves sushi so it was a must to try it burrito style. Sushi is expensive on the strip or just not fresh so i was hesitant. I got the Long Beach burrito and its enough for 2 people. Its literally a spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and crab roll all in one, bomb.com 

Also another plus the miso soup is great and super cheap! ($2.00)
Ill definitely come back the next time i visit LV."}
{"text":"I had the Long Beach and it was phenomenal! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious! Their chips and queso are amazing!!!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After having the Redondo sushi burrito   I am now convinced after all these years that there is a god."}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi burrito and options. Located in the LINQ promenade Jaburritos cranks our delicious sushi burritos and bowls. The preset menu has many options and variations of combos. Service was fast and friendly and I recommend to anyone is search of a quick meal."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! I was surprised of how big they were. I ordered the Kodiak and my boyfriend the Rockport, and they were both incredible! If ever in Vegas again, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really great food and a wonderful staff that is welcoming! I got the Long Beach and the flavor was great. The fish tasted fresh and filling! I liked the little touch of having hand towels to wash hands with at the table."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good considering I discovered this place when the foodie fest was in town and I had Jogasaki. I was in search of sushi burritos and so thankful I found a place and close to my work! Just wish they would add lobster sushi burrito rolls to their menu."}
{"text":"Great little spot on the promenade. We got the Long Beach burrito I think. I love the tempura shrimp! Crispy and yummy in the burrito. Service was friendly and accommodating. Nice little snack!"}
{"text":"I was at the  Linq and all of the food options were either fried fish or hamburgers . JABURRITOS was the ONLY healthy place there . The menu was a lot easier to navigate than other sushi burrito spots . The burrito I had \"the redondo\" was delicious . The staff was friendly and the modern space was clean. If you're looking for a healthy option on the Strip then this is the place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a restaurant that says it's open until 12a on Fridays but tells people they are closed at 11:56p and turns you away will get a 1 star from me!  
Bad form JaBurritos...bad form indeed!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a sushi burrito. I loved it!!
Located in the promenade, right across from sprinkles. 
I had a burrito with salmon, tuna and albacore. 

-the restaurant was clean
-the staff were all very friendly and patient for a first time customer with a food allergy and lots of questions. 
-they have a food allergy menu which lists all ingredients separately so you know what you can order. They list gluten free options, and also have tamari as an alternative soy sauce option. 
-price is reasonable considering the quality and freshness of the food. 


After drinking and not feeling so great from the night before, it's nice to be able to find a light and healthy option."}
{"text":"Solid sushi burrito. I don't know why Yelp categorizes this as Mexican because it's not. It's not just fish, but It's basically like getting a giant sushi roll. I had the Redondo, which was quite delicious.

The restaurant's soy sauce and \"wasabi\" were pretty weak. They both come in packets and pouring it on your food is kind of difficult.

I enjoyed my experience there overall and would go back."}
{"text":"I should've reviewed as soon as i finished eating but i was in a hurry to watch Backstreet Boys concert 

But anyway, im back. I was actually surprised there was no line when i came on a saturday evening. Everybody was so busy going to it's neighboring In and Out burger they missed out on such good food right here. Place was pretty clean and there was adequate space for their guests...but let me get this over with and jump to my sushi burrito experience

I went ahead and ordered two from there best sellers. First was the Long beach which was oooh so good! First bite was heaven! Sushi was fresh and melty, sauces were rich and flavorful and my oh my was the seaweed wrap amazing! So fresh almost like they just got it right out of the ocean aahaha im over exaggerating but what the heck! Next one i got the was the Rockport since i wanted to try something spicy. It wasnt very overwhelming at all which was good. But i just had to say although it was good, Long Beach still stood out for me.

I had a really positive experience for my first sushi burrito and i just wish they'd have a few more stores open in other states say new jersey or new york perhaps? I hope they take that as a hint"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a craving for sushi/poke this is my go to place. I have had everything from the bowls to the nachos to the sushi cupcakes. My favorites are the Long Beach, Rockport and Venice."}
{"text":"I came here tonight and was pretty happy that I did ! 

They just opened 12 days ago they stated! I came in approximately at after 7pm for dinner after my work day . The line was fairly long - I must have waited 15-20 minutes ! 

I ended up ordering the Long Beach - Sushi burrito ! It tasted amazing ! The fusion of flavor was there ! There is spicy tuna in it but it's not too hot ! In addition, the chipotle mayo adds flavor ! I definitely well come back ! 

I give them props on that machine that rolls the sushi into a perfect roll and the utilization of IPads at check out ! Also they had 5-6 people behind the counter working !

Down side - they need more tables - business is booming! Their juices on the menu weren't available yet and let's Market more friends ! The food is amazing you can market your product more ! I loved it and many more will and do too !"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come try this place out after hearing about it from friends. For now, I will have to give them 4/5 until I come back again. I for sure will definitely give them another try since I find it very interesting.

I know it shouldn't count against them, but the contributing factors of the rating was the name. On Yelp it was called Jabburitos when it fact they just did a recent name change to SoHo SushiBurrito. It was very confusing driving around the lot trying to locate it with my friend.

Walking in we were greeted by the platoon of workers standing behind the line. Very impressed with this because we got our order from start to payment in no time. The ingredients were fully stocked and nothing seemed out of temp or dated.

I ordered the Triple S (previously known as the Rockport) -  soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab. I enjoyed watching my burrito being made. 

But once the novelty wore off, my stomach took over. I enjoyed and appreciated the freshness of the ingredients. The spice level was perfect for me. Not too much but definitely packed with enough heat that it didn't over power everything else. Nothing worse than having the heat ruin the taste of the other components in a dish. After eating the burrito, along with a cup of their salted edamame, I was left with a feeling of wanting more.

With my mind set on something else and finding out that the restaurant was closed, Jabburitos was my second choice. I will however give them another fighting chance and come back to try the other incarnations of each dish as you can build you own bowl, burrito or nacho."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place and it didn't disappoint! We came in and the guy asked if we've ever been there and we said no so he explained to us how the whole thing works. Basically, it's like chipotle/subway where you can create your own or choose one made up from their menu. I got the rockport without tobiko and subbed cream cheese instead and my husband made his own. They make it right in front of you and they're really friendly and patient. There wasn't too much rice on the rolls and they were pretty hefty with the portions of the proteins and toppings. We got the combo with our meals, we got the seaweed salad and the taro chips and dip. The rolls were really good! My husband said he couldn't taste the sauces too much so we'll have to ask for extra next time. The sauce for the dip was also in a very tiny cup so it was kinda hard to get the chip in there lol. We got too full so we didn't have any room for mochis. Each of our burritos had like 3 types of proteins in there so they were a good size. The place itself is nice, I love how bright it is in there. They're also trying to be eco friendly so that's cool. I'm glad this place is right by my house so I can get my sushi fix whenever I get a craving :D"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place, so I decided to give it a try. I had the Redondo and the Baja. Out of the two, I prefer the Baja. The spicy tuna gives it flavor and the tortilla chips add texture. The Redondo was just too bland and mushy. I also noticed that the pricing on the printed menu differs from the one on the board. I was told that the printed menus were made prior to opening and they have since adjusted. The workers were nice but still trying to get the hang of things. Overall, the food wasn't bad I wouldn't rush to come back."}
{"text":"If you like sushi and don't wanna break the bank on the strip, you gotta check this place out. Super casual and affordable. I got the hot saki complimentary for checking in on Yelp and it was filled to the top.  The spicy edamame and miss soup were only $2 each and very tasty. Good portion size for the main bowl and great quality."}
{"text":"OH EM GEE!!! Sushi burritos?! get at me. 

I am a sucker for a saucy, crunchy, fresh tasting sushi roll - with a lot going on. I love tempura and eel sauce and avocado - and tuna and salmon and the list goes on and on. This becomes a bit extreme on a roll because they end up being gigantic (and never mind the cost). BUT Chef John Chien Lee solved my problem! THANK YOU MASTER! 

Jaburritos is such a winning concept. It's like the Chipotle of the Sushi world (but better). 
Pick your wrapping - soy or seaweed - (i opted for soy) and then decide whether you'd like a concoction that has already been perfected or if you'd like to take a stab at your own creation. I went  with a modified Rockport - which had soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo and sweet anguilla sauce. I said nah to the surimi crab and added avocado and salmon. Enter - my perfect roll! IN A BURRITO! It was so freakin' good. 

These are like a giant hand roll of everything you could ever desire. The thing that makes these so legit though -hands down- is the quality. Nothing is mushy - the rice is cooked perfectly, the fish is fresh and firm. It's a high quality roll in a beautiful blanket of burrito-ness. 

I'm really hoping for an expansion to San Diego because the two places that tried their hand at this concept have failed. PLEASE CHEF LEE - HELP ME OUT!!! 

I promise if you love sushi, you'll love this place - and you'll crave it...often...like all the time. Like every day. ugh."}
{"text":"I don't really crave food like I used to, but since I went to Jaburrito with my friend Ife I've been obsessed with it. 
Jaburrito's thing is sushi burritos. For those of you who don't enjoy raw fish they do have chicken, steak and cooked fish. They have burritos that have names or you can just create your own. Which I suggest you do. You can also make it a bowl or nachos. 
It's an assembly line situation. You go down the line and tell them what you'd like in your burrito. What I like in my burrito is I start with the traditional seaweed paper and sushi rice. For my protein choice I pick raw salmon and tempura shrimp. Next, you move onto sauces. If you are unsure of a sauce you can always ask to sample it. I like the poke sauce and the chipotle mayo. Last, you move on to veggies and things. I like to add guacamole, cream cheese, cucumbers, and roasted corn. Jaburrito has a super sweet machine that presses the burrito all together. That's it! You have a fabulous and tasty burrito.

I wish they had a location closer to me, but it's so good it's worth the drive. If you like sushi and burritos Jaburrito is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"My last dinner in town was at Jaburritos on the Linq Promenade.  Jaburritos is a Chipotle-style fast casual restaurant specializing in sushi burritos that is a small, local chain that just started up in Las Vegas.  It wouldn't have even occurred to me to give Jaburritos a shot had it not been for an Uber driver earlier in the week that had talked it up and gave me a coupon for 10% off my bill.  While I'm frequently skeptical of Asian fusion, my curiosity was piqued since I certainly hadn't seen or heard of anything like it back in Ohio.

Jaburritos followed the Chipotle model of ordering and paying at a counter then the staff working assembly line style put together your order while you wait.  The dining room wasn't large, but there was seating if you chose to eat in.  Jaburritos must have struck a chord with other diners, because the place was jammed and there was a line out the door at 8pm on a Monday night.  The line moved at a good pace.  Once I got to the counter, I ordered the Redondo sushi burrito combo (Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, cucumber, Masago (fish roe), red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeño, cilantro, and white sushi rice with a wasabi mayo sauce) wrapped in soy paper (+$1 supplement), which came with a choice of side and a fountain drink.  I chose the seaweed salad.  You could also get your sushi burrito wrapped in nori (seaweed) or in a flour tortilla, or served in a bowl over lettuce or rice.  The different sushi burritos were all priced under $15, which may seem pricey, but the quality of the fish was truly sushi grade, the ingredients were fresh, and the quantity received was definitely in line with its price.  I was very pleased with my order.  The fish possessed vibrant colors without a hint of fishy smell.  The wasabi mayo sauce had the potency to clear the sinuses.  Taken as a whole, my sushi burrito was nicely balanced in its flavor.  However, I think if you're looking to keep it light, the nori or soy paper wraps are your best options.  My only small (very small) critique would be that the size of the seaweed salad that comes with the combo seemed a bit undersized, which wasn't too big of a deal since I came for the sushi burrito.

Jaburritos was a very pleasant surprise and solid way to end my vacation.  It's a concept that seemed pretty crazy at first, but I have to admit that it really worked!  My experience was made all the better by the friendly, upbeat, and patient customer service I received.  Jaburritos is a place that I highly recommend for a totally satisfying meal for those that are looking for something familiar, yet completely different."}
{"text":"Basically a sushi roll that isn't sliced up. I was surprised by how good it tasted. It had flavor a crunch"}
{"text":"Damn guys, the portions are just really small for what you pay. And I feel like there were so many components that the flavors got muddied and overpowered the fish. If you're feeling like one of those sushi rolls that's stuffed with lots of crazy wingwang and then tempura fried and drizzled with two kinds of sauce, Jaburritos might be just what you're looking for. 

I usually end up at Poukei over in the Planet Hollywood mall for a sushirrito or at GoGo Poke at Fashion Mall, which IMHO gives you the best deal on the strip for poke."}
{"text":"Beat the crowd! 
We are first timers here. Wasnt sure how to order but the friendly staff and owner was there to make sure everything went smooth. Just 5 days open and the crew did an A+ job!

Ordered 4 Jaburritos. And all of them were delicious! 
They have a few different pre-selected menu items but if you want to create your own they have that option too. 

Definitely going to eat here again!"}
{"text":"It was like I died and went to fast food heaven.  

Burrito Sushi????  Sushi Burrito????  Either way it was AMAZING!!!!!!

I got the REDONDO - 
PROTEIN: Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail
SAUCE: Wasabi Mayo
INGREDIENTS: Cucumber, Masago, Red Onion,Tortilla Strips, Jalapeño, Cilantro

Now I had a choice: tortilla, soy paper or nori.  I went for the nori.   Fresh fish perfectly seasoned and cut (not shredded into mystery fish).   Not too much rice.   

The side of seaweed salad fell very short and was spendy.   

They have build your own options.  Pick a 
PROTEIN (or serval), then pick SAUCE (Asian flavors to guacamole) then pick FRUIT/VEG/SPICE then pick what you want it wrapped in.   Not in the mood for wrap, have it in a bowl.   

There is no doubt the next time I'm in Vegas this will be my first meal, maybe my second, possibly my third."}
{"text":"First of all, the customer service here is outstanding. We were greated the moment we walked through the door (no other customers were in there until we started ordering, great timing). The cashier was super helpful in explaining what comes in them to the person I was with who has never had sushi and was a bit hesitant to try raw fish. I ordered the Redondo burrito on a tortilla with no onions and it was great. The fish was very fresh and looked higher quality. However, it could have a bit more wasabi mayo to add a little extra spice, no big deal though. A bit expensive, two burritos and two sodas was $35, but what do you expect on the strip, honestly. It's a bit overhyped and I don't know if this would be my first choice for food on the strip, but I'm a bit biased because of the sushi and burrito options back home. I'd definitely recommend trying it if you're in the mood for sushi and want something safe and different."}
{"text":"So I have been to Jaburritos twice now. The first time, I ordered a burrito seaweed long beach, which was absolutely delicious. LOVED IT SO MUCH that I brought my fiance back the second time to have him try the food just a day later. But the second time was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Rice was overly drenched in some sort of sauce (soy sauce?) that seeped through the seaweed wrap, that ended up both wet and soggy, and the entire burrito was falling apart and was a challenge to eat that we picked at it with a fork. So messy and the lack of consistency was such a disappointment. Would have been worth it if it was done right. On the upside, I received a message from Jaburritos regarding my experience so perhaps it was an off day."}
{"text":"The burrito was way too small for paying $13+ for it. Would not recommend. You can definitely find better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"Four stars because of the customer service and the taro chips with queso. They have my favorite Taro chips by far and they come seasoned with something like a seaweed furikake mix. They're amazing.

For my burrito I ordered the Redondo as it was recommended over the Rock one (honestly name just slipped my mind, the one with soft shell crab). It was good, but very plain. The flavor explosion just wasn't there. The quality seemed high, but again, the lack of any exciting flavor really kind of let me down. 

I'd like to try again with different burritos and maybe even the redondo again to see if maybe it was just an off day."}
{"text":"What a great concept!!! No complaints here!!! Exactly what was expected. Sort of a sushi QDoba. Service was great. Food tasty."}
{"text":"A friend of mine dragged me along to this place because she loves it and can't stop talking about it.  I went in with low expectations as it didn't seem like my kind of thing but boy were my expectations exceeded. The sushi burrito was so delicious! I also was initially skeptical of an $11 burrito at a walk up counter as it seemed a but high, but after receiving the product, it was a really good value. The roll is a good size with a decent amount of fish and is very filling and satisfying and feels like the equivalent of eating probably 3 or 4 sushi rolls, so the price ends up being a pretty good value, especially for the Las Vegas Strip. It tastes more Japanese (i.e., sushi) than it does Mexican, but the Mexican fusion elements of tortilla strips and jalapeno and cilantro were just enough to make it interesting and really complimented the fish. All the ingredients seemed really fresh. I love the burrito format for sushi, I think it might be my new favorite thing. I don't write a lot of Yelp reviews but was so impressed by this place... I will be back here as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Mucho oishii! Another great fusion spot! Sushi burritos are nothing new, but Jaburritos is easily one of the best I have ever had. Jaburritos does not make me miss sushi burritos from SF, LA, or food trucks at all! 

The menu is simple: 
1) Pre designed concoctions: *probably the most popular choice if trying for the first time*
2) Build your own sushi burrito, jachos, or rice bowl.

Items tried:
- Redondo: If you love raw fish it is loaded with yellowtail, ahi tuna, and salmon! Not the most flavorful, but flavors can be enhanced with the house soy sauce and extra wasabi! Or salsa from the salsa bar, if that's your thang. 

- Long beach: One of my favorites! It has shrimp tempura, surimi crab, and spicy tuna. The flavors of the chipotle mayo and sweet anguilla sauce puts it over the top!

- Baja: Yellowtail and spicy tuna. Good, but not great. I only sampled this. I think it needed a second flavor profile. The yuzu guacamole alone did not have the oomph. Maybe a salty/sweet element was missing?

- Jachos with ahi tuna and toppings of your choice! Imagine the set up like Chipotle or Subway. 

- Taro chips with queso. So addicting. The whole idea of \"cheese\" is weird at first, but totally works! Love that these chips are dusted with furikake!

I love the high quality fish, house made sauces, fresh ingredients, and nice touches like the crunch from the tortilla strips!  

Workers are friendly and have a great attitude. My initial visit, they were less efficient and still working out the kinks. Second visit, was much improved. I would imagine it would only get even better with time. 

Be prepared to wait, but so WORTH it!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a quick bite.
Usually I order different types of fish tacos. They are very tasty. And once I've tried burrito was not bad but I prefer tacos."}
{"text":"First time and some of us got the bowls and some got the wraps. Lots of great options. Food is fresh, the sauces are delicious and the workers are friendly. Will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I wasn't sold on the idea of Sushi Burritos and for the first time decided to try it out. I had the Long Beach but couldn't bring myself to do it with tortilla so opted for Nori, I loved it!! It was delicious. It's a bit pricey but to be expected when hanging on the LV strip. It's a great alternative to burgers, dogs, and fish n chips."}
{"text":"My second time here! I really enjoy the location in the promenade since I usually stay at the Flamingo Hotel. Their menu is simple, you can choose which kind of recipe you want. From there you can get choose if you want it in a nori burrito, tortilla burrito, or in a bowl. I got the mission sushi burrito in nori, my fave! It has salmon and an avocado cilantro sauce."}
{"text":"Fast casual. That's how I roll. 

Jaburritos is located at The Linq Promenade, almost towards the back by The High Roller. It is across from In-N-Out Burger & close to Ghiradelli.

I wanted to try a flavor profile that was the most unattainable at home. So I picked the Waikiki($9). Go figure. The irony on that is too funny.

I also upgraded to soy paper ($1) since I've always wondered what that tastes like. Turns out soy paper has no flavor. If it did, the sushi burrito ingredients overpowered any kind of soy flavor. The texture is like a thinner version of flour tortilla. Not bad but I think I'll stick with nori in the future. 

All the ingredients worked well together and while the amount of chicken was plentiful, the veggies were skimpy. I love my veggies so that was small kind disappointing. 

Still, it was a very good meal. I could even taste the sushi vinegar in the rice so they got that down perfectly.

Combo your meal with taro chips & queso with drink for $3.50. It's the best combo option on the menu.

4.5 Stars Rating Up."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Sure flirt with a customer for 15 min and don't acknowledge the other behind her... This place was filthy and empty but I gave it a shot. Not only did the employee have a nasty attitude towards me as I ordered, but my sushi burrito looked sad. Presentation was like a 1st grader's art project. Will NEVER be coming back to this spot. Nasty food, poor customer service, over priced for a 1 star joint. Never again. Just don't guys."}
{"text":"I usually don't review right after the first visit but this place blew me away! I didn't expect my sushi burrito to be that good! I ordered a DIY jaburrito with salmon, ahi tuna, with wasabi mayo (yum!), romaine lettuce, cilantro, and pico de gallo on soy paper: it was delicious! The ingredients were fresh and the burrito wasn't dry like I would expect it would --- for some reason. I think the wasabi mayo did the trick and the rice was cooked perfectly in its sticky sushi rice condition. I can't wait to go back and try their specials!"}
{"text":"Great thing about this place is that it is familiar. SOHOs Chef John is running this new gem and i believe its a great concept to having a place in las vegas that has sushi burritos. Ive had them before but nothing like this. So weve had the Redondo and the Rockport which is my fave it was so good i had to order 2. On the second one i even added shrimp tempura to like totally stuff the burrito. It was definitely worth it. I can see myself eating here at least once every couple weeks just because its a little far from my house. Other than that its so good!!!"}
{"text":"Cool concept place just outside the LINQ.  We had dinner here before heading to the High Roller.  We tried one of the burritos with the traditional seaweed wrapping (they will also use a tortilla) and we had a bowl as well.  Everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"Great concept with great flavorful food!
Everyone is very helpful helping you figure out what to eat. 
More or less it's like a giant sushi roll."}
{"text":"This place made me debate opening a similar restaurant on the East coast, as there's nothing comparable there. I highly recommend jaburritos"}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi cupcakes, which sounded amazing. I have allergies, so don't do rice. Asked for no rice and the manager refused to make them without the rice. Didn't even care to ask why i was requesting. So, although I paid the same price and it would have actually been one step less for them, the answer was no. If they had cared enough to just even pretend like they'd humor me and consider my request, they would have received 5 stars. The Sushi was delicious but it was a pain trying to pour the rice out and eat the wonton \"cupcake\" base and the sushi from the top without getting any rice. Please care at least a little about your customer's requests in the future."}
{"text":"After watching the show \"O\" at the Bellagio we stopped in to have a late meal. I had the summer special Acapulco bowl. It had flavor and the jalapeño had a strong kick, washed it down with Asashi beer. It was extremely tasty and satisfying for the sushi crave."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of raw fish, but I am a big fan of soft shell crab, so I had to try one of their sushi burritos when I saw one with soft shell crab.  I ordered The Rockport burrito wrapped in seaweed and my boyfriend ordered The Redondo burrito with tuna, salmon, and yellowtail wrapped in flour tortilla.  I checked in on Yelp and got my free Hot Sake, which I couldn't finish, because I then realized that I do not really like sake hot.  We both really liked our burritos.  They were a decent size, and was fulfilling, but not enough to stop us from getting a cookie ice cream sandwich from the cupcake shop nearby, although I was tempted to try their mochi ice cream.  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"I got the veggie sushi bowl. It was with fake meat (veggie tofu meat).  It was interesting.  Flavorful.  Priced reasonable considering the restaurants on the strip are overpriced.  If you check-in on yelp-you get sake! I got the queso and chips-I wasn't a fan- It tasted like it was watered down or had fish sauce in it."}
{"text":"I  this place.  It's the perfect spot to grab a quick lunch, and it's very refreshing, especially in the summer.  The staff here has been here for as long as I can remember (2years?), and it has been a consistently high-quality and fresh experience every time!  The ONE thing that I would change is to offer fresh pickled ginger and wasabi on request.  They have packets, but they are nowhere nearly as good.  It's very forgivable and not worth the loss of a star!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about a giant, customized sushi roll you eat like a burrito? Also, the nachos are a delicious and unique experience I highly recommend. Only real downside is the seating is tight for such a popular place."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas this place is a must go. My boyfriend and I still talk about this place. We came in and got the best sushi burrito we have ever had. The flavor the texture everything was so good AND you can sit there and watch them make it. It's like a subway for sushi burritos"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! So fresh and the service was great!!! My wife and I both love it and we will come again on our next Vegas trip #SushiBurrito"}
{"text":"I ordered their Kodiak burrito which is grilled salmon with mango teriyaki and Chipotle mayo sauces. It was delicious! I got mine without the cream cheese. It was very filling even thigh initially I thought my sushi burrito looked small. It was a great lunch! I'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"This is like the Chipotle of sushi rolls. You pick what form you want: rice bowl or sushi burrito. Pick a wrapper: soy paper or nori. Pick your rice: white rice or brown rice. Pick a sushi burrito concoction or create your own. Pick your sides: taro chips or edamame. Do you want extra protein? Pay extra. They also have tofu as a protein source.

I tried the Kodiak with brown rice and fresh salmon. This normally has grilled salmon so, the fresh salmon was extra. The fish quality was good.

The create-your-own option is neat. The combinations you can make...oh, the possibilities!

The restaurant is tiny with only a few tables. I'd recommend taking your food to-go because of the lack of seating and you'll end up smelling like cooking oil. The service is great though. The price per sushi burrito is about $9. You can get tiny sushi rolls/maki from other restaurants for about $8 but a sushi burrito is roughly 2-3 times bigger than a maki."}
{"text":"I loved their food! The line was super long, but definitely worth the wait. I will make this a regular place when I crave for sushi"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas a lot but many times I find myself eating by myself. Staying at the Linq, there is a small street w tons of restaurants. JaBurritos is located here. I've been here fewer than 24 hours and have been here twice. Awesome sashimi and sushi burritos and even chicken for those sushi-challenged. 

I highly recommend JaBurritos"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go on a spontaneous trip to Vegas just this past week and stayed at the Linq hotel. Of course, being the foodies we are, the first thing we did was look up places to go eat. He came across this place and thought it looked promising and also convenient since it's located right outside our hotel. Neither of us had ever actually tried sushi burritos so we were both pretty excited to try it.

The have a poster outside of all their menu items which made it easier to read all the descriptions before going in to order. We decided to share (we wanted to try out more food places after) the Redondo burrito ($13) with no red onion and spicy mayo substituted instead of the wasabi mayo. Upon walking in, we were not greeted and I actually had to say hi to the girl at the register first. We made our order which was quick and easy and sat down at a table. 

The food came out pretty quick but the guy kinda just threw the tray down on our table and left without saying anything so I thought it was a bit rude. The burrito was better than I expected, the fish was very fresh and tasty. However, I should've just stuck with the wasabi mayo. I thought it would be too overpowering but my bf and I both agreed that it needed that extra kick. I usually don't like wonton strips but it did add a nice texture and these were a bit different and better than the ones I'm used to.

Overall, I enjoyed the food quite a bit. However, I thought the service needed some help. The only person that was friendly to us was the guy that said bye as we were leaving. I also think it's pretty expensive for what you get. I expected the burrito to be a bit larger but it is what it is, and it's Vegas after all, everything is overpriced lol. If I ever do come back, I'll try out the bowls instead since I think it's probably (and hopefully) a better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"A friend asked me, upon seeing the requisite social network check-in, how it was. My response is rather topical, but best captured by comparison to the New York City subway rat absconding with a slice of pizza.  The pizza, a giant sushi roll of tremendous quality.  The rat, you.  It is the best day of your life. I hope to die this way."}
{"text":"I love Sushi and burritos.. so why not have both? After I heard about this place I had to give it a try! I got the Long Beach seaweed and the BF got Rockport seaweed. Both were in the same price range ~13$. While I was expecting the Long Beach \"guest favorite\" to be an explosion of sushi goodness it was really just okayy.....don't get me wrong the ingredients were great but I guess I didn't like the combination.
Long Beach ingredients: Spicy Tuna*, Shrimp Tempura, Surimi Crab; Sauce: Guacamole, Chipotle Mayo, Eel Sauce, Romaine Lettuce, Cucumber, Wonton Strips. It could just be my taste preference but it was kinda too sweet for me that I lost my appetite!
The BFs choice l, however, was spot on!! I thought the Rockport (soft shell crab) was amazing! I would recommend it to anyone who likes sushi. I will definitely come here again to try other items and I feel like it's was a great price for the amount."}
{"text":"I ordered the Redondo burrito like so many other Yelpers and it was fantastic.  I was watching them make the burritos and they put so much in them that even though it comes out small it is very hearty meal.  I also ordered a side of miso soup which had huge chunks of tofu in it.  The staff was extremely friendly and my food came out fast.  The price was very reasonable and there was a lot of seating both indoors and outdoors.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Walked back here from Linq 30 minutes before seeing the Divas show and it was definitely worth the speed walk! The Mochi Ice Cream is amazing, especially the Green Tea"}
{"text":"Fresh foods, good food professional & friendly staff, clean surroundings and not too pricey sushi place... i like coming back here..."}
{"text":"My friend and I were not impressed. Bland and tasteless bowls (Redondo and Acapulco). Sake was good. Cashier and waiter were wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is going to be the next Robertos of sushi! I've seen this concept done in SF and LA but they have a unique twist by incorporating a few subtle Mexican flavors.  Most of the other places have been pretty much just Japanese flavors.  I'm always a fan of fresh ingredients that I can pick up on the go.  Definitely healthier options than your normal fast food or burrito options.  Pretty much all the basic sushi roll ingredients you can think of(salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura, egg, crab salad)...I would like to see them put eel into the mix as well in the future. And for the non seafood eaters, they have chicken and steak. I like that they have tons of fresh veggies you can add and seaweed salad.  The tortilla chip option also gives it a nice crunch to the rolls.  They also have chips, I wish they had a wonton chip nachos with a mix of fishes/crab, eel sauce, etc.  Lol....if the owner is reading this...I've been dreaming of a place that would serve nachos like the ones at Samurai Burrito in Fountain Valley, CA ;). They were quite the money maker there...I have no doubt it would be similar in Vegas.  They have a plethora of interesting unique sauces to pair with all the rolls.  They also have a thicker house made soy perfect for topping the burritos, as well as the normal pico de gallo, salsas, wasabi and ginger. Quick service, large burritos, reasonable prices!  This is truly fast food sushi heaven."}
{"text":"Omg yum!!!I will be eating here everyday!  I loved the Rockport Bowl and the Toro chips with queso is bomb!!! I'm so happy I work next door!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi cupcakes looked great and tasted great! Love the concept. Definitely worth the walk from our hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The space was nice and clean. Will definitely visit again next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Love the concept. It's basically a sushi hand roll packed with fresh fish and a fun combination of sauces and toppings. I got the Mission, which was salmon and ebi shrimp wrapped in white rice. Came with a yuzu avocado cilantro sauce, wonton strips for a nice crunch, lettuce, and pico de gallo. It had a mild spicy kick to it. You can choose to wrap it in nori, tortilla, or soy paper. Definitely a great portion for lunch.

It's located in the Linq Promenade, right across from Sprinkles and In-N-Out. If you're looking for something different, you found it! :D"}
{"text":"I went through the line and ordered the \"mission,\" one of their \"signature\" burritos. The employee then tried to charge me extra for EACH INDIVIDUAL item normally included in the burrito on top of the normal $8.99 price. So this was turning into a $18.00 burrito bc she was trying to charge me twice for everything that was listed on the menu. She made a huge deal out of it and called her manager and pretty soon every employee was crowded around staring at me. And then the manager backed up the employee. So I walked out and they lost a customer. 

Too bad, because I was hoping this would be my go-to place, since I work nearby."}
{"text":"Here for lunch for the first time.  Glad I got here early because it's packed now and takes a while to understand the concept.   For instance,  I thought it was all build -your -own until I sat down and saw the flashing menu.  Tip to the owner - slow down the flashing screen.  Doesn't allow time to really read.  Anyway,  back to the food that I devoured.   I ordered soy paper, spicy tuna, salmon, fish eggs, wasabi aioli, cucumbers and pico.  Glad she told me about the combo so I added miso soup and a drink.   All up and in $13.  Not bad for the freshness and quality.   I'm definitely going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Sushi burrito..  Interesting concept but even cooler in person!!  It's just a really HUGE sushi roll!! 

You can opt for a normal-ish burrito -depending on the extras you decide to add. And they have tortillas.  So fear not, non-adventurous sushi people. 

I made my own, with the nori rice- which is a nice thin layer. Got some shrimp tempura and some random stuff in it, but the seaweed salad was the best part! 

Prices are reasonable considering the prices at a normal sushi joint are about the same or more for a smaller portion. 

We also got the queso and taro chips. Both of which were pretty good. 

We left feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed and with a good feeling in our belly that it wasn't a greasy, oily, heavy meal. 

There isn't too many tables, I'm sure on a busy night during the dinner rush it can get pretty busy. 

We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Hungry for sushi and have limited time.... This place... Stop looking on Yelp and come here. Sushi Burrito"}
{"text":"After seeing a bunch of delicious-looking sushi burritos on their Instagram page, I added Jaburritos to my list of places to visit when in Vegas. It was a great option for a quicker, casual, less-expensive meal (or snack if you share one) in between activities on the Strip. We actually visited 2 days in a row because we enjoyed it so much. We opted for the Long Beach for one visit and the Redondo the 2nd day -- both were great! Fresh-tasting fish and tasty/unique flavors with the sauces and other ingredients and a decent portion size! 

Coming from Seattle, we have a bunch of poke places that offer sushi burritos too but for some reason, I thought these combinations were more unique and interesting. Customer service was friendly and we never had to wait very long in line. We'll definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Quick and easy for lunch or dinner. It's any way you want, sushi style, bowl, even cupcake. Plus sangria sake!"}
{"text":"sushi burritos ... say whaaat ??? 

JABURRITOS hit the spot for me and the fiancé tonight.  Craved sushi but didn't want to go to a busy sushi restaurant.  I've seen places like this in Cali so I'm happy to see they've finally brought it to Vegas.   

All the guys working there are super friendly and they will help you out if you have any questions about the menu.   

The ordering is similar to chipotle/subway where they make it in front of you.  
The fish is fresh and they are generous with the condiments.  You can choose to customize it if you'd like or opt for a salad instead of a burrito.  If you want to \"make it a combo\" it includes a drink and you add a side salad, chips or, mochi.  The side salad was seaweed and I was craving cucumber salad, which they didn't have but the chef gave me some sauces to make it ... awesome ! 

This place isn't quite on my side of town, but I definitely would recommend others to come here to get your SUSHI BURRITO FIX !"}
{"text":"This place is great! I usually go to their other location off of 215 W & Rainbow and am so happy to find out they actually have one near my work! They give you a discount if you work on the strip which is a huge plus! :) I always get the Malibu Bowl and add seaweed salad, ahi tuna and shrimp tempura. It always hits the spot for me! Don't forget to get the taro chips too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  What a surprising and delicious way to serve your favorite type of sushi.  They offer salads, bowls and burritos  (wraps) with your choice of sushi. It's similar to a Subway sandwich shop where your selection moves down a food assembly line whereby you may choose your fresh ingredients. At the end of the line, they offer an array of sauces to top your meal.  

There is a shirt learning curve to understand the menu but we'll worth the brainpower."}
{"text":"Amazing fusion of sushi and burrito. You have to try this. Their sake sangria is nice, but you can pass for its price."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. Such a fresh concept. This is where I will go if I crave sushi but don't want to have a whole sit down dinner for it. The fish is fresh, the ginger is yummy, and the prices are decent. There's a cool rice pressor machine to give you a thin layer of sushi rice in your jaburrito and another cool roller machine to make sure your roll is nice and tight. 

The only thing is the rice pressor machine is the limiting factor. The wait a quite long for a process that should be pretty quick. 

Today we tried the Rockport and Redondo. Go for the Rockport! Its so yummy! Flavor is great and spicy too. Redondo is good for you sashimi lovers as there is fresh chunks of fish. 

Also, service is great. They are nice and explain things if you don't understand. My fav sushi chef, nunu, which transferred from Soho is here too! Makes me sad that he's not at Soho, but that's OK."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! They had a great menu with different options. The sushi burrito we got was very fresh and tasted wonderful."}
{"text":"Hot and new, Jaburritos lived up to the hype on our first visit for dinner last night.  

I created my own Jachos with taro chips, ebi shrimp, crab, guacamole, pico de gallo, and had the nacho cheese on the side.  Wow, those taro chips are amazeballs!  I could have eaten another serving and plan to very soon.

The b/f created his own Jaburrito with salmon, ahi, brown rice, and chips and was also tempted to get another creation, but the line became super long as we were eating our first go-round.  Word is definitely out on this place.

Sometimes new spots disappoint because those expectations become unreasonably high, but Jaburritos did not; we'll definitely be back sooner than later.

*TIPS:
Our party of six arrived around 6:15pm on Tuesday night and we were lucky enough to snag a table for all of us.  However, it wasn't too long before the place got packed.  It's new, so patience is key.  Check out the menu online so you have an idea of what you'd like to create or try one of their own Jaburritos."}
{"text":"This place was pretty bomb. It's mainly sushi with an attempt to make it mexican-esque like adding jalapeños, guac, red onions, etc - which I think is weird with sushi, but I guess some people are down for it. They had selections to choose on the menu so you don't have to choose yours from scratch. I got the RockPort one, and it was so good! I told them to take off the jalapeños cuz it's weird. I also should've told them to take off the red onions and add avocados. 
It was funny cuz the guy who checked us out said \"for go\" all nonchalant instead of \"for here or to go\". Haha! Also, they have Asian drinks you would find at the Asian market next to Jarritos! It's so odd to see those together.

Other than that, the place was clean and a modern design.

Just a suggestion for the store: It would be nice if they had like classic rolls like California roll, caterpillar rolls, dragon roll, etc in a burrito form. That would be so much better."}
{"text":"I ate the Long Beach burrito wrapped in seaweed...... WOW!!! So amazing this is a must try!"}
{"text":"DO NOT! I repeat, DO NOT eat at this place.

Went here yesterday upon arriving in Las Vegas and decided to try out this place at the Linq Promenade.  Hubby had the chicken burrito, I had the tuna, yellow tail rice bowl.

Food was tasteless, mine had half of it rice with minimal raw fish (it was warm too - that should have been my first clue) and veggies.  Worse of all, you couldn't open up the small packets of wasabi and ginger even with your teeth.  No scissors on hand to open up the packets.

Both of us ended up with diarrhea.  We were suspicious initially and decided to give it a chance.  We should have followed our 6th sense.

DO NOT EAT THIS PLACE unless you want to make friends with the John."}
{"text":"I love sushi. I love burritos. I love sushirritos. Jaburritos had great flavor and it was conveniently located right outside our hotel. I thought they had great flavor and fish was fresh. I'm looking at the online menu at pricing now and I'm not sure how I ended up spending over $30 for just 2 rolls. Their prices online are very reasonable; you can easily spend $15 + on 1 roll elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food here is a little bit expensive, but super delicious! I really enjoyed the delicious flavors and how big the burrito is. I wish they had more of these around."}
{"text":"At first the burrito looked almost too small for me. But it is pretty filling. I was really full after eating the whole burrito and the side of taro chips. The sides are extra 50 cents so it's definitely worth it! Sake sangria is pretty strong fyi."}
{"text":"As a fan of the other Jaburritos location, when I was grabbing dinner in the Linq I had to get my poke bowl craving satisfied! This location is definitely different - better interior decor and instead of going down the line to build your bowl or burrito, you place an order at the front of the line and they do the rest. 

I did a build your own bowl with ahi tuna and a variety of toppings on brown rice. The toppings were all good and fresh, but the tuna left a lot to be desired. Parts of it were frozen!! Ummm. No thank you! It put me off from wanting to finish my bowl. 

The one employee I spoke with was really friendly and patient since I didn't realize they do things a bit different than the other location. This location was clean and had a lot of tables. 

It's good, but I'll take my tuna without the ice. Hopefully other options are less frozen."}
{"text":"Such delicious food and decently priced considering you are right on the strip. The Long Beach sushirrito was probably my favorite thing on the menu and it is definitely one of my favorite. Everything is so fresh and tasty and it feels great on your system. It's definitely a must if you are looking for something delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 10-17-15 around 4:30 PM with my new yelp friend Jamie P.  This restaurant is located in a small shopping center on Sahara just west of the 15.  David's Bridal, McDonalds, and Landry's are in the same area.  

The line is set up kinda like Subway...you pick whether you want nachos, a burrito, a bowl, or a salad, and then you can choose between their signature burritos or build your own.  I got the redondo which is Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Cucumber, Tobiko, Guacamole, Red Onion, Tortilla Strips, Jalapeno, Cream Cheese, Lettuce, Avocado, Cilantro, Wasabi Mayo, with Soy Paper ($11.84 after tax).

They have an awesome machine that rolls the rice onto the nori/soy paper.  A sushi machine! Never seen one before.  Fancy-schmancy.  

Honestly, I don't even know how to review this place because...well...I don't like sushi.  THERE.  I SAID IT.  I've tried, really.   I want to like it so bad because it's to beautiful and hip!     

Like Manami S. noted, the assembly line was chaotic, with the guys reaching over each other and reading the recipes off a piece of paper.  The same guy asked me twice about somebody else's burrito, then the cashier tried to charge me for the person behind me.  My burrito was missing the cream cheese and the onion.  Mildly irritating but understandable in their first few weeks of opening. 

The place was crowded and there's only seating for maybe 20 people so we took our burritos over to McDonalds and ate them.  I got about five bites in before I gave up and gave my other half to my new friend.  If I ever go back, I'll stick to the white girl options like the waikiki (chicken) or the boardwalk(steak)."}
{"text":"WOW! Beautiful and yummy! So good, we can't wait to come back!!!! The sushi cupcakes are unique and tasty! Fun little place to enjoy the promenade!!!"}
{"text":"We got the Rockport and the Redondo, both were good but we especially loved the Rockport.  We would definitely eat here again!

The sake sangria was also pretty good!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are becoming quite the thing in Vegas; between them and poke places, there are an abundance of options around. I've had the item at a few places, and my point of reference is Yoshi Burrito, the first place at which I had the dish. That is, for me, a four out of five star place. This is a three, because I think there are a bit fewer options, the burritos are a bit smaller, and overall, the accompanying flavors less compelling than that of Yoshi. It's not a bad place, and if you're in the area, you certainly can do much worse, but overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Kodiak\" flour tortilla roll. It was very good but I really wanted to try a raw sushi burrito and wish I had ordered something that was such. The menu is very limited though. I wanted to go back and try again, and see if I could do ala carte. They did not make my order correctly (asked for -pico +cucumber) which bummed me out, but the \"roll\" was still VERY good."}
{"text":"These sushi burritos are very good.   There's a very nice selection and I like that you can choose what shell you want and that you can get in it bowl form.   I liked how easy it was to get substitutions as well. 

The service was pretty good.   I like how they get you whatever you like and even refill your drinks. 

They were a little busy when I came in and the table I sat at was dirty but I did notice they cleaned once they had less customers in line.
 
The only thing my boyfriend griped about was that price but hey it's on the Strip and it's fish and restaurants will always charge top dollar for that."}
{"text":"I love anything with raw fish so I decided to give this place a try & see what all the hype is about. 

Atmosphere - Really clean, simple setting restaurant. 

Menu- Easy to read with lots of options. 1) you could either customize your own burrito 2) pick a roll that's already customized. 

Food - I got the redondo and it was delicious!! It came with tuna, salmon, and yellowtail (Fave fish). 10/10 they always make their own soy sauce which was more on the thick side but really good!!

Would definitely come back here again to try everything else!"}
{"text":"I had such a great first sushi burrito experience here! The ingredients were extremely fresh, staff were friendly & efficient and the food was delicious! The portion sizes are somewhat on the smaller side but definitely still worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday evening for the first time and the first bite immediately put me in a trance. Literally didn't want to speak and just wanted to enjoy every glorious flavor in each dreamy bite. Try the Long Beach with soy wrap! I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes.  So bomb!  My friend from Seattle told me about this joint and to check it out for her. This led us to a little hidden spot next to Palace station.  Line was fast.  Service was quick and kept us entertained.  They really loaded our burritos up.  And it was soooooooo delicious.  We had The Long Beach and Redondo each cut in half for sharing.  Would recommend to anyone who loves sushi.  Great minimalistic modern interior as well."}
{"text":"Great experience both times I went. They make the burritos right in front of you and you can either choose from a menu or make your own, which I'm not ballsy enough to do. The location is slightly awkward and they get busy quickly with not that much seating to accommodate. But their product is worth it, super fresh, delicious, and filling. Their home soy sauce is perfect, and I recommend their taro chips and queso to go with that burrito. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decor: 5/5
-Decent amount of seating and availability depends on time of day
-I love the succulent plants on each table

Service: 5/5
-Simple setup. Order at the counter, pay and wait for your food
-I wish you can create your own burrito

Food: 5/5
-I went with the Laguna burrito. I'm a lover of unagi and shrimp tempura. Think of jaburritos as one extra large roll. Compare it to the cost of a regular roll and this is actually a pretty good deal. I would definitely come back to try their other rolls
-Ginger and wasabi come in packets. Don't have high expectations"}
{"text":"Found half a rubber band half way through our sushi salad bowl... manager responded, \"sorry, but you ate half of it already\".

Wow. 

Even absent the abysmal ervice (3/25/18), or the choking hazard salad, this is pretty pathetic food. Wilted greens, lukewarm fish, more or less a health inspectors wet dream."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Super clean facility
- Friendly workers
- Yummy burritos
- Modern interior decorations

Overall,
This place was a good stop during a day out around the strip. I think we came around maybe early afternoon (11-12, not sure), but it wasn't busy so I can't give you customer service review at their busy times. It was a little pricier and smaller than other places I've been too, but I think they packed the inside really well, so you do get a lot. I've had my share of sushi burritos and this place has 2 thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Very friendly, fast, and tastes really good. The sake sangria is excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The bowl was one of the best I've had in the temporal shrimp were great. The blend of crab meat and shrimp with the brown rice was really perfect."}
{"text":"This place is not closed just a name change from Jaburrito to SoHo burritos. New kids menu and most same items from Jaburrito just renamed"}
{"text":"Sushi, burrito, my oh my I'm wearing a speed-o.  Not really.  This place is so awesome.  My wife got a bowl and I ordered a burrito.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  I also ordered the miso soup that was packed full of tofu.  It's a little pricey but the location in Vegas it's no surprise.  I was happy to pay the price and give this place a shot.  I really hope they franchise everywhere.  I would hope folks in the Midwest would embrace this!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for sushi burritos, and this place delivers.  At first, I was a bit skeptical coming here, but only because this place is located in the Linq Promenade.  Sushi on the Strip in a shopping center walkway?  Lord, help me.  But since I've been here a few times, I think it will become one of my quick lunch Vegas staples.

The last time that I came, my dining companion and I shared the Mission (raw salmon, sushi ebi shrimp (special butterfly shrimp), yuzu avocado cilantro sauce, cream cheese, pico de gallo, won ton strips, and romaine lettuce) and the Redondo (ahi tuna, raw salmon, yellowtail, wasabi mayo, cucumber masago, red onion, won ton strips, jalapeno, and ciltantro) burritots, both wrapped in seaweed.  You can choose either the burrito or bowl options.  Both options were STUFFED with big chunky pieces of fish.  Make sure to stock up on wasabi paste and soy sauce, and you've got it made!

The service is quick and friendly.  I've never had to wait long for my food, and since I'm usually starving, I cannot wait to munch down on some tasty fish and fixings!  And the portions are huge.  You could probably get away with sharing a burrito with someone, but this is Vegas, so no sharing allowed! (at least, in my book).  Go big or get the h-e-double hockey sticks outta here!

The sake sangria is an interesting accoutrement for your burrito or bowl.  Sweet enough to balance out all of the fusion flavors, but not too sweet to wash away the Mexican/Japanese wonderfulness. Get the pitcher to get more bang for the buck.

An excellent, healthy-ish option that will keep you fueled up for the day of Vegas debauchery."}
{"text":"Incredible food, with vegan options! Reasonably priced! I had the Laguna bowl and it was delicious. Better than eating fried food (not that I don't love it occasionally), and I loved watching them make it in front of me! Chipotle who?!"}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh. Service is good and they open until 11 pm. People were still ordering and eating in the restaurant at 10:57 PM and the staff did not rush them to leave which was good. The restaurant is clean and it also has a small outside seating. They sell sake margaritas and beer as well. Overall, this is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's just call this place great and skip all the other fantastic things I could say.  Just go eat there and be happy

P.S.- try the Rockport on nori seaweed paper, thank me later!"}
{"text":"This place does not live up to the hype. We were so excited to try this but It was so underwhelming. The flavors and ingredients just don't belong together. I ordered the Acapulco with double salmon instead of tuna and just wasn't happy. My burrito had more sauce and lettuce than anything else and It really overpowered the entire thing. 

The three others in my group ordered bowls and were significantly disappointed as well. We hardly ate any of what we ordered and I ended up deconstructing my burrito to try and salvage some of the fish. We won't come here again, but at least we tried."}
{"text":"Seeing the ratings, I expected to be amazed. My guess is that the customers consist of people who live out of state and never had a sushi burrito/rice bowl. I got a sushi burrito, and it was the tiniest thing ever.. Not a lot of rice (which isnt a bad thing), but boy were they stringent on the sashimi and other ingredients. Gobbled it up in bites, and the entire thing cost $13. Granted,  this is vegas, but even ignoring the cost, I've had much better in LA that were loads fresher and more satisfying."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. There was no line & my food came out super quick. All of the employees were super friendly. I got the Acapulco burrito which was amazing but also extremely spicy. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"first time at this place and surprisingly good! customer service was great too:-)"}
{"text":"So impressed after my first visit! I saw a pic posted that I had to try- 
Sushi cupcakes are awesome! They are a limited time menu item, according to the sign. 
You'll get 4 to an order- two spicy tuna, one smoked salmon, one crab. The tuna was my favorite. They tasted so fresh, and the presentation is pretty awesome. 
This ingenious sushi idea is served in a cupcake tray! The cupcake \"toppings\" include cream cheese and guac. Each one is a good sized serving, and all 4 are pretty much a meal. They have plenty of seafood in them as well. 

This store at the Linq promenade was not busy during my Tuesday at 4 pm visit, and service was quick and friendly. I'm not sure if the cupcakes were premade, but I would guess not. My wait was minimal, and the entire restaurant was clean. Before I left, I told one of the employees how much I enjoyed the meal, and he gave me some coupons for next time! Score!"}
{"text":"Really good my husband got the burrito which was huge and I got the cupcakes! Two spicy crab ones and two spicy tuna. Liked them both but loved the tuna one better. Husband said the burrito was soo good! I recommend this place to everyone !

{"text":"This is the sushi burrito of my dreams :D 

Think \"Chipotle/Subway-meets-Japanese fusion\" and you'll get the gist of this place.  They have large sushi burritos, bowls and salads, with your choice of different fresh fish (spicy tuna/ yellowtail/salmon/soft shell crab/ etc) or chicken, veggie toppings, and sauces. And it's all prepared when you get up to the counter in assembly-line fashion. Much like Chipotle, some add ons are extra like guacamole or seaweed salad. The sushi rice, for a semi-fast food place is great! And the quality of the fish is pretty great too!  

I had a make-my-own sushi burrito in a soy paper wrapper on sushi rice with spicy tuna + salmon + cucumber + red onion + tomatoes + seaweed salad + chipotle mayo + sweet anguille sauce. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I ate the whole thing in one sitting ( a little big but sushi doesn't keep well).  I got a combo just to try the taro chips with cheesey sauce...meh, I'd skip that next time. 

If you don't want to think too hard, they do have jaburritos already concocted for you with names like Redondo & Long Beach (California dreaming much?). 

My only complaint is that this place is kinda slow....or more so that during lunch time this place gets incredibly packed so get ready to wait in line for a while before getting to order. There is also very limited seating. Otherwise, this might become a very regular lunch spot for me :P"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty straightforward guy. I like sushi, I like burritos. And I love sushi burritos. When all of that is factored, everyone knew that I'd be a fan when Vegas finally joined on the sushi burrito train. This place is good, really really good. Which is why it's a 4.5 star from me. The location is nice, across the street from palace station, it's very minimalist and clean. I've gone here so much the staff even remember me and my order. My top two favorites by far are the long beach and the Baja. If you want to go off menu, that's totally fine because it's a create your own burrito type deal , so throw on your crown and have it your way boss. One thing that sets them apart from another sushi burrito place is that they are definitely more dedicated to fusion. They have more traditional burrito items so it doesn't always just feel like sushi to go. The lines can get long, but I can't penalize a business for being too popular. They definitely could improve the ordering system. It seems to get slow at times, and I'm not sure if that's just a product of new people or what, but maybe call ahead ordering would be legit. Burritos are legit and worth the price"}
{"text":"I love this place! We were skeptical about sushi burritos but we both loved our burritos and the sake sangria cocktails were fun. I highly recommend if you're in the area and are a fan of sushi."}
{"text":"Big ol' sushi rolls the size of your face? Yes, please. 

I came in during their first week and I opted for the select your own option. I chose salmon, soft shell crab, cucumber, yuzu guacamole and tobiko. The staff was new and just learning, but patience was key and they were really trying to learn.

They let you try any of the sauces and add anything on the side if you prefer. I was impressed by how friendly and accommodating everyone was and I look forward to giving them another try soon. If only they were closer to home."}
{"text":"Sushi!? Burritos?! Whaaaat?!
I was super excited to find out that Vegas finally has a place with the concept of sushi burritos so I definitely had to check it out. I love seafood, so it took me a while to decide on one of their choices, but I finally settled on the Rockport ($11.25) mainly because of the soft shell crab along with some sweet anguila sauce and wasabi mayo on the side. You also have a choice of getting it wrapped in nori dried seaweed... and a couple others I can't recall because I like nori. I wanted to get a smoothie, but they said they're focusing on the food for now so it'll be about another week until they start making the drinks. That's reasonable.

So, how's it taste? I was a bit sad about the overall size and amount of rice that was put, but it was pretty good. My choice may have hindered me from tasting the quality of fish that they have to offer since the soft shell crab is mainly crunch and the spicy tuna is already minced. They have quite a bit of sauces and even a little salsa bar on the side so I definitely recommend trying some additional sauces. I don't think the salsas would go well with the sushi burritos, but try them out with the nachos (or \"Jachos\")

I wasn't wow-ed my first time going, but the owner and other employees seem eager to grow and improve everything which is great! I'll definitely be back to try other things and see how they decide to improve the food.

...I'll also be back to get that mango smoothie I wanted to so bad ugh."}
{"text":"This place was so good! The service was awesome! I was impressed that the staff checked on us to bring napkins and refills. I definitely recommend people check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place from when it was originally located on Sahara, (now soho burritos - different sushi burrito / bowls restaurant though oddly in the exact space). I've been to the rainbow location as well as the closest to my office on the strip located at the linq with coworkers Ive enticed into joining me. It's so good I've had orders delivered via Postmates on occasions as well as take out as it is not close to my home, and the quality has remained top tier on all orders. 

I am a sushi lover who would probably splurge on AYCE weekly if I could.. and in between those weeks when I crave delicious fresh fish, these sushi burritos and bowls get me by! haha it's usually around a reasonable price for what you get. 

My favorite rolls are the usually the spicy options and fortunately for me this place has two options to choose from. My go to two are the Redondo and Acapulco - because of the habanero lime sauce, but usually, the ingredients in the Redondo wins, because of the - as my coworker calls it the \"holy trinity of fish\" salmon, tuna, yellowtail.  I find these ingredients to really compliment each other, I also find the amount of wonton crunch contributes to the overall flavor and not just as a filler for a lack of fish or other pricier toppings. I also enjoy the fact it has masago - which I love with tuna, and usually have to pay extra to add in most places. Nothing is overpowering of another which I find some places can overdo on the spice or sauce to where I can't taste anything else, but the jalapenos and onion give it that spicy kick I crave. Occasionally, I get a side of habanero lime sauce used included in the Acapulco roll, that just takes it to another level of spicy goodness, but it might be a bit too spicy for some if you're not big hot sauce / chili. It is also filling with a side of seaweed salad and miso, which tastes pretty good, not watery or overly salty like its straight out of a machine though it might be.. Speaking of salty, I find the sauces used to also be pretty good though I like a bit of soy sauce with wasabi too, I don't think its a must as these rolls have a good variety or sauces and flavorful already. Lastly, the sushi cupcakes - an original of this particular sushi burrito/bowl restaurant in LV - I have not seen elsewhere, are a must try, they are all soo good, its like a mini sampler of their ingredients on the rolls, you get a bite-sized burst of flavor, which might even be filling on its own as it comes with 4 total.

If you're at the link or on the strip, I highly recommend trying this place if say Yardhouse, Brooklyn bowl, and In-n-Out are too long of a wait, as the service here is usually pretty quick and the quality has been good thus far for the price. Their employees have been friendly, polite and run a smooth production in both locations I've been to. I will continue coming here as usual, hoping the quality remains. 

Side note: as a designer, I had to give a shout out for their attention to detail, as I appreciate their updated branding - thought its probably not as important to most people as is the taste and service just wanted to include as some of us deisgners might subconsiously be swayed by menu layouts or silly things like that. haha, anyway enjoy and bon appetite!"}

{"text":"Saw on vegaseaters.com that Jaburritos was coming to Vegas and couldn't wait to go try this restaurant! I love eating sushi and they did not disappoint! The prices are fair and the fish was fresh. We tried the long beach, rock port, & janachos with redondo special. I'd definitely recommend my friends to go here and will be coming back as a frequent customer."}
