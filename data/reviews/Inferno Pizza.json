{"text":"Decided to try this place. Looking for a place to order out from.  Pizza was good the first times, but then subsequently the cheese was always browned/burned and rubbery. The whole wings were great a few times, but that faded quickly...... arriving not cooked and even completely raw inside once.  We called, they apologized, but didn't make it right.  The steak hoagie and fresh cut fries are have been good.  That changed tonight though. We called and they said they would make and deliver a new one.  We even repeated the order.  We held our other food and waited an hour for the correct hoagie to be delivered.  It was wrong too!!!  Is it that difficult to make a steak, cheese, mushrooms, onion hoagie with and a little mayo? Called to let them know it was still wrong and she wanted to be get an attitude and be rude to us. Really???? Absolutely  NEVER AGAIN!!!!! At this point we would give them no stars if we could."}
{"text":"The food here is awful. We got bread sticks and they were sitting in a puddle of melted butter/ margarine. And the pizza didn't taste good either. Their pizza isn't cooked on a stone but rather a conveyor belt oven so it's soft and lacks the crisp of a well made pizza. Will not return here."}
{"text":"Um, well, I would like to say that I called Inferno in advance to inquire about whether they serve fish since giving up meat for lent.  I was told they have a lent menu but only serve it on Friday's BUT they would make it for me even though it was Sunday.  I was gracious since my husband wanted to stop at the brewery next door and these two establishments have a partnership where you can order from Inferno and they will deliver your food to your table, or vice versa, you can grab a growler at Fury and take it next door to eat with your pizza.  Now being the kind of establishment that they are (wings and pizza type of joint)  I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but I guess I did expect better than I got.  Because I was making a special food request I couldn't just order from the counter at Fury, which you can if you are ordering off their standard menu.  So I walked next door to the entirely empty restaurant to place my order.  I don't really eat fried food but again giving up the meat really limits my choices at this establishment, and I certainly wasn't feeling a salad.  They have a lent menu with about four different dinner options, all fried.  There were three different size fish sandwiches and a fried shrimp dinner.  They all came with coleslaw and fries.  I knew I would be just giving the fries to my husband and assumed the smaller of the fish sandwich would be adequate for me.  I also ordered a small pepperoni and sausage pie for my husband.  She asked if I wanted to any tarter or hot sauce and I said yes to the hot sauce.  They charge you $.50 extra for the sauce.  I'm not trying to sound cheap but come on, it was a cheap hot sauce to begin with that I bet you could buy the whole bottle for $.50.  My total was $24 and change.  I tipped a couple of bucks for they delivery service AKA walking it next door to the brewery.    After I returned my husband and I were enjoying our drinks but I began to notice the girl from next door coming in several times with food for other people.  This was going on for about 25-30 minutes.  Then I began to notice people who came in well after us getting food delivered and we were still sitting there.  At the 45 minute mark I asked my husband to walk next door and check as I was almost positive at this point that they plum forgot about us and our order was either dying in a window or never started.  He came back to report it will just be a few more minutes.  What?!    So within a few minutes she appears (what a coincidence) and states something about timing, I'm honestly not sure what her excuse was as I was more interested in if we should be expecting cold food.  She exclaimed no everything is hot and fresh.  At that point she left.  SO the food.  Well they gave a huge portion of fries with my sandwich.  Enough fries to cover a paper plate and they were heaping.  My husband said the fries weren't bad, but not great either.  Mediocre.  My coleslaw was a little bland, but let me be honest I didn't expect much.  Now onto the fish.  Ugh well it was a long piece of fried cod.  Not a very thick piece though.  And it was served on a massive hoagie bun that was way too big for this piece of fish.  It was easily two inches thick each side of the bun.  I wasn't into eating a pound of bread so I tried dissecting the bread.  I hollowed out the bottom half and sliced off about an inch and a half from the top half, then tried to cut the fish into two pieces to stack it on the bun I made.  Well the fish kind of fell apart, and the breading was pulling away from the fish. Not the best quality.  It had no real seasoning or flavor so I used my expensive hot sauce and lemon to try and help it along.  It was just kind of dry and a tad greasy.  I was hungry so I finished the fish.  For my first fish fry of the year I have to say it can only go uphill from here.  My husband was also not enthralled with his pizza, but I'll let him yelp about that.  One star is too harsh, especially considering they did accommodate my special request and offered me a menu they usually only serve on Fridays, but with the excessive wait time, the price, and the lack of quality and flavor of the food, I just can't go three.  We will eat in advance if we visit this brewery again."}
{"text":"This was a LOUSY outing for Pizza, wings, and loaded fries! With a name INFERNO, you would expect some fire, a real stove or such, but as it turns out, a conveyor/toaster oven pizza instead which is equivalent to pizza out of a box from any grocery store! The wings were to come out first, but all the goofing off in the kitchen that we could hear over the stereo was likely due to wings taking 40 minutes! Then they come out whole! How about cutting the wings down and throw the tips out as that part is in poop all day when the chicken is still living. We were like cavemen eating these ridiculous whole wings. The loaded fries were almost the save of the day, fresh cut fries, real bacon, but then topped with fake cheese out of a can! Pepsi suck products only! This was VERY DISAPPOINTING!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I typically don't write reviews because I am one that understands that things happen. However, this was one that warranted a review. Forgetting items such as salad dressing for my salad, sides of sauce that were requested, and cheese on a wrap that was supposed to come with cheese could have all been brushed off. Being out of onion rings was also ok and replaced with fries. The main thing causing me to write a review is the nauseating fact of find a huge mosquito/bug inside my wrap covered nicely in buffalo sauce. Luckily I noticed the wings of it before I took my next bite. I'm normally one who can find a hair in my food and keep on eating but seeing the eyes of this bug staring back at me right as I was ready to take another bite just did me in! And since I'm already taking the time to write this, I'll add it took a long time to receive our food which was way overpriced. So disgusted!"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to for Pizza in the Irwin/North Huntingdon area.  The cheese is great and so is the sauce.  I ordered the Inferno Fries and it they were awesome as well.  My wife and I have gone here twice just to confirm it wasn't a fluke and the food was consistently delicious each time. One thing to note is that the portions are pretty generous so come hungry."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! We waited over an hour for two small pizzas and never got them! We actually left the restaurant without eating. There were people there before us who had been waiting an hour and 20 mins. They used the excuse short staffed. We weren't even offered an apology or anything. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is good, especially the wings, but delivery is ridiculously slow.  Last two times it took 2 hours to arrive when we were told it would take an hour. It's our favorite pizza place that delivers tho so we just plan for how slow it is."}
{"text":"Love the food and service here! The buffalo parm sauce is the ABSOLUTE best sauce for wings and chicken. I even dip my fries in it.. lol everything is super here!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday in lent and the place was packed. We ordered a pizza and fish sandwich to eat in. I went to get a couple of beers from Fury brewing 2 doors down. We drank those and still no food. My wife went and got more beers, we drank those, still no food. An hour later, our food finally showed and the pizza was wrong. We ordered a seafood pizza with no onions and it came WITH onions but no tomatoes or mushrooms like the menu says it should. When the waitress finally came back to our table, I told her about the mistake and she said they would remake the pizza for us in about 10 minutes. 10 minutes to make a pizza after I waited an hour. What ever. The pizza came out in about 10 minutes and had no onions, there were mushrooms but they forgot to put the tomatoes on it. WTF. I complained and she took $5 off the bill and gave us $5 toward the next visit. This place is too busy for their own good. If you cannot correctly make what someone orders then you fail as a restaurant, no matter how many coupons you give out. There are enough pizza places nearby that will make you the correct food and deliver it in way less than an hour. As for the food, it was good once they got it right."}
{"text":"They are now partnering with Fury Brewing.  Great pizza and the Buffalo parm wings are outstanding.  They also deliver, which is a nice addition to the area.  I think they've ironed out quite a few kinks, since first opening."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. First of all, the food just isn't that good- or perhaps just nothing special. We got delivery and it took two hours to receive the food so maybe that had something to do with the final product. The delivery driver said they were sorry and that the manager would call to give us a coupon or something for next time but they failed to do that. Just go to Pizza Marsala."}
{"text":"Should have written this review when basically the same thing happened a few weeks ago but I gave them the benefit of doubt that day.   Ordered food for delivery at 4:50pm and was told it would be an hour for delivery. That seems conservative for delivery during a Steelers game but we'll take it.   Call at 6:17 because we hadn't gotten our food yet. Was told the driver just left and would be there soon.   Call back at 6:35 because still no food. I'm told the driver is out with two deliveries. One in Irwin and one to our house which is in the neighborhood behind Inferno. They have no idea where the driver is or why it's taking so long. I'm offered $10 off my next order.   At 6:45 I receive a call from Inferno saying they spoke to the driver and he's 10 minutes away.   At 6:59 I call Inferno and cancel my order because we still had no food.   I understand it's Steeler Sunday and they were probably busy. But they need to learn how to quote accurate time estimates for delivery orders. Or find out why their driver left the shop with two orders at or before 6:17 and didn't make it to my house within 40 minutes.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Two only because the one pizza that wasn't burned my family liked.  We got 2 large, on coupon.  One pepperoni, one bacon, whole buffalo chicken hoagie, half Italian, order of cheesy fries.  Delivery boy was clean and pleasent.  Very friendly.  The family liked the bacon pizza.  Not a fan of the super huge bacon slices, I prefer a smaller size to spread around better.  The pepperoni I was please to see had the tiny pepperoni that I really like...UNTIL is was seen to be burnt..ugh...ruins the whole flavor.  The Italian hoagie was mediocre, bun was subpar for a hoagie roll and the insides were skimpy.  But then again, all hoagies are judged, in my book, against another local restaurant who's hoagies are always outstanding.  Crust was unremarkable.  No effort made to add any zip...or make you WANT to eat it even.  Son loved his cheesy fries, but come on, they're cheesy fries....with coupon and 5.00 for the bouncy friendly delivery boy bill was 50.00 and change.  The way the hoagie and the one pizza was, it is my suspicion that they forgot to make the bacon one and everything else sat on warm till it was done.  But for a new Italian place trying to make it out here...you need to sent out highly edible product.  AS FOR MY FAMILY, WE'VE SCRATCHED INFERNO OFF OUR ORDER OUT LIST."}
{"text":"Went to the Inferno for the first time last night. I've heard a few good things so me and my friend gave it a try. I knew something was up when the waitress thought it was going to be an iffy experience when the waitress complained they were busy and the place was more than half empty.   We placed our of 2 half hoagies and a dozen wings. I got a buffalo chicken hoagie with no onions. We waited 25 minutes for the hoagies and mine was not what I ordered. It was like a grill chicken hoagie with grilled onions. I would have sent it I back but I didn't feel like waiting possibly another 25 minutes. Flavor wise, it wasn't bad honestly. But it's the principle that the order wasn't right.   The dozen wings were another 15 minutes. Buffalo parm and bacon BBQ wings. The bacon BBQ weren't bad at all. Our issue was with the buffalo parm. They were barely sauced, to point were there was just enough buffalo sauce on them to make them orange. They reminded me of the wings from hooters and they sucked and made me sick.   One of the owners/managers spoke to my friend while I was in the bathroom. She told him the cooks are new, still haven't settled in after being open for a year, they opened with only 1 waitress. It was basically a bunch of excuses. They gave us 10% off the bill but she asked to split the bill, the waitress seriously put a drink and both hoagies on one check and a drink and the wings on the other instead of a drink, hoagie, and a half dozen wings on each. Also a table of 6 that came in after us got their food, ate it, and left before we got our complete order.   This was an exercise in incompetence. The wait staff, cooks, management all felt like they hadn't a clue what they were doing. I want to try the pizza but if it's not good I'll be done with the place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Both times I really enjoyed the food.  I have had many pizzas around the area, and this is hands down one of the best tasting pies you'll find.    And then there's the Inferno Fries.  Let me tell you, if you love spice and heat, give them a try! Amazing!  We dined in.  The set up of the restaurant is very open and utilitarian...which seems to be the norm these days, so no complaints there.  There are big screen TVs on the walls to catch up on sports scores and the like.    If you are looking for a new pizza joint to try in the area, you won't go wrong with Inferno."}
{"text":"When we first went to Fury next door and they told us that we could order food from Inferno when we drink there.  We kept that in mind and months later we came back to Fury and decided to order some food from Inferno.  I like the concept.  You can enjoy your beer at Fury, place your order there, and they will bring you your food.     My wife called ahead to see if they make fish sandwiches for lent season.  They said that they do but it's for Fridays but they would make an exception for us.  That was great and very nice.  I wanted to try out their pizza so that's what I got.  We tried to order at Fury but since we had the special fish request my wife went next door to place the order.  No problem.   The problem was that it took 40 minutes to get our food.  It didn't look like other people's  food was coming out too fast there which was ok but when a couple who got to Fury before us got food before us that wasn't cool.  So I walked over to see what was going on and they said sorry our food would be over in a few minutes.  A few minutes later the girl did bring over our food.  She attempted to explain what happened but I'm not sure what she was talking about.  You can read my wife's review on how her fish was.  As for my pie I got a cheese, sausage, and pepperoni 8 cut pizza.  Honestly it tasted a little under cooked.  It just tasted a little doughy and the meats weren't coming together.  I just ate 2 slices and ate my wife's fries that she got with her fish.  I brought it home for leftovers for the next few days and it actually tasted a lot better once I reheated it.  So I don't know if it was me or it needed done a little more but I did like the pizza when reheated.  Too bad it wasn't done right the first time and we didn't have to wait so long to get our food."}
