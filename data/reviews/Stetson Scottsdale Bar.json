{"text":"So I went in with the family and had a great experience. The food is priced well for the amount you get, I ordered the STETSON Signature Shrimp and it was very very good, whatever is in the green sauce was amazing. My daughter got the shrimp Tostadas. the shrimp was fresh a they gave us plenty. My wife ordered shrimp Enchiladas and those were also very good, if I have anything bad to say it would be that the water refills were a little slow."}
{"text":"Came by for some late night eats. Service was amazing and the place was PACKED with girls from all the surrounding clubs. Can't wait to come back next weekend!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and each time I've had great food. I started with chips and guacamole, which they have to be the best chips I've ever had and obviously homemade. We ordered several things and shared. The shrimp enchiladas with the Stetson green sauce is unique and delicious with a good amount of shrimp. The shrimp ceviche tostadas were made the same delicious tortillas used to make the chips and the ceviche was fresh and light.  I like the environment, light and airy. I would definatley come back for lunch or dinner or for their late night specials."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. The waitress had the worst customer service. She cared about the men and flirting then taking our order. When we did get our food, there was hair in it not to mention I got food poisoning all night and morning long. The manager didn't charge us for the food but the damage was done. Don't eat there. Beware and enter at own risk."}
{"text":"Great seafood. The shrimp tacos are amazing and the Stetson Signature is so unique.  Fun atmosphere and fun people.  Great deal with $3 beers."}
{"text":"This is the best food I've ever had in old town. Really great atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great new place with nice outdoor seating available. Clean and open environment with TVs and nice bar.  Anything shrimp is amazing"}
{"text":"This review is for the night club/after hours situation  We are from San Diego and this was a terrible experience. We got there at 11pm, paid $10 each to get in. Pretty sure they over charged us and were not charging that to ther folks. The bartender had a attitude because I was asking her what flavors of stoli they have. Then she basically ignored us after the first round. Then a gentle men (maybe a barback) kindly asked us what we wanted to drink and told us there was $2 you call its for the hour. We ordered round 2, went to ask for round three, and got charged $7 a drink. My husband ask why, he went and consulted with the attitudey bartender and we were told it was over when there was 15 mins left in the hour. Hold up,  your going to over charge me and then let me sit here and watch you charve other people $2? Thats a terrible way to run a business. You dont treat people like that.  There is too many options in this area do not waste your time or.money here.  The ratch music they play isnt even enough to engage the people to dance the Dj has his own agenda. Your not in business to make your selves have fun people its to entertain others.  I work too hard for mine and my time is go valuable to ever give them another chance. I do not think they will last long any way."}
{"text":"New restaurant worth trying - great location - ordered the Mexican City Street Tacos and gobbled them up. Friendly attentive staff - good service - perfect lunch and happy hour spot before and after Spring Training games."}
{"text":"We stopped by on Saturday June 4, 2016 at 5:30 in the evening. The door was locked and no one was there."}
