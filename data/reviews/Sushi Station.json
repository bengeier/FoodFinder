{"text":"Prices are great, service excellent, sushi is fresh! Great concept."}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple second chances because the food is amazing. The first time I ate here, I was thrilled. I thought I'd finally found my go-to sushi spot in my neighbourhood. Everything was wonderful! The server, the food, the price. Naturally, I came back a second time. 
The second visit was barely a shadow of the first.
I actually watched a waitress spill an entire glass of cola down a customer's shirt. Instead of staying calm and apologizing, she immediately turns around and literally begins to SCREAM at her co-workers for not cleaning up her mess. It was one of the most embarassing and unprofessional situations I've witnessed in a long time. She also happened to be our waitress unfortunately, and she completely forgot about us. I think it took her twenty minutes to bring us utensils and water after we had been seated, even though we were one of three tables in the entire restsurant. She was not polite and generally pretty terrible at her job.The food was still great, so I only tipped the chefs.
The third and final attempt to eat here was the last straw. 
I walk in with my fiance. It's moderately busy but not hectic. The hostess does not greet me after several minutes of standing and waiting patiently. After I ask for a table she waves her hands towards the bar without looking up from her ipad, and says that we can seat ourselves. There was only one seat open at the bar. I ask for a table for two, again she just waves her hand. 
A different hostess walks us towards another table and chucks our menus on it before she walks away. The table was completely covered in the meal of the previous diners and obviously hadn't been wiped down. I left. So disappointed. 
I feel terrible for their chefs. They've permanently lost my business due to their rude and negligent waitstaff."}
{"text":"Fast becoming one of our favorite restaurants excellent food excellent value and the service terrific! Today's sushi selections were extremely oyshi"}
{"text":"Good sushi quality and variety. Also ordering off the menu the portions for sashimi were good too. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars is big for me and I reserve those for sporting events, plays, and comedy shows to name a few. Yet if I did give 5 stars to a restaurant this may be it. I have my favorite dish, Tatum Sushi, and their fresh wasabi is worth $1.75. My kids love to come and feel like they are eating 'like a queen' although my bill, at best, is $40 including tip. With the revolving sushi and ever changing options there truly is something for all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Station twice and have enjoyed it both times. The food is well priced and the conveyor belt adds a fun little spin on the meal. I enjoy that they price each plate color, so you know what you're ringing up and they also have little cards with the name and description of the food beside the plates on the belt, so there's absolutely no confusion. I have ordered a few things off the menu (the Las Vegas roll is so so so good, as is the fried rice) and most recently, my server Tom was excellent and attentive and funny. If you see something on the belt or the menu you like, but want to change something new, they are accommodating and quick. The only reasons this isn't a 5 star review is that it normally takes quite a while to get served and the most recent visit, I sat at the sushi bar and the chefs and other servers were passing plates back and forth between us while we were eating. A little odd. All in all, I really enjoy this place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that this place has gotten such good reviews.  Its fun, I suppose to watch the food going around and around.  I've enjoyed places like this in Hawaii, but for me its the quality at the end of the day that makes or breaks it.  

The quality was horrible.  And I'm not really a sushi snob.  But this was really pretty darned bad.  Every single item that I tried tasted exactly the same.  It was only the texture that changed with each new item, and lets face it...the texture on seared tuna isnt really all that appetizing.  

Yes, it was cheap.  Yes, it could be fun and yes, the staff was very sweet.  But I can't go back...at least not in this town where there is good sushi at almost any corner."}
{"text":"The best thing to happen to this area since total wine and chipotle!!!! Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place three stars because the sushi is ok, but not great. However, I'm just a sucker for the conveyor belt. They do a really good job of keeping it stocked with all of the favorites.  The only thing I don't like is all the dessert options that come by. Nothing against dessert but jello?  
OK sushi, fun atmosphere, terrific place to bring your kids and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This is the first time I tried sushi. I actually like it. And this is the best place to go! Friendly staff and lots of options to choose from. 
If it's your first time to try or if you're a sushi lover, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What a wonderful time we had.  Very fresh sushi made right in front of you.  The prices are VERY reasonable.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, awesome price! We love coming here for the cool atmosphere and unique ambience. It also helps that the food is so reasonably priced. I highly recommend this restaurant for people who are sushi lovers and for people who are just getting into sushi."}
{"text":"We had a fun experience, however, the sushi was not exceptional by any means.  The sevice was very disappointing.  We asked more than once for wasabi.  And then we had to ask several times for a second beer.  I have to say the jalape√±o poppers were my best choice."}
{"text":"I go on a weekly date with a friend  to Sushi Station and have never had a bad meal here!  The staff all know me and most of them have actually made the effort to remember what rolls I like to order!  

     A spin off on the traditional \"Sushi Boat\" style restaurant, this place has a conveyor belt that snakes around the dining room from which you choose different colored plates holding a host of sushi rolls.  The colored plates indicate different prices.  You just stack up plates and they calculate your tab at the end by counting how many of each color you chose.  The prices are SUPER reasonable and they have happy hour on weeknights to boot! 

    They have a ton of deep fried rolls - at which more traditional sushi aficionados would balk - but honestly - with a little bit of spicy mayo - their fried rolls are obscenely delicious! I especially like the Ultimate roll - coconut shrimp, cream cheese with mango, spicy mayo and a touch of  tobiko, and the New Mexico - spicy tuna, cream cheese, jalapeno -rice/sea weed and deep fried.  They do of course have the regular stuff too. If you go on the tail end of a meal, I would recommend ordering off the menu rather than just taking off the belt because I suspect some stuff goes around for quite some time - I just prefer fresh out of the kitchen.  However, if you come at a more busy time, there is more turnover of the food so your chance of getting fresh is far greater.
  
   This place is popular for a good reason.  If you come at prime time, be prepared to wait for a little bit."}
{"text":"I experienced friendly service over the phone. I ordered to pick up. They have great quality sushi and use a lot more fish in their rolls than other places. The pieces of sashimi were large, fresh and a perfect temperature. The pricing is affordable and not just during happy hour. I have only experienced their food through take out. I look forward to dining in the restaurant and trying out the revolving sushi bar."}
{"text":"Very fun way to enjoy sushi and other Japanese dishes! Every table has the opportunity to grab dishes coming by, and they are all priced at $5 or less (although nobody at our table got an item over $3). So, the prices are very reasonable! Our server was also very attentive and friendly. This is a great place to go if you are trying to satisfy your sushi craving!

It's a little set off from the street, so it can be a bit difficult to find. Worth the find though!"}
{"text":"Sushi is not the best but wow can I eat a lot for a little. I like that you can have so many different types in one meal unlike other sushi restaurants where you have to order a whole roll. 
Truth is it is great sushi for the price and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I had previously dined at Teharu, and while I loved the concept, the food wasn't great. Went to sushi station for lunch today, service was great, sushi was fresh and there was plenty of what I liked coming around. The fried Cali roll was amazing. They had fresh fruit, which my baby ate and the server was attentive. The whole staff was kind to us and our baby which I am learning is really rare at restaurants. Sushi station will definitely have our business."}
{"text":"I love this place but I recently visited with my sister and my experience can not be more frustrating. Our server took 30 minutes to come to our table so I could order something. Our server not once came around to check if we were doing okay. The more disappointing part is the fact she's one of the managers there. Another server had to check up on us and we weren't her table. My sister wanted siracha sauce so she asked a waitress for some and she said she was going to tell our server, she never mentioned it to her so I had to ask the waitress that checked up on us and she immediately got it for us. Once I got my food i got the wrong thing, i ordered white rice and got miso soup instead and got charged for it even though I didn't eat it. 
Over all my experience was horrible, I work in customer service for over 3 years and the service I got was horrible."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as I have heard of conveyor belt sushi and it sounded fun. I never realized it meant the same sushi going around and around and around again....as in getting old or cold if supposed to be hot (like the baked mussels). If you truly love sushi for the fish, skip this place. You get what you pay for, and at about $3/roll, that's what you get-most roll options were of the mayonnaise variety or tempura and the tempura wasn't good. The rice wasn't fresh either and I kept wondering if the rolls were a day old already. Too bad."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Friendly people, good food, very reasonable prices. Will not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"Fun place with neat feel, not the best Sushi in town, but everything was good. I would go here again. Just wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi!!! Say hello to the future of foodery! 

I wasn't aware this was a chain restaurant but am very glad the concept is working for them. Japanese-style conveyors shuttle an extensive variety of delicious dishes around the room and you take a plate at your leisure...what's not to like?  

The quality is surprisingly excellent considering the landlocked metropolitan area, and the offerings change by the minute for the more indecisive among us. Classic rolls, specialty nigiri, superb dumplings, side salads & multicultural desserts, just choose whatever plate strikes your fancy and devour!!

Take out is available but the novelty and the fun is lost completely. All-in-all this place simultaneously delivers a great meal and experience, I will gladly return for another round soon. 

Only cons to consider are the sub-par service and the quality of chopsticks, but otherwise a worthy and worthwhile culinary endeavor."}
{"text":"This building has been so many different restaurants over the years and this is by far the best! Went for lunch with co-workers and it was great! Not very much seating but didn't have to wait long!"}
{"text":"Beer was cold, which is great when 108 but got 2 fishy items out of 6. They waved but makes you wonder...
Think the positive reviews are based on price and not quality. Hoping I don't get sick tonight. Guess that's what sake is for!"}
{"text":"Better the second time back.  Service still meh but at least they didn't completely forget about us and there was more sushi variety on the conveyor belt. I still think the prices are a tad too high here compared to some other conveyor-belt places in the valley though. Was just good enough to push it into 3 star range."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and came across this place which seemed kind of a good idea but after we ordered the food it was anHorrible experience with the service and the food isn't fresh at all.. The teriyaki chicken dish was like rubber and didn't seem like chicken at all.. We are never coming here again!"}
{"text":"This place is great - Sushi on a track!  If you're confused by what I'm talking about then you'll probably giggle when you see it!  Basically there is a conveyer belt running around the restaurant by the bar and table areas. As you sit at your table, if something appealing conveys by, you just grab it!  

It's pretty inexpensive and good stuff. 
Portions are small which allows you to try more!!! 

Don't expect anything fancy, because, well, it's sushi on a track."}
{"text":"The perfect cheap sushi! I love the train and broad range of rolls. The sake is cheap and I always go home happy"}
{"text":"Slow svc, some sushi rides the train too long. Overpriced for institutional sushi. Not sure some know what good fresh sushi is."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations coming here since I am used to deliciously fresh seafood in Seattle, and neither did I get surprised. Tuna was pretty \"fishy\" and salmon was not of the best quality, but a still an ok place to go. The edamame however was remarkably good. I was glad to see the low sodium soy sauce on the table already so I don't have to ask for it."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi station for a year or so now. I always get absolutely incredible service no matter who my server is. The food is low priced but incredibly delicious. The atmosphere is wonderful and you can watch your food being made in front of you. I love that the plates revolve around the restaraunt and you just get to grab whatever you want.  This is by far my favorite sushi restaraunt."}
{"text":"It was a busy night, wait was about 20 minutes. I loved just being able to sit and start eating, I've already made up my mind of what I wanted looking at the conveyor belt! It was good. And fresh. They also can make you custom ordered sushi as well. Fun place!"}
{"text":"Typical sushi track..I am always a fan if I can eat immediately when sitting down.  For what it is  - revolving food that's sitting out...I'm headed there whenever I need a quick fix of sushi.  It's also good for my daughter who doesn't want a whole role but wants to try new things.  Good selection, my favorite is the jalapeno poppers which has crab meat and eel sauce. I would give a 3-star instead of 4 if not comparing to sushi tracks but sushi restaurants itself as after a few visits I get bored with the selection and I've had superior sushi at other (non-track) restaurants."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the service is great. It is one of the few sushi places in town with a revolving sushi bar, and the prices are very reasonable. What I found a bit irritating is that they place a sign on the sidewalk advertising Happy Hour at certain times of the day, on days that there is no Happy Hour. It says somewhere on the sign that the Happy Hour is not available on certain days, although the sign is out on those days. So it's certainly not false advertising, just misleading and irritating. I guess there is something to be said for reading the fine print."}
{"text":"Having just moved here from the Pacific Northwest, where these sushi \"track\" type restaurants are as ubiquitous as Starbucks, I actually seek these places out due to their prices usually being very reasonable; I try to eat sushi 3-5 times per week.

I don't ever eat any of the typical \"rolls\" that mot people eat.  I don't eat Krab with a K, and I don't like all the mayo and sour cream crap that most rolls have.

Thus, I base my opinion on the same thing ordered in every sushi place; salmon roll with avocado, tuna roll with avocado, and Salmon Nigiri along with a Miso Soup.

This place has a Happy Hour where the plates are discounted by 50 cents Sun-Thur from 3pm-5pm, which is usually when I go.

This place is very good for the money; It's nice to be able to fill up for less than $12.00.  

The rice is prepared well and the fish is very fresh.  The Miso soup was just average, though. I have eaten here a few times since moving here 3 weeks ago and I will continue to, as well. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in and grab lunch! Food is always fresh and the selection..well they've got a lot to choose from. :-)"}
{"text":"I've only been to one other conveyer belt sushi since I moved here from Okinawa, Japan, and the sushi was so close to how it was back there. One of the waitresses greeted us right away and was was really nice (my cousin-in-law described her as 'bubbly'). It was worth the 30 minute drive from where I live. They also did a 10% military discount for us. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Great value for the money.  Try to go for happy hour for an even better value.  Fantastic selection of sushi, great service, highly recommended if you've never experienced rotary sushi before! 

They even have some pot-stickers if you have picky kids who don't like fish, and some non raw sushi rolls as well.

Great value fun place, would highly recommend for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Best revolving sushi in town compared to the one by Arrowhead and Teharu in Tempe. Reasonable prices. Quality and taste is better. Grand Canyon, Hawaiian and Spicy Tuna are the favorites. Flat screen TVs with sports games are available."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least a couple times a month when we are craving sushi, not only is it quality sushi it's a crazy price. We can fill up on sushi for $30 between us two. It's a great place for cheap quality sushi. 

What's best about it is it's color coded by plates. So you know how much your spending. The plates are delivered to your table by a conveyor belt that goes around the entire restaurant. The plates are labeled what they are and what's in the roll. Super helpful since my boyfriend is allergic to avocado. All around I recommend this place to all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"Please seat yourself\"  sign mislead you, otherwise your visit may get off to a rough start. Definitely let them seat you.   After that, enjoy the terrific sushi off from the revolving bar or order from the menu. It's not fancy schmancy, hence the three stars. But it is a solid three stars and a place my guy and I visit about once every two weeks to get our sushi fix. Tuna and Sexy Roll are my favs. He likes the octopus and the Santa Fe roll. 

We bounce between this location and the Desert Ridge location, both are consistently good."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a few of my friends. First time I've been to a place like this and it was great! All the rolls have a sign in front of them saying what they are called and what's in it which is great for picky eaters (like myself). 

The plates are color coded so you know how much each is. I loved that I could try a bunch of different types of sushi and didn't have to worry about spending a lot of money on something I didn't enjoy.

Overall the selection was pretty great and I've tried some sushi such as squid and red snapper that I've wanted to try but never have due to he price.

The only thing I disliked is the number of tables. I went about noon on a Saturday since I figured there would be enough people to make sure that there was always fresh sushi being put up. We had to wait about half an hour to be seated because all the tables were full."}
{"text":"OMG!!!
I think Sushi Station has the coolest concept ever. I wish we had one in California. I was visiting my mom and we decided to check this place out after a hard morning of shopping. We were quickly seated by our friendly waitress. At this point we were starving so we both appreciated that we could get started right away. After reading the little description cards before each item, we quickly made our selections. We had several rolls, which were all fresh and was some of the best sushi I have had. My favorite was the snow crab. There was also a good sized selection for appetizers, desserts and non fish/sushi items. I liked that there were only about 4-5 pieces on each plate that way if only one person liked the roll you were stuck with a full 8-10 piece roll by yourself. You also had the opportunity to try several different rolls. I think the hardest part is waiting for your favorite item to circle around again. The concept was easy: read the description, select food, eat food and pay for food based on color of the plate. We had several rolls, appetizers and dessert. For 2 people we walked out of there paying just a little over $40. Not bad! I cant wait to visit Arizona again so I can go back. I hightly recommend for any sushi lover."}
{"text":"I loooovvee this place. Its so nice and its cheap, but the best part its that the sushi is good! Everyone is always friendly and its a great hangout spot"}
{"text":"This place turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would. The best rotating sushi bar that I've ever been to. The sushi was better then I've had at some extensive bars. The service was not to bad considering that they just refilling drinks and counting plates. If it were up to me the atmosphere would be a little less soup kitchen although I did enjoy the pictures of people on the wall that consumed more than their fair share. I would definitely go back and recommend it to a friend"}
{"text":"I was hoping it would be a great hidden sushi spot since the handful of times I went there I was either the only table or second table there. I have had to walk out twice since I stood there amd once even sat down for atleast 10 minutes but no one came to help us I was even talking loudly and trying to find anyone there...  one of the times the times another group walked out with us since there was no service to be had.  Overall the food is fair."}
{"text":"Took my son here for his birthday and it's great to have a new Sushi Station on this side of town. The revolving menu which circulates around the restaurant is really great,  you can actually choose what your eating and se e first hand how fresh the sushi is. The cooked teriyaki chicken with white rice is delicious as well. Hot green tea was our choice of beverage. 
The staff turned of tr the lights and sang Happy Birthday to my son, something they had never done upon request.
 The entire restaurant joined in which made it even more special. Highly recommended the fried grean tea ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"I love taking my mom here for dinner. She thinks it's a blast. Fun concept. Nicely executed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 2 times with a few friends. The sashimi is quite good and fresh, no smelly fish here! They have a cool conveyor belt that runs all around the sushi bar. There are plenty of seating at the bar too! And also dining tables that you can order the sushi from. Most of the sushi is done very well, and very tasty. Your bill can go up really quick though, since it is charged by the plate, the plate color to be exact! And from what I've eaten, most of the good stuff are the higher priced plates. My friend ate $25 all by himself! So if you're hungry and come here, watch those plates stack up. The rice does help fill you up really good though. But all in all, this is a great sushi place I would definitely come back to."}
{"text":"My new fav for sushi in the neighborhood.  The conveyor belt is fun, but it reminds me of dim sum - always hawking for food.  The sushi is decent and it is nice not to order an entire roll.  We've been there about 3 different times and sat a few different sections - no problems with getting sushi.  I do like the fact that if you haven't seen anything come by to your liking or if it is all taken, you can order what you want and they will bring it by.  It is very affordable with plates ranging from $1.50 to $5.  It is not the best sushi in town, but it is the best sushi in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Good place to bring my kids who love cooked sushi, but my fiance n I will prob stick to sushi style. Thats amazing raw sushi. But this place is very quick"}
{"text":"Our favorite - quick \"let's go out to eat\" kind of place. Fun conveyer belt sushi. I'm not a Sushi expert - but it's definitely good food for me.  I like mild, my wife likes spicy and we're both very satisfied there.  It can get very very crowded sometimes and the wait can be annoying - particularly since the staff is pretty lax about how they handle the waitlist.  But there is sufficient seating, and pretty attentive staff - despite it being a self-serve sushi bar.  Sushi station is great for either a quick dinner, or if you want to have a fun casual night with 4-6 people: seating is either booths (for 4,6 or 8 cramped) ... or bar seating. 

Parking can be a little hassell during peak times, since there are 4 other restaurants in a row.

We come back here often - food ... nothing to dive into any detailed reviews, but that it's a fun, no-hassel place to get some tasty sushi - I'll give it the same 4 stars as I would a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place for some fast sushi. The food tastes great and server was very nice."}
{"text":"Fun and affordable!

My husband and I go here almost every weekend.  The sushi is good and prices reasonable!  It's a quick and easy place to dine.  I do wish they had more random selections on the conveyer belt but i guess you can order off th menu too...but that's just not as much fun!"}
{"text":"This is a 4 star review for taste & price, but 3 stars for atmosphere. It's a little heavy on the roll side of choices on the conveyer belt, but you can order off the menu including some really tasty uni. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I went here on a visit to Phoenix and had expected it to be fairly nice from my first impression walking in. The rice was slightly sweet, but it didn't make a big difference to me. However, my experience took a turn for the worse when I got the bill and was charged more than what was on the menu. The prices listed for the plate colors were the same listed next to each kind of sushi in the menu. 

However, when I got the bill I was told the menu was old and their prices were changed to reflect the prices on the bar. That was fine, except for one kind I ordered off menu that didn't have a price on the rotating bar, and was still charged more than what was listed. 

To top it off, I got food poisoning that night. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Been going to the other Sushi Station for a few years and was very excited when this one opened up close to home. Have been here several times and things were fine in the past, decent service and decent quality food for the price. Today however was a different experience, horrible service from our waitress. After we asked for the check we were told the she heard us already and after we wanted to address this with her afterwards she basically just said the same thing in a very rude manor and just walked off. We asked to talk to a manager and she basically just ignored us, another girl had to get the manager. Very bad customer service experience and disappointed.."}
{"text":"The selection of sushi available on the conveyor seems to be better than other rotating sushi bars.  Even if you don't see what you want, you can always order off the menu.  However, the quality of the sushi was average.  In my opinion,  Teharu has slightly better sushi quality."}
{"text":"How fun is this place?  Great sushi, reasonable prices, and it's fun to watch it all pass by.  I enjoyed it immensely!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a reasonable price. Service was great and the sushi fresh. They have a menu of their sushi so if you don't see what you want going around on the conveyor belt the server will gladly order it for you. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that a quality sushi place has opened in desert ridge and it is affordably priced!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and selection as always. Only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because we had a dumb waitress. She wasn't of foreign descent, but her \"cluelessness\" was quite obvious. She would visit our table and not offer refills and when I had a cake in front of me, she offered to get a fork and forgot about it... Just wow. But the food, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is simply a wonderful experience. The food is top notch. The conveyor belt experience is fun and there is a great variety of menu items.  Superb!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is all ready for you and the sushi is fresh and cheap. The include salads and appetizers as well as dessert too. Service is greats too!"}
{"text":"Came here only because Kabuki had a 30 min. wait and we were super hungry so we came here. First of all, the environment was plain and uncomfortable setting. I understand this is a rotating sushi bar, but this was just so weird! Second, the food was tasteless and to be honest the worst sushi I ever had - I would rather pay extra and grab sushi from AJ's. Third, the waitress was so terrible! She didn't ask us how we were doing and got my drink wrong. I tipped her the amount I would do to a pick-up order, it was that bad. Advice to the owners: change the setting, teach your staff good customer service, and work on the taste of the food. Won't be coming back here - ever."}
{"text":"I love sushi, pure and simple. I did not love this place even though I love the concept. If you are a sushi fanatic and want fresh, melt in your mouth fish, this is not the place for you. 

I had three different sushi dishes - tuna, salmon, and whitefish - all the fish was dry and tasted the same. My husband picked up four different rolls - Hawaii, Dragon, Spider and Crunchy Spicy Tuna - with exception of the sauce, they too tasted the same. We thought the seaweed \"nori\" wrap was very \"chewy\" and tasted funny. The gyoza and the Inarizushi (stuffed tofu skin) were actually the best things we had. 

Service was friendly and efficient. I like how you know the price of the item by the color of the plate it is on.  It is kind of like a reverse cafeteria. Instead of going through the line, the line goes to you!  Among the typical offering like sushi and rolls, they also have desserts (tiramisu, cream puffs, cheesecake), jello and fruit salad.

Think, and then think again, before you trek here. Weigh the choice . . . price vs. quality. The price was right, the quality wasn't."}
{"text":"You know, I had great expectations based on the reviews, but I'm sad to say I was hugely disappointed and will not be returning. The sushi just was not that great. The selection wasn't that great, seemed kind of dry, prices weren't that great either. I've had my fair share of great sushi being born and raised in Alaska but this doesn't hold a candle to any of it. We left hungry and disappointed. They overload their sushi with mayo or cream cheese. If ever in the area id choose Nori any day! Maybe it was just a bad day but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I took my family to Sushi Station on 4/17. We liked the environment and enjoyed the conveyor belt of sushi, however received absolutely no service. We waited 10 minutes for a drink and it was the only time we saw a server. I had to ask two people to bring me a bill while 4 people were huddled next to a computer in the front counting and exchanging money. 

Our family tends to eat sushi often, and I guess we will keep looking for a place that offers good rolls and service."}
{"text":"I love sushi station! 
They have such a variety, and always have my favorite things!
I couldn't believe how cheap it is. Always fast service, but I also try not to go when it's happy hour, or anything because I am afraid it would be too crowded for me. Staff is wonderful & every now and then the chefs ask if you want them to make you anything special! So nice."}
{"text":"Good prices. Great prices during happy hour. Food is pretty good too. Staff is friendly and pretty on the ball. I like this place."}
{"text":"Great selection and service. Kids loved it and lots for them to choose from. We will be back when we visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is cheap and it reminds me of the Sushi Boat restaurant back home in San Francisco. Except this is much tastier. Fish is fresh, selection is great and the service is always good or excellent. We typically get out of there with a sub 20 dollar check for two strong eaters for dinner. 

I have now been at least 12 times. Can't comment on drink or sake selection cuz that's not my bag, but the happy hour specials seem legit. They recently switched to a new style lid for the rotating plates (more sturdy probably easier to clean) they look nice but because they only have one large hole in the top, hot food creates condensation inside and the Gyoza (and any other hot items) get soggy. Quick fix tho, just order hot items from your server! 

I will keep eating at Sushi Station."}
{"text":"This is so far my favorite sushi place in Phoenix! The sushi is done very well and it's all tasty. Please take advantage of happy hour and come with an empty stomach!!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food selection was good. Portions were same as other conveyor sushi bars. Prices were about 35% higher then other similar places"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Right across from Desert Ridge behind a US bank. It was packed! Great atmosphere, and luckily there were two seats at the bar right as we walked in. Service was quick. 

The sushi was actually incredibly fresh tasting. My favorite thing was the albacore nigiri, which was one of the best nigiris I've had.  It had some additional flavor/spice on the top which I really enjoyed. The salmon nigiri was really fresh too. I especially loved the jalapeno poppers which were crunchy and stuffed with cream cheese/crab mix. Ended the meal with some cream puffs off the conveyor - yum. The oreo mousse cake and cheesecake looked good too, will have to try it next time.

Price was really reasonable. And loved that you can get half rolls so you can try so many more. Will definitely have to come back."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly. Not overly impressed however. More than twice the price of another revolving sushi place in Chandler. Decent flavor. Fresh. But really nothing stood out. $35 for two with not much of a meal...The same we usually paid about $15.  Probably won't return. Teharu is worth the drive."}
{"text":"We love this place!! We come about once a week. The sushi has always been fresh for us, the place can get busy but we have never had to wait to get a table. The prices are also VERY reasonable for the quantity of sushi you get. John has been our server every time and he's great- super friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good sushi, an excellent conveyer belt, & ok service.  The concept is really cool - sushi comes out on a conveyer belt and you grab what you want.  They even put a little sign out before the sushi with a description of the sushi and price.  We tried a handful of different rolls.   There were some basics and some interesting ones - like the baked scallop roll.  We also got drinks and were full after only spending about $30 on everything.  The rolls were also around 2-5 pieces which allows you to try more things.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've never had to wait. The service is always great, rolls are fresh and yummy, and the experience is fun. The rolls are smaller and less expensive which allows for more variety. Also, I left my iPhone 6 plus behind there like an idiot and they held on to it for me until I could come back and get it. Great place."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is my new favorite sushi place. If I lived close by, I'd go there every day. 

The prices are unbeatable, the atmosphere and 'sushi boat' concept is very fun, and the sushi is actually pretty good. 

My dream would be a sushi station more centrally located in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Should be called Diarrhea Station because thats where everyone went after eating the vegas rolls."}
{"text":"The concept is so awesome! They need more of these types of restaurants in the U.S. The servers are always polite. The sushi is exquisite and the prices are great. I absolutely love this place and come at least once every couple weeks!"}
{"text":"I had to knock them down a star. I came in here for lunch.. and in the midst of all the crab-meat rolls I decided to order off their menu. 

I grabbed a 2pc salmon sushi and seaweed salad off the conveyor and ordered:
-Eel handroll $3
-Mackerel sushi 2pc ($1.50) x2 
-Albacore ($2) THIS is where it gets weird. My server brought it out.. but it was on the $3 dollar plate. I showed her that it was $2 on the menu. SHE TELLS ME THAT YEAH, THEY HAVE SOME TYPOS ON THEIR MENU.. Like \"munchrooms\" instead of mushrooms or whatever. I told her the price is not in the same category of 'typos'.. especially as other items were clearly marked when their price changed.  I sent it back out of principal.. but she came back and asked if I had 'touched' the sushi.. I told her no... so someone else got that 2pc. Weeeee!

Sorry, but.... you can't just tell me you decided to change prices and expect me not to care. If there's a discrepancy you should honor your menu (especially since it was a $1). This just shows their lack of customer service, but I'll probably still be back because it's dirt cheap and I'll lower my standards for a good piece of fish."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, and enjoyed the revolving plates of food idea. I'm not even a huge fan of sushi but I've found something to eat every time. Most recently I made a reservation for a larger party of friends and they were able to accommodate us and we're absolutely the best! They allowed us to store out cake and ice cream in their fridge and freezer for the birthday we enter celebrating. Then, as our party got bigger than expected they kept finding ways to make our seating workout. They helped us, then, serve our cake and ice cream. they're fantastic and exceeded my expectations for the night. Staff was so nice and helpful and we felt like they genuinely just wanted us to have a good time and we absolutely did!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited here for a quick sushi fix and we both enjoyed it. The sushi is all around you, so you can just sit down and start eating right away. They also have a conventional menu if you want to order something else. The sushi tasted really good and had a lot of flavor to it. I was pleasantly surprised by that. I had to stop myself from needing a medical escort out of the place due to over eating. We got out of there well fed for under $30. I'll take that anytime we go for sushi! My only knock would be that some of the sushi was a bit luke warm when we got it. It sits on a belt, so it can cool of pretty quickly. It wasn't a deal breaker, but just a small drawback. We'll go back again sometime soon hopefully!"}
{"text":"Well well..... very nice a revolving Sushi Bar... been in some in L.A. but I haven't seen one until now. Very simple , Price not bad what you eat is what you pay. Love it and going back for more and telling my friends about SUSHI STATION ... Its a new place I heard its only a week old very clean as well. Just a Note: been to Kabuki its overrated ... been to Tempe and Glendale and both I had bad experience ... sayonara kabuki and hello Sushi Station."}
{"text":"The sushi is good and you cannot beat the prices.  Love going here all the time."}
{"text":"I've been to both sushi station locations & hands down the camelback location is the best. During our visit to this location we walked into to see a waiter refilling soy sauce bottles, one waitress working the tables and four others sitting in a booth chatting. We were told sit where ever. We sat down and after about 15 minutes no one had yet to come to our table. I finally asked if we could place a drink order and the waiter acted shocked no one had come by. When he went to talk to the waitresses all just sitting together they just looked at our table in annoyance. Finally after receiving some water and plates we sat to eat. The sushi belt is large however we only ever saw about 10 different types of rolls. I'd say if you want to eat at sushi station go the extra distance to the camelback location."}
{"text":"If you're on a budget and craving sushi, come here. It's not the highest quality, but it will suffice. Fun atmosphere in a large well lit room, I came on Easter Sunday and there were still a good amount of people there. Service was attentive but not overbearing."}
{"text":"We definitely gave this place too many chances. The fish is of a very low quality. I literally could not eat the salmon. 
I kept forgetting how much I hated this place and would order it on PostMates to get my sushi kick without paying a lot. This is definitely the last time."}
{"text":"I love coming here!  The food is good, we also order from the menu and love the fried rice.  This place is very affordable and they also have desert items.   My kids love it too.  There always friendly service and you can get to try different rolls.  The rolls could be better but you get what you pay for.  This place is good for a casual date just a good hangout spot.  They have fried ice cream next food and boba tea.  Must try!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is priced great, drinks - not so much. However, this is a good spot for a cheap sushi date. Definitely will be back but probably not my go to place for drinks!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this revolving sushi bar. They have quick friendly service. The sushi is great for the price. The chefs are very friendly, if you don't see the roll you are looking for they will make it for you real quick. 
We definitely go back often. You should give it a go :)"}
{"text":"This place is excellent (and well priced) for a casual sushi experience. The largest draw was the conveyor belt and the amount of choices I had to choose from. I liked being able to order the sushi in sets of 3 or 4 as opposed to having to purchase a whole roll. 

I tried the spicy salmon, the New Mexico and the spicy shrimpy and salmon. All tasted great and could be compared to a number of other sushi places I have been to. My fianc√© ordered the veggie roll and said multiple times that this was the best veggie roll she has had yet (tried 6 or 7 different places). We definitely plan to come back again for lunch and happy hour."}
{"text":"This was my first rotation sushi experience and I enjoyed the meal I had here. There seemed to be lots of options available and the cards that were shown next to the rotating plates had enough information for me to know what I was getting into before grabbing a bite to eat--it was bizarre eating without reading a menu first, but like I mentioned the signs next to the food plates were helpful. I also liked that they had other types of food (aka non-sushi or seafood items) and even dessert available."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The muscles and shrimp tempura are amazing. And the staff are so friendly. A great date night spot."}
{"text":"One of the few revolving sushi places I know in town. For that, it's like a novelty. 

The sushi though was average, but I guess you can't expect high quality when the sushi is literally coming down a production line - ha! The only other one I've been to is Teharu in Chandler, and I think their quality is a little better. Also, the last time I checked it was also cheaper but I'm not positive because it had been awhile since I've went. What I also wished this restaurant did that Teharu did/does? (sorry, it's the only direct comparison I have to off of!) is giving you a sushi seat to order off of. Instead of waiting for what you want to hopefully get to you, I was able to order exactly what I wanted if I didn't see it on the belt..or even a place card for it. 

Overall, it works. It can be a quick in-and-out for lunch or whatnot. I went with a group of friends around 12:30, and it wasn't busy. I assumed it would be due to the office buildings and Desert Ridge nearby, but we sat immediately (party of 5)."}
{"text":"Friends and out of town guest always want to meet  at this place.The turning Carousel always spark their attention (it's their first time) Food lack quality, plates never have consistency to them. Food on the plates get cold and they still serve them. The prices don't match the takeout brochure.  Too many sushi places in the valley for this"}
{"text":"I agree with fellow Yelper, Bao....this place is more about the fun than the yum. So know what you're getting into if you're an avid sushi fan - this place is not about high quality or exotic sushi. But if you're in the mood for quick, decent basic sushi? Then add this place to your list. This is the best revolving sushi place that my husband and I have ever been to...we typically don't enjoy the flavor and selection at these types of establishments...but Sushi Station has more variety than most and decent tasting sushi.

The best reason to find yourself here is if you want a quick bite of sushi and want to enjoy more types of sushi than you normally would when having to order full sushi rolls. The fun is watching the food go by and enjoying a few pieces of this, a few pieces of that, and so on. Pricing for plates is pretty cheap - our lunch total came out to just over $30 for the two of us and we enjoyed at least 15 plates. Most of our plates for the $2 kind but they have plates priced at $1.50, $2, $3, $4 and $5. The $4 and $5 plates were few and far between. Another perk is getting to sit down right away and start grabbing your food without any wait. Perfect if you're stomach is grumbling and need something asap.

The place has a lot of seating and is open and clean. Service was friendly and quick. They have a happy hour that seems worth checking out. The hubs and I plan on going back if we're ever in the mood for a quick bite of sush. Not bad, I say....Not bad!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. The prices were awesome and the sushi and service was great! Would definitely recommend this and come back soon!"}
{"text":"I eat here once or twice a week, been going for 2 years now. Always great food, and the service is impeccable. I always feel like a VIP and am happy to always tip 20%+ !!"}
{"text":"I feel that my experiences at Sushi Station are always hit or miss.  I've been here and left within 10 minutes of not being acknowledged.  I've also been here and had great service.  Overall, this is a good place when you're craving some decent sushi at affordable prices.  Their nigiri portions are generous, and their rolls are creative.  Their 3-6 happy hour takes $.50 off per plate."}
{"text":"This concept is a hum ding-er in my book. Where can you go to sit down and immediately grab something rolling by on a conveyor belt and star eating? HERE! 

Plates start at $1.50 for your basic California crunchy roll to $5 for a bit exotic type rolls. I ate there twice in one week, so I can say it works for me for a quick, fun place to eat on the fly. Is there better sushi elsewhere? Of course, but the experience and food is still quite good. The wait staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I've never met a manager so rude ever. She's not even worth my time explaining, but we will never come back here. Don't ever bring in a discount card that you were given. Apparently they aren't valid and the waiter wanted a bigger tip, per the manager."}
{"text":"Bad food. A lot of the rolls tasted like they had been out for hours. The ones that do not still taste awful and were small in portion.  Plenty of the rolls contain artificial crab. Other rolls can be found marinating in mayo/soy sauce and or excessively deep-fried. On top of the poor quality sushi, the staff here are rude. Be prepared for angry looks if you ask for anything that's not on the belt. I am sorry if I wanted something that was semi-fresh.

That said, don't waste your time here. There are plenty of other sushi places in Phoenix that offer superior sushi, portions and customer service. All for the same price as Sushi Station."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything we had was good.  Especially like the idea of being able to see all the options go by and just grab whatever looks good.  Prices were fantastic for happy hour.  Even the dessert was so good we had another (carrot cake and chocolate cake, both really good).  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!!!  Far surpassed any hopes. 
It's clean, fresh, and Delish. Watch out if you get the saki bomb...you get a full bottle."}
{"text":"Great value! That's the reason we keep coming back here one weekend after another. The sushi plates range from $1.50 to $5.00, but they include things such as sea urchin and sweet shrimp. You can still get the usual tuna, salmon, yellowtail. Most of the plates are the some variation of California rolls but if you wait patiently you'll find the more interesting items. The quality and freshness is fairly average, which is great  especially considering the low price. As far as eating here, there is a line once in a while and our experience with service has been good."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. I've never been to a revolving sushi bar before but liked the convenience of not having to wait and seeing the roll before eating it. Also, price wasn't too crazy."}
{"text":"It is not the best sushi you will have, but its such a cool concept and the food is still great. You can try so many types of sushi with out having to order a whole roll. The service here has always been great as well."}
{"text":"First time dining at Sushi Station and it was fabulous! My waitress explained how it worked, she was also very attentive and friendly. The sushi was great, and they had a lot more variety besides sushi. Prices are fair and the restaurant is very clean. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here 3x this week since discovering this place. I love the concept (conveyer sushi), the variety, the portions and prices, and it's always fresh and the service is great. Is it the best sushi I've ever had?  No. But it's perfect for what it is, quick, cheap, fresh sushi!  Their happy hour is great too. Get the sesame balls for desert. You won't be disappointed. Also, order from the menu and they'll make the rolls fresh for you. The Grand Canyon and Las Vegas strip rolls are my go-to. But still so many to try!"}
{"text":"The price is right and the quality is pretty good.  

The fish is pretty fresh and decent sized cuts are available.  

If you get the sushi itch a few times a month, this is a great way to get your fix and not break the bank.  Sure other places may taste a little bit better, but they also charge 2-3X the price.  

This is a good place and I hope they do well and open more locations."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's good. I do have a problem when come to sushi . I like it fresh made to order. I don't know how long has it been in that conveyer belt but you can't beat the prices. It's convenient that's all."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you want expensive amazing sushi, but I'm not that picky to start with.

It's good if you want the basic rolls like rainbow/cali/dragon which are all among my favorites any ways ;3 I love the fact you can get a variety of sushi  for about the same price I spend on one or two rolls I can get a taste of about four or five rolls."}
{"text":"I love coming here usually, except for tonight! The food that I was able to get was delicious as always however the service was terrible! Part of dining out is the service that you receive if they do not get better servers there I might just be going to the other rotating sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Great prices! We went during happy hour. The staff was very nice and helpful! The sushi was really tasty for the price took my son and he loved it!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and for the price it is a pretty good deal. The only reason it has 3 stars is because the sushi isn't the BEST quality although it's still totally edible and I think it tastes pretty fresh. They have an amazing happy hour, I ate a ton of sushi and got two saki bombs for $25 which is much less than I usually spend on a sushi outing. It's a rotating sushi bar so that is also pretty cool it's the only rotating sushi bar I've ever been to! I've taken a couple people there and they've also thought it was a good time. They have specialty rolls that you can order off the menu as well and they are really good! I'll defiantly keep coming back with my friends!"}
{"text":"Parking is tucked behind the building and is what you expect for the restaurant's location. Sushi Station is just a tad bit pricier than Teharu."}
{"text":"We love our local Sushi Station! Revolving Bar with yummies that come right to you. The Salmon was great quality and perfect ending to a perfect day"}
{"text":"Love coming here.  It's super fast since you can start eating from the moment you sit down and choose your plates from the conveyor belt.  The food from the belt is fresh and scrumptious.  The food from the menu is equally delicious.  Service is great and prices are reasonable.

I know some people may be wary about the entire concept but you should give it a try, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and both delicious!! This restaurant is unique in that the food comes to you on a moving platform. Prices of the food are determined by the color of the plates. I had a California rolls with crab on it. Yum! Try to get the bigger ones first. The tiramisu is delicious! So yummy! Also the cheese cake bites are to die for. I loved the raspberry cheesecake. I had four different dishes for a total of $11. This is a great place to go in the midst of a shopping spree or after Last Chance! The wait staff are extremely nice and attentive; they even asked if we wanted a fork to eat our desserts. Loved that. I would go back in a second!"}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and the place is always busy! Fast service! The scallop topped sushi plate is awesome"}
{"text":"This place was alright.  I'm not really a big fan of sushi but was hyped up to try it.  Me and the misses were seated pretty quick.  And the"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Excellent service even when swamped!  Food ready & fresh on revolving server. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place to go to! I love the fact that the sushi is on a conveyor belt and get to choose what sushi I want! Every time I go to a sushi place it is always hard for me to decide what I want! Also I like the fact that it is color coded based on price !"}
{"text":"This place was definitely fun. The sushi was alright. I think going around on the conveyer makes it difficult to maintain the temperature of what should be cold or hot. The only thing that really turned me off were the muscles, but I knew it was a gamble...

I can see how this would be great for a fun casual date, people with kids, or those who are not big fans of sushi, but if you're looking for a gourmet experience, go elsewhere. 

This would also be a great place for a quick lunch if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I really like this place but if they tell you they're giving you 10% off, check your itemized receipt. We had a $20.50 tab and they told us they were taking 10% off. 10% of $20.50 is $2.05. They only removed a dollar $1.53 and claimed that was 10%. On their Facebook page they have a 10% off coupon. What they're really giving is seven and a half percent and skimming the rest for themselves. Probably not a legal practice."}
{"text":"Make sure you go during happy hour! Plates range from $1.25-$4. Extremely budget friendly, &you'll be leaving with a happy tummy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week. Everything was phenomenal. The Las Vegas roll was my favorite. We gorged ourselves and our bill was right at $40. Very reasonable for the amount of food we put away. Only reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that I feel like the waitstaff wasn't very attentive as we had to wait quite a while for drink refills."}
{"text":"The sushi tastes great, it's fairly priced, and the conveyor belt concept is awesome!"}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants I frequent for my sushi fix, I'd have to say Sushi Station is one of my favorites. I love the ambiance, and the chatter of happy people everywhere. If you haven't eaten here before, note that they charge you via a plate color system (white plates costing $1.25, blue $2.75, purple 3.25, yellow 4.25, and black 5.25), so it is easy to accumulate a larger bill than you might think. On average, I spend about $25 each time I go, though I have a large appetite. That aside, the sushi is always fresh, and the variety is fantastic! Definitely consider giving them a shot, even if you have to drive a bit to get there (I personally live 30 minutes away, but it's worth it!)"}
{"text":"Coming in the evening seems to be even better busy so food supply is fresh and kept a rolling. Found a good roll for here this trip, the 5pc Sexy Roll. My husband likes the nigiri  sushi  (raw cuts of fish on top of sticky rice) Decent spot for that at a low price"}
{"text":"Your average rotating sushi bar where you pick plates off a conveyor belt and each color plate is a different cost. The total is added up at the end of the meal. They have a decent variety of things to choose from, but did not have udon or soba noodles on the menu or many non-sushi or sashimi items on the menu. The chefs behind the bar are constantly talking in Chinese."}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi bar. Great sushi and busy.

This is a fun place to visit and is great for rookies and pros alike. Seems to always be busy the several times I have gone and I look for that in a sushi place like this (conveyer belt service). Lots of variety and great prices. 

Staff is friendly and efficient. I can get in and out quick or sit and relax with a friend - no pressure or waiting place on us by the staff. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi spot! It's a great location and great food. It's a revolving sushi bar with a variety of different kinds. Sometimes they are low on specific ones, but for the most part it's pretty well stocked. The service is nice and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"WOW, When I first walked in here, I wanted to turn right around and walk right out! But my causin was with me & wanted to stay!

I am not a big fan of buffet's and this was slightly similar, but different, lol

All the food is running on a conveyer belt. For sushi, that does seem weird because I like it cold and FRESH!! That is very important to me.

I have been to a place like this in Hawaii but I ordered off them menu at that restaurant.

I decided I would try it off the conveyer belt and it was great!!! It was cold, fresh and yummy!! Not to mention the cost was pretty outstanding as well.  You pay for the color of the plate. I think they start at $1.50 or 2.00 and go up to maybe $3.50 or something.

I was VERY suprised and excited that the cheesecake was Super!!  It was like New York style cheesecake. Very dense, not jellow cheesecake like most Asian restaurants have.

I love this place and I will be back over & over again!!!"}
{"text":"Good service from the servers and decent quality sushi for being a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. The sushi chefs can be a little moody, but most sushi chefs are. Also, they tend to nickel-and-dime for any variations made to orders, no matter how small. But overall, there is a wide variety on the belt, available instantly, which is nice for a quick lunch or dinner. To date I've never had a bad experience and would even recommend for a fun group dinner or party."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times (at least 10), and am not a fan. However, I will continue to eat here many more times because my husband loves it. And that's what marriage is about.

The service is consistently poor and awkward. I'll admit the servers are kind of set up for failure at a place like this, because many customers are just helping themselves from the selections on the conveyor belt. And then there are other customers (like me) who want to order off the menu. So I'm sure it's hard from the servers to adjust to everyone's different dining styles here. However, we ALL still want our drinks refilled, our checks brought out in a timely manner, and friendly greetings/interactions. And each of these things have been lacking almost every time I've been here. Our servers often completely disappear for a very long time, and we have to track them down for our check by asking other servers. Not cool.

Normally, I really like sushi. But at Sushi Station I don't think the quality of fish is very good. It has a very off taste to m, though that's exactly what I expect at an inexpensive revolving sushi bar. After trying a number of weird-tasting dishes from the conveyor belt, I've now gotten into the habit of just ordering veggie rolls from the menu, and I do think these are decent. They're nothing special, just straight up cucumber or avocado rolled in rice and seaweed; but I like them and would recommend them.

Sushi Station does have a rewards program, so that makes me feel a teeny bit better about eating here so frequently. 

I could forgive the quality of the fish (since now I just order my veggie rolls) if the service were even reasonable, or if the place had a more pleasant environment. But unfortunately all of these things combined just make it an experience I don't enjoy. But if you're like my husband and just want all the sushi you can get by any means necessary, you'll probably be a fan."}
{"text":"Great fun!! The food was delicious and its a fun way to eat sushi - especially if you want to try a wide range of rolls. We had many floating sushi restaurants in outlast state we lived in and are happy to have one in the valley. Yummy, affordable, fun, clean, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Obviously the sushi isn't going to be a five stars quality but, it definitely passes for a good meal. I love the idea and the concept of the rotating belt with various types of sushi, deserts and salads to pick from. Some of my favorites are the seaweed salad, the sexy rolls, the California roll and the soft crab rolls. One thing to remember is that each plates will have a different price range. You can tell this by the different color plates. It is a good place to take friends and family out to but, the plates will add up and so will your bill ha ha. Only eat what you know you are willing to spend on ;)"}
{"text":"Me and My wife Love both this and the Desert Ridge Sushi Station and have been numerous times. The concept is awesome and it works really well and the sushi is always fresh. The staff is lovely and get you your drinks and if you want a special order. I will forever love this place. :)"}
{"text":"I am accustomed to going to regular more expensive sushi bars and not many revolving sushi bars but I have been here before and was in the mood for sushi and didn't want to spend a lot of money and Sushi Station was right down the street and it's quick and casual. It's definitely the best bang for your buck when it comes to sushi. The revolving counters are pretty cool especially if you have never been to one. Mass amounts of various rolls and items rotate by you and you just grab the plate of whatever items you like. Plates range from $2-$5 based on plate color and have 4-5 pieces each. Me and my girlfriend came here and between the two of us had about 10 plates total and the bill with drinks came to $30 (which is the equivalent to maybe 3 rolls at a more upscale sushi bar like Ra or Koi). It definitely offers up a great way to try a wider variety of rolls and sushi. They even have a happy hour which is 50cents off each plate. So if you are craving sushi and want something not as expensive and much quicker than traditional place, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My first sushi experience in Phoenix area. The sushi train is full of options, including sashimi, cooked sushi, desserts, and Japanese drinks. It's an experience if you haven't had this before!"}
{"text":"We often go to this restaurant. It's good food and affordable. Perfect for family. You can order to go, too. 
Favorite are california rolls, salmon and tuna sushi,"}
{"text":"This place is really cool and a lot of fun. Inside is nice and clean. Hip music playing in the background while you relax and dine. The best part is watching all sorts of tasty items cruising across the conveyor belt right in front of you that one can choose from when something catches your eye. There is also a large menu that you can select from and they will bring it to the table for the same price if you do not want to wait for the belt. They also have Soups, Salads, Appetizers, Teriyaki and Tempura if you do not care for Sushi.

Service was very friendly. I was gladly told by my server the skinny on what to do and how to choose based on the colors of the plates. Each colored plate is a different price and you just stack them up to the side for a grand total at the end. I watched the belt as it moved in front of me and I said that one. She helped me grab it and from there I was in command. Nice!

Today I had the Dragon Roll with eel sauce, a Crispy Sweet Potato Roll, what they call the Caterpillar, a New Mexico Roll with jalapenos, and one called the Imagine which was huge with some Salmon Roe sprinkled on top. I like some wasabi mixed with a little soy and pickled ginger on the side to give it some kick.

This is not what I call North Scottsdale high end sushi but based on the selection of items and the great value on top of the fun of watching that dang belt go by you while you are eating. I give them a thumbs up. Yes even cheese cake and other dessert items are available. Beep beep.

Bring the family and kids. Great place to experiment or just have fun while getting filled up with some tasty treats at the same time. Look for coupons in the weekly mailers. I found a 15% off for today. Shazam!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's usually quite busy but worth the wait. The concept is great, a conveyor belt loaded with different kinds of sushi rolls, salads and deserts. The way it works is all items are placed on colored plates. Each color represents the price associated with that particular plate, so you know the exact cost of what you're getting. The prices are very reasonable and you are able to try different kinds of items without breaking the bank. This is now my \"go to\" sushi place."}
{"text":"We walked in an hour before closing and were not greeted because the staff was too consumed cleaning to seat us. We waited about 2-3 minutes to be seated. A staff member even walked by us with a broom and didn't say a word to us. 

We finally got seated and the waitress gave us menus and never came back to take our order. We ended up taking food off the sushi boat, which is highly questionable so close to closing. 

The food was mediocre. Nothing was memorable. I even got a salmon roll that was supposed to be crunchy and it was not crunchy at all. 

No one brought us wasabi or ginger. No one asked us if we needed anything.  We could have walked out of there without paying. 

I calculated our bill and left $20 on the counter. I was about to leave but my sister insisted that we wait for a bill. 

We had to ask someone to get our bill from us and our waitress finally appeared and acknowledged that she forgot about us. 

Long story short I don't know how this \"business\" got a 4 star rating on yelp. This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my life. The only thing that would make this dining experience any worse is if we get food poisoning."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so close to my home and so affordable. I eat it every week. Everyone here is so nice and gracious, such a friendly environment!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot so far. Wide variety of plates that are always being refreshed so you dont get old sushi. My only gripe is that I wish they would offer more rolls that didnt have avocado and mayo. Other then that fun casual tasty place for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never too crowded which is weird because of how good it is. Sitting at the bar is great with the conveyer belt moving the sushi plates around. Rolls can be made to order and there's definitely something for everyone. Even non sushi loves will find something on the menu. Quality sushi!"}
{"text":"This place has decent sushi for a relatively low price. I've come here a bunch of times, and it's great if you want to start eating immediately. Tatum sushi is my favorite. 
Make sure to ask for a fork if you get cake. Eating it with chopsticks is nearly impossible. 
You could hold it against them that they're not a high-end place, but you're simply setting your expectations too high. This is probably as close to good fast food sushi you're going to get. It does gets a point off because often the service isn't great. It takes a while to order drinks, get drinks (other than the lukewarm ramune offered on the conveyer belts), or get your check."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical of this place as I am a bit of a germaphob...however I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked the options and the pricing of their sushi, not at happy hour.  My daughter loved watching the food go around and around!  I was a little disappointed with the lack of other options on the menu for children and those that are not sushi fans.  Other than fried food, which we aren't big fans of the only other option was a $10 meal.  

We will return for another try, but probably without our kids and only with people who like sushi."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour prices! Regular prices are 50 cents more per tier. Nice pricing and decent food. I brought my son to this revolving sushi restaurant this evening for dinner.

Parking is available behind the restaurant. Enter through alleys on either side of the restaurant. It is super convenient. 

The restaurant is larger than it seems on the outside. Only one half of the restaurant was open to the public on this weekday night. We just missed Happy Hour by 5 minutes, but we still found prices pretty affordable, and the sushi is alright.

They offer several items at their lowest tier: California Roll, Snow Crab Roll, Tamago Nigiri, Red Snapper Nigiri (pretty fresh and cut well with minimal sinew).

One of the higher priced items that I enjoyed was their baked scallop over California roll.

Tip: If you like gyoza dumplings, order a fresh batch from the server when you first get in. It is worth the wait. $2.50 for 5 dumplings with sauce.

Maguro nigiri was a little pricier. Make sure that it looks fresh and of good color for optimal pieces. We also enjoyed a couple of pieces of seared albacore tuna.

We stuffed ourselves for $29."}
{"text":"My mom had been to this place before and raved about it, so when we were in town, this was the first restaurant that we went to! I love sushi, and was craving salmon sashimi at the time, so this was the perfect first meal in Phoenix. I loved the fact that there were so many different sushi dishes on the conveyer belt...a great way to try new sushi! Out of all the sushi places that I've been to in the U.S., this place had the best salmon sashimi!! They were the thickest pieces of salmon that I've ever gotten, and oh so yummy! And I would say that the prices are reasonable. Can't wait to come back here when I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good and the kids and ADHD adults of our family love that we get fresh sushi quick. It also helps to bribe the kids to eat when the desserts cruise by every few minutes"}
{"text":"They have a conveyor belt with color coordinate plates. The colored plates represent different price points. For example, white plates might all be $1.50. This is convenient if you're on a budget and know \"okay only look for white plates\".
Convenience: 9/10

As far as the taste of the sushi, I was not impressed. Maybe because I stuck towards the lower end of prices, but the ones I did try I was not impressed with. I did try some of the more \"expensive\" ones from my friends plate and still was not as impressed.
Taste: 6/10

I would say that if you're new to sushi and have never had GOOD sushi, you'd enjoy this place. If you have, like me, however, experienced good sushi (I'm from the coast: good sushi is all I know;)) then you probably have better luck elsewhere here in Phoenix for some good sushi.
Overall I would give this place a 3/5 for the convenience being so great with the cool concept of the conveyor belt and colored plates, but taste if more important to me than convenience."}
{"text":"Just left this place tonight. Great food, great service. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Goof food, very convenient to my house and the servers keep bringing me pop. I've gone a few times to both locations and will stick with Desert Ridge because the food seems fresher."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Loved the New Mexico roll the most. Actually has good desert too unexpected for sushi place to me but chocolate mousse was great"}
{"text":"I love the Sushi Station! The conveyer belt is so fun and the quality of the sushi is great! Very inexpensive too! My sister and I come here about once a week. The staff is so nice."}
{"text":"Sushi. This is how is sushi is made to be served. This place is so amazing that i want to eat here almost every day. The food is awesome and very diverse and at a good price. I love how i can get just a little bit of every kind of sushi that i love instead of being stuck with just one or two plates of just a few kinds. The way the place is set up is awesome and everyone who works there is awesome. So this place is pretty much awesomely awesome."}
{"text":"Love the Scottsdale location so decide yesterday to go this location. Allot smaller than the other one but I still enjoyed my visit. The staff was very friendly and sat we very quickly. Sushi selection wasn't huge but for the size of the location I can't complain. Sushi did taste great tho. My only complaints are that it was a little hard to get ahold of my waitress and the whole place seemed really cold. Other than that I enjoyed my visit and will return."}
{"text":"Liked that there was plenty of sushi options to choose from. The customer service was good. My drink never ran out and the waiter brought us everything we asked for without forgetting anything. Only down fall is that it's super expensive. I've visited lots of revolving sushi places and this one was the most expensive one I've been too. Some of their sushi dishes only have 3rolls on it and it cost about $3.25. That's like paying a dollar a bit lol"}
{"text":"Finally I can get kaiten sushi and not have to drive 15 miles to the outskirts of Phoenix....  I used to live in Japan so this is a bit like going home for me.  This place could easily be dropped in a Japanese city and would fit in.  

I ended up getting the fried rice and tried a couple of plates of sushi.  Both were good, and the last time I was here the sushi was good as well.  The ebi (shrimp) is exactly like I used to have it in Japan.  I opted for the California roll this time around (easy way out) since I was doing some reading and didn't much feel like prepping each piece of sushi with wasabi and ginger.

The food was more than enough, plus a large drink put the total at $11.34.  Very, very friendly staff, easy location, easy parking, easy ordering and eating."}
{"text":"Last meal in Arizona before I headed back to the OC. Boyfriend wanted to do sushi and found this place that was on the way to the airport. Didn't think they would have good sushi places around here but surprise, surprise here's one! 

Pretty good selection of sushi and omg they have really good selection of desserts too - cheesecake, tiramisu, oreo mousse cake, chocolate cake - I was wowed by the choices of desserts because usually sushi on conveyor belt usually only have the mochi bread thing that I don't like and some jello thing - but this one had those and more. The sushi wasn't of superior quality - it is a conveyor belt one - they usually aren't but it's not the say that they are not good. As a matter of fact it's pretty decent quality in taste. 

They have things that I haven't had before either - like a whole lump of crabmeat (they claim is crab meat but it was 2 dollars -- so I don't know haha) mixed with some spicy mayo on a little dish. it was pretty good too. They also have a variety of different rolls - but I got pretty full after have 2 pieces of salmon and mackeral sushi, one salmon skin handroll, the lump of crabmeat and a piece of the spicy tuna roll and a piece of the tiramisu cake. Couldn't try more even if i wanted to.

The prices aren't too bad - starts out at $1.50 and the max was like 5 bucks.

But I will keep this place noted if there was a need for a quick sushi run the next time I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"Tried after a movie, got lost, but called and glad I did. Loved all the sushi, and ordered miso soup, agedashi tofu (no broth, so just fried tofu),  will be back for the other soups (osumashi & gyoza). This place kinds of reminds me of Japanese dim sum...:) Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Attentive staff very friendly. Plenty of selction to try new things. Would definatley recomend to friends and family. Great for a nice and affordable date."}
{"text":"I read the reviews here before I picked this Kaiten Sushi place to go to and saw the high stars it got. I was so excited since I grew up eating kaiten sushi in Japan and Hawaii and then in Seattle too, and only recently learned that there is actually kaiten sushi in the desert! The reviews must come from people who never have been to kaiten sushi or aren't familiar with real sushi, or maybe I just went on an off-day --- though I did come here at 6:30pm on a Saturday so you'd think it'd be hopping and fresh. The conveyer belt was full and the first thing I saw was tako nigiri, which is one of my favorites so I was happy and grabbed it. It was okay - not that bad but nothing to rave about. Then not much else interesting came my way. There were lots and lots of rolls. I'm not a roll fan. I tried looking for and then ordering normal stuff you can find at most sushi bars but, since I am not a roll fan, I couldn't find much by way of nigiri or even gunkan or maki. I would say 85% of the belt was rolls. The only other non-rolls on the belt were ika, inari, tamago, fried gyoza, tai, maguro, salmon, bowls of different types of salads (seaweed, seafood, green, etc), packaged azuki buns, and some ramune drinks. All of the raw fish looked pretty dry. Lots of them passed by me over and over - and the belt is pretty long so I got to watch them get dryer and dryer. If you see something you want and it's on the other belt - and it's fresh, I'd say just go grab it or you'll have to wait forever! I relented from starvation and picked a seared maguro nigiri off the belt..and was so sad when I bit into it and had to chew on the maguro for a bit (true sushi fans will understand why this is sad). Weirdly, there were several sushi chefs behind the counter continously adding (rolls) to the belt. I can understand not wanting to put out nigiri or raw fish given the environment, but at least have a good menu to order from. I did order a hamachi & scallion hand roll, but wasn't impressed. I also tried to order a spicy tuna gunkan but was told they only do that in rolls. I do like that, from what I could see, they don't overdo the rice on the rolls. But the sushi rice wasn't flavored as it should be and was also on the colder side...which is weird, should be at least room temp. I ended up eating tamago, inari, seared maguro, tako, a piece of gyoza and the hamachi handroll. (Notice all of mine were cooked except the handroll.) My husband did like the salmon nigiri, he ate 2 plates of it. 
Our waitress was nice but it did take quite long to get our wasabi and drinks (it wasn't THAT busy in there) - and she didn't seem to know the menu. 
I know I'm in the desert...maybe I had my hopes up too high. I am going to try out other kaiten sushi places and hope I can be excited about kaiten sushi in the desert again. I'm not sure why it got such high praise here. I hope this is not what the bar is set on ..otherwise :-( ."}
{"text":"Whoa almost five stars, really?

Rice wasn't right. Too hard.

Sushi tasted cold and not fresh even though they were making it on the spot and sending it on the conveyer belt.

I LOVE shrimp tempura rolls and one of the things that I love about them is that the tempura is warm while the rest of the roll is cold.
Not here. They use pre cooked cold tempura from what I can tell.

They had a sesame bean roll on the conveyor that I grabbed because I haven't had one of those since Chinatown in NYC.
It was packaged which was weird but it was FROZEN solid. 
Told the waitress so she brought another which was still frozen though not solid.

Ummmmm no thanks. 

My mom treated so I wish I would have liked this place more.

Basically it's grocery store sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't bad.  It would have been a lot better if the rolls were offered without Eel sauce."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous! So good, and addicting. I especially like that they incorporate southwestern flavors in some of their plates."}
{"text":"Super happy I found this hidden gem. Revolving sushi!? I'm in! The sushi was fresh and customer service was great. So many varieties or you can order fresh if you want something different. Luxury shopping center and he prices were very reasonable! I like that I can just walk in and eat at my pace at the sushi bar or I can sit in a booth if I am with multiple people because the sushi goes around the booths as well! I will definitely come back, happy I found this place. They have happy hour for drinks and food too."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to get your sushi fix. The sushi is good and inexpensive.  There is really no need for a menu, as you just have to choose what you like from the endless parade of food on the conveyor belt setup. The color of the plate indicates the price of the dish, which makes it easy to tally the final cost. I found the staff to be friendly and although it is a popular place, I have not experienced any significant wait even at peak hours, probably because there's lots of seating and because there is no lag between getting seated and getting food."}
{"text":"I've been here a good dozen times and I like it. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. The sushi is good for the price and it's what you expect for being a \"fast food\" sushi restaurant. I'm a fan and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi but it's pretty decent with decent prices! Good for families and is kid friendly! The staff are nice and all smiles! It has an enjoyable environment. A place I keep coming back to for good and decent sushi in the desert!!"}
{"text":"Great! Fun lunch stop and neat to watch the sushi go by. We really liked that it comes in small portions so we got to try and share a lot of different things."}
{"text":"This place is great for a fast meal. Sushi is reasonably priced as well. Each plate ranges from 3-5 pieces. My favorite is the shrimp tempura roll. Don't be afraid to ask the chef for a roll you don't see on the belt!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am very disappointed.

I am a long time customer of Sushi Station in the valley. The food and service has always been just great. However, I do not appreciate the way I was treated at Sushi Stations newest location on camelback. 

I dropped into Sushi Station on camelback with my significant the other night. The place was pretty busy but we were attended to and seated promptly. Our server was a very nice young woman. About 7 minutes went by and my girlfriend and I had yet to get sushi off the belt that we wanted. It was just too busy and our central position enabled others to get the more popular sushi options first. This is understandable.. But we were having a craving for #delux.... So, we decided to get up and leave. Which last time I checked is not illegal. We had nothing but waters and no pending orders. What followed next is why I am posting this.

I heard a comment coming from behind me. I turn around and it was one of the sushi chefs. He then obnoxiously says 'thank you' like a freaking valley girl in front of a full house of people. I kept walking and did not entertain the rudeness and unprofessionalism. 

I noticed the attitude and don't tolerate stuff like this from children with a sushi knife...

I won't come back until I get an apology from that chef. Pity because you guys are right down the street from us. We had been to this location a total of 6 times already. 

Just dumb.


**still waiting on apology**"}
{"text":"I kept hoping for a conveyor belt sushi restaurant to open in Central Phoenix, and we now have one. Sushi Station has the typical offerings of most conveyor belt places, lots of fried stuff and California roll variations. I usually go with the nigiri for a healthier option, where you can actually taste the fish. It's not the best sushi in Phoenix, but the price is obviously the trade off, and everything I've had has been fresh. I've ordered the Oshi pressed sushi with both the tuna and yellowtail and it was delicious. It's nice to have fresh made-to-order options along with the grab-and-eat. Service had always been pleasant and friendly, though a little slow at times when they get busy. This is a great place if you're looking for a reasonably priced healthy meal that wont break the bank."}
{"text":"Finally - a revolving sushi bar in central Phoenix, conveniently located on Camelback near 16th Street  at the eastern end of car-dealership row and with ample parking at the back. The place is very clean and spacious, the staff is very attentive, and the sushi chefs are efficient at replenishing the items on the conveyors. The sushi items themselves are very fresh and there is a wide variety to choose from. As with all revolving sushi restaurants, the prices of the items are indicated by the colors of the plates. For this one, white = $1.75,  blue = $2.25, green = $3.25, yellow = $4.25, and black = $5.25.  The prices, of course, vary with the ingredients and the preparation, from basic inexpensive salmon to more intricate rolls with multiple ingredients including octopus or sea urchin. Expect to see popular familiar items such as shrimp nigiri and spider rolls as well as atypical offerings such as Arizona roll and Explode roll (crawfish salad with spicy crabmeat, avocado, and eel sauce). In all, it's a fun and satisfying dining experience with  prices that are very reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go eat lunch when you don't have a lot of time. Sushi is just average. Sometimes parking is hard to find during lunch time because of the other businesses around."}
{"text":"Cute spot! We don't have any revolving sushi places where I live and always wanted to check one out. The sushi wasn't amongst the freshest I've ever had but I guess you can't expect it to be super fresh if its revolving around for awhile. 

Albacore was really good!

Definitely an experience that sushi lovers should check out.

After we got our bill I realized why there are no revolving sushi places where I live. When there are all you can eat sushi restaurants for $25 and the sushi is fresh and made as you order, revolving sushi probably wouldn't make it."}
{"text":"The best!!!  If only the booths were bigger to accommodate my huge family...  good sushi good pricing.  If its not on the belt just order it!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, called to order to go and told them I'd call back, called about a dozen times no answer finally answered 3 hours later to take my order, what I ended up with was gyoza with no sauce, all the sushi was practically falling apart, no sauce or topping on one of my sexy rolls, 3 packets of soy sauce for 10 rolls of sushi, one pair of chop sticks too."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Super affordable and awesome variety! We took our two little ones who are 7 and 4.  They loved the tempura sushi and also the fruit and potstickers! The conveyer belt is such a cute idea! It was such an enjoyable experience! The food was really fresh! There wasn't a dish I tried that I didn't like! We definitely will be visiting again and hopefully soon! We went on a Saturday night and it was packed which is probably why the food was super fresh. My favorite is salmon and there were so many salmon dishes to choose from! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This revolving sushi bar was not impressive. I sat at the sushi bar, but wasn't able to see much sushi making. The sushi selection didn't look very fresh, so I opted to order from the menu. I placed an order for sashimi, but was given sushi. Not sure how that happened. 

I did pick up edamame from the revolver and it didn't taste quite fresh. 

While I was seated, I looked over on the side of the bar and noticed a small bug crawling along it. It was going away from the food, so I didn't make a fuss about it."}
{"text":"I am so over all these newbs writing bad reviews for sushi joints around town. This revolving sushi concept is not new. It's self explanatory. The sushi is safe to eat. Please get out more.

If you like revolving sushi bars, you'll like the selection at Sushi Station. They have more variety than some of the other places in town. It's cheap, it's fast, and the sushi is pretty good. I went twice in one weekend, because my boyfriend was sad I didn't go with him the first time. 

I gave this place 5 stars, because it is damn good for what it is. Sushi isn't automatically good or bad based on it's location and I wish more people could get that through their thick skulls.

Lastly, if one more person complains about imitation crab while simultaneously complaining that prices are too high ... my head is going to explode from trying to process all the stupidity. Who cares? If you are ordering a California roll ... you are a basic bitch anyway."}
{"text":"Lots of complexed sushis, some I never heard of which is fun however maybe the time of day was bad but it all goes fast. Then you have to have plenty of time on your hands because it seems you have to wait a good ten minutes for the one plate you like to come back around. It would be great if the manager can make more of the popular plates throughout the belt rather than on section... The prices are awesome and the service is ok. Servers, even though the belt does all the work, check to see if you can clear come tray covers so the person next to me doesn't take over my area lol. Also, don't forget to ask if we need utensil, I had to wait for a long while to eat my desert so I had to ask the sushi maker for a fork :( overall, will try again"}
{"text":"I really am a fan of conveyor sushi.
Being able to get my raw fish fix and be stuffed in the $20 range just isn't something I can do at a \"real\" sushi house. And it is nice to have small plates for the ability to have a wider sampling of rolls and nigiri.
Seaweed salad, tai (red snapper), tuna, salmon, several rolls, and the deep fried jalapenos (not authentic...but SO yummy!) and an iced green tea. Stuffed for the rest of the day, and didn't break the budget. Gotta love that!
I've been to this location a couple of times - my house is just about mid-point between here and Teharu in Chandler - and I'll continue to alternate between the two.
Granted, it's not the best sushi around. Fresh, but not the super top notch quality I've been spoiled with. Given the volume, it can't help but be corporate in assembly and have a general cafeteria feel."}
{"text":"I get that it's a revolving belt sushi type joint, and that take away orders may not be the target demographic here. Still, if I call in to place a take away order, please don't tell me to hold, set the phone down and carry on with your business for 7 or 8 minutes, then hang up on me. That's what happened with this place. Either make it dine-in only or teach your employees some phone service manners. Won't be coming back to take away or dine in."}
{"text":"This is place is awesome. Good sushi and very clean.
It is kinda hard to find especially at night. I wish they have like a light sign or something better to help seeing the place!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant because $2.00 for 4pcs of spicy crab roll is a killer deal. I also love the Hawaii roll. The prices are good, there is pretty much unlimited ginger which is good, and the only draw back is that the service is mediocre at best. We also wonder how long it will take before we get sick from eating sushi on a revolving conveyor belt. We have been 9 times and so far so good. I will update Yelp if that ever changes."}
{"text":"Decent sushi at fantastic prices!
I've been driving to Desert Ridge's Sushi Station location for a few years - and am thrilled to have one so close to home now!
They aren't reinventing the sushi wheel, by any means - but it's fresh, close, affordable and convenient.
The restaurant is set up with a conveyor belt, and small plates starting at $1.75. With the affordable prices and small portions, it's easy to enjoy a range of rolls, nigiri and salads without breaking the bank.
There's also a full menu, in case what you're craving doesn't appear on the conveyor - they will make it for you.
I've found the service to be hit or miss - but that's just for drinks, refills, and the initial delivery of wasabi and mixing bowls. The food is constantly circulating - so the service there is unbeatable...you grab what you want when it comes by.
So far, I've been averaging a meal each week since they opened this location - and at these prices, I can keep up that pace without destroying my food budget!"}
{"text":"The is definitely one I have my favorite revolver sushi places. They have this thing called the golden avocado it is a fried avocado with cream cheese and crab meat in it with a fried outside. Best thing on the menu, they are often offer coupons to you for 15% off.. But really best affordable sushi .."}
{"text":"Love this place for a fast meal! The fish is fresh and they keep replenishing the sushi. You can also order off the menu if you don't see what you want on the revolving belt or if sushi isn't your thing. To top of off there is a happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here with the hubs- and we love the place :)  We were able to eat here for significantly less dinero than you typically spend at any other sushi restaurant.  The food comes by on the conveyer belts and the items are price coded by the color plate they are on.  At the end of your meal you just add up the plates for your total.  Each plate comes with 4-6 pieces of sushi- and they also have salads, desserts, appetizers, etc on the belt.  If you are afraid that the sushi has been on the belt for too long or there is something else that you would like that isn't currently on display you can order direct from the bar.  Win win :)"}
{"text":"The revolving aspect is pretty cool, but I've got to admit that I've had better sushi. Many plates were about $1 a piece which is pretty reasonable. One of the plates we got were not fresh. I bit into it and it left a rancid taste in my mouth, ew. 

Anyone who knows me know that I am a huge sushi fan and this kinda let me down."}
{"text":"I never turn down a chance to go, but I typically wait for an invitation. It's way too easy to spend entirely too much money here.

Sushi rolls are fairly on point, but the other menu items run the gamut from \"are you serious?\" to \"hey, this is pretty good\", so sometimes it can be a gamble.

Staff is nice, place is clean, and I do love the concept. Worth a try for any sushi fan."}
{"text":"This place is good and cheap. I wasn't sure what to expect for a conveyor belt sushi place because I've never been to one. I also don't like sushi as much as other people do but I thought this place was good. They also put sliced cucumber in the water, which is refreshing."}
{"text":"First time at Sushi Station.  Kids brought me here for Fathers Day and by the time we left at 5 (we came during happy hour) it was 3/4 full. 

The variety at SS is adequate, with a 100 foot long conveyor winding thru half of the restaurant. The sushi chefs constantly work to keep it stocked with everything from California rolls, spider rolls, Sexy rolls, edamame plates, jalape√±o poppers and a couple dozen more types.

The value is not as top notch as you would experience at a traditional sushi bar: the rolls have more rice and less filling but they tasted fresh. 

I read a lot of reviews regarding poor service. Ours couldn't have been better. Our server brought wasabi, ginger and drinks plus she checked on us numerous times, kept our drinks full and kept our table clear of excess. 

Sushi Station is certainly a gimmick but it is a fun place to gather for fanciful sushi. The greatest advantage is that you get to see and try pieces you always wondered about but didn't want to spend $8 for a whole roll. It's only $1.25-$4.25 per four pieces here."}
{"text":"I love this place, so many things to choose from and everything was fresh. You can't beat the price and it was fun watching the sushi pass by."}
{"text":"It was my second time here and it's so disappointing. I'm enjoying the sushi until I ordered the steamed gyoza. It's still cold inside! She just microwaved it but did not replace the one I already bit. So I told her that I do not want the gyoza anymore. She gladly took it off my bill. But as I said, the sushi was good though."}
{"text":"OMG I am so happy they open on this location!
They sushi is really really good..
Try service is really friendly..
Its really close by my place..this a heaven!!
Ohhh yeahhh
Sushi station .."}
{"text":"Solid 3. Nothing really makes you go \"Holy Cow!\", but every dish we had made us go \"mmmmm, that's good.\" Excellent place to take a date. Watching carousel can fill voids in conversation for first timers, the seasoned couple can sit and talk about all the stuff that would be good to try. Very friendly staff and a really good overall experience."}
{"text":"Good place to hit up if you want somewhere  cheap and fast. The sushi is okay. I think the whole idea is a fantastic one where you can literally watch your food come to you on the conveyor belt. I would imagine this would be a great place to bring kids to because it is a high energy place and fun to be in. I prefer my sushi rolls somewhere else, but would definitely come back if a friend wanted to go here."}
{"text":"Average sushi but lots of fun.  I love just taking things off the conveyer belt.  Alcohol is also a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This place has good food but horrible customer service. They used to be wonderful and it was such a treat when I would drive thirty minutes just to eat here. I probably pass 25 sushi places just to get here and it was always worth it but the past couple times it has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's the only sushi place I go to! The food is fresh, always tastes great, price is unbeatable, and everyone there is so nice and always on the ball! I recommend it to anyone wanting a great sushi place that's affordable!"}
{"text":"Food is good. The place is clean, maybe overly... unfortunately, the strong smell of bleach did not sit well with me as I ate. The service was fast however no napkins on the table and you don't get any unless you ask for it."}
{"text":"The absolute best thing about this place is it's super convenient. I love that I can be in and out of here in 15 minutes if I need to. The servers are very friendly and you cannot beat the prices. This definitely is NOT high end sushi but I don't think it's meant to be. Definitely way better than grabbing an old roll from the grocery store case. Come during happy hour, the plates are so cheap."}
{"text":"As we all know, sushi is generally quite expensive - and it has therefore been a rare treat for us in the past. Having moved recently to the PV area and checked out this awesome little sushi train place we've decided to make it a little more regular of an event. Sushi Station's prices are lower, for a start, and while it's not the absolute best sushi I've ever had, it certainly suffices! My 8-year-old loves the train idea and has even tried other types of sushi than the usual shrimp one - I think it's because he can see stuff trundling by to pluck up the courage to give something a shot rather than ordering blind off a menu. The rainbow rolls, spicy crab rolls and other old favourites (even squid!) roll by regularly, and even after stuffing ourselves to capacity we were only down $45 last visit. Usually that amount of food would have costed upwards of $70, knowing my near-insatiable appetite. Worth coming to for a quick, fun sushi night with friends, although at times it can get pretty packed (and there's hardly any waiting space, you literally have to crowd in and around a wall - standing room only). They need to put long benchs down the sides as standing for 45 mins one night recently grew old real fast."}
{"text":"Informal spot we hit cuz pita jungle next door was telling us it was a 15 min wait would of been longer we assumed.

Anywaaaays the place was quant, clean, and the staff were really nice!
Loved the attention they were sweet.

The food, they brought us wasabi... 
So I've never been to a place that has food on a conveyer belt... So it was a new experience for me, which at first I thought to be suspect... as I said they were really nice with the explanation & requests'.

The rolls/ plates I tried were labeled as spicy but I didn't think they were and had cream cheese in it? I only took it cuz it was something different n new to me. Likewise the other roll was baked scallops on rolls???  It's baked cheese so it was a familiar flavor as well as the scallops. 

I'd go back nothing scary about it but I'd try other things and they had ALOT of options to choose from."}
{"text":"This was fun! My first time eating sushi. Good service and I liked everything I tried. They let us bring Subway in for the kids. There was good selection and competitive pricing. I had the same concern about freshness that many others have had coming in, but I tried several things that tasted good and came with no stomach issues. If you like sushi, give it a try!"}
{"text":"If revolving doors are a gateway into a building then revolving sushi bars are the gateway to heaven. This place has plenty to devour off of a conveyor belt and a decent sized menu to accompany said belt o' grub. Saki? Yes. Selection? Yes. Will they call you a cab? Probably, I walked. 
Good stuff, man. I recommend going in groups. Just do it."}
{"text":"Really cool concept for sushi and ridiculously cheap, especially if you go during happy hour. How it works is you grab a table and there is a sushi \"boat\" that constantly goes around all the tables and you choose what you want. There are different color plates that mean different prices and they have a big variety. They also have a regular menu with regular japanese restaurant items (at regular japanese restaurant prices). Our server, Ciara, was really attentive and kept making sure our drinks were full. You can eat well for under $10 here."}
{"text":"Quick lunch on Camelback. The sushi is pretty good and there is enough traffic that it all looks pretty fresh. 

Sometimes it can take a few to get a drink and some wasabi (or the check) - wait staff seems a bit disorganized."}
{"text":"I love this place! The conveyor belt sushi is fun and food is good.  I recommend the hot green tea for beverage, and the Jalapeno Poppers. The poppers are my fave and a hot commodity so grab them if you see them. 
I do not recommend coming in 45mins to closing. It won't be fresh. Come in right before peak dinner times and the choices are better."}
{"text":"No...just no - nothing was fresh besides the sweet potato roll and it was HOT from the sweet potato just being cooked.

I'm giving it two stars based on the server doing the right thing.
I seek out places that offer hot kitchen dishes as well as sushi as my husband doesn't eat a variety of sushi like I do, so being able to order him some teriyaki and fried rice was the perfect combo so I could get my sushi on.

However, I was not able to get my sushi on, at all.
Everything was stale except the sweet potato roll mentioned above.
The tuna was not good quality and really hard to bite into.
The ginger container was nasty, super nasty.  (unlike when in japan, but how can i compare japan to Arizona, lol)  The seaweed salad was almost warm, very off putting.

The beef teriyaki was beyond....hate to say it...disgusting.
I don't know any teriyaki sauce that tastes like that, rather it tasted like straight up oyster sauce, a really bad version of it.  And the meat itself was not good.  The fried rice was simple white rice with frozen mixed veg mixed it, nothing fried about it....bland as can be.

They deep fry their gyoza for speed, I would have preferred pan fried where just the bottoms were done, so I could taste the filling properly instead of just fried outside.

In the end, they took off the teriyaki and gave us a discount, but it still is not enough to get us to come back, sadly."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite local sushi places. It's super fast, cheap, fun, and the sushi is not terrible.  The staff is always friendly and they keep the selections going on the conveyer belt.  If you want a place to grab a quick bite and enjoy some descent sushi check it out"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprise by this place! I have been to a few conveyer belt sushi places and the selections have been decent and quality pretty good. But this place had an amazing selection and the quality was great for rolls. There had to be 10-15 different rolled I wanted to try and probably 30+ different rolls total. I got there shortly after 11 and more things came out as the lunch rush was picking up. So excellent selection, decent prices, and everything was tasty."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't too sure if I wanted to eat at this place because the thought of sushi working it's way around a room sorta freaked me out but then one day, I decided to do it and I AM SO HAPPY I DID! I love this place and my kids love it even more!!! Beautiful selection of sushi and NOW you can finally sample different sushi at a low cost!! We loved it so much the first time we went again the next day and we will be back!!!!! Try this place, it's fun, easy and delish!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times. Love the selection and the revolving belt. Great prices during happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Revolving sushi belt is awesome! Makes picking and choosing super easy. It's cool how's it's color coordinated so you know how much each one and if you like getting a lot of samples instead of entire rolls it's perfect. Definitely reasonably priced as well compared to other near by sushi places."}
{"text":"This is the greatest thing EVER!  We came in here starving and u get to immediately eat with the conveyer belt..oh happy happy joy joy!!"}
{"text":"It's a new location & their second branch recently opened. It's location is surrounding the mass auto dealers.. I don't know how that's going to be for business. But once their it was a new system for me as a New Yorker to accept. They way of offering their sushi was on a belt that has the food going around the entire restaurant. You could pick out what ever you want to eat.. I didn't find a lot of options on it.. It was more likely made to serve what the majority wanted or what they had an overstock of. We seen a lot of eel on the plates and I don't like eel. Of course you can order from the menu which they gave out at the beginning. The cool part is you don't have to wait for the food the food is already on a belt coming around passing your table the moment you are seated. Service was a bit slow.. Needed improvement but over all of those never experience the new belt system of serving food.. You enjoy the experience the first time & the second time you realize the need of improvement on their service end.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie - pulling up it doesn't have much curb appeal. The first time we thought it was closed and whenever I bring people there they ask if they are closed because there's a portion that looks like office space right next to the restaurant itself. Definitely a cool experience and pretty good sushi!"}
{"text":"I have been to the other location at Camelback and I have to say I like this one better. It is tucked away on the left-hand side of the road across from Desert Ridge Mall. Parking is a little hinky and sought after.

I went with the GF Girl as we had some returns to do at the mall and were jonesin' for sushi. Knowing that sushi can be spendy, we compromised and went here. This is what I like about conveyor belt sushi. It tempts you to try different things that you may not normally try. The prices are very decent- $1.75 - $4.50, depending on the color of the plate. The plates have at least two pieces of sushi, so you can always share if you want to try your neighbor's choice.  There is usually tuna, salmon, shrimp (ibi), octopus (tako), squid, yellowtail,crab, sweet egg, red snapper nigiri. Lots of different rolls (we like the spider roll) that range from mild to Sriracha/jalape√±o hot. Seaweed salad, cucumber salad, edamame, gyoza, egg rolls., etc. You can ask for miso soup, at an extra charge. They also have a menu with other hot dishes if sushi is not your thing. Dessert comes around on the plates- tiramisu, cheesecake, red bean cake, little eclairs, chocolate mousse.

Our server was good though as the restaurant started to fill up, it took a little longer to Flag them down but that was to be expected. Pretty hopping on a Friday night.

We usually escape for about $18-$25 pp. You can take your receipt and go next door for fro-yo and they will give you a 10% discount. :)"}
{"text":"After out running errands last Sunday, my eldest college-aged son kept mentioning that the Sushi Station was open. He wanted to check it out.  I was a bit apprehensive. I've known about the previous restaurants that have been at that location. Guess what? This is not a greasy, bulk food buffet!                                             I was feeling a bit peckish and  disappointed that our usual sushi joint wasn't running their happy hour specials but the others sushi eaters in the house convinced me to go.        So did the customer who was just leaving, saying: \" This was my first time here and I like sushi. I was pleasantly surprised. You're going to love it!\"  When you go in, you pass by cool marble and a Zen water fountain. The inside has been tastefully updated with rice paper lanterns, Koi paintings, Feng shui  colors and strategically placed tables and booths around the sushi conveyor belt. There were 3 to 4 sushi chefs preparing different bite size plates of all sorts of sushi goodness. They had many different types of roles, pairs including seared tuna, salmon, octopus, squid, shrimp, yellow tail, snapper. Even the more exotic things like  sea cucumber. Many vegetarian delights as well like seasoned seaweed, spring rolls, bean curd, asparagus rolls,tamago, miso soup. Our favorites included: the lady roll, the spider roll, the Grand Canyon, the rainbow roll. And most of all, our way cool waiter Travis. Travis was super attentive, patiently explaining how the sushi station works. He made great menu suggestions on what to try. The nice thing is if you didn't care for any of the sushi rolling past you, and how could you not. We were eating with our eyes! :-) They have a full menu of other tasty hot and cold meals to try. They have a good selection of beer, sake, and soft drinks. Prices from the conveyor belt vary on the plate color with white being a $1.75. To the most expensive plate being $5.25. You stack your finished plates on the table and they tally it up at the end.                                             Thank you Sushi Station. We sounded just like that happy customer we passed on our way in. We told the same things to the new customers we are passing on the way out. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fun and yummy.   I like that each is 3-4 pieces so I can get a variety instead of eating a whole roll of one thing.  Coming back with the kiddos next time!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at the quality of sushi! Thanks to yelps reviews I decided to check this place out even though sushi on a conveyor belt doesn't seem like it would taste fresh. I was pleasantly surprised plus the atmosphere is awesome. Great service, fun concept and great food. You can tell they got a good thing going because it gets very busy. Tip: $10 off your bill if its your bday! Alcohol is a little spendy so if you watch your drinks you can put down some serous sushi for a great price. The record is 30 plates!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Enjoyed our first experience here sitting on the bar side.  Its nice to have this option in Central Phoenix now! Just sit down and graze for awhile, and if you go during happy hour the sushi plates cost even less.  The happy hour selections passing by our booth were varied and refreshed constantly.  That Grand Canyon Roll is still on my mind.  They also did a good job with the interior of this spot which has seen many restaurants come and go over the years.  Our server was very nice and attentive too."}
{"text":"For quick no frills affordable sushi good place I've eaten here many times always fresh and tasty 
Restaurant has always been clean and well organized"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Sushi Station Over 80 times, no joke! The staff is very friendly and the sushi is the best deal in town. You can't beat the happy hour! You will be happy you went, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years. Great restaurant for happy hour or weekend nights. You should expect a 15-20 minute wait during dinner time.. But it is well worth the wait!

Fresh fish with great customer service. Also a fun experience to pickup your food from the moving belt."}
{"text":"Sushi in Arizona...hmmmm...one has to wonder and select carefully (I would guess).  This was a nice find in that it's reasonably priced, the sushi-trolly is a novelty and you get some pretty descent quality sushi and variety.  Price is good and you do get a good amount.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in town. The sushi is generally very fresh, and it's generally decent quality. The prices are competitive and the fact that you can eat immediately upon entering is great. The atmosphere is fine and the service speaks better English than many Chinese restaurants, but not better than most sushi joints."}
{"text":"I'd say you get what you pay for, but the Desert Ridge Sushi Station is actually vastly superior to this location. There's noticeably less variety here; most of the sushi rolls I saw come around were some kind of California roll with different sauces on top. The quality is also noticeably inferior. The pieces were sometimes falling apart, the few options with fish were not that fresh, and I got a little nauseous from the ubiquitous crab mix. 

On the plus side I can at least say that the staff is friendly, but unfortunately they seemed to be a bit short staffed, especially when big parties started arriving with crying toddlers. (Here's a tip: if you're going out to dinner with a group of 10 people, you should probably choose something other than kaiten sushi - most of you won't be able to reach the conveyer belt, people in your party will inevitably start standing up and reaching over people, and the party of two next to you will judge you for your bad planning.) Next time I'll just drive the extra 20 minutes to north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to sushi all I can say at least the price was low absolutely the worst experience they had more deserts than I could imagine I'm here for sushi not cheesecake. Epic fail. Try iron chef or wasabi fresh if you want good food and good value."}
{"text":"\"You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, round, round\"

OK, so it's another sushi conveyor belt. Then again, maybe not. I must say I found this Manchurian Merry Go Round of raw sea creatures a refreshing smorgasbord of generous proportions of high quality food unlike many of its competitors. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Great little place, off the 101 and Tatum. Northwest side of the westbound on ramp. Nice waiter, my 3yr old and I ordered from the menu, conveyor style sushi didn't look super fresh. However, everything we ordered off the menu was delicious.  
Would stop in again."}
{"text":"Sushi station is a new restaurant right on Camelback and 16th. This place is huge but pretty neat with the rotating sushi, my eyes always feel larger than my stomach whenever I eat here. The sushi is fresh and affordable for whichever plates you choose. The best part is choosing what you want to eat and getting to try all kinds of rolls. I have not tried anything off the menu yet, but I've seen a couple dishes and they look delicious. I wish they made the interior of this restaurant a little more decorative, it feels like a cafeteria.

I'm glad a conveyor belt sushi restaurant is now near where I live :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Station is the penultimate reminder of my time in Japan and re-experiencing that here in the States. The sushi was pretty delicious, not high-end, but far above the typical quality you'd expect at a cheaper sushi restaurant. My only sadness is that there aren't hot water taps at the counter for hot matcha green tea. Otherwise, the conveyor-style delivery and atmosphere is pretty spot-on!"}
{"text":"The only other time I've experienced a Sushi-go-round was my visits to Japan. They are all over the place! So I was extremely excited to learn that Sushi Station opened in Phoenix. No, it's not fancy. But it is fun and quick. It was extremely packed when I went so I didn't have any issues with not getting anything fresh. In fact, it was so busy that the most popular custom rolls were getting snatched up before they came around to us. But the prices are extremely reasonable, rolls were tasty  and it was a unique dining experience. I will be back!

Updating my review to 4 stars from 5. Went on a Friday night in August and the rolls were very mediocre and service slow even though it wasn't very busy. Didn't leave any ginger out as they had taken all of the ginger jars off the tables. However, I still love the conveyor belt concept. When I want really great sushi, I'll go to Geisha a Go Go but this is still a fun quick lunch/dinner option close to home."}
{"text":"Ok, if you are a foodie or a \"real\" sushi fan than this place is not for you. 90% of the rolls here have imitation crab meat in them with mayonnaise. Only 1 or 2 rolls actually had raw fish and they were covered in eel sauce and spicy mayonnaise. Not exactly authentic, but ok. Also the rolls are very tiny, and the plates add up. $25 worth of sushi and I was barely full. For about half that price I could have gotten the same amount at any other sushi place.  If California Rolls impress you then by all means chow down at this place, otherwise there are tons of other good sushi places with a lot more variety for cheaper and higher quality."}
{"text":"Such a fun experience. Huge variety of rolls and deserts, they even have Japanese soda. I took my bottomless pit nephew and had a giant stack of plates ...suddenly wondering about the cost of said bottomless pit...pleasantly surprised how inexpensive it was. Clean with polite help with great food, doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"I like my conveyor belt sushi. When I'm hungry, I wanna eat now. It's like a buffet since the food is ready and there's the element of surprise. I really enjoy this place. I'm not a sushi snob, I lived in Tokyo before so I don't want to be impressed; I want something quirky. Quickly."}
{"text":"Love the sushi. Great prices. And you can get to eating as soon as sit down. Cant beat that!"}
{"text":"I recently tried Sushi Station for the first time with my boyfriend. I have always loved sushi, but the boyfriend is the picky eater who just started delving into he wonderful world of sushi. And by that I mean the deep fried rolls and imitation crab. But hey, you gotta start somewhere, right? 

Anyhow, Sushi Station is a great place to go for a convenient and quick meal where you can try a bunch of different rolls/items without having to spend a fortune for one type of roll. You only get about 4-5 pieces per plate, though, which if you do the math comes out to about the same cost for the same amount of food at a traditional sushi joint. 

They've got everything from traditional California rolls, to garden salads, to deep-fried concoctions and everything in between. That being said, some of my favorite things on their conveyor belt are the super fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious salmon nigiri (which comes with 2 pieces per blue plate $2.25), the cucumber salad, and the New Mexico roll. 

What's not to love, right? Not exactly. The service on the other hand has always been lackluster- on every occasion we've been in. Staff is not very personable, is very forgetful of drink refills, and only stops by a few times just to collect the tops of the sushi plates. There was one instance in particular that I remember where our waitress was tending to a table across from us, and she turned to our table and put a tray full of dirty, empty plates on our table as we were eating to chat with the other guests. Very awkward and a bit unsettling to have someone else's scraps inches away from your own food. Oh well. At least it's primarily a \"serve yourself\" concept. I also have to wonder how long each item stays on the conveyor belt. We are usually there for 45 minutes to an hour each time we visit, and there are some items on the belt that I watch go round and round for the duration of the time that we're there. The conveyor is not refrigerated, nor are the items on ice, so it seems like a concern to me. Just make sure to watch what comes and goes from the conveyor and you should be in good shape. 

Our checks usually average anywhere from $25-$35 for the two of us, depending on how hungry we are, which is always a good deal for decent sushi. Aside from the service, I will most definitely return. The sushi is too good to pass up, especially given the selection. Granted, the service leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav places ever. The service is wonderful and it's actually fun to see the sushi on a conveyor belt. My daughter loves their fried rice as well!!"}
{"text":"Man, this place has a great location, a fantastic and fun gimmick, and sushi... but those three things don't outweigh the lackluster of the rest of the picture.  The service is mediocre.  The sushi is mediocre.  The atmosphere is mediocre.  If you're in a jones and you need your fishie fix, stop on in, but do not expect a fully satisfying sushi experience.  If you want that, go to Moto or Akai Hana."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today service was fast and girl helping us was so nice.  One of the best layouts we've been to in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Terrible service! My boyfriend and I felt uncomfortable from the moment we walked in.. We felt rushed when we were eating and the manager continued to stare at us while we ate. The food was great as always but this is the second time we go and we aren't happy with the service."}
{"text":"Reasonably good sushi, but the service really detracted from the experience. Had a mixup with drinks; husband had a Diet Coke that they then refilled with tea and it took a while before we could flag a waiter down to make the correction. Refills on water were also slow. Had to ask three times for some additional wasabi since they were quite stingy with it (and no, I don't dissolve it in soy sauce). Reasonable selection on sushi, which was good, and enjoyed the (nice and warm!) gyoza that came around every now and then."}
{"text":"Five stars for really good sushi priced right.  Great service too."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi, get the Tatum Sushi or the Sizzle. Samantha is the best, the Golden avocado is to die for"}
{"text":"Came for the first time tonight on Carolyn and my quest to try more sushi places.  This place exceeded my expectations.  We had California roll. Spicy crab roll and caterpillar roll and the special of the day, which is not something regular on the menu. Carolyn thought this place was amazing. Rachel liked it too. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Great experience and so much fun. I loved getting to see everything I wanted to order. The round colorful plates made it easy to pick out what I wanted. I love that a sushi roll I wanted but didn't see was easy to request from the chefs. Great place for ladies not outs and great variety of sushi."}
{"text":"Good place for sushi with a selection coming by you every minute. They've recently added more items to the conveyor belt which is nice. The majority of the food is good, I don't have any complaints. I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've tried my fair share of conveyer belt sushi restaurants in Oregon, Hawaii, California and Arizona.  My simple conclusion.... This is the best one I've ever been to!  Normally I want to try every 4th or 5th item that rolls around due to personal preference or based on quality of the roll.  I wanted to try them all!!! The quality was excellent, the Tatum was my favorite and I will be back.

My only reason for not giving 5 stars was because I was sitting near the back where the waiters were cleaning the menus with 409 spray. Kuddos for cleanliness but the overwhelming bleach smell made me want to vomit and killed my appetite, next time I'll ask to be seated somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chose this place because it didn't seem too expensive and was a good halfway point for my nephew to meet us, plus all the good reviews. This place is just okay...the rolls are okay and the service is okay.  Nothing great or even above average and for slightly higher or even the same price of getting happy hour, there are way better options. The food wasn't \"bad\" but could definitely use more flavor than rice.
However, the teriyaki chicken my nephew got was pretty decent. I would not recommend this place as a must go to, but it could work in a pinch."}
{"text":"Great concept! Great prices! Love the conveyor belt concept. It was fresh, reasonable, healthy.... No ambiance but I would go back...We also ordered sashimi off the menu and it was fresh and good..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite revolving sushi place to date, but the last visit seemed like the freshness wasn't there as much.  My daughter loves watching the food pass by and getting items for me, so the enterainment factor is pretty high for her. :-)"}
{"text":"I was shocked when I saw this is a 4 Star restaurant.... we have gotten violently sick 3 times over the years and I don't know why my kids ever go. 

Main issue for us now is food could go around the belt unrefrigerated for hours before you pick it up it would seem. 

We don't plan on going back given so many good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Loooove it. Great food, and there is nothing more exciting than seeing your favorite roll strolling closer and closer to you. The variety of rolls is impressive. Most importantly, the sushi is actually very tasteful."}
{"text":"Great, casual, cheap sushi!
I also like that they have plenty of \"cooked\" sushi options for my mother, who is still terrified of eating raw fish."}
{"text":"While the food here tasted ok there was only 2 items that were really good the spicy tuna handroll and yellowtail scallion hand roll I ordered from the menu. The stuff on the conveyor was ok but when you realize that for many rolls it's 4 pieces for $3.25 it adds up quick.

Ended up with a $30 bill and didn't feel very full. Then within a few hours the stomach issues hit and lasted for 3 days. I can't 100% place the blame here but considering my previous few meals were homemade leftovers from the 2 days prior I would be hard pressed to think that was it.

Also the wait staff seemed disoriented and weren't very attentive for simple things like drinks and dishes for soy sauce.

Sorry but for the price I am driving up the 51 to Moto for better higher quality or heading south to Mido in Tempe for AYCE for $22."}
{"text":"Been a HUGE fan of SS since we moved here. We bring all of our our of town visitors here. We brought my mom here tonight. She was impressed with the sushi. We always order the fried rice and I made my mom a plate. She got really quiet and I looked over to see she was reaching down her throat to pull a long stand of hair out of her mouth that had rice attached to it. As I'm trying not to vomit at the table, I call the elderly lady over to the table, (I'm assuming she's the owner) and she says there's no one that works there with that color hair. Kind of weird that there was a white girl that had the same hair color behind the counter in view. They were nice enough to comp the rice. Sweet of them. We absolutely won't be back."}
{"text":"3.5
Not the best sushi, not the worst sushi. I was excited to come here because they have one of my favorite veggie rolls: sweet potato! Unfortunately it tasted like cardboard. So that was a major bummer. But the avocado roll was very fresh and tasty. I also tried inari for the first time and it was pretty sweet (literally). The service was pretty good, but we got there an hour and a half before closing time and it seemed like the staff was annoyed about that. Still, it was a decent experience and the conveyer belt thing is always a fun time. Maybe we'll go back; maybe not."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a whim after a job interview. This place is great! I've never been before so I started chatting with a gal sitting next to me and she recommended a couple things but I stuck true to my spicy tuna roll which i ordered from a very friendly server since I saw nothing on the conveyor belt. Holy smokes, it was great! I've already bragged about to all my friends. Service and food were great and I'll definitely be back. BTW (I got the job)"}
{"text":"So, I really wanted to like this place. I wasn't expecting amazing sushi, but I was hoping for a place to find quick and cheap lunch time sushi. 

The sushi reminded me of sad pre-packaged grocery store sushi. I wasn't super hungry, so I was able to walk out of the restaurant for under $10 (getting 2 basic rolls). However, my dainty male friend  was still hungry after spending over $20.

Despite the sad sushi and questionable value, I would have given Sushi Station a generous 3 star rating....until they decided to give me an uninvited shower. One of the servers spilled an entire pitcher of ice water on my back. I totally get that mistakes happen, so after the initial shock of having freezing cold water poured all over me I tried not to overreact. The thing that really upset me was the lack of apology from anyone working at the restaurant. No one asked if anything in my purse had been damaged or even if I needed some paper towels! Drenched with ice cold water, I sat there for about 5 minutes before my friend could finally flag someone over to get me paper towels."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and was a bit hesitant when my sister and I arrived at noon and there were plenty of open seats. 

I'd never been to the turn style type of restaurant but quickly became a fan. I liken this style to a Japanese tapas. The conveyer comes around but it's only 3-4 pieces of sushi on the plate. I think this is perfect, so you can try several items, for far less than the regular style....each roll with 10-12 pieces and you gorge yourself beyond comprehension. 

I prefer to nibble and try everything, so this was perfect for me.


Sushi was fresh, prices are reasonable, service is super quick and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Took the father-in-law and kids for an afternoon treat. We wanted to try something different - but still Sushi - and I remembered reading a review about this place on Yelp.

If you don't already know - it is a moving sushi bar. The bar doesn't move, the sushi does - on conveyor belts.

While it was a little trek from my house, I think it was well worth it if just for the experience. The Sushi is above average - but not over the top great. The experience and service of the wait staff is what makes this place shine!

TIP - Order HOT items from the waitress, and get them fresh. That way not soggy (tempura) or warm (other items)."}
{"text":"Over 70 visits to this restaurant!!! Great food and great service! The sushi is great, the assortment is amazing. Being in Desert Ridge makes it very easy to get to. This is great sushi at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Very unique idea. Staff looked bored and unprofessional. Food kinda made me feel like I was going to get food poisoning because it was room temperature but everything tasted fine. Super cheap."}
{"text":"Sushi: 4/5 stars. It's always tasted fresh, but a lot of rolls are deep fried. I especially like the Phoenix Roll, Rock n Roll, and Volcano Roll.

Service: 5/5. I have no complaints. Every time I've gone with my bf, we've never experienced a long wait for a drink refill, or ordering off the menu. Everyone has been pleasant. They have the Belly card and last time I was there, our server offered to take it to the register and swipe it for me.

Price: 5/5. It's already very reasonable at $1.50-$4 for a (half) roll, and up to $5 for sashimi or uni sushi, but they also have happy hour where it's 50 cents off a plate. I found coupons in the Clipper (from the mailbox) as well as online.

Atmosphere: 4/5. It's a mix between a sushi bar and almost a buffet, but the conveyor belt is unique and a fun change of pace. 

I wish you could leave 4.5. I'll give it the 5 because for what it is, I can't see room for improvement. There are plenty of other places that are delicious, but drain my wallet! 


I come here 1-2 times a month, happy to add it to my rotation."}
{"text":"Like a moth to a flame, I totally fall for gimmicky stuff all the time. This is no exception. I absolutely adore having my sushi travel around on a mini conveyor belt. 

At places like these, I've learned that the sushi tends to be fresher when the restaurant is crowded, because the chefs constantly have to replenish the sushi that's been taken off the conveyor belt and I'm not sure what the turn around time is before the sushi is removed (I'm sure there's some secret protocol in place). At noon, the place was boomin'! 

Sushi Station had quite the variety of rolls. Unagi avocado rolls, tempura rolls, Imagine rolls, and Tiger rolls whizzed by on the belt, but by the time I read the description, I had to wait for them to make their \"rounds\" before they made their way back to me again. I just was so mesmerized by the movement though that I was in a trance instead of deciding whether I wanted the roll or not. At similar mobile sushi places, usually there's a sticker dot that indicates the price of the sushi and based on dot color or number of dots, you could tell how much each plate is. Here, there are petite signs that lead each set of rolls out, so you're never confused what each roll is. I like how easy each name was displayed here on clear, neat signs.  There was nigiri also present: maguro (tuna), shake (salmon), seared tuna, and tamago. There was also desserts like carrot cake, tiramisu, and jello traveling around.

In case the food on the conveyor belt wasn't what you were \"jonesing\" for, they also have a regular menu booklet you could flip through and order directly from. I didn't even bother with this because it wasn't as fun. What a short attention span I have!

Overall, sushi was pretty good for what it was worth. My friend and I walked out paying $23 total including tax. Normally at fancier sushi restaurants that would have gotten us two specialty rolls (if that) without drinks. I really like this place. I get my sushi fix while still on a budget and the atmosphere is interactive and fun in itself!"}
{"text":"When they first opened I was so excited for a revolving sushi place to finally be in the neighborhood. But after awhile the specialness wore off and they became less and less crowded and therefore the sushi options revolving around looked bleh. After about the fifth visit my husband and I both got food poisoning. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for good, reasonable and tasty sushi. It's the only conveyor belt sushi I know in town, and is it awesome. They have your standard rolls all the way to more exotic concoctions. Plates are broken down by $1.50, $2, $3, $4, $5 increments- but don't think everything is $5. I eat sushi often and eat a wide variety and when I go to Station, 80% of my plates are $2. I went with my gf, both had a drink and ate until we couldn't anymore...and it was $40 when a typical sushi dinner is around $120-$140. 

Definitely love this place and is now one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Sushi station oh sushi station how you afford me to eat my favorite sushi on a budget. 
Let me count the way I love thee...
Ok so first off, this place has a unique concept, sushi is made and then sent out on a conveyer belt on different color plates which denote the prices. Typically about 4 pieces per plate.
What's neat about this place, especially if you go with a group is that it allows you to sample quite a bit of sushi types by barely spending anything individually. I have been here at least a half dozen times at this point, and should technically have my picture on the wall I have checked in so many times on Belly. 
The place is always clean and usually has a descent crowd, I don't really like sitting at the bar and prefer one of the booths off to the right side when you come in, you get first dibs if you sit over there on all the fresh stuff being put on the conveyer. 
Service has always been good, If you get a chance ask to sit in Tom's section, this guy is on point, always makes sure your drinks are full and is pretty knowledgeable if you have questions. I always spend at least $50 here every time I go. It's hard not to, between two people. There is just to much good stuff to try. 
This isn't your typical sushi bar...but if you like sushi and don't want to wait, this is the spot to go, sushi is ready as soon as you take  a seat...can't beat that. Everything you need is at your table, chop sticks, soy, all the server needs to bring is just drinks and wasabi.  I will be back, since it opened I am here at least 2 times a month."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quick seating for one and there's booths for up to six so I drag friends! Great variety and delicious. I enjoy the sweet potato roll, and all the rolls are always fresh. And of course, I love that I don't have to wait for my food to be prepared since it's waiting for me on the belt!"}
{"text":"One of the rotating tables here in the valley. One that I keep going to. Place is very clean, owner is hands on and very kind. The place is located on a very busy street near auto dealership. And parking is located at the back. NOW that's out of the way let's talk about the sushi. Since I have been here alot I got some things I can reccomend.

(Most of this are cooked/fried)
1. California tempura- a must if you come here.
2. Vegas roll-better than most vegas roll in the area.
3. Santa fe- very mushy and explosion of flavors in your mouth.
4. Playboy roll. Just grab it and try it. You'll thank me later.
5. New Mexico roll. 
6. Jalape√±o poppers. Probably the most crunchy poppers here in the area.

I'll keep coming here. I also tried some other rolls such as , baked scallop, baked mussels, squid salad, California roll- but find that there are better places that represents those."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations of Sushi Station and I love it. I like going for happy hour especially. The quality is hit or miss, but options are slim around here for revolving sushi. The servers are great and friendly. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the price, especially if you know what to choose.  The yellowtail roll is the best thing they have!  It's so tasty!  They also have salmon skin roll and it's best to ask for it to be made fresh...so much better than grabbing one from the conveyor belt.  I like that they have a seaweed salad and spinach plate.  The salad could be better though...it's basically just lettuce!  Boring!  

The first time we came here, there was no salmon skin rolls so I asked for it...now they are always here!  Guess I started a trend! Haha!  I think if there's something you really want, they will make it for you, within reason!  I tend to avoid the fried rolls and the ones with cream cheese...too fatty and filling.  Stick to the fresh fish...yellowtail and salmon are the best here."}
{"text":"We always enjoy stopping a Sushi Station when we are in the area.  We tend to visit late in the afternoon when they are not too busy.  They can get very busy and loud during peak hours.  They have ample staff to keep the conveyor full and special requests only take a few minutes, longer if cooked since there are made to order.  She always gets the baked mussels and scallops, her favorites.  I'll try most new things and the spicier items.  Tatum Roll, Poppers, Spider roll are tasty,  Sushi is good, not the very best quality, but always fresh, never had anything that was not fresh.  
Prices rare very reasonable, we can get in and out for the price of fast food.  If you are shopping at desert ridge, it's worth the drive across Tatam."}
{"text":"After seeing the Grand Opening signs, my wife and I decided to go try their sushi for her birthday. If you're a sushi roll fan, this is the place for you. There were a continuous line of rolls. I, however, am not a fan of rolls so I tried their menu and found sashimi to my delight. The fish was fresh and there was lots of it. The prices are great. We actually ate more than we would normally order at a regular sushi bar and came out $20 cheaper, including tip, than normal. The service was great and the noise was bearable. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  My first time there was absolutely delicious and the sushi was fresh even though other reviews warned about the sushi not being fresh on the conveyor belt.  I noticed that the sushi chef came along and took sushi away so it may have been sushi that was placed on the belt too long ago.  The server was really nice although she or the cashier made a slight mistake on our bill...but we had it corrected.  I would definitely come back to Sushi Station and recommend it to people."}
{"text":"Sorry, this place isn't great at all. Its kinda eeky, I was excited because everyone I know is raving about this new sushi on the conveyor belt so of course I wanted to see what the fuss was about. We walked in and the Ora was just a little off. I walked in and you see all the different kinds of sushi just strolling away on this belt. We sat down near the belt and just looked at them pass us by. I was extremely hesitant, just like i am at a buffet. But i was hoping that once someone grabbed a plate the chefs would replace it with fresh sushi. NOPE that was not the case, all 3 chefs just sat there and talked among-st each other. I watched the sushi pass me by for maybe 10 mins before I got the courage to try something. I finally tried it and I was not blown away at all kinda grossed out started thinking \" i haven't seen the chefs switch out any sushi, so how do they know how long its been sitting there.\" so i decided to just get the check and leave maybe ill give it a try again, but i don't see it happening."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with 3 other co-workers and decided to head here. Once arriving we got seated right away. The conveyer belt had a great variety of sushi, salads, desserts, asian sodas....they even had a few rolls with no fish (chicken roll). The plates are all different colors and on on the wall shows the color of the plate and the price of each plate (there were 5 price ranges/plate colors to choose from). What was nice was most rolls were 3-5 pieces, sushi had 2 large pieces, they also had sashimi as well. They even had various desserts and even fruit, jell-o. I had some salmon sushi, a special sushi roll, mussels, Jalape√±o poppers and everything was very, very good! 

The prices of the plates I had were from $2.25 to $4.25.

I will certainly be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to do a 3.5 stars....I have been coming to Sushi Station since they opened. They were great then service got REALLY bad now it's been really good again. I come in once a week for lunch so they are pretty familiar with what I get (as it never changes). I do look forward to my weekly sushi lunches again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! All of the sushi is really good and if you don't see any sushi you want on the conveyor belt, they chefs will make it special for you! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a quick, delicious, and cheap meal."}
{"text":"The sushi is always good every time we come here.   I love the seared tuna and albacore! The service is good for the most part.  Gave it 4 stars because the hostess that was working today was kind of rude. Other than that.. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sit at the bar or a table and pick what you'd like as the wheel turns. Clearly marked signs, affordable pricing, great service. Fun to watch the chefs make the rolls right in front of you. Perfect for groups, singles or couples"}
{"text":"Love conveyor belt Sushi!  I first ate this style of sushi at a train station in London, and have been hooked since.  This is the fast-food of sushi, but done right.  I won't explain the concept because I'm sure several others have done so.  Sushi Station has a lot of options, rolls and nigri that will appeal to most.  I like their salmon nigri best myself.  If you want something not from the conveyor belt you can order directly as well.  Their happy hour deals are fab.  I come here with my husband and my small child.  She loves to watch the conveyor belt go around, and pick out what she wants.  Conveyor belt-style sushi means a quick meal...you grab food off the belt, so you can start eating right away.  You can easily be in and out for lunch or a quick bite before a movie.  My family of 3 ate heartily, including large beers for the adults, at happy hour recently and our bill was under $40.  What a deal.  Fun, tasty, affordable fast-casual fresh sushi, what's not to like?  If you want fancy haute cuisine, look elsewhere....if you want cheap and fun sushi that will even entertain your child, give this place a go."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The concept is great!!!  You come in, get seated and then you can already start eating if the right sushi happens to roll by.  Don't see what you like?  Don't worry! Either be happily mesmerized as the sushi rolls by on the conveyor belt until something does, and something will, peak your interest or have your waiter/waitress assist you and grab the sushi you want if it isn't within arms reach. 

Great variety of sushi, fast and efficient service, and the price is hard to beat!  Everything is reasonably priced.  I love that you can get your classic California or Philly roll as well as try some of the new roll creations made by the sushi chefs.  

They play music and you are surrounded by pictures of previous guests that have dined there.  It's a really welcoming experience, even for those shy and new to the sushi scene.

I could eat here every day, no problem :-)"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night for the first time with a few friends, and it was fun!  The experience was unique, I've never been to a sushi place before that has the \"revolving\" sushi going around the restaurant, and you just pick up whatever you want!  I like this because you know exactly what you are paying for.  Each plate of sushi is color coordinated with a price, anywhere from $1.50-5.00 not bad at all!

The hawaii roll was personally my favorite.  The staff was very nice, and not annoying.  I would go back for sure, but at the same time I probably wouldn't go on a regular basis to be honest, because I think I would get sort of tired of their selections.  It's a must try at least for the fun experience."}
{"text":"Decent sushi but found a piece of metal in my last roll and almost swallowed it. I Informed the server and I believe one of the managers came up to us next and informed \"it may have been from a scrubber. This rarely happens.\" 
Sounds like it's happen before. Be aware"}
{"text":"It's not the best sushi in the world, but it's decent and you can eat until you're full and not spend a small fortune."}
{"text":"Man, Sushi was \"ok\". Nothing spectacular and a little pricey. Service was good; the waitress checked on me twice. One critique on the service is they need to get better at busting table man. When i came in, there was a stack of sushi dish a few chair next to me and it stayed there for 15 minutes man. WTH, it annoyed me cause those plates were always on my side vision. Anyway when they finally cleared the plates, they didn't wipe the table off. I could still see the stain. WTH man. The Japanese girlt hat works there is cute. i like her better than i like the sushi."}
{"text":"First time we went for my step-daughters birthday since she wanted Sushi. We loved it. I let them know that we were new to this and our waitress went into how it works. She was so helpful and gave us great service. LOVED the rolls, tried a little bit of everything. They have great desserts on the belt along with the sushi. I would go again, well actually I might be going on Friday since we liked it so much. Look on their website they have \"specials\" that they will let you know about. This is a must try."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for quick, cheap sushi. It's a rotating sushi bar so don't expect anything too fancy but all the rolls I've had have been excellent. My favorites are the Arizona Roll and Tatum Roll. this is quickly becoming one of my regular places."}
{"text":"Ok to be fair I am not a Sushi guy at all. I grew up in Ohio and I love my comfort food, should I raise the review a star just because I am not a fan of it. Meh, I guess not.

With that being said its growing on me, we came here to try and eat a bit more healthy. The bad in that is about all I can stand to eat are the fried items (again not a sushi guy but its growing on me) and the deserts. I guess its all ok.

Now that I have returned for a second visit I have a few thoughts. The rotation of food that is passing by is pretty amazing and looks pretty good! The bad on this is (with the fried items) that chances of you getting a freshly (at least warm) fried item is pretty slim even at lunch. Lucky for us we were sat at the first two booths that get the first pick of items as the cook places them out for grabs. After waiting for a few rounds the fresh selection is on my table and tastes pretty good!

The first time I was here I just went ahead and ordered a drink thinking it would be around the normal price and had a bit of sticker shock when the bill came. This place is by no means an expensive place but the drink prices make you think twice about that, yeah I'll have the water. You don't need any of those other drinks to enjoy this place.

The staff is great, I never had to worry about my free water getting topped off and that about all they are there for other then clearing your table afterwords. Speaking of there is a menu full of there good options but who wants to do that when one can just pick and choose as your food stolls by begging to be on your table.

The restaurant itself is clean but a bit dated, who cares you are not eating here for the wow factor in decor. I love the color coded plates but when they start to stack up you realize its time to back off a bit and get the check while skipping desert and by the way that would be a bad decision. I asked about their deserts and from what I am told (from the staff) is that a good portion of them came from the Cheesecake Factory! I really don't know if this it true or not but it tastes so good! 

I will be back, would I skip going to my other favorite places (all near by) just to come here? sorry but that's a no, I leave this place feeling like something (taste?) is missing."}
{"text":"I placed a large order for pick up, and was pleasantly surprised that everything was 100% correct and fresh and delicious!  Thank you for making my sushi day with my kiddos awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is more fun than yum!

I totally dig the production line-like conveyor belt the sushi rolls are going around on! This place totally caught my eye as I first walked in.  However, the sushi and rolls are pretty basic.  Nothing too fancy or exotic that would entice my sense or palate.  You have your Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crunchy Tuna, Philly, and Vegas etc.  The cool thing is they do have the Japanese Sodas floating around too.  Other than that, I think it's fun to look at the food passing by and guessing what they are.  

Service is good, no doubt and the ambience is very fast foody with some Asian flair.  I would say come for HH to make things a little more interesting with a few drinks.  If you're a beginner Sushi eater than this is the place to start! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed my last visit.  Sushi quality has gone downhill or something.. What is normally cold sushi was literally at room temperature. The hot items were literally at room temperature as well.  My stomach did not feel too well for 2 days after my visit here.."}
{"text":"Its a fun place to eat. I used to come here more often when they first opened a few years ago. I was excited to have conveyor belt sushi (kaiten-zushi) restaurant so close to my office, that means quick lunch and only eat what I want.

They mostly offer rolls, it is interesting to watch food goes by and think about how they came up with those crazy name.  Staff behind the bars/belts work really hard, trying to keep up with the demand.  Server was a bit slow on their service the day I visited.  Food quality is .... you get what you paid for.

Still a good place to visit when you are not that hungry, want to eat small portion quick.  You get to start eating as soon as you sit down if you want."}
{"text":"Took a client there for lunch.   He had the shrimp teriyaki and I wasn't hungry but had the deep fried vanilla ice cream.

I asked to have the ice cream brought out at the time his lunch was brought, but the server brought it out at the same time she brought out his miso soup.    It was mainly dough -- I was told it was like what they use for the tempura.   I kept digging around in the dough, and there was probably about a tablespoon of the ice cream.   Otherwise, most of it was the dough, which was barely edible.

I tried the broccoli in his teriyaki.   I don't know what kind of sauce it is, but nothing I'd like.   It was thin and basically tasted rather commercial -- a bad version of commercial.   He wasn't too pleased with his food, but did eat the shrimp.

The server, Emily, was helpful, friendly and professional.   I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Are you guys stretched thin now that you have multiple locations? I stopped by with the family about thirty minutes ago and waited about 10 minutes without getting seated. It was hardly busy yet all the tables needed to be cleaned. At least four wait staff looked at me as I stood there without any verbal acknowledgment. Needless to say, we left."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant. The prices can't be beat (especially during happy hour), the sushi is always amazing, there is a great selection, it's fast, and we always leave full and happy. If there's a roll you want to try that's not on the conveyer belt, you can request it. Also I used to spend $40+ on sushi at other places, but I spend about $10-15 here. Because they're half rolls it's much cheaper and you can try more varieties. Just awesome, seriously."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Restaurant claims to close at 10pm on Saturdays.  I came in at 945 and the hostess said they were closed. We came a long ways and she acted like she couldn't care less. No where on website or door says they do not close at 945"}
{"text":"Thanks for food poisoning the crap out of me on 4/7/2018.  I have never taken so many painful shits in my life.   By the way you were the only meal I had yesterday.  Screw this place!!!!!!!!  Please refund me my money...j dont pay to be poisoned."}
{"text":"Decent quality sushi. That comes to you. Constantly and without much waiting.... Need I say more?

I've been a fan of Sushi Station since I started going to the location up at Desert Ridge. Driving down Camelback and seeing this location was now open was music to my ears (sometimes the 30 minute drive up North just doesn't seem worth it).

This location seems more spacious than the other - and included all my go-to favorites (there's one spicy shrimp roll I can't get enough of) as well as some new delights. I especially enjoy getting to try several small bites of different things without it breaking the bank - although I've been known to go a little HAM and eat a few too many plates when hungry. My record so far is ~$36 in plates that don't cost more than ~4 a piece. Care to challenge my mad sushi eating skills?

The one critique I might make - I LOVE yellowtail. And although you can order items not on the conveyor belt that do have yellowtail, they aren't typically included in the standard rotation and finding your waitress can be a little challenging if they're especially busy. Regardless, 4 well deserved stars."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to have to leave a bad review for a place I really enjoyed going with my family and friends. However, last night while dining there with a friend, 2 different sushi chefs dropped food on the floor and very quickly picked up and put back on plates to serve to customers. When the first chef dropped something,  he picked it up, a female server witnessed it and tried to discreetly shake her head no. He didn't listen, he put more sauce on the plate and served. Unfortunately, not knowing which plate or what type of roll, in a sea of plates he set down(he set several types of plates down quickly), we were unable to grab it and take it off the belt. The 2nd time, in a span of less than 40 min a chef dropped a gyoza dumpling on the floor and discreetly placed it back on a plate, again in a sea of plates filled with dumplings.  We were shocked, quickly paid our bill and brought this to the attention of our server who then told, I'm assuming management.  The manager proceeded to address the chefs, they all turned and stared at us and began talking. No apologies or even a single word from management was said. No one approached us to find out what we saw. We left disappointed, sad and NEVER dining there again. I find this very disturbing and disgusting, how many times has this happened and no one saw it? Twice in less than 40 min and no hesitation to serve it anyway, tells me it happens a lot.  I'm sorry friends that enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I have to say my Brother-in-Law come here all the time but this is the first time we came here this late. We arrived around 8.30 on a Friday night. The server was attentive but there was no food coming around. Just deserts & edamame. We got tired of waiting and spent a ton of money on Sashimi. (The entrees never came by on the conveyer belt) So my bill was twice as expensive as usual. I only gave 2 stars as the Sashimi was really good otherwise it would have been 1 star. We have been coming here for years but this was not a good experience. Not happy."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. Revolving sushi bar where you take plates of what you want and they add them up when you pay your bill? Sounds like great fun. Except that it wasn't. 
In order to pull off this sort of thing you need good sushi. I don't think I had one plate that I actually liked. Most of it was almost lukewarm and it definitely didn't taste fresh. Heavy sauces, iffy fish, the works. Yes, it was inexpensive, but it didn't sit well. The place was also too casual for sushi and too loud for a conversation. We were up near the prep station at the bar, but I would hate to be in the back of the restaurant getting the sushi no one closer to the front wanted. Sure, we ate till we were full and the bill was only $30 but I didn't enjoy it. I'd have rather paid a bit more for better sushi and eaten less of it."}
{"text":"Super cheap for sushi, not bad quality either. I am a big sharer, so go with some friends and you end up spending about $10 a piece. The plates are color coded so you can see how much your bill will come to.

Always ask for eel sauce. Eel sauce is the condiment of gods."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for lunch, as this spot is pretty close to my work. If you're looking for someplace quick to get good sushi, this is it! I wouldn't say this is the best sushi I've ever had but it will definitely satisfy that sushi craving. Some of the names of the rolls definitely crack me up...playboy roll? Sexy roll? LOL!

All in all, good place to check out."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to eat at. We went there today as we walked in the girl at the counter never greeted us. When we told her how much was in our party she just slowly walked to set up a table large enough for us to sit on. As we sat down we never received any water asked for wasabi she never brought it. We ended up walking out 20mins later than the owner wanted to charge us for items we had taken off the belt and never ate. It was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had and would not ever go back to this location. We politely told her we were not happy with the service and was going to leave. She tried to convince us to stay and we told her nope!!!! She lost out on a ton of money this day and goes to show you why this location is so slow and there are only two waitress's!!! The service sucks here!!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant!  They have a conveyor system that you will either love or hate, depending on how far you are from the sushi station.  The food is priced per plate, but it is still very reasonable.  If you are planning on going for Happy Hour, get there towards the beginning, it can fill up fast and take awhile to rotate through the customers.  The staff is very attentive, even if they don't appear to be.  They don't hover over your table, but they magically arrive at the exact moment your soda goes empty.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi at a good price."}
{"text":"Used to going to chandler for the rotating options however this place was awesome! Not crowded but the sushi was fresh and they were constantly adding new options. 
Service was fast and very friendly. Will be coming back. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for a quick bite of sushi and aren't too fussy about quality, then this place is spot on.  Tons of options just keep passing buy so it's easy to see something you like.  You grab what you want and they restock as it swings by the sushi bar.

Or do they?  I ended up coming to this place two days in a row and suspiciously enough there were some rolls that seemed to have the same number plates as it did the day before.  The one plate of \"sushi daily special\" was still going around.

They also offer a menu which allowed me to order some hamachi but it was still just a step above supermarket sushi.  Prices about the same as a supermarket which makes it easy eat a bunch of fish.

The one odd thing is that you have to ask for wasabi and then they bring you a bunch of it.  Pretty sure it's extra."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome and unique! My newest favorite place to eat! Service is great, the decor and vibe is super cool and chill. The colors are bright and make you happy to be here. I love how quickly I can come in, get stuffed and get right back to work or whatever. Awesome place, try it once."}
{"text":"I love this place! You come in and nab your little plates and nom your little sushi noms! You can rack up a big tab pretty fast, so don't let the low price per-plate trick you into building up a tower that crushes your weekend budget, but I love love LOVE the pay-as-you-go approach.

My favorites are the seaweed salad, the salmon nigiri and the Philadelphia roll, which is pretty much what I would get at any sushi place. They have a few vegetarian rolls, but I can't say I would recommend this for vegetarians, and definitely not vegans. 

The staff here are also super friendly and a big part of why I keep coming back as well.

tl;dr This is a great place to go for happy hour + sushi or a fun dinner spot that won't break the bank. Vive la Sushi Station!"}
{"text":"I love coming here and getting the scalloped sushi very delicious  however the service here really lacks and depends on the day. Every time I come we have a hard time getting service. My sister even had to stand for 10 min to try and get someone to come so we could order, after we already waited an additional 10 min. Overall though best place for sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I love their scalloped sushi it is absolutely my favorite and this is the only place I have seen this specific kind at. Highly recommend trying their food. (:"}
{"text":"I love this place. You get great sushi for good price. The staff are great. Great sushi great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If your think is value for your bucks, this is a great place for that. When it comes to food though, and specially sushi, I prefer higher quality. 
The belt is a concept I experienced before in South Africa and LOVED. Does not need to mean cheap but at the station it does."}
{"text":"Sushi Station is great!  The staff is very welcoming and takes excellent care of your needs!  It's fun to see the varied selection of sushi and desserts that travels to you by conveyer belt service--no waiting if you are starving!  Also, if you would like customized sushi that is terrific, too!  We loved the uni, sweet shrimp, Tokyo Roll and the Spooky Roll!  The price of sushi is reasonable and Sushi Station has a Happy Hour which we are looking forward to enjoying!"}
{"text":"Wow.... I'm really shocked at the reviews! The atmosphere sucks! The sushi was bland, not fresh at all! The scary part,  the conveyor should be refrigerated, and it wasn't! I travel all over and I have never had such horrible sushi! The only thing good about this place is the price..."}
{"text":"The turn over here is fast and fresh.  Had a great time! So much fun watching the conveyor belt go by and getting excited when something you want comes by.  Very entertaining."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch!!! I went in and ordered my meal and it took less than 5 minutes!!! So delicious for its price and the workers are so nice! I stuck with the simple rolls today - California roll, tuna and avocado, and tuna and cream cheese! They come four pieces to an order but each order is only like $1.50 or $2.00! I will definitely be a regular on work days!!!!"}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi rocks!  We've been here a handful of times with our young children (just there last night) and by some miracle every time we visit Sushi Station, my husband and I are able to enjoy a decent meal without being interrupted by our kids.  They are too busy watching the revolving small plates of sushi and munching down on the shrimp shumai, edamame and jello.

As for sushi quality, I would give this place a solid B+.  For the price, you won't find better sushi in town.  I can get a 2-piece order of Nigiri Sake (salmon) for $2...and it's sushi grade fish!   We have towering empty plates at our table and the bill for 4 averages $50, sake bombers included! 

For serious sushi fans, this place might not rock for you.  My husband and I are serious sushi lovers (we met at a sushi bar back in the mid 90's), so if it's a sushi date night in town we go see Mo at Toyama or head to Roka Akor or Pure."}
{"text":"This place is super fun especially if you have little kids to make having sushi an experience.  My son loves to sit at the countertop area and watch all the different sushi go by then pick what he wants to eat.
The good thing too is the fact that the portions are smaller so if you're a kid you can try a varieties of dishes to discover what you like to eat and as the parent, you're not breaking the bank as your kid is embarking on this culinary adventure.
My son has a great time here.  He will ask to come here and happily for me, each time he'll pick up his favorites like salmon sushi and California roll but he will also pick out one or two new dishes to try.
It's great to come here during happy hour which is when I try to go as both my son and I can get fill up on sushi for around $12 for the two of us.
I can't imagine this happening anywhere else.
The staff is friendly.  Always with a smile and prompt with service."}
{"text":"Great selection, friendly wait staff.  I love the concept especially since I'm exploring sushi more and more.  Loved the New Mexico roll.  It had great flavor.  They always have a great dessert selection including lemon cake!  

On top of that my friend has a 10%off card.  Less than $40 for dinner.  Kaching!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Had to travel to the one in far North Phoenix. Glad there is one minutes from my place. Very convenient. Sushi is good but because it's on a conveyer belt, you should know what you want. Everything is simplified and the location is great. I'll be dropping by a few times. It's about time Central Phoenix has a place like this. Try the Inari and Maguro Sashimi. The building is not that great but the ambiance is great, especially when you have other sushi lovers around you. The only bad thing I would say is, I wish they would appeal to higher end people and adults. When I went, there were way too many children but maybe because it was a Chinese Buffet before? I don't know. Give this place a try. The manager was really nice and I hope this place does well. It's definitely a first in this area."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and it's become my safety sushi spot. It's always filled with people, but I've never waited to be seated. Everything tastes good, most items are $2 a plate, and there's a lot of interesting rolls. In short, it's good sushi at reasonable prices with fast service. Compared to Teharu Sushi (another revolving sushi joint), this place has more variety...albeit you'll feel it ever so slightly in your wallet. Expect to pay about $20 after tip with no alcohol, but you'll be full and satisfied. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Portions are small, most of the food tastes pretty bland, service definitely lacking and on top of that it's pretty pricey for what you get. Save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sushi Station off Camelback is better. Service is slower here, the rolls are very old & can be cold. My girlfriend got food poisoning from this location"}
{"text":"You get with what you pay for. Good quality revolving belt sushi, the staff works hard to make sure fresh sushi keeps coming out and they want to make sure you are doing ok. I am a regular of this location!"}
{"text":"It was ok... The atmosphere was very cafeteria like. When I go to a sushi place, atmosphere is key. Even if it was on the lower priced end, it was uncomfortable. The sushi was marginal at best."}
{"text":"Sushi Station is a good place to go for some quick sushi, especially if you have the kids with you.  Prices are very reasonable and the food is good. Not a \"gourmet\" type of sushi bar,  but they have all the basic dishes you usually encounter.  If you don't see a baked scallop roll on the conveyor,  just ask your server and they'll bring you one - they are yummy. 

The bill for us with the kids usually ranges from 40-60 bucks, which isn't bad at all for what you get. Service us slow when they are busy and the conveyor gets empty fast. But, be patient or just ask your server for a dish and they'll get it for you!"}
{"text":"Mediocre quality fish at a good price.  Tuna was such a fake color of bright red I think it was dyed (yes they do this).  Yellowtail was worse than average.  Spicy tuna rolls were good.  Great for a quick meal but not one that you want to enjoy with some fres fish."}
{"text":"Bland. At one point, saw one sushi chef, if you can even call him that, continued making sushi using a piece of tuna which he accidentally put an take-out box on..."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is my third time here and I cannot get enough of it! You walk in, your seated, and then you get to experience the Sushi station's revolving conveyor belt of goodness! Everything tastes amazing and is so fresh! Their sushi selection consists of anything and everything you can think of. From Las Vegas roles, to sashimi, to California roles, Phoenix Roles, Spicy Tuna and everything in between. And all are priced between $2- $5 a plate and during happy hour they are .50 cent off!! Each plate has abou 4 to 6 rolls, so you only need 4 or 5 plates to get full, so not bad for a light lunch or dinner.

Also, if there is something you want that you cannot find on the belt you can order it from their extensive menu! They have tons of sushi and other types of dishes on their menu! I definitely recommend Sushi Station for fresh and a wide variety of sushi items!! Happy Hunting!"}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time tonight and it was great! Love all the sushi options revolving around the room; the sushi was fresh and delicious. Even my 3 year old loved watching all the plates go by. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good! This was our first time here and its our new favorite. We normally go to Teharu when we want quick sushi, but this place beats it. The way they do their rolls are better. The frying is actually fluffy crunchy and tastey. 
The way the conveyor belt wraps around making sure it goes by every table, is absolutely amazing compared to Teharu. We will definitely be returning here when we're in the area. Or we might just ditch Teharu and start coming here. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I'be been a customer of this establishment since they opened. Sadly, I've seen their service and their food decline over the years and last night was the worst experience I've ever had here. We witnessed favoritism, prim seating, service and attention given to a family that was clearly a close aquantance and who arrived much later than us. We saw our waitress maybe twice and demanded her attention for the little things such as a straw, wasabi, and a clean plate (the first one she gave us had old rice plastered to it). We even had to request our check?! Most horrific was watching the same plate of tuna pass us numerous times and seeing it discolor with each round. Overall, my family agreed that this was our last meal here! We're going to Sushi Brokers where the atmosphere, service and food have never wavered!"}
{"text":"I need to update my review. I took my husband here for lunch on a Saturday. I found on this experience to be sushi for the masses. We haven't ordered from the menu so I don't know if there is a different experience. 
I don't think we will return.
I really enjoy a sustainable sushi experience instead of the conveyor.
The service is great though but the thrill is gone for me."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and reasonable in price! They have some really yummy rolls. Go at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I have been to the sushi station on camelback and I wasn't impressed, but I decided to try this location because I wanted quick and easy service for sushi. The service here is 150% better than the other one. Our server was friendly, attentive and offered my baby a high chair. Sushi was also better- fresh and most were delicious. The only one I wouldn't recommend is their \"Todays special\" roll. Only because you don't know what's in it. I got it because it was fried so I thought it would be amazing and I took one bite, it definitely was not. I'm not even sure what was in it, but I think it was chicken. Chicken in a roll? No thanks.

I also ordered a teriyaki beef entree and that was not that great either. Prices are reasonable and stick to the sushi that you are familiar with and you will have a four or five star experience."}
{"text":"It's Friday and I wanted sushi!! I came here based on yelp and it is so close to me. I've never experienced a revolving sushi bar before so I was excited to head down here and try it out! Lots of parking so no problems there.When we walk in, the place is pretty big, they can use a decorator, and the service - let's just say they can improve on it. 

We were seated next to the revolver - cool concept especially if you are a visual person. The prices were extremely reasonable so you don't have to worry about breaking the bank. We  tried four different rolls - don't ask me what because I just took the ones that look good. The flavors weren't bad - no problems there. We ordered two drinks - a wine and a beer. Guess what? They don't do happy hour prices on a Friday. Stupid, right? Anyway, we ordered the drinks anyway. Our server didn't even go over how this whole concept works, how the color of the plate determines the price and how they give you a check when you say you are done. We kind of just asked whichever employee who passed by these questions.
It was quite irritating.

So while I am looking at this conveyor belt full of sushi, all these questions come to my mind: 1) How do they know how long a sushi plate has been on the conveyor belt? 2)How do they know if a plate is no good anymore since we are in room temperature 3) What do they do with all their inventory at the end of the night and how do they control spoilage? 

All these questions going through my mind didn't stop me from eating. The pinot noir I had was a little too warm for me. We paid our bill - less than $30 for four plates, two alcoholic beverages = not bad. We were in and out of there in half an hour so this would be a great place to go for a quick lunch.

After the experience, I was ready to give this place three stars. However, half an hour later - I wasn't feeling all that well. I wouldn't necessarily say I had food poisoning, but I may have eaten a few things that my stomach didn't agree with."}
{"text":"I love the conveyor belt concept, where you can pick whichever sushi you want. Prices are extremely decent and sushi was tastey."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always fresh and quick. I usually sit at the bar and I'm in and out in a half hour, even if I order from the menu. Perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised. I had driven by the place several times and was a bit skeptical because I had the memory of the horrible buffet that resided there before it became a rotating sushi bar. 

My friend and I arrived for dinner around 6 pm and service was great! There was no one waiting to be seated before us so we were greeted immediately, waited about three or four minutes to be seated, and had an awesome waitress who checked on us several times throughout out our entire stay. I wish I could remember her name because our cups where never dry and our table was aways cleaned; she was excellent! I don't know if we just got the one good server they have or service has gotten better since people wrote other reviews. 

Sushi was delish! Everything was fresh and flavorful and plenty of options to make everyone happy. Sure there are better more extravagant sushi bars but this place is great enough to continue returning to unless I encounter the bad service other reviewers experienced."}
{"text":"I love this place. A great sushi selection and great prices. The staff is friendly and helpful. The sushi tastes good overall, only tried one roll that I didn't like."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to try new things, see something interesting? Grab it off the conveyor belt and give it a shot.

The prices are good, and I am really fond of the way I can sit down and get started pretty much right away without having to wait 10 minutes before my order is taken, then another 15-20 to have it brought, you just place a drink order and grab and go.

And if there is something you don't see on the belt, just ask for it, the service for special orders is surprisingly fast.

I really with they had a more extended happy hour on the sushi, but I can't really blame them, the prices are already pretty good. I can eat here for less than most other sushi places, and I can get in and out the door in 20 minutes easily, even with the kids in tow.

Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"The service has gotten rocky. The wait staff seem undertrained because they're slow and inattentive. Took forever for water, and took forever for our check. They never checked if we needed anything, and we don't need much considering its a self-serving sushi conveyer belt. The food is very good though and the experience in general is fun! I would check it out, but expect to be there a little longer than you want."}
{"text":"Great concept and service but the sushi is mediocre at best.  The sushi is made from pre-sliced packaged fish, squid was very chewy and hard in some spots, baked calamari did not taste fresh (I could not finish), seaweed salad had a lot of liquid and needed to be strained more after defrosting, the cream puffs looked like they came from Costco, we could see the carrot cake deconstructing every time it passed us, and they may mix up your check with the person next to you!  
While our check was cheaper than expected (from mixing up checks) and they did run out the door to return a phone someone left, we will most likely not return.
Great service but mediocre food."}
{"text":"Very unpleasant experience here. The sushi tasted warm. And very expensive. $80 for 2 adults and 1 child. Also the servers absolutely refuse to help any patron outside of their section. Even telling us that the \"cannot help us\" and we will have to wait for our guy. \"Napkins\" I said and she said \"Yea you still have to ask your guy..\" with damn napkins in her front apron. I guess it's because the tip is added automatically so the serves don't have to give any sort of quality service to deserve the tip. NEVER EVER GOING HERE AGAIN, SUPER UNPLEASANT, UNSATISFYING FIRST/LAST VISIT. Save your money and visit Tomos Japanese cuisine in Avondale for quality food and service."}
{"text":"I've never loved this place but I'll give it the extra star because my fianc√© did at one point. He loves sashimi - found this place and he likes the way it's cut here so he would go all the time, usually by himself because I've never thought it was that great. Tonight blew my mind. We went for dinner and had already grabbed couple plates off the belt. Fianc√© had ordered his salmon sashimi. Fianc√© grabs a seaweed salad off the belt, takes the lid off, puts his chopsticks in and a fly flops out. It's laying on the counter squirming all over in front of us....and our server walks up with the sashimi. Fianc√© tells her sorry, can't eat anymore, too grossed out. She brings us our bill aaaaand...still charged us for the sashimi! Awesome business practices. Really disappointing because now he's lost his favorite lunch spot. Had they actually corrected the problem maybe we could have given it another shot. Stuff like that can happen but to just say sorry and charge for an item we didn't even touch is crazy."}
{"text":"I think people come here for the concept... The rolls are okay. They're cheap so you can't really expect too much. My favorites are the imagine roll ($4) and crunchy spicy salmon ($2 but soooo good!) and it's also half rolls so you can try more items. They get pretty packed sometimes so I always order Togo."}
{"text":"The 4* rating can be a little misleading, because this is NOT amazing sushi.  What it is is reasonable priced decent sushi.  I had 5 plates or so and my bill was like $12.  I felt pretty full, but if this was AYCE I probably would have eaten more.  Wish I could make this a 3 1/2 star review, because 4* just seems too high."}
{"text":"I am way too hooked to this place .. sushi on a conveyer belt? Sign me up! Sushi is priced based on color of plate .. 1.75 2.75 3.75 4.75  and during happy hour it is cheaper. The quality of sushi isn't bad. Actually pretty good and tasty. You just grab your sushi and eat. They also have a menu if grabbing sushi off a conveyer belt isn't your thing. The customer service kinda sucks but I promise you only see your waiter once or twice to get your drinks and to count your plates in order to bill you. Bring a friend or two. There is plenty of space! They accept cash and credit and there is a yummy icecream place attached next door."}
{"text":"Properly priced and great food.  I can eat there for less than 20 bucks and leave full and happy.  Great job, and the belt full of sushi is fun to watch and anticipate what item will come next!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best revolving sushi in the valley.  They have everything you can think of and most of the classic rolls and dishes are only $2 (white plate) to $2.50 (blue plate) each.  The Vegas roll is my favorite and my kids love the Tamago and California Rolls here.  We're going to be coming here from now on instead of Kabuki."}
{"text":"Had a REALY great time here!!! Date night with my sis ... Two conveyor belts with delicious choices of sushi!!! Pretty cool, tags describes what each roll consists of & the different colored plates, tell you the price of what you take!! Very fun!! I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"This places serves sushi and other goodies on a conveyor belt that goes around the entire restaurant.  It was really fun watching the sushi go by.  They also have gyoza, salads, fruit, and other stuff on the conveyor belt.

The prices are very reasonable and the sushi is commensurate with the price.  Sushi was good for the price but not spectacular.  Lots of rolls that were \"cooked\" and had sauces.  I dont like the \"'cooked\" rolls or rolls with sauce on it.  Give me straight up raw sushi.  No baking, frying, or using tempura shrimp.

 We found the rainbow roll with salmon, tuna, and yellow tail to be very good. 

You can also order things from the menu that are not on the conveyor belt like miso soup, tempura, and sashimi.  You pay based on the color and number of plates that you have left over.

Service was really good and friendly.  The manager or owner was checking up on everyone to make sure that service was good.

This is place is really hidden.  Across the street from the Desert Ridge Mall behind a Chase bank.  The restaurant is not easily seen from the street.  The restaurant was fairly busy so word is getting out because if you were just driving by you would not see this place.

I like to support the independent restaurant owner and I hate chain restaurants.  We are here on vacation and wherever we go, we try to stimulate the local economy by shopping at local stores and restaurants.  

Sushi Station just opened in mid-march 2012.  I hope this restaurant the best.  We hope to visit next year since we visit Phoenix every year for Spring Training Baseball."}
{"text":"Sushi Station is one of the best revolving sushi bars I've been to. Located across the street from desert ridge and next to a frozen yogurt shop, Sushi Station provides a central and fun environment for visitors. It get's quite busy during dinner time so try to arrive before 6pm or be prepared to wait to be seated. 

Sushi and other meals are all served along a revolving conveyor where you can pick the plates and rolls that you want, while there are other items on that are made to order. Prices are static and determined by the color of the plate in which they are served on:

White: $1.75
Blue: $2.25
Purple: $3.25
Yellow: $4.25
Black: $5.25

The sushi rolls are not the freshest as they sit on the conveyor belt until they are picked off but the rolls still taste delicious! From the most adventurous to the most plain taste pallet, there's a roll for everyone to choose from. My favorite roll was the Philly Roll, which was packed with salmon, avocado, cream cheese, and rice. 
See menu here: http://www.sushistation88.com/sushi/menu.html

There dessert menu was quite surprising as they cheesecake, a variety of cakes and ice cream to choose from. If you're looking for something different to try, order their Green Tea Fried Ice Cream. This dessert is made with fried doughnut-like breading with green tea ice cream inside, topped with whip cream and a cherry. 

Great restaurant overall and one of the cheapest sushi places you'll find in the Phoenix area! Before visiting Sushi Station, take a look at their site for meal coupons as you can get up to 10% of your entire meal.

{"text":"I no longer bother writing reviews of restaurants with mediocre food.  I only bother if it's really good, or really bad.  And Sushi Station, a \"conveyer belt\" sushi place is... OUTSTANDING!  In Japan carousel sushi is typically the cheapest, and lowest quality.  Ditto for the revolving sushi places I've been in America, like the one out on Bell road.  But not Sushi Station.  Their fish is incredibly fresh.  Their rolls are unique, like the Tempura California roll.  Or the Crab stuffed Jalapeno popper.  Seaweed salad is good.  A lot of Unagi (eel) rolls that rock. Their faux crab stuffing is definitely superior to others, perhaps they mix in some real crab.  It's not goopy, loaded with mayo like most, even upscale sushi houses.  Get there before five and you can have a fantastic AND highly affordable meal.  You pay per plate at a rotisserie Sushi place, certain color plates are certain prices.  But hey, it's ALL affordable here, esp at happy hour.  My buddy, a professional chef AND sushi gourman like myself, we couldn't wait to go back after a single visit.  For the two of us, plus 3-4 items \"to-go\" for his sick GF, we spent $40, not including any alcohol, not happy hour either.   Very reasonable, IMHO, for first rate sushi.  Like Schwarzenegger sez, \"I WILL BE BACK!\""}
{"text":"Huge fan!  I come here for sushi a lot with friends and family.

It's a fun place -- the restaurant is clean, and it's always fun watching the dishes go by on the conveyor belt.  You can see that that sushi is fresh and swapped out by the chefs when it stays on the belt for too long.   (By the way, I've only had the revolving sushi bar, so I can't speak to the rest of the menu.)

I feel that for sushi the price is very reasonable.  There are different colored plates, and each color represents a certain price.  When my fiance and I come here, we usually spend around $20-$25 for the both of us.  

Even if you're not into raw fish, there are dishes for you, too.  They have some delicious gyoza (dumplings), California rolls, sweet potatoes rolls, sushi with teriyaki chicken, and plenty of dessert, etc.  

The service is quick, and everyone is very kind.  Whenever we get drinks, the owner actually gives us a refill in a paper cup to go!  She's super sweet!  

Highly recommend.  It's quick getting in and out, especially if you know what you want.  The food is great!  And the price isn't bad!"}
{"text":"I find the concept behind this place super fun. You sit there and pick your food off of a conveyer belt and pay at the end for whatever you ate according to a color coded plate system. Fun for groups and also makes you eat slower because you most likely have to wait for something awesome to come back to you. 
I have been to this place a couple of times now and every time they have been nice and accomodating. We even kind of demanded to sit in an area they had closed off that day since we went with a car seat and needed more room, and the manager let us sit where we wanted, that was very nice. 

So concept is nice, they are family friendly, food is good and here comes my reason for only 4 starts and I have to admit that the thought of sushi that keeps going around a giant room on a belt all day kind of turns me off. I mean do they have their eyes on the sushi and know which items have been dancing around for hours? I don't know and see, I cannot stop thinking about the fact that I may end up eating something not so fresh or something maybe someone else has touched before me. Luckily,  that hasn't happend ever/yet (don't know about the touching), so far it's more my head that has been messing with me. 

Alternatively, you can order from a menu which would solve the problem but then the fun factor would be gone. I guess the saying \"no risk no fun\" applies to this place!"}
{"text":"The chicken fried rice is main reason why we come here. Over all it was really good and not overly priced. However if you come when they are slow some
Of the rolls may not be too fresh.  But our waiter is more then happy to get it made fresh."}

{"text":"Server (Travis) was really sweet & food options were plenty- you can go with the conveyer belt of half rolls or order off a massive menu. I opted for the line and unfortunately couldn't get past the chewy seaweed and mainly fake crab options. Glad it was like $7 for three little plates but the quality wasn't worth returning."}
{"text":"This place was ONCE great. Tonight was a miserable experience that continued with a filthy table and plates. So we left before they could even give us our waters. Not a care in the world from any of the staff. We were seated last of the three groups that walked in and we were first. If the food was good that's ok, but terrible service always speaks louder than food. Good luck to whoever is next. You are better off buying a frozen pizza for the sake of cleanliness"}
{"text":"It was OK. I'm kind of a snob about my sushi- I mean it is raw fish. I don't really care that the food is rotating around the room, and is room temperature. I know Sushi is truly suppose to be served at room temperature but I prefer mine cold. We did order a few rolls off the menu so that they were fresh, and they did taste better but I've defiantly had much much better sushi at hundreds of other places. Would I return again? No. 

The atmosphere was better than the food. It's entertaining to watch every gab at the food that's rotating around the room, the staff was friendly, which is why I provided 3 starts rather than 1 or 2. 

I didn't think there were many sushi spots nearby but recently found one across the street is dessert ridge and I would highly suggest that one. The food is fresh, great and a massively enjoyable atmosphere and setting."}
{"text":"We came in during the advertised happy hr of 3 to 9. Each plate is 0.50 cents off. The selection is not too bad but I wouldn't give this place more than 2 stars. The service is mediocre and the place could use a lot of cleaning. Beware: the server tried to overcharge us! If not for my spouse, I would have been taken by the sleazy, cheating, server. My spouse took a photo of the number of plates we consumed, as they charge by the plate. thank goodness he did. The server charged me for 1 additional plate! And to add insult, he did not give me the happy hr prices as advertised! Be careful. It will be so easy for this place to overcharge you if you let them. Keep track/take a photo of your total plates and ask for the itemized receipt. Needless to say, we will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but if you show up anywhere near closing time the service is pretty bad. We showed up an hour before they closed on Saturday and they already stopped putting food on the conveyor belt. One of the waitresses started cleaning right in our area and getting up in our personal space. She seemed to have some attitude like we shouldn't be there... Our waitress was nice but she barely came to check on us. When I talk to other people about this location, they always have the same exact complaints..."}
{"text":"This sushi bar is delicious !!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a revolving sushi restaurant. There is just something about sitting at the bar, watching the food go by and grabbing whatever strikes your fancy. I love it. And when the sushi is good, I love it even more. Spoiler alert: the sushi here is good.

Now some sushi snobs might say it's not good, or it's not \"real\" sushi or whatever. It's food on a conveyor belt so you need to adjust your expectations accordingly. For what it is, I thought the rolls were really good. There was one with baked scallops on top that I thought was awesome. My husband special ordered some kind of spicy tuna roll that he thought was excellent. The only one I didn't like was a fried chicken roll - which I should have known better and stayed with the fish. It was just really dry. If it had a sauce with it, it would have been better.

It's a laid back place to stuff your face with sushi rolls. How can you beat it?"}
{"text":"Was yelping around for a new sushi place in my area and this place came up, read some of the review so I thought I would give it a try. Nice and clean place, staff was very friendly and helpful. You really don't need to look at a menu because every 3-4 seconds something new rolled by your face at the table. Everything was good, I even tried a few things I never even heard of. Overall had a great time and some good food, I will have to return again to check out some more of the cool little plates that roll by the table. hope this is useful in making your choice to come in and check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff.  You can not beat the price and you get to try so many different types of Sushi.  I like that you get to sit down and start eating right away."}
{"text":"This place is a really good value for the money...

They have a lot of options. So if you're looking for decent sushi at a reasonable price then this is the place for you.  However if you're looking for really high-quality sushi and special rolls... Then you're better off at other restaurants.

If you go at the happy hour time... Then you can get the plates even cheaper and it's it even a better value. 

I have eaten here two times now and very happy with the the food and choices.

Great sushi at a great price"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see something nice going into a space where three Asian buffets have failed.  They did a great job on the decor, very clean and a very novel conveyor belt system for the food which was fresh and well prepared though nothing really exceptional.

I have been about 6 times now and the food was always good as long as you don't go to far off the grid (stay away from the Uni).

However, my gripe is the service which is perhaps among the worst of any restaurant I have been to.  Every time!!  You sit ignored with wait staff passing you all the time but acting like they don't see you.  Today was the last time I will go. 

I waited nearly 30 minutes and finally had to stand up and block the path of the waitress to get her to stop.  Then she got rude with me telling me how busy they where however, the entire time, most of the wait staff was standing around talking behind  the register.  I never had so much as a glass of water, paid for my three plates I ate and left."}
{"text":"If your in a hurry and you want good Sushi this is the place for you!  Nice variety and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great variety of fresh sushi ready as soon as you walk in. The staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love revolving sushi restaurants. As far as I know, there are 3 revolving sushi restaurants in Phoenix area, of which I think Sushi Station is the best. A lot of variety is the thing I like the most about this restaurant. About 20 rolls, 15 types of sushi, 5 salads, 5 appetizers and 5 desserts including carrot cake, 3 kinds of cheese cake, chocolate moose cake, cream puffs and jello on the conveyor. Just looking at them moving on the conveyor is a lot of fun.

Sushi Station is not the cheapest of the three. Teharu is the lowest but the quality is not so good. But you can get 10% off coupon from Sushi Station's website. 

The quality of Sushi Station is much higher than Teharu, although it is still the quality I expect for a revolving sushi restaurant but it's good enough, esp for the price. If I want to eat real good sushi, I will go to Shimogamo or other authentic Japanese sushi restaurants but it is the fun experience and reasonable price that I expected from revolving restaurants. So I'm sure I will go back to Sushi Station soon."}
{"text":"The service can kiss my ass, the waiter was an unpleasant. She was passive aggressive and had a slick mouth. Also it was a big unnecessary confusion happening checking out, very frustrating."}
{"text":"If your looking for fast service, fresh sushi and great iced green tea I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not the freshest sushi I've ever tasted, but very creative rolls and I left very pleased with my meal.  Finally, a conveyer belt sushi joint in North PHX/Scottsdale!!!  I'll be back way too often.

Service = 5*
Atmosphere/Ambiance = 4*
Food/Taste = 4*
Overall Experience = 4*"}
{"text":"Our son introduced us to this restaurant.  It's a little challenging to find. It's set back quite away from the street between office buildings. 

It's a novelty - having the sushi dishes go by on a conveyer belt. It helps for those who want to know what a dish looks like first.  Great selections.  And you can still order from the menu. 

It's not fancy, but the servers are nice and you can watch them make the sushi rolls.  

They had several small salads and desserts, lots of non-shellfish options for those who are allergic.  I love the asparagus rolls.  

Makes a fun place to meet friends and take your time and eat as much or little as you choose."}
{"text":"This place is definitely somewhere to go if you are looking for a fun experience! There is a conveyer belt that runs through the whole restaurant and you basically take what you want to eat. It's awesome! The plates are color coded which indicates the price of each item. Everything is reasonably priced and you can easily get in and out of there spending a very reasonable amount. Another great thing about this place was that everything moves really quickly since you aren't waiting on a server or food to be made. I wouldn't recommend this place for \"sushi snobs\" because the food is good, not great. It is also an option to order something off the menu if you don't see what you want on the conveyer belt, or if you want the sushi to be made fresh. This is also a good place for someone who doesn't love sushi because they have some chicken options. My brother and I came here and he doesn't even like sushi and he loved it! All in all, I would come back for a good time but probably wouldn't choose this place if I was looking for amazing sushi."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed by the staff for arguing with me over their soy sauce packets. They insisted that they were gluten free. I got very sick and came back a week later to tell them.  I asked them to show me the box the packets came in. And they did. Nothing said gluten-free. And then finally the manager says it doesn't say wheat on the package anywhere. They obviously don't know what gluten is. And it scares me. Since I have a very sensitive allergy and they're very uneducated. I asked to speak to the owner but she hasn't called me back yet."}
{"text":"Fast, affordable, and yummy. Gave it a 4 because I'm curious about how long the food rotates. If your looking for good fish don't come here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quick, friendly service and good prices. It's fun to eat conveyer belt style!"}
{"text":"Always a fun, go-to for casual sushi. It's easy to order an item you want specifically or grab some new stuff and try it. Seaweed salad was our new dish and pretty good tho not as \"pickled\" as I expected. Sushi is fresh and some fun dishes like jalape√±o poppers and great gyoza."}
{"text":"They stop making good roles 1.5 hours before they close -- do not come here late.  Also there website offered a March 10% discount they already discontinued as of March 11th per our waitress."}
{"text":"This place is just ok , it's nice to sit down and eat right away ... But I was worried about how fresh the Sushi was and how long or how many laps the sushi/raw fish has been going around the conveyor belt ... That alone is kinda scary to me . I grabbed the freshest looking rolls I could find and they had good flavor , not gourmet fresh flavor but just good. The prices are crazy cheap which I think is where all the 5 star reviews come from .. My stomach hurt for 2 days afterwards , not sure if it was from the fish sitting out on the conveyor belts for who knows how long or if it was from mostly all the rolls being made with that mayonnaise stuff . I never actually saw them take away anything that had been out for to long in my opinion . 
Cool concept , I suppose I'd prefer to pay more $ and know my raw fish is fresh and kept cool ."}
{"text":"Just went there this afternoon for the first time, and I'm in love with this place. It's so simple yet so great. You sit down, order a drink, then just start grabbing sushi as it rolls along this little conveyor belt. The sushi are all labeled and priced, and have a nice selection. They also have other things like dumplings, salads and such. Also, they have Happy Hour from 3 to 6, worth it. So if your cravin sushi and dont want to sit and wait a long time at a traditional restaurant then check this place out."}
{"text":"(conveyor belt of sushi rolling by)

LAS VEGAS ROLL:  Check. Me. Out. Baby. I'm tantalizing. I've got some BBQ eel, masago for real, and a cream cheese seal. Deep fried, hun. Find me on a purple plate. And. Don't be intimidated by my crab stick's weight. Pick, me, up, for my three dolla rate.

(more sushi rolling by)

TATUM ROLL:  Ooooh. Pick me! Pick me! I'm kinda sorta spicy. Try me and you will see. Crawfish. Crabstick. Avoca-DOH. I'm really super artsy. I'm really super pretty. I'm really super tasty. Try me if you're gutsy.

CATERPILLAR ROLL:  Fresh green, fresh green. I'm pretty much the queen. My sliced avocado is the best I've ever seen. Cute sauce, cute sauce. With colors like a boss. If you don't get me, it will be your loss.

(wasabi kicking in)

WASABI:  I. Am. Strong. I'll give you a high. A tingle in your nose then a tear in your eye. Sinuses, goodbye. By the end of your meal, I will hear you sigh.

(small bowls of ice cream appear)

ICE CREAM:  Heeeeey. Did someone my name? Say you saw I'm free and no charge you'll be to blame. Just be sure to eat me with no shame.

(check rolls in)

CHECK:  Best part is, that this new biz, is cheap for it's wiz. Eight dollars, Ms."}
{"text":"Revolving sushi is supposed to be cheap and not the best quality. So i give you a 3 star, i have had better conveyor belt style sushi before. It is nice to have one of these close to where you live. Good for eating on a budget. The prices for drinks here is a little steep. Especially since you are by dessert ridge which has some places to buy adult beverages for cheaper. Suck it up and eat your dinner with out any adult beverage and head across the busy street to dessert ridge."}
{"text":"Really terrible service. 2 servers 4 patrons and I still had to get up to get my check. The rice is hard and the fish is so so. If you want revolving sushi go to teharu.."}
{"text":"It had been a while since the last time I went out for sushi, so I was open to trying Sushi Station upon arriving in Phoenix. When I stepped inside with our party, we were all surprised with a greeting from busy wait staff... And a giant conveyor belt whisking sushi all around the restaurant! This conveyor belt drew us in.

 And then, the conveyor belt delivered our meals. I tried the Las Vegas Roll (naturally), the Sexy Roll, and the Spicy Seafood Roll. The Vegas Roll was my favorite of the three, because it represents my adopted hometown and somehow barbequed eel, masago, & cream cheese make for a great menage a trois. The Sexy Roll was also quite good, as the eel sauce managed to make tempura shrimp even better than it otherwise is alone. 

The Spicy Seafood Roll was OK, but IMHO nothing to write home about. Other than that, I was plesantly surprised by this joint... Especially when considering how affordable it is! I had all this and a glass of plum wine, yet my first PHX dinner clocked in under $20 even after tax & tip!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the style of sushi they offer! I go a lot.. like once a week or so, and I've always been happy. It's quick and for the price of the sushi compared to quality you can't beat it. Definitly a dangerous spot to land at if you had a bit to drink, the sushi goes down quick and the wonderful assortment of colored plates start stacking pretty high. The servers really only bring you water/drinks and the check, so I try to tip the servers and chef's pretty equal, and the chefs are always super grateful for anything you throw in their tip jar. Cool place if you want a lot of different sushi for cheap, check it out!"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat! Great pricing and tasty sushi. I enjoyed watching the sushi travel around the restaurant on little conveyor belts. There was so much to try I will have to go back soon!"}
{"text":"So first things first - It's a revolving sushi bar and the sushi rolls are anywhere from $1.50 to $5.00 a roll. The rolls aren't anything super fancy and most of them include some form of krab mix, something deep fried and or a creamy sauce. It's not a high end Nobu joint where you are getting really beautiful, fresh cuts of fish.... But frankly if you are craving sushi and don't want to break the bank I would totally recommend Sushi Station. Also, If eating food off of a revolving sushi belt isn't your thing, you can order your sushi fresh from their menu."}
{"text":"inexpensive and quick.
i was surprise the food was good and lots of it, pretty much a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened. Sushi is always amazing and top notch. Lately the food tastes not very fresh and the next day my stomach is not feeling good. And the past 4 times we have gone the waitresses are either hanging out near the front or in the back rarely checking up on their guest. On our way out tonight I had to flag a waitress down to get our check. When we were paying I mentioned how lacking the customer service has been the last 4 times we had been there and got I will talk to the other waitresses and i am sorry you had a bad experience. 4 times bad and got nothing else out of it. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The revolving sushi bar is really fun.  Service is friendly, food is decent and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! Pick what you want, try new things and be adventuresome! Took my 14 year old daughter here on a Friday evening. It was busy, but we were seated immediately. We were given a menu and out drink order was taken. Pretty self-explanatory. You take what you want off of the conveyor and get your grub on. We spent 40.00, and were so stuffed that we considered napping in the car.  This is not crazy, off the wall hipster sushi it's pretty basic. Most of the favorites go around and I was thankful for that. We will be back, soon."}
{"text":"It's a good spot for a fast sushi lunch. You could literally get in and out of this place within 20 minutes. 
It's worth checking out, just don't expect too much. Everything look fresh and tasted descent, but there is no wow factor when it comes to the food. I usually like to be excited when I have sushi. This place should be renamed Sushi Costco. 
Server was nice, but didn't take much to do that job. Just keep drinks coming and add up the plates. 
I would return. Just not frequent this place."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and when I was craving some on a work break I came on in. 

Once I entered, I'm not going to lie I was very hesitant seeing everything on a moving display with not too many people inside. However after sampling 7 plates, the sushi was actually super good, I was very shocked but also pleased and the cream puffs omg so good!! 

I would def recommend, it may seem scary like how long has this been sitting out but honestly it tasted very fresh to me! 

Also I order just sashimi and the normal sushi (fish and rice) too don't like  he crazy stuff"}
{"text":"this place provides more cooked stuff than raw fish, but their sushi is basically different combination of 3~5 ingredients"}
{"text":"Overpriced sub-par mediocre sushi....and rude people.

We usually go to Teharu in Scottsdale where the same rainbow roll is $2 and made fresh vs. Sushu station which costs $5 and very dry and small. 
I hate leaving bad reviews but it was dimly lit, hard to read off the menu and seating was uncomfortable. 
I paid for the few rolls we attempted but didn't finish and left. 
I understand how reviews work, and im assuming someone is gonna attempt to \"reach out\" to me....please dont, everyone is different and has the right to express their experiences."}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week because I live next door and because the sushi is such high quality. Literally, the sushi is some of the best I've ever had. It's not only a relatively inexpensive place to get your grub on but it's also a fun experience. The only reason why I give it four stars is because sometimes the servers aren't attentive. Otherwise, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Okay so i have heard about this place from a lot of people saying it was good so one day I went to go check it out. I went on a Friday night with some friends and it wasn't very crowded at all.. so the 3 of us got seated right away and the waiter said that he would be right back.Even though I loved the concept of it... the service is not so good. we waited for the waiter to come ask for our drinks for literally 20 MINUTES! So after i waved the guy down, I didn't see what i wanted.. so i called the guy back over (because he never came back around to see if we needed anything)  i asked him for a couple rolls and he said okay and didn't bring them until 20 minutes later. The whole time i saw him in the back by the kitchen messing around with the other girl workers.. i was so upset. I love the food and it a must try but the service is not so good."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for - not much. I found my fish to be tasteless, rubbery, & high on food coloring; spicy is not an actual descriptor; fillers are rampant."}
{"text":"So the food quality is three stars when compared to other sushi places, but the conveyor belt is such a novelty and the service is so friendly.  Therefore, four stars.
A great place to try variety and to take a sushi newbie.  The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Is this the best sushi I ever ate?  No.  Not even close.
But is it a fun environment, with decent rolls, and cheap?  YES!

The sushi comes in small orders starting at around $1.50 and moving up to about $4 or $5.  There's nothing special about the rolls at sushi station, but the price is a lot cheaper than grocery store sushi, and the quality is much better.  The tuna and avocado roll, the salmon and avocado roll, and spicy crunchy salmon roll were all good.  A total of 8 orders for two people came to a little more than $17.  Good deal.

Just a note for some people; Look at the menu.  Every special roll, most appetizers, and most salads have shell fish in it.  It's mostly prepped and can't be changed.  If you have a food allergy, or other dietary restriction, this may not be your sushi place."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for price. But now that they are busy all the time and popular they are not honoring the 10% and 15% coupons on your phone, must be printed and they didn't honor in weekend either. This is different from before. I don't think the manager can appreciate the little savings this creates vs keeping the regular customers happy. I'm not happy."}
{"text":"Not my style at all.  Most of the sushi was below average and wasn't that fresh.  I guess I'm a food snob, but I will get fresh rolled sushi where I know its fresh."}
{"text":"Service is horrible.  Tables were dirty and Sticky.  Definitely do not recommend.  We were waiting to be seated and the lady at the front was bad mouthing us because we were asking to be seated and gave our tables away.  Very rude so we walked out.  Never again"}
{"text":"Revolving sushi place?  Yes please!  I love coming here for the sheer novelty of it alone.  I was most recently here last Friday night and it was packed.  Where we were seated was towards the end of the conveyor belt cycle so a ton of the menu options were already scooped up by other patrons which was a little bit annoying, but this was the first time it was an issue.  The fix to that is to remember what you like and ask your server to go grab it for you (yes, they'll get you whatever you ask for).  I consider this place to be like a sushi treasure hunt.  You never know what's coming down the belt next.
The sushi is far from the best I have ever had but it's quite good and there are plenty of different rolls to choose from.  The prices are also ridiculously reasonable.  Unlike a traditional restaurant, the plate you grab only has three or four pieces of sushi on it, but when you're only paying between $2-$4 for it and consider that you'd pay $12-$14 for a specialty roll at a traditional restaurant, this place is a steal.  I normally eat 5 plates worth of sushi (I always come starving), and my bill is never more than $25.  I'd spend that on two specialty rolls and a drink at a regular place.  The kids really seem to enjoy this place too.  It probably has more to do with watching the food on the belts, but don't shy away from bringing them here.  It's a fun, loud place perfect for kids.
There is a menu you can order from with other options if you or your partner don't dig sushi.  I'd tell you more about it, but to be honest, I've never looked at it once."}
{"text":"First time at this type of restaurant and I was thrilled for the conveyer belt! Even thought the price was very cheap most of the sushi out was mostly the same! I was lucky enough to get a plate of gyoza! The server was nice but disappeared for a bit when we were trying to get the check."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for ten minutes without someone coming over.  I finished eating 20 minutes ago, with no new plates and about half of my water left. One server asked me at the very beginning of my meal if I was okay, but only then. It was dead for a good while and suddenly alive with the dinner rush, both when the servers were sitting down (one girl picking her nails and avoiding my look) to where they were all standing up and walking around, I feel like I may as well have been sitting under an invisibility cloak.  I normally have no qualms about waiting, but that's not the point.

I /hate/ leaving bad reviews (effort and all), especiallyconsidering this is one of my favorite close-by sushi places.  Unfortunately, this has been on a steady decline for me over the course of a year.  This isn't my first incident with bad staff.  Wait staff don't seem to care about being there, the fish doesn't seem very fresh (I'm not a picky eater at all), and I've never liked how thickly cut the salmon and tuna are on top of the nigiri.

The sushi chefs seem to be pretty alright, though, but they also seem like they'd rather be elsewhere.  Honestly, I'm going to give it one more shot before calling it quits."}
{"text":"Just so much fun!

I love the idea, when I saw it on the food network that was showing fun eats in Japan. So I jumped at the chance to go to the rotating sushi bar at Desert Ridge.

I went with a friend, and we enjoyed the variety of items, edemame, carrot cake, asian sodas, cheesecake, poppers.

The food wasnt spectaular ,meaning, there was no flair to the food , just the standard sushi rolls. 

Really fun to go out with a group or date.
I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was very lively downtown. The staff was a bit slow but it was very crowded and a game night. They accidentally put two orders in for the same roll so gave us both and corrected it. Good service. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"First visit here was welcoming and friendly.   There are so many choices and as your eating more and different rolls and items including deserts keep getting added to the revolving belt.  Sushi was pretty good, and of course when your full a new roll comes around.   I will be back.  The only drawback for me was you can't really socialize the way this is set up. That's why I gave it a 4."}
{"text":"I am always a bit hesitant to try a sushi-go-round place. Although the \"hot\" dishes like dumplings and spring rolls were anything but hot, I really did enjoy the sushi. The salmon was my favorite and was very fresh. I ordered the dumplings fresh and they were very tasty. Make a note that their food happy hour menu ends at 5:30 and alcohol ends at 6, I really wish they would extend both through 6. Service is hit or miss but you really just serve yourself. The restaurant is huge and could easily host a large group."}
{"text":"Most excellent dinner spot I've ever been to... ever! I could've just watched the conveyor belt wind its way around and around the restaurant all evening long. The fact that the sushi was interesting and delicious was a bonus. :)

But really, everything was terrific about this restaurant: good food quality, friendly servers, talented sushi chefs, fun atmosphere! It felt more like a place you'd find in Manhattan than in a shopping center in Phoenix. 

You can sit at the bar or in a booth; both options have access to the conveyor belt. You can also order from the menu. There are Japanese sodas and desserts on the belt too. 

Bottom line: Seriously cool place!"}
{"text":"Here is a great little sushi house in phoenix.  The revolving sushi gets you in and out quick if you are in a time crunch.  

The sushi was fresh and good.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The Experience:  4 Stars
First time I went I thought this place was just awesome. Sat at the conveyor belt and just had a blast. It is a really fun, different experience seeing things go by and plucking them off the belt to try. The cool thing is that each plate is roughly in the $3-5 range and has 3-5 pieces of that particular roll so you can try new things without having to get an 8-piece roll like a lot of other places to find out $10-15 later that you actually don't like that roll at all. My waitress was awesome too...friendly, great disposition and made sure that I had my soda refills and anything else I needed. BUT, when I went back during their \"Happy Hour\" a few weeks later the service was completely different. Very slow. Maybe she was new. 

The Food:  3 Stars
Again, first time was much better...surprisingly good. I say that because I expected it to be just OK given the whole conveyor belt scenario, etc. but I thought the food quality was great. I wouldn't call it \"premium\" sushi...but it's just a notch below. I know a lot of people in Phx/Scottdale think Sushi Brokers is great sushi but the sushi here is much better. More variety, better taste, cost is much better and much better service, even at Happy Hour. But again, the food was better the first time. 

Overall I would give them 3.5 stars. Maybe the moral of the story is that it's better not to pull into Sushi Station during Happy Hour but go during regular hours and you'll end up \"Happier\"."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for months and finally did last weekend. The conveyer belt concept is great, you can try a huge variety of sushi you may not otherwise want to commit to just looking at the menu. Everything we had was fresh, but we were eyeballing what was coming out fresh. No complaints, the prices were reasonable and i enjoyed everything I tried, as did my friend. My particular favorites were the squid salad, and the salmon and tuna sashimi and my plain friend liked the california roll and arizona roll. The sake was nice too, but would recommend buying it on happy hour as it was a bit expensive, like $9, so yeah happy hour. Anyway will be back again, for happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"I love the new buffet concept. By having sushi rolling by your table on a conveyer  belt it makes it almost a game. The fish was fresh and delicious! If you love sushi I highly reccomend checking out this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I love sushi station. It's our go to for quick sushi. The rolls and speciality beverages, desserts and appetizers are placed on small plates and put on an \"conveyor belt\" this pushes the food around the restaurant and allows you to simply pick up what you want. It's nice to see your food before you get it! Also, if they don't have what you want you can order it right off the menu, and it's more than just sushi , the menu consists of rice, chicken and \"cooked food\" for those who don't like it raw. 

Brownie points for being connected to Fried Ice and Bubble Tea, you can literally walk next door to get some customer made rolled ice cream and boba!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and the sushi wasn't bad I mean I got what I paid for but this time I ordered it for delivery and after one bite I was literally sick the sushi WAS NOT fresh and the cream cheese was sour. None of it look appetizing and I wish I could get a refund. 

I'm really disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about four times in the last month, so that must say something good to begin with right??  I can stuff myself silly for about $20, and it's better than supermarket quality, but not as good as a few of the restaurants in town.  But for a quick fill you up stop . . . this is the place.  Granted, just this evening, a small party of friends and I had a little difficulty, as they could use a few more waitresses as ours seemed to be responsible for far too big an area and we barely ever saw her except when she was rushing by.  Another small problem was that when i ordered salmon roe sushi, i got just salmon sushi (which i ate anyway since it looked great) and when i tried to reorder it later, I got Smelt roe which is far smaller and obviously different . . . though the waitress wanted to argue that i was getting what i ordered, she repeatedly agreed it was salmon roe that i had ordered, but there before me was smelt roe.  Eventually she took it back and brought me the right order.  The weird thing was is she had a receipt/printout that said salmon roe, so depending on when she printed that out, either she OR the chef got it wrong.  Maybe more pictures are the solution, something to point at, or maybe bridging the language barrier??  I don't know, but that has never happened at any other sushi place i've gone to.  But here's the thing . . . I'll be back to this place anyhow, probably a lot.  The conveyor belt is almost hypnotic, the food is quite good, the price is awesome, maybe just train the waitresses a tad better, but since the food mostly comes to you, who cares."}
{"text":"Seriously how does this place have 4 stars. And, how long does that food fester on that conveyor belt? Sure it's inexpensive and quick, and if that's what you're looking for good for you and you'll be happy with this place. Small beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"Of course,a t these prices, you can't expect truly wonderful sushi. But it's a fun idea and the food is a food value, so it's worth 4 stars. Be careful when ordering from the menu. It seems that the prices are different than if you get it off the belt. At least that was our experience. Off the belt, a sushi dish was one color, but was a different, more expensive color, when we ordered it off the menu. The server did not mention that when we remarked that a sushi we liked had not come by, so she encouraged us to order from the menu. Live and learn."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good sushi place since I moved to Phoenix. Great concept of the revolving sushi bar. I will say it is what it is though. This is not one of those new trendy sushi bars where young people go to drink and then get a California roll and say \"they love sushi\". This is a simplistic spot with real sushi, sashimi and rolls. Nothing fancy to it (except the revolving runway of food in front of you). Loved the simplicity of the pricing as well. Each plate color means a price. 
White= $1.75
Blue= $2.25
Green= $3.25
Yellow= $4.25
Black= $5.25 

Overall pretty great place to get sushi and good prices!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just visited Sushi Station for the first time since we moved here 6 months ago. If you are looking for good, not amazing, but good sushi, in a tight time frame, this is the place to go. I loved the sushi but we are sushi fanatics and there are much better places. But, we were able to get in and out of dinner in less than a half an hour which is great when in a rush or needing to get somewhere else. I would definitely recommend this revolving sushi place."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time and I found it really cool how they had the sushi in different color coded balls on the conveyor belt, where are you just grab the one you want and eat it. They constantly replace the ones missing and they have signs with the names of each different kind of sushi. They had a pretty good variety and you also have the option of sitting on the restaurant side and ordering a meal at the table. 
Prices are according to the color-coded bowls. 
Food was good and tasty.
It was a pretty cool experience and I plan to come back."}
{"text":"Sushi here is good. Interesting rolls but they were all good. Went after lunch rush so some rolls seems like its been there for awhile. The crunchy rolls were stale. So if you want it fresh gotta go during the rush or order from the chefs. But that defeats the purpose of the rotating sushi belt."}
{"text":"Great sushi at even greater prices. 

It's fresh, they have some original creations, and classic favorites. Cuts of sashimi are nice.
I always get the 18oz Sapporo to go with my meal. We enjoy sitting right at the Sushi Bar and pick up whatever looks good at that moment. 
By the end of it we usually stack up 4-5 plates like trophies. Sometimes 6 plates if we haven't eaten all day.

Not sure why some yelpers think its pricey for the quality as we get stuffed (I mean Stuffed!) for under $15 per person every time. Maybe because we don't order off the menu but from the Sushi Bar every time.

+Ample parking and great staff."}
{"text":"I can't believe the high reviews for this place.  We visited on a Sunday and maybe it was the day; but for a good sushi place: you must hit the right notes EVERY day.

Food: The selection was poor and the conveyer was filled with various random items to avoid huge empty space gaps: Orange Juice, Ramune,etc bottles.  A fruit place was just some cut up watermelon.

The taste was weak and quality low; relative to price.  Keep in mind that while plates are marked less than $5; you are actually only getting 1/3 to 1/2 a roll.  Not even a freshly made one, but one that has been circling the line for a while.
The last straw was when I saw one of the \"chefs\" take two bowls of crabmeat salad off the line and dump them back into the large container.  So how long were the plates out on the line and not one took them; that allowed them to \"reconsolidate\" back in the container?  Is this not a FOOD SERVICE health violation??
Iced tea taste was off as well.

Service: Ok from wait staff. \"Chefs\" busy watching Olympics on tv.

Overall: We knocked off 11 plates and paid about $10 less than we typically pay from a solid 5 star sushi place.  It's just not worth it.  Maybe for a first timer to sushi that needs to visualize the items: ok."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi is not always the best sushi but here it is !! Come during happy hour and you'll walk out full and your wallet still packed! Lots of variety and the stuff are friendly."}
{"text":"My only other experience with convener belt sushi was in London and I loved it so I was really excited to hear that one was opened close to me. My friend and I went on a Saturday night and it was packed. Luckily, we only had to wait a couple of minutes before being seated. All of the plates are color coded so you know how much each item costs. They have a lot of different rolls and goodies that slowly go by. My friend and I just sat there for 5 min. watching them all go by before we decided to make a move. They also have a menu too in case you don't see what you want on the belt or if you want sushi (not rolls). The rolls that I got were delicious. I'm not a raw sushi gal so I can't speak for that. The price is super reasonable too. If you love sushi rolls, check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here.
Our server was TERRIBLE.
We saw her maybe twice the entire 1.5 hrs we were there. She was the only Asian server, so someone else may know who I am talking about.
 
The food was fine.  My son got fresh shrimp fried rice, which was good.

The pot stickers were tough to get off the line, of course.  but the ones we did get were nice and fresh.
I must have had 4 plates of the tempura chicken roll.  Easily my fav."}
{"text":"I enjoy some of the rolls that are on the conveyor.  In theory this is a genius idea and normally during the busy times it is fresh and they are constantly swapping  items in and out.  Some rolls I will order directly off the menu though things like handrolls.  Service is ok 
Overall for the value and the fun of the conveyor it's not a bad little joint.  Give them a try"}
{"text":"This place is good enough to keep kids entertained but the sushi leaves much to be desired. 

Most of the sushi is lesser quality fish minced and manipulated so it seems edible. I wasn't a fan. But my kids loved the whole Choo Choo train aspect of the rotating sushi.

Lesson learned. If sitting at a booth, don't crane your neck like I did waiting for something you like. I ended up with a neck-cramp... Just order it straight through your server."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi that's surprisingly inexpensive. The rotating sushi bar has a fun atmosphere and good service as well."}
{"text":"What could be better than watching your sushi choices drift by on a conveyor belt in parade fashion while on a quick or leisurely lunch?  This is a great place to literally get in and out during lunch in less than 20 minutes, and still have decent sushi at a very reasonable price.  I have a few favorite sushi haunts in town that I like much more, but I find myself coming here more and more because the food is so reasonably priced it just makes for a quick and easy lunch.  

Here's a trick I have learned...  The menu prices are the same as the prices for the pre-made sushi, and they come out very quickly.  Try browsing the menu for a few items you like, and just order them off the menu.  For instance, I like their Hawaii Roll, but they top it with eel sauce, and I try to stay away from the carbs.  The solution?  I just order the roll off the menu and ask for no sauce.  It is the same price, but fresh and the way I like it.

Parking can be tough here sometimes, and don't try to park in the short term parking in front of one of the other buildings because you will get cited.  Try parking over towards US Bank and walking about 100 yards or so, it's much easier.

Oh, the reason for the 4 stars?  The service is still a bit inconsistent, and they occasionally bring me something other than what I ordered...  lol   I suppose that because the check is often small they can't attract too much of the top talent to work there.  They are mostly nice though, and some are very good.  I find myself leaving $3 as a minimum tip, even though I am often out of there for $10-$12.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I got to say I'm really impressed! The Happy Hour prices are great and the quality of the food is amazing with the conveyor belt makes it more fun to eat here. Plus the plates are covered and it's fresh! The employees are really friendly and they check up on you every now and then. My Go-To Sushi place from now on!!"}
{"text":"I think my standards are pretty high for sushi. I think this restaurants concept is pretty neat. I really am not used to conveyer belts in this way where I live in the Bay Area of California. But here they only serve half the roll and the quality is pretty low. I wasn't inclined to want to go back. I also used a coupon and the woman wasn't able to show the fact that the 20% was applied to my bill! She just assumed some number when I asked her how much it would have been before the discount. I think more than anything this location was just convenient but I don't think I'll be back when visiting again."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi merry-go-round! That's how to describe Sushi Station. Just sit down and let the sushi, etc..., come to you. The plates are color coded, and they have a display that tells you what each colored plate costs. I had light-as-air spring rolls, shrimp tempura roll, shrimp sushi, seared ahi tuna sushi, and a piece of lemon cake that tasted like a lemon cloud. Every thing was fresh, and the hot items were hot. I can't wait to come back here with my husband!"}
{"text":"It took me a long time to try out the location on camelback because it looks like a hole in the wall, but I kept hearing about people who really love it and after trying it, I'm always bringing sushi lovers back with me to either location. I've been coming here for over a year and now Sushi Station is the only place I think to go when I want sushi (I've even come alone). 

The prices are amazing and the sushi is really good. Because it's revolving, the plates are small and you get to try whatever you want. The prices per place range from about $1.50-4.50 and they're usually about 4 pieces. They also have a happy hour with even lower prices. 

Once when I was here they even had hot dog sushi for kids. Whoa. 

Definitely try it out...You won't spend even half the amount you normally would so you'll have nothing to lose."}
{"text":"OK, this place is a little bit of a hole in the wall. However pretty comfortable with this sushi rolling by my face you get to pick and choose and pay for based on what it is. A lot of fun and the sushi is actually pretty good. Beer is ice cold. Hard to beat the quality versus the price. The only reason for four stars is they don't really serve true blue sushi, mostly rolls."}
{"text":"Great section of sushi and friendly service. The plates are fairly priced as well. I will go out of my way to satisfy my sushi craving and return to the Sushi Station. I recommend the Dragon Roll. Did I mention it's a revolving sushi bar and the quality is amazing"}
{"text":"I've never been to one of these cool conveyor belt places before. With a clientele that clearly overlapped with Golden Corral's, and patrons cycling out almost as fast as the food, I was skeptical. Once I was seated, I was hesitant to grab anything. The concept was so new to me! There were so many choices, I had an overload. 

I think this is a very good format for those wanting to try a vast variety of sushi and a well-balanced meal. Start out with a seaweed salad for $1.75, move on to a few 3-4 piece rolls of decent quality for $3.25 each (look out for good specials on nigiri!), and finish off the night with something like a generous piece of cheesecake for another $2.25. You'll be more than satisfied for around 20 bucks. 

I think this is also a good format if you wanna be a n00b and gorge yourself on the oversupply of California roll variations for just over 2 bucks a pop. Just go nuts, you'll be up to your eyeballs in surimi and spicy mayo in no time. I think too many of the rolls are essentially the same. 

What I don't think this is good for is for anyone looking for heaping portions of good quality sushi. For the price of 2-3 premium plates, you could just go to a traditional sushi bar and get something better. I'd say that's about the limitation of this place. 

Overall, this is a fast and fun dinner option for casual customers. It's a great option to dine on cheap rolls. It's not-so-good for those with really high standards (for either quality or creativity). Just...do it the way I do it and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and the food has been quite good, so I kept coming back.  However, this time was a disaster.  My male server was terrible, took the order and never came back.  Another female server brought the orders and came to check on us to make sure all was fine.  When we finished, the male server showed up with the bill.  I told him he has made a mistake and charged me double in one order, and told me the female server has made the mistake because she was in training and on top of that, he said she had forgotten to charge me one plate.  He went to fix the bill and returned with another mistake in the bill.  I asked for the manager, she never came, so I went all the way to the counter.  She didn't really look like a manager and also blamed the poor new girl in front of her face who had nothing to do with the second mistake.  The so called manager never apologized or made a discount for the inconvenience.  I will not cone back again.  They have list two customers."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ever had sushi and I loved it! The staff was excellent, and everything I ate was good! If I had to pick a favorite I would say the Hawaiian roll buy honestly everything was good!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the plates are a little pricey. The cheapest sushi plate was I believe 1.75, and there was only 2 options in that. Our waiter didn't check on us very often and didn't even bother clearing our table of the 10 lids we had on our table or many napkins and trash we had. Me and my friend wanted a slice of cheesecake, and ordered a piece, the waiter told us that its in the freezer so it might be cold. we had said that was fine. When we got it it was hard as a rock, not because it was cold, but because it was VERY stale and old :( ew. The manager came and took the cheesecake away and denied it was old, but said it was hard because it was in the freezer, but the cheesecake wasn't even cold."}
{"text":"The food is always good but the customer service is horrible. I've waited 10 minutes just to get a plate, wasabi, and soy sauce dish. They need to train their employees better to be more attentive as well."}
{"text":"I never thought I would enjoy a revolving sushi bar. The sushi is fresh. I like the portion sizes & how you can try multiple items. It's also a quick place to go, you can get in and out very fast. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Station. It's such a fun experience to watch all the sushi revolving around the restaurant on the conveyor belts. There is a parking lot to the back of the restaurant, and I have never had issues finding parking. My GPS has a hard time taking me to the exact location, but I wasn't very familiar with the area my first time dining there. In my opinion, Sushi Station is best for a girls' night or guys' night out, or a family dinner with the kids (who would enjoy the novelty of revolving sushi). It's not a particularly elegant location if you're looking for a date spot. It's not the best sushi I've had in Phoenix, but the experience is well worth the trip, in my opinion. The first time I went to Sushi Station, the bathrooms were a complete disaster, but I've never seen it like that sense."}
{"text":"This was certainly a different experience, interesting to say the least. The revolving Sushi Bar you could say was an attraction. You pick what you want as it goes by. I would go during Happy Hour 3-6 pm to check them out. The pricing was reasonable and the food was good. It looked like it attracted a younger crowd. If you want a fun environment with decent food, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I would come here more often but the music they play is so bad it makes me physically ill - they play a rotation of 4 'songs' that each have 4 words - a total of 16 words repeated over and over again - I do like the food however..."}
{"text":"Foods good and can't beat the price. Great place could use a little more of a modern look but other than that I've been here twice already in the pass few months and plan on making a return trip."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and great prices. We went a few months ago and loved it. Employees are always in a positive mood and the sushi tastes so satisfying. We are going tonight again."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!

The revolving sushi belt is efficient and entertaining.

The prices for the dishes range from $1.75 for the daily special, to $6.00 for the custom dishes.

We enjoyed several different selections,  including;

Gyoza
Pan fried pork dumpling

Las Vegas roll
BBQ eel, crabstick, masago & cream cheese, deep fried and topped w/eel sauce

Santa Fe roll
Spicy snow crab, cucumber, typed w/crab strips, avocado, masago, & tempura crunchies

New Mexico roll
Spicy tuna, cream cheese, jalape√±o with spicy mayonnaise & eel sauce

Grand Canyon roll
Spicy tuna, cream cheese, jalape√±o topped w/spicy crab, Tina, eel, &spicy mayonnaise

Tiger roll
Snow crab &avocado,  topped w/ boiled shrimp

Explode roll
Crawfish salad topped with spicy crabmeat and avocado w/eel sauce

Literally everything was amazing, fresh, and delicious. This was one of the best sushi dining experiences I've had in the valley.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when I walked in was the conveyer belt! Looked so fun. I immediately was greeted with a friendly smile didn't even wait 5 minutes to get seated and for my waiter to get my drink order, she was awesome very nice and friendly. As soon as she left I went straight to picking. The sushi is AWESOME!!!! Had 4 plates off the conveyer belt and then ordered a rainbow sushi. Some that I ate from the conveyer belt were a little more on the warm side the one that was actually made from the sushi chef was colder bt price does even it out overall I loved it!! The environment, customer service, and food was the best I highly recommend coming here it's affordable and satisfies your sushi craving. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The sushi was really fishy... It smelt nasty and the salmon was super chewy. I tried at least 8 different rolls and none of them have a good flavor, they all tasted the same.  I wouldn't waste my money here if I were you. There is plenty of other sushi restaurants around that are a hundred times better. If you want a good place that has a rotating sushi belt go to Teharu. Oh, and none of the people look happy to work there. All of them had sour faces and seemed so serious."}
{"text":"It's sushi on a conveyor belt! So this is a concept I'm not new to and is usually one that provides subpar sushi.

I was looking for a quick spot for dinner with my mom and brother after work, so we decided to stop in. The place was crowded, but not packed and was seated promptly.

Different plates indicate different prices, there are names with ingredients next to the plates and all condiments are given at the tables like Ginger, Wasabi and Soy Sauce. You may order off the menu if items on the belt aren't sufficient.

We ended up grabbing different rolls and found some to be way better (more expensive plates), most are filled with fake crab or deep fried. I don't remember the names of which ones we liked best, but the items with spicy tuna or fresh salmon were all pretty good. The only con was that often the same sushi rolls would make rounds, while we waited for something new to come around. I appreciated that they use little plastic \"lids\" instead of saran wrap or leave them exposed to air. They also serve edamame and little desserts on the belt as well, but we passed on those. The plates range from $1.75 to $6 which is very reasonably priced. For three people we ended up leaving pretty full and paying only around $40! There is a happy hour you can also take advantage of from Sunday- Thursday 3-6pm!

Service is okay, it's pretty much a self service type of place. The only time we talked with our server was just to get our waters filled and for our check."}
{"text":"Cool little sushi spot in Phoenix. This conveyor belt/sushi boat style is popular in Northern California however at this spot they seem to excecute it a bit better since the food tastes fresher (maybe we just got lucky)."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some quick sushi.  Love the conveyor belt concept, you pick your fresh sushi right off the belt.  If you want something special they have a very large menu to choose from.  Beer is served cold and with a frosted glass!  Service is great and prices are good.  We will definitely be coming back.  Next door is a yogurt place if you need a little sweet."}
{"text":"We have been here many times. The revolving bar is always a treat. For the price, the sushi is pretty good. Don't order the sashimi. It is more expensive for very little quantity. Stick with the revolving bar."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I lived in Phoenix. Always loved the concept and price is very reasonable too. Came back after 3 years. Sushi tasted good, but didn't taste that fresh today. Hopefully the quality isn't going down. Service is always pretty. Usually they have a wide variety of selection, and if it's not out, you can order. 

Wish we had sushi places like this in SoCal."}
{"text":"So this is not the best sushi but it is a fun concept. Our family enjoys going for happy hour for discounted rolls. The kids love it, eat their food and we get to select what we each want. I sit and watch the sushi chefs constantly make rolls and put them out. They must have some kind of a system to take stuff off the conveyor belt and put it back in the refrigerator (like desserts, fruit) to keep it chilled and semi-fresh. We haven't had anything that wasn't good. The quality is above buffet and supermarket sushi but not up there with a regular sushi restaurant. Now you CAN order stuff made to order but we haven't just because we come for the experience of the conveyor belt. Great for a quick bite since you can sit down and practically start eating. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi! That being said, Sushi Station has \"OK\" sushi. I go here because it's close to where I work and it satisfies my craving for raw fish. 

Like I said, the sushi is good but not fantastic. What makes this place attractive to go to at least once a week is the novelty of the conveyor belt. If you've never been to one of these joints, go. They are pretty neat, and even after going here for a little while now, the novelty still hasn't worn off on me. I just love watching the food go round and round the restaurant. My only recommendation is to go when it's peak lunch time; that way, you are assured of getting the fresh stuff because it's replenished at a faster rate than if the lunch crowd had cleared out.

A few words about the service. Every time I've been there the service has been great. They seat you right away and the wait staff is very attentive. Oh, and another thing I like is that the sushi chef will say hello and they actually recognize you as a regular customer. My only beef is that on the bill they charge a penny for tap water. Now, I know it's \"only a penny,\" but for me it's not the money so much as it is the principle. I have argued many times with the wait staff regarding why they feel they have to do it, but to no avail. Out of protest, I just don't pay the penny. I know I'm being silly, but I stand by my convictions and it just seems silly for them to put a one cent charge on the bill for tap water. No other restaurant does this.

Oh, and get the Hawaii Roll. It is BY FAR the best thing circling the restaurant.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The price is perfect for the sushi you are getting. I've come here a dozen times! The only thing that is a bit bothersome is service lag time. You may be done eating and waiting for the check for 10+ minutes. I've had to call someone over a few times to finally get someone to come over.

If you want decent & simple sushi, then this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Sushi on a conveyer belt. Genius! The staff here is incredibly nice and the food is delicious. My coworkers and I come here often and it is the same fresh tasty food each and every time. So glad we found this place. So quick and convenient..... Give it a shot if you love sushi. They do have menus and made to order dishes but I honestly have never gone that route. The sushi is what keeps bringing us back!"}
{"text":"This place is great - way better than Teharu - service is stellar; reasonably priced; and they have vegetarian options on the conveyor.  This is now my go-to place for a sushi lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVORITE sushi spots. There is always fresh sushi rolling around the belt so there is no wait when you need a quick bite. The prices are very reasonable and there is a large assortment of rolls. Sushi is always great quality and I have always had a good experience here. If you are in the area definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's fun and the sushi is delicious.  They have great combinations/specialty rolls.  The hot entrees are always tasty.  The teriyaki steak, chicken tempura and our favorite fried rice!  

The best part about this place is they will make anything to accommodate your dietary needs.  My husband has a Keto diet so he orders a lot of items without sugar or carbs.  

A couple of tips.  They serve hot items on the conveyer, if you're like it piping hot order those items with your server.  (Gyozas, baked mussels)

Also ask for fresh wasabi - at $1.50 charge, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here when it opened on Saturday morning around 11:15 am (they open at 11 am). We thought we give it a try since my daughter's dance class was 3 miles away. We have experienced the revolving sushi before at a different location in AZ (in Chandler), but thought, this one is closer so why not give it a try?

This place is smaller than Teharu, but definitely had more seating around the revolving sushi belt. We were quickly seated when we arrived. The waiter was extremely nice and brought us our drinks quickly. 

One thing I noticed quickly is that they had the color of the plates and the prices very well broadcast in the restaurant. We had a couple of things: seaweed salad (yum), rainbow roll, dragon roll, shrimp sushi, squid sushi, etc. Everything was great - and seemed fresh (since we were there when they opened). They were also VERY quick when I wanted something I didn't see. The sushi chef made it a priority to get me what I wanted, instead of having me wait, which was a plus.  

At the end of our meal, our hostess came by and chatted with me. I had previously told the waiter that it was our first time and we saw the recommendation on Yelp. She was fascinated and asked if this was our first revolving sushi experience, how we thought of the place, etc. She even gave us a 10% off card for our next visit, which was nice. Definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent affordable sushi. Staff was friendly and attentive. Great selection and everything tastes fresh.  Would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable sushi spot."}
{"text":"Fun place to enjoy decent sushi for A reasonable sum...I stopped in almost every week or so and always have an enjoyable experience...service is terrific And a nice selection of beverages Always available"}
{"text":"We had a decent dinner here last night. The prices were very reasonable and our server was very nice and honestly, quite easy on the eyes. The sushi wasn't as cold as I prefer.  It was more room temperature but the flavor was very good. The shrimp tempura wasn't the best I've had, but for the price it was ok. The one downfall that we observed was that the manager/owner hovered over our server, even telling him to make sure he wrote everything down. I don't know what her reasoning was, perhaps he was in training, but it came off as very unprofessional on her part. This conversation should have happened out of our earshot."}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi I have ever eaten. My family and I left hungry because it was so gross and we were afraid we were going to get sick. They told me they make everything in the morning and just let it go around all day unrefrigerated. I wouldn't even give them a star if I could. We eat sushi 3 days a week. Supermarket sushi is 100% better . Don't waste your money. Go to the supermarket instead. 
Kimberlee"}
{"text":"My kids had so much fun here. We sat them at the conveyor belt so they could grab the sushi as it came around and they had an amazing time. The sushi is really good and for the price point you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for causal sushi. I love the revolving belt and getting to choose my selections easily. In fact, I don't eat raw fish at all, but l Iove the miso soup, seaweed salad, veggie rolls, sweet potato rolls, and other goodies here. If you're looking for an upscale sushi place and upscale prices, this isn't for you. But for what Sushi Station is, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"I was having a craving for sushi so we looked up some places and found this gem! We ordered take out and it was delicious! The lady at the register answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. This will definitely be one of our new favorite spots for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Sushi station is a neat little revolving sushi place. I really love how you can sit down and just grab something off the conveyor and eat it. It's fun to see all the different kinds of sushi and if you don't see something you like you can order off the menu. Sometimes the service can be a little poor and there have been several times that we have waited long periods for our drinks or bill. Overall the sushi is quite delightful and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Truly, considering the price and the amazingly creative selection of sushi items on their conveyor belt, you can't do much better than Sushi Station. My husband and I have eaten here several times, leaving stuffed and fulfilled each time.  Their specialty seems to be fried sushi such as dragon rolls, but everything we've tasted off the belt has been acceptable, and we haven't even felt the need to order anything off the menu.  Even after several trips we haven't sampled everything, not even close. Kitchen and bathroom appear relatively clean too, which is particularly important for a sushi restaurant.  This place isn't high end or gourmet by any means, just common sushi products with a dizzying array of creative and tasty variations.  Fantastic place for lunch or casual dinner."}
{"text":"I love the fact that I can leave here completely stuffed, having tried a number of different fish for under $15. The prices are perfect, but realize that there's a little bit of \"you get what you pay for\" here. There's nothing super amazing on the conveyer belt. There's not a lot of Wow! factor. You get typical looking, tasty sushi for reasonable prices. Nothing was bad, nothing really stood out. I liked everything that went into my mouth, so I was happy and satisfied. If you want exceptional, amazing, oh my god I think my face just exploded from pleasure sushi, don't come here. If you want reasonably priced, tasty, catch your own sushi, this is the place."}
{"text":"Love how unique this place is! The items come on a conveyor belt around the restaurant, which is really awesome to see all the items in person. Everything I have tried I have liked and the colored plates make it very easy to keep track of your tab. The only reason I did not give them five stars is because the service is hit or miss. If you can look past the fact that you may have to ask to have your drink refilled two or three times than I definitely recommend you check it out! PS go for their happy hour! Same great quality and portions but happy hour prices"}
{"text":"They had a good selection of items going around.  We only paid 30 bucks for two of us and that is really good for sushi.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's a revolving sushi bar that serves fresh sushi and creative rolls at great prices.  
If you can't find the roll/item you want, just ask the staff and they are more than obliging.
We have been there while they were busy and while it was slow.  Each time we received excellent service. 
The desserts aren't as impressive (jello!) But then I didn't go there for dessert.
Hopefully this restaurant becomes a mainstay in Desert Ridge.  Will be great to have affordable, high quality places in that area."}
{"text":"I sent back a baked scallop roll because it was cold. I asked for a fresh one and I watched them put it in the toaster and put it back on the conveyor belt (after I ate a piece off of it). So that pretty much did it for us, and we won't be back. They also took 15 minutes to even ask for our drink order..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been over 10 times!! Cheap and good food. Good place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Tucked in a decent plaza with ample parking spots. Looking for a revolving sushi bar and this seemed to have the best ratings. Inside, we were greeted and seated quickly at a table. Staff was nice and prompt with their service. Dishes here are color coded and range from 1.50 and up to 4 dollars. Of course, you can always order a plate fresh along with the other appetizers.

While they do have a large variety, they are almost similar to each other and unfortunately stuffed with sauces, especially the cheesy and imitation crab ones. I ordered a seared tuna and only found it to be cold and drenched with some weird sweet and sour sauce. Otherwise, the rest of the plates were pretty average. This is a place that will fill you up for a decent price."}
{"text":"I had 9 toes when I went to eat here, and the food was so good, I walked out with 9 toes still"}
{"text":"We went there to show my daughter the cool concept of the conveyor belt sushi since she had never been.  I regret our decision more each day since my daughter and I have been sick ever since.  We went their for an early lunch and a movie.  That night it hit and that was Tuesday.  It is now Thursday and my daughter and I are still paying the price.  She had the spicy tuna and some other rolls, I had one piece of one of her rolls and shrimp tempura.  My guess is it was either the shrimp or their grease was rancid.  Who knows."}
{"text":"Great place for quick and fresh sushi. Love the conveyer belt concept. Works well when dining with kids who are impatient and need to eat quick. ;) they have creative sushi rolls as well as a menu you can order from. Must try."}
{"text":"The best hand roll I've ever had!! The service was extremely quick and the customer service was superb! The prices were extremely affordable for the quality of ingredients. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was part of large group.  We had to walk through a maze to make it to our table.   The service was very good considering how large our party was.  The sushi quality was ok.  I liked the large selection on the conveyor belt.    I've been to conveyor belt sushi bars before so I knew it wasn't going to be inexpensive."}
{"text":"The food was average and I think the service could of been better. Our waitress tried to help us out but she was never checking in with us. I had to yell across the room to get her or go find her."}
{"text":"Really cool, fun place. I had some time to kill and since I love sushi I figured I would give it a try. It was really quick since you can grab what you want off the conveyor belt,  which was awesome!  I also ordered two of the special rolls,  which came out quickly.  My server,  Michael, was very sweet as was the other one.  Interesting concept, I like it!"}
{"text":"I don't really come to this part of town ever. This was my friends idea to stop here on our way to downtown Phoenix. It's tucked kinda in a row of businesses. The concept is pretty cool. Sushi is freshly made and comes around on a conveyer belt with descriptions of what everything is. Each plate is color coded with a corresponding price. Easy enough. The sushi was good but it didn't blow my socks off. The wait staff was wonderfully attentive."}
{"text":"My go-to takeout sushi place! They are very quick and the food is fresh when I order directly from the menu."}
{"text":"This is another conveyer belt restaurant.  But there are not a lot of them in Phoenix, so that is just fine.  The rolls are surprisingly good.  They have enough people making such, which is important because this place is very busy.  The price very reasonable.  The wait staff could use some improvement, in that they do not turn the tables fast enough.  Because of the volume at this restaurant, this can be annoying.  Overall, however, this is a place we frequent often!"}
{"text":"Really great place.  Maybe not the best sushi ever, but better than average. I come here for the variety offered by the revolving bar.  After the first few times here I knew which rolls are good (to my taste) and what to avoid. Stay away from the fried calamari and \"surprise\" roll.  I recommend Grand Canyon roll and salmon nigiri-sushi. I'm sure I misspelled that last one. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great concept of conveyor belt sushi! When this restaurant was suggested to me a few weeks ago I was very skeptical about the quality of the food. I had a hard time believing that raw fish on a conveyor belt would be tasty and fresh. Well, I was proven quite wrong. I've already been back a second time with my wife and family who also really enjoyed it. The sushi chefs are in the middle of the conveyor constantly churning out fresh options and placing them on the belt. The overall value is excellent with plates ranging from $1.50 to $5. Both times I've gone I've spent under $18 which is on the less expensive end for sushi. I look forward to more visits."}
{"text":"This place gave me thee worst bout of food poisoning I've ever had. I will never be able to trust sushi again because of this place and it is a favorite. You have betrayed me, Sushi Station with your overpriced plates of vomit death."}
{"text":"Yes! I literally have nothing bad to say about this place!

I stumbled across this place on Yelp in a sushi enraged hunger one day, & I'm so glad I did! There are not enough sushi go rounds in Phoenix, period, so I was so happy to have found one close to home. Both times I've been here the service was friendly & quick. Our last server, Sam, was really great!!

Getting down to business, the sushi here is actually great quality & they have a TON of options! I have been to \"another\" sushi go round in Phoenix, & Sushi Station definitely crushes the competition. I recommend the New Mexico roll, which has a really good taste/texture/& the right amount of kick to it.

If you don't see what you like on the belt, you can ask your server or one of the sushi chefs too.

The hubs & I are definitely gonna be regulars here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Eating here makes me forget Arizona is land locked! Fresh, tasty, and wicked fun!  And that conveyor belt... oh my god! The food comes to me!!  Who wouldn't love that?!  Low prices... There is nothing negative I have to say about this place. I love it."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi you'll ever have but good and super fun! We love coming here and trying a ton of different rolls. The conveyer belt makes for a fun and different experience. All rolls are made fresh as you can see the sushi chefs making them. The best part is its super cheap. Always shocked when we get the bill at how cheap it is."}
{"text":"This is a Great place for affordable sushi! I really enjoyed the ambience. The staff is very friendly and prompt when it comes time to ordering drinks. Also, there pot stickers are delicious and when I got some off the rotator belt they were cold. However, I kindly asked The server for some fresh ones and she got them out quickly to me! I was really wowed! Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely addicted to sushi station. No wait to sit and no wait for the sushi since it's on a revolving belt at the tables."}
{"text":"This spot is good when your hungry. Their happy hour sun-thurs is from 3-5 pm and plates are 50 cents off. We couldn't  wait until 3 to eat but the prices are really  great.

 We were seated at a corner area at the sushi bar. From our spot they loaded freshly made sushi. Yellow plates are 4.50, green 3.50, blue 2.50. 
From what we tried we liked the dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, and the salmon nigiri. The quality is A-okay! This is typical for most revolving sushi places. The desserts didn't look that great. We stuck more with the yellow plates and were happy with them. 

For two people we had about 36 pieces for a good deal. There weren't too many exciting rolls but for a cheap filling lunch with your friends or coworkers this is a place to go! 

Over all this place is 3.5 we didn't  come in with high expectations for the food but were left satisfied. They could improve on service, they didn't  fill our water but the owner on the assembly line close to us helped us. And the sushi chef was nice. Thanks sushi station!"}
{"text":"Alright for a landlocked State sushi place. Food was okay they just didn't have a whole lot of a selection."}
{"text":"So this place is way more affordable than Ra or Nori and you can pick and choose what you want without having to read menu descriptions.

Service is great and if you eat a lot you get a picture on the wall. 

Coming here with a group is a pretty good idea because everyone can judge everyone based on how many sushi plates they grab."}
{"text":"For a CASUAL Sushi meal, Can't be beat!! Other than waiting for something you saw to come back, the convertor belt concept is great!
And you can't beat the price anywhere!!!! 
I will stop by again."}
{"text":"Food: I like this place for a quick sushi fix. The best revolving sushi on my side of town. The baked Scallop Rolls are my favorite as long as they are fresh and hot. I also like the jalape√±os poppers. But the one I love the most is the Tatum sushi which is a piece of Salmon sashimi wrapped around a ball of crab meat and a slice of avocado, for those of you who like sushi w/o Rice. 

Decor: it's bright and fun and loud, they have TVs so if you want to catch the score of the game and sometimes they play K-Pop (Korean pop music) music which is kinda cool.

Service: it's pretty much self serve once you sit down but the staff is always nice and will help you with whatever you need.

Overall: The Best Fast Food sushi you'll find. For the two you'll spend anywhere between $30-50 with tip....just spends on how high you stack your plates."}
{"text":"Nicole LOVES this place. And I get it. The sushi is good, don't get me wrong. Tastes great, as good sushi should.

But every bite is a dollar. Think about that. A dollar per bite. That's not a great bite/dollar ratio. Why is it a dollar per bite? Because conveyor belt sushi is a sales gimmick.

It's the same reason that buying Lucky jeans at Nordstrom costs more than buying Lucky jeans at Costco. At Costco I pick up a pair knowing it's probably good and will likely fit and if I really don't like them I know I can send them back. At Nordstrom shopping is an experience. Jeans are presented on manikins with six-pack abs so I know exactly how they'll look on me. I can really experience them before purchase. Do some Jackie Chan spinning front kicks to see if they're comfortable. Frog hop around the dressing room. Pose like a GQ model with my leg up on the stool running one hand through my hair. And like conveyor belt sushi, at Nordstrom you know the price up front, but you really don't pay attention to it until you get to the register, and, realize, \"holy shit, I'm just paid $10/flying front kick in the dressing room.\"

So is it worth it? I don't know. Would you go do yoga in a beautiful, well-appointed studio floored with bamboo and taught by a bona fide ancient guru if after every session the guru kicked you as hard as he could in the shins? If so, you'll probably love Sushi Station.

Great for: self-disciplined eaters
Bad for: American eaters"}
{"text":"Great service and great value. He servers are super friendly and the food is very good too"}
{"text":"What an interesting concept.  Sushi was B+, A-, Atmosphere A, Service A+"}
{"text":"I guess the Chinese is coming around to invade sushi too.   If you are going for sheer quantity over quality this is place to go.  The variety is excellent, and as far as I am concerned, the sushi wasn't  bad.  Most of the sauces on their rolls are similar either with eel sauce, mayo, or spicy mayo.  Nothing fancy as Bao mentioned.  

I enjoyed the Rainbow, Dragon, Desert, and the Baked Scallop rolls.  The Surf Clam was on the rubbery side.   My friend had grabbed the squid salad.  It didn't taste fresh.  I'm assuming it's been circling around the belt.  

Service is  very friendly and attentive.  This place is hard to spot.  It is located in a strip plaza behind US Bank next to Pita Jungle.  If you want something affordable, filling, and still tasty, this is great!"}
{"text":"For the price, you can't beat it, since the only other conveyor belt sushi places are in Tempe or LA. It's mediocre at best for sushi standards, but hey, it's F-U-N.  A couple sake bombers and you'll be good to go! :)

 I would recommend sitting near the front sushi bar along the right hand side if you want to see what's the freshest.  Also I always order a bunch of assorted hand rolls @ $2 ea right off the bat.  Then it gets made fresh just for you! and just supplement with a few other things that catch your eye on the belt.  Unless you've seen it be put down, it may be a little old.  Even sushi that's been sitting for 15 minutes does not make me a happy camper."}
{"text":"Love the price on Sundays 1-3pm. Everything is a $1 off. Good quality sushi. Easy to reach on the revolving sushi bar. Enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I went back and forth between 3 and 4 Stars... the novelty of the conveyor belt is of course awesome. This was actually my first experience with this kind of place. So as far as something different, this place definitely delivers. 

As for the food, it was decent for sushi. Nothing life changing but it was definitely edible. It was nice to be able to try different rolls and a variety of sides (seaweed salad, edamame, etc). They even had some dessert plates like cheesecake bites, macaroons, jello, chocolate cake, and tiramisu. You come here more for variety of choices instead of something mind blowing. We also ordered the chicken teriyaki off of the menu. It comes with rice, miso soup, and had broccoli with it. It was just okay, pretty typical. I'd sick with the assortment on the belt. 

Service was pleasant but a little slow to get the check. Then again they are really just there for drinks and if you order off the menu, so when it gets busier they are kind of all over the place. 

Overall, I'll probably return when I'm in the mood for the experience. It's not bad but just remember you are more paying for the novelty instead of insanely amazing entrees."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi but its good enough. The prices and the fact that you can start grabbing your food right away is the only reason i go back. Ive had much better sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible. Got food poisoning from this place. Way too cheap. Would rather spend $20 on good sushi than $3 on something that looks like it has been on the conveyor belt for 1 or more hours."}
{"text":"It's well worth it if you go during their Happy Hour. Monday wasn't crowded. Good selection. I don't know how it is when the place is full but the selections were kept well stocked. Attentive but not hovering service. I will definitely go back to try the selections I was too full for this time."}
{"text":"Not bad for a revolving sushi place. Wasn't too busy and the staff was very friendly. Definitely going again."}
{"text":"I love conveyer belt sushi! You can get all kinds of bites and not have to pay $15 for one roll of sushi! This place had the largest selection I've ever seen at a conveyer belt place. It wasn't just California rolls. I just wish service was better."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, easy & right amount of rice, servers are friendly & efficiently. Enjoy our lunch! Happy hour is our next plan !"}
{"text":"I was here recently for lunch, and was disappointed by the quality of the sushi, the selection of the sushi, and the service.

I love nigiri sushi, and the revolving sushi was 90% rolls, with a few spare salmon / tuna / red snapper plates rotating around.  The taste of the sushi was just ok, nothing special.

If you know your sushi places, you know that Japanese do the best sushi, followed by Koreans, and then much further by Chinese.  Well the chefs there were Chinese, and they do make a valiant attempt to make sushi, but it's not the quality I'm used to at Japanese or Korean places.

The service was also disappointing.  We were only allowed to ask for things from our server.  We tried asking two other waitresses for things like water, order additional items, and they pretty much shrugged and told us to wait for our waitress... wth?

Overall, you could do much better elsewhere.  My favorite revolving sushi place is Kiku Sushi in town."}
{"text":"So this is the first belt sushi place that I have been to here in AZ. I have been to several in the Seattle area, and I have had both amazing and crappy sushi from them. I am a little bit of a sushi fanatic so I kinda know my fish lol. 

Price: 4.5 stars. The price is per plate like all belt places. They range from $1.75- $5.25. Most plates are $2.25- $4.25. I got 6 plates and spent about $15 before tax. But still this is the price for 2-4 pieces of fish and can add up really quick. 

Service: 5 stars. I was greeted as I walked in and taken to a seat right away. The servers are great and if you ask a question they will make sure you are taken care of and make sure that someone is taking care of you. 

Size of roll or fish: 5 stars. The rolls were a good size, and the cuts of fish were very large in comparison to most the belt sushi places I have been to. 

Quality of fish: 4. stars. The fish is good, but I guess I am just spoiled with amazing fish so I can't quite give it 5 stars. 

Red Snapper $1.75 for 2 pieces. Not amazing but not bad at all
Tuna $3.25 for 2 pieces. It was a different texture than I'm used to but was good tasting
Salmon $2.25 for 2 pieces. Delicious salmon no complaints at all
Philly Roll $2.25 for 4 pieces. I enjoyed this basic roll. 
Las Vegas Roll $2.25 for 3 pieces. This thing is amazing. Don't hesitate. Just get it."}
{"text":"I love revolving belt sushi bars. Gotta be careful though. You never know how long that sushi has been rolling around that belt. This place is fresh every time I go. They have a wonderful selection as well!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for sushi in Phoenix, then you have to understand that it's not going to be as great as an oceanside restaurant. That being said, the sushi here is decent and the prices are very reasonable. If you are in the mood for sushi, this should be a place you consider."}
{"text":"I like this place because you can sample lots of different types of sushi for a fair price.  Instead of being stuck with 2-3 rolls, I can try as many as I want without being burdened with an over abundance of them. If you like it, grab another plate of it! 
I admit I'm not a fan of imitation crab and mostly skip over those, but there's plenty of other things to choose from. My favorite roll is the Playboy.  Yum!
Ok, it might not be up to the standards of some more upscale sushi restaurants, but it's still good. I'll be going back, absolutely."}
{"text":"First of all I got so excited reaching for the conveyor that I knocked over my full iced tea everywhere! Thankfully my boyfriend can move out of harms way fast! The staff was so friendly I couldn't believe it. 

The sushi is average but I love the fun of watching the conveyor. It's all small portions of 2-4 pieces so you can try it all. And the plates are almost all only $1.50-$4 and minus 50 cents during happy hr. Final lunch bill with one iced tea and one hot tea (and the way Evan can eat)- only $35 before tax and tip"}
{"text":"Revolving sushi bar?! This is highly dangerous for self-proclaimed sushi addicts, like myself. The concept is genius! You sit down, wherever you want, an as sushi goes around on a conveyer belt, you pull what you would like to try. You pay by the plate and the plates are organized by color. So before you even pick it up off the conveyer belt, you know how much it will cost you. At the end, they stack up your plates and bring you your bill!   I'm going to break it down to the good and the bad. 
The good: if you're in a rush... You can literally sit down and just go to town, there isn't much of that waitress lag, so if you work at desert ridge, this is a smart stop for a lunch break. They have a decent variety of rolls and sashimi that goes around the conveyer belt, even desserts, salads and drinks. The waitresses were attentive and made sure to refill our waters without us asking. 
The bad: the baked rolls revolving around weren't very fresh tasting and kind of soggy. My boyfriend explained two ways to avoid this: 1. Go during the dinner rush since things are selected more quickly. 2. Pick the boxes with condensation on the inside of the lids, they seem fresher.
I guess the third way would be to order directly off the menu, but that seems a little less fun. 
This place does need to be updated, decor wise. It's got modern style paint with strange paintings of waterfalls, and flowers.... And Disney characters? What? 
And another thing, wipe down your tables. They're gross looking. 

I'll still be back, but probably during a busier time, just so I know the food is a little fresher."}
{"text":"Obviously people have the fear of trying a new sushi place and even a revolving sushi bar but honestly this place is one of the good ones! I have tried other revolving sushi bars in the past and all of them seem a little shady but not this one! They have all your typical rolls and even things to eat for non-sushi lovers. The rolls I got and the gyoza were all so yummy at an affordable price as well! The place is also nice and clean and well organized as well :)."}
{"text":"This place is fun and always busy! Happy hour is a great. The sushi rolls, dessert and appetizers come around on a conveyor belt and you choose what you want to try. Each color of plate has a different prices. At the end, the count up your plates and give you your bill. We had a table where we were able to watch the sushi being made and put onto the conveyor belt - so much fun!!!"}
{"text":"The worst sushi! Not fresh. My waitress was annoyingly confused too. She just looked at us with a blank look on her face. Horrible experience! We will never be back"}
{"text":"The customer service here is super terrible. The older lady at the front always gives me an attitude and forgets to add any type of ginger or soy sauce to my bag every time. She doesn't separate my bags how I tell her to and turns around and give me lip back. I live very close to this location and I always order to go. I've only eaten in once and when I did it took forever for me to get my card back. I have stopped going to this location because of how terrible they treat me. The only plus is the sushi is cheap. If I could do no stars I would!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased! All the sushi was fresh made and placed on the belt. There seemed to be a good rotation to keep it fresh. Best seats are at the bar! We drove an hour and 20 minutes and we were not dissapointed. Our waitress was prompt and nice. I would return to this location again!"}
{"text":"My sister dragged me here after she visited with a friend. This is the first sushi place I've ever been to and I really liked it. When you enter, you wait to be seated and then someone comes by to take drink orders. Once you are seated you can more or less begin choosing your plates. I've never been to a place like this- the food is on a long rotating belt and each plate costs a different amount. You have a guide in front of you which shows how much plates cost and they are sorted by color. There are a lot of options and not just sushi- jello, crab puffs, egg rolls, fruit, salad and more! You can spend a lot or a little. It's pretty sweet. The food was delicious. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! Small portions so you can try more things and budget friendly! The food is good too and if you dont like whats on the revolving belt then you can order off of the menu! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came to this location about a week ago just on a whim. I love revolving sushi bars and I'm always up for a new experience and my favorite revolving sushi bars is about 15 miles away from my house so seeing another revolving sushi bar in my area I decided why not. The atmosphere was nice, but that's about where all the good things end. 

I started off by ordering in iced green tea and I grabbed one of my favorite types of sushi the Philly roll. The cream cheese in this role was the majority of the role. The cream cheese overtook the flavor of everything else. Next I grabbed some at a edamame which was thoroughly undercooked and pre-salted. I personally don't mind having the salt on there but I know some people wouldn't like it salted. I'm sure you could ask for it unsalted but at a revolving sushi bar it's all about getting it from the conveyor belt. Next I tried a Las Vegas roll which had no flavor whatsoever. Next was a tuna roll and the tuna tasted like it was dropped on the floor. At this Time I asked the waitress where the restrooms were and they were all the way on the other side of the restaurant which you literally had to go through a maze to get to. After spending about two minutes in the restroom I came back and my place was already given to another customer. If it wasn't for the fact that I consider myself to be a good person I would've walked out without paying.

When it comes to revolving sushi bars do not waste your time at this location. I will continue spending my money and enjoying Teharu sushi in Tempe rather than go to this place again."}
{"text":"I live in the north west valley but was in this area killing time before a dr appointment. I decided to stop in here for lunch and I couldn't be happier I did. The sushi was absolutely amazing, some of the best I have had. Pricing was great as was the service. I will definitely be returning! There was a great selection of different rolls and fish. I would recommend the imagine roll or baked scallop roll."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi FTW! I like the conveyor belt concept because it allows you to take the risk of trying weird stuff without committing to a whole roll. They did a good job of keeping the hot food hot and the cold food cold on the belt. I must've eaten 3 plates of gyoza... they were mighty tasty. The sushi was decent, not wonderful, but not bad. They have an extensive menu you can order from if you don't see what you want on the belt. We got a sweet potato roll which was.... weird. Anyway, we were stuffed and I paid about 22$, that's fantastic! We'll be back."}
{"text":"It's not the best quality sushi I've ever had, but I wasn't expecting that either. It's awesome for the price, and it's fun to come with family or friends and watch all the sushi go around."}
{"text":"The sushi is quality and comes around at a very steady pace, but the service really ruins the whole experience. It takes awhile for someone to come over with drinks and wasabi, which prevents you from eating. They also do not come back to check on you at all, the sushi chef noticed we didn't have any water left and waved for a server to come over, and the waitress was on the phone gossiping while filling up our waters. Then after 15 minutes of sitting around I finally flagged down our waitress to get our checks. I do not think it is individual servers but simply the way they were trained by the manager. we come because we enjoy the price and variety of sushi. But only come if you are in no rush."}
{"text":"Took my Mom and my partner to Sushi Station!  Mom and I love Sushi and thoroughly enjoyed the rotating sushi and it kept appearing on the conveyor belt! We ate a lot! My partner who doesn't like raw fish found so much other fun stuff to eat and wants to go back as well!  Something for everyone here and great service and fair price!  We will be back!  Try this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! The sushi is really great and the prices are awesome. Most importantly, it's just such a fun experience! We sit and chat and watch the sushi go round, grabbing our favorites and trying new rolls when something catches our eye. It's really fun to see different rolls so you can branch out and try something you might not have thought of without seeing it. My husband loves the mochi desserts, while I usually lean towards something chocolate :) My favorite sushi is the Yankee roll. Always a great evening!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Station.   This was the first time I had been to this location, but now I have one closer to work.  Always fresh, always delicious and a great way to get yourself full without breaking the bank at all.

I'll be back, as usual."}
{"text":"Snuck away for a quiet lunch today all by myself and was totally looking forward to the quick and delicious sushi... Once again, it didn't disappoint....my favorite spot for sure!!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. Trays of sushi revolving around you, if you see it amd it looks good you cam just grab it and dig in. They have a good variety of sushi as well as a full menu you can order from. Each plate of sushi comes withe 2-5 pieces on it and depending on the roll ranges from 2 dollars to 6 dollars and are distinguishes by the color plate they come on. They take 50 cents off each plate during happy hour, which is nice because depending on how many people you have in your group it will save you a few bucks. It is also a great place to grab sushi if you're in a hurry, maybe on a lunch break from work. You are able to sit at the bar and help yourself to the sushi of your likeing without having to wait on your order being taken. This is also a great place to take kids or new sushi eaters. The concept will give them an imexpencive way try many different sushi rolls without breaking the bank. And for those of you that love sake bombers like i do, they are very resonably priced amd have a pretty good variety of beers to chooae from. This is a place i plan on visiting again soon and that i would definatly recomend to someone who has yet to tey sushi and to all you sushi lovers out there."}
{"text":"Revolving sushi with different priced plates. Happy hour I believe is 3-5 pm mon-thurs 

Super quick & friendly service and they will make pretty much anything they can, just ask! 

Rolls tend to be on the smaller side than usual rolls other places, but honestly it tastes better than pretty much any other sushi place we have tried in Phoenix and we have tried a lot of them! It isn't California sushi, but for Phoenix, it is surprisingly one of the better ones and the only one we come back to time and again."}
{"text":"Had to update this review today after a mediocre experience followed by a super rude waitress who walked away from us after we asked a question of something rude she said earlier .. I understand people have bad days but come on, she was on the phone half the time, I had to check on the order multiple times and keep asking for things. Finally when the check time came, when we asked her for it, she made a rude remark about how she \"heard us already\". After asking her about it privately later by the checkout instead of wanting to cause a scene by asking at the seating area, she stormed away and said \"well I already heard you !\" And proceeded to ignore us. I asked for the manager who has always been nice and was today as well, but don't appreciate no one really caring how she acted or said. Disappointed"}
{"text":"First time going to a rotating sushi bar!

Upon first impression - I was definitely surprised by the cleanliness and all the variety and freshness of it.

Prices on the belt range from $1.75 - $6. The plates are color coordinated, so there's really no confusion! They also have a full menu you can order separate dishes off of that isn't priced bad either.

There are a few vegan/vegetarian options on the revolving sushi belt too, which I thought was cool.

We got the Edamame, Asparagus Roll, Sweet Potato Roll, this bean curd thing that is not featured on the menu (it was good though!) and a plate of vegetable Yaki Soba noodles (from the menu). All of which was very good! Our total was under $20 for 2 people!

The service isn't the greatest, but you ARE pretty much serving yourself, so it wasn't a huge deal. All the servers there were very nice and always keeping up tables/sushi belt.

I recommend it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a blah day at work and haven't really found a good sushi place since before I moved from Oregon. I kept seeing sushi station as I'm headed off to work or going home. This time I decided to walk in and sit down. I really like that you can order or grab off the conveyer belt. And wow! So many many choices of sushi off the belt. I felt like a kid in a candy store. Honestly, this place beat out the sushi in Oregon by far. So much more variety. The staff was friendly and attentive. I will defiantly attend more and it's only s block from home. Score!"}
{"text":"Who doesn`t love  a revolving sushi restaurant?! Fun atmosphere with the conveyor belt full an assortment of sushi rolls, salads, edamame, and mini desserts. I even spotted fruit going by! Now, all my friends knowI  love, love, love sushi, if you are looking for high end expensive sushi, this is not the place. However I liked the rolls and salmon nigiri I picked. All items were fresh. 
This place was popular and busy, good service and good food!"}
{"text":"I am actually loving this place!! The sushi is fresh and delicious! Looking to grab a quite bite for lunch but would rather not have fast food or Chipotle, come here! Gotta love a revolving sushi bar! I have been to a couple others (Terahu), this place is better!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! My friend and I come here every week! We used to go to Ah-So in Norterra, but easily drop $60+ for a sushi dinner and they don't have the best service.

At Sushi Station we don't really have to deal with servers other than drinks, and we can eat the second we sit down! Everyone knows you eat with yours eyes first, and I love that you can SEE the food and if it looks good, just grab it off the belt! And if you want something thats not on the belt, you let them know and REAL sushi chefs make it! We can easily eat 5 or 6 different kinds of sushi and have a good meal, for half the price of Ah-So! The sushi is VERY good for the price! Its no Sapporo or Ra, but at $2 or $3 bucks a plate, you really can't beat that anywhere else, even when other places have happy hour!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to honestly. I go at least once a week. It is amazing quality for super cheap. And we all know that sushi is usually a little over priced. The staff is friendly and always there to help you out"}
{"text":"Pros- good sushi, especially for a rotating sushi bar. Great location. Teriyaki chicken dish was beautiful, but tasted just ok...
Cons- terrible service. Two workers completely ignored us before a third Busser said hello and finally  seated us. The sushi chef didn't welcome us, (as typically they do)... Server talked extremely quietly and rarely came to check on us even though we were her only table. 

We will be back... We live around the corner, but not impressed. Maybe they just had a bad day..."}
{"text":"Seriously, I was having one of those days when nothing seemed to be going right. Sushi is my comfort food, so I went to my favorite \"how you want it\" sushi place, which, much to the tune of the rest of my day, was closed for some unknown reason (possibly remodeling). Sushi Station is only a few blocks from my house and I've not tried it before. I had a particular roll in mind that wasn't on the menu, and I wanted it to-go, so I already had a chip on my shoulder when I walked in the door. And I was STARVING, which compounds my moodiness. The cashier didn't seem to really grasp what I wanted, so she got the manager/owner?, who came out and talked to me about what I wanted and was very easily able to accommodate me after clarifying what I wanted (which was basically a salmon Philly roll without the rice - but who eats sushi with no rice? That's not normal). The roll was RIDICULOUSLY cheap, far cheaper than any place I've ever gone to. I'm so glad I ordered two, because it was WAY exceeded my expectations, and I am now a happy man. I can't speak to the sit-down portion of the experience because I ordered to-go (and was out the door in under 5 minutes). But the place was pretty busy - barely a chair open in the place, and the conveyor belt was full of fresh sushi for the taking.

I remind myself of this constantly - one never knows what someone else's day has been like. I had had a terrible day - and this might seem clich√© - but the staff at Sushi Station took just a little bit of time for me, and it turned my entire day around. Without a doubt, I WILL be back. Next time, I'm bringing friends. PLENTY of friends! I'd love to become a regular. And I'm hoping they cater! I feel it's a much-needed fare addition in this area, and you can't beat the price. Another reviewer said that other restaurants have tried and failed in this space - I've noticed that as well, but I'm pretty confident that won't happen to this place as long as they keep things just the way they are.

Really nice job, guys. Keep up the amazing work."}
{"text":"My son and I were in the general area and were craving sushi. We didn't want to take the long drive to our normal conveyor belt sushi restaurant so we stopped here. A couple of things, the selection is amazing, but the service is lacking. Also it is a lot more expensive than its competitor in Tempe.  The place seemed a little dirty as well. It's in an old building that definitely needs renovation. We would go again, but not if we have a healthy appetite. It was way too easy to rack up a $40 lunch bill. That's pretty expensive for two people one of them being a small child."}
{"text":"My Review is really 3.5 stars. 

This restaurant is basically sushi served on a conveyor belt. Great concept. They charge by color of the plate. I've been here twice so far. It's best to go on weekends like around 6-7pm because they belt is packed with fresh sushi. Sometimes, some of the sushi can look a little scary on the conveyor belt because it has been circling around for a while. You can definitely tell which plates have been on for a while and which plates are fresh. 

I highly recommend you don't go to this restaurant on the weekend around 8ish. That's when they start slowing their service and don't place that many fresh plates out. Then you're eating sushi that has been on the belt for over 15 minutes, and it tastes pretty gross."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a Diamondbacks game and wasn't disappointed. The prices were fair and the sushi was pretty good. Sadly we missed happy hour by about 30 minutes. Those prices are extremely good. I love the conveyor belt and it's awesome that they cover the sushi to avoid others who may be a little touchy. I wish the shrimp tempura roll didn't have a huge piece of imitation crab and maybe a little more spice to the spicy ahi and not grinding it up. Other than that, I'd definitely be back here again. Not sure what people didn't like about the customer service but I thought it was good. Many have an Asian accent which I can see being a little difficult for others, but everyone was definitely friendly. I wish they weren't so far away from where I am though. I'd definitely be back sooner rather than later. Especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is super fun! Might seem chintzy at first glance, but this place is not to be underestimated. The sushi travels on conveyor belts that move around the restaurant and you can try a huge assortment of different sushi. The sushi is pretty good and a select few of the servers are kind, helpful, and AWESOME!  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I know I'm in the minority here but I just didn't get it. The sushi was not bad but it was nothing to write home about. I didn't think the conveyer added anything to the experience. But I can see coming here if I worked nearby and had a sushi itch but not a lot of time for lunch.

If I could I'd go 2.5 stars but not quite a 3 for me. Not bad enough to say avoid at all costs. But just not somewhere I'd go back to except with friends if they wanted to go."}
{"text":"I GO HERE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK! I absolutely love the people that work here--they are all so sweet and accommodating! They also know exactly what my friend and I order every visit (endless crunchy rolls)...I guess you could call us 'regulars'!  I like to keep it simple with the rolls, but last time I was there I tried the new mexico roll (AMAZING), jalapeno poppers (SO TASTY), and tatum roll (DELICIOUS)! I will most likely stop there after work because talking about it just isn't the same as actually tasting it!!"}
{"text":"First rated when I was new to Yelp. Four stars is now only reserved for places that I deem deserve them. All comments previously posted are still valid, it's just my star ratings have now been adjusted."}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant for a traveler. Good food, priced reasonably and very convenient."}
{"text":"Total waste of our appetite, money and time. This is the place where Sushi can be junk foods. They fry, put thick cream cheese and dump fried pankos. Much worse than cheap sushi quality of bad Chinese buffet. Very  little choice of foods. 
Hot Tea cup was so filthy that I refused to drink from it. The booth was so crammed and I was barely able to scoot in the booth. 
The highlights of everything was I've never seen a revolving sushi place where they put soda bottle and a kids snack on the dish!! We literally laughed out loud. FYI, they still count the dishes manually by color whereas others have a scanning machine that automatically counts your dishes by color."}
{"text":"Went again, and loved it again. Had a newer waitress and she came by to check on us just the right number of times, filled drinks before they ran out. Sat in a booth. Must remember to sit as conveyor Congress towards me so i can see what's coming. My kind friends kept an eye on what was approaching. I met my goal of 15 plates. The mussels were much better this time. The chocolate mousse was perfect. My bill with tip just for my portion was just over $50. With self service I have limited self control. If you're on a budget, keep track of your total while you eat."}
{"text":"Sushi is just OK.  If you want a quick lunch with ok sushi you go here.  It's fun having all this sushi in your face.  Sometimes you stuff yourself because everything is right in front of you. I like to go here for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place about 5 times. It's close to my house, and it does the trick when I'm craving sushi, and don't want to spend a lot of money. This place is cheap, like you can get 4 plates of sushi for around 10.00( depending on what you get). Happy hour is from 3-5 And that's when you'll get the most bang for your buck. It's .50 off a plate. BUT there's a reason it's so cheap. The quality is not the best. Don't get me wrong, I've never gotten sick from eating here but it's definitely not on my list of best sushi places in Phoenix. They use a lot of fake crab in their rolls, and cream cheese. I'm pretty basic and get the spicy tuna, but I always order it because you never know how long it's been on the conveyer belt lol. Anyways , decent sushi at a killer price ."}
{"text":"Revolving sushi is such a great concept, you get to try a lot of things for little money. What I like especially about Sushi Station, is that the quality and variety is better than other revolving sushi spots.

I also feel that the staff is super kind, thorough and accommodating. 

Stand outs: Baked Scallop Roll, Imagine Roll, and can we talk about their desserts? They're actually good. 

OH, and Happy Hour is great! 1.50-2.00 off of their normal alcohol prices. Also, if there's something you don't see on the belt, they have a menu to draw from! Yay win, win.

 Again, I absolutely love this. You get try as many things as you want, and it's super affordable.

I only wish they would expand...and open a spot in the East Valley : )"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. What isn't on the revolving belt can be made to order. All very fresh. I will return."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi at great prices. The staff is friendly and service is great. My favorite place to eat nigiri."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!
It has everything I need!
It reminds me of San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and Hong Kong!
The food is GREAT! I love the rotating conveyor belt!
Prices are cool, the only thing is that the parking is in the rear and I like to keep an eye on my car or don't like parking where I can't be seen.
If I am ever hiding from the cops, this is where I will be!
Great happy hour also!"}
{"text":"It took me a long time to try this place because it looks like a hole in the wall, but I kept hearing about people who really love it and after trying it, I'm always bringing sushi lovers back with me. I've been coming here for over a year and now it's the only place I think to go when I want sushi (I've even come here alone). 

The prices are amazing and the sushi is really good. Because it's revolving, the plates are small and you get to try whatever you want. The prices per place range from about $1.50-4.50 and they're usually about 4 pieces. They also have a happy hour with even lower prices. 
 
The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the atmosphere is so basic (which doesn't bother me, but I don't want my rating to be misleading). 

Definitely try it out...You won't spend even half the amount you normally would so you'll have nothing to lose. 
The parking is on the side and back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is decent, we usually have to wait 3-5 minutes to get seated but they are really good at acomidating where you want to sit.  It's not the best sushi but then again it's a revolving sushi bar meaning its probably not the freshest. It's a good spot if you want sushi fast because you just grab whatever you want as it passes. They have Good prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to  open ever since I saw the store sign go up. As of today, I have eaten at Sushi Station 4x and had a wonderful experience each time. What i love about this  place is that my wife who hates Sushi;  really enjoyed the spring rolls and teriyaki chicken. Personally, i recommend the snow crab and Philadelphia rolls. In addition, it's a real delight to have Japanese soda and a some cake to finish off my lunch."}
{"text":"Good food with clean environment, fair pricing and neat rotating sushi line, things not on the conveyer belt could be ordered as well"}
{"text":"Well, we did not expect this! This restaurant has tried to be so many places over the years and they all failed. Come try it out before they get too busy! This is going to be a popular spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is fun!  When I went, the food was fresh and the atmosphere was definitely enjoyable.  Tis a revolving sushi station so it's fun to look up the line and see what is coming thru.  Good prices and allows you to see and try new things."}
{"text":"Sushi...fast food style. Basically a step above the sushi at Fry's but good if you want a quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"Literally the best sushi ever!!!! I recommend everyone to try this place. We randomly stopped to try a new sushi place and this place blew my mind ."}
{"text":"Belt Sushi and many other items.

Our favorite is generally the Spider Roll, Gyozas, Caterpillar Roll and we order the Beef or Chicken Teriyaki Dinner.

Gyozas are excellent and deep fried to a nice crispy dumpling.

The Spider Roll is generally my go to order with a nice soft shell crab surrounded by a nice suhsi roll.

If you don't see the dishes you want, you can always order from the waiter or waitress.

Price is very good and items are generally fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to a revolving sushi restaurant in Scottsdale before but this place was not good. It may be fun watching the sushi go around a conveyor belt but the service was horrible and the sushi was disgusting. Almost every sushi roll was filled with imitation crab meat that tastes like mayo and the servers, even though were very polite, seems like they didn't know what they were doing.  What was even more annoying were the sushi chefs who kept ringing the bell every time a roll was done. Skip the place, unless you want your night to be ruined. Lesson of the day, if the sushi is cheap it ain't good. Lol"}
{"text":"As many other reviewers have mentioned, the sushi is served on a conveyor belt and this is a blessing and a curse.  It means that the sushi isn't always as fresh as it was just made, but it also allows you to pick out which you want based on looks.  Now I have to warn people as you can easily spend 20 bucks if you aren't careful just by picking up plate after plate.  The concept is interesting, but personally I would prefer my sushi to be made to order.  They do have an option for that, but the prices are higher"}
{"text":"Great spot! I recommend you try it! 

Try the Yellowtail sashimi!!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that this mass produced sushi was good, I actually had a fun time picking the sushi that goes by you on a conveyor belt, the prices were affordable and food not the BEST sushi I have had but definitely not bad, good sushi fast and fun, my only complaint was my plum wine was spoiled, my first glass was yummy and sweet, the second was a totally different color then my first the waiter took the wine back because the wine tasted sour and brought me a new glass unfortunately I think the whole bottle must have been spoiled, the waiter was nice enough and took it off the bill, we will be coming back to enjoy some sushi fun again :)"}
