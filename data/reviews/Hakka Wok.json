{"text":"This is a great little place. 

In all fairness, we've tried a lot of the Thai food and not much of the Hakka per se, however each time the service has been fast and friendly, the food has been delicious and affordable. YUMMY Thai curry coconut dishes and great portions = good value."}
{"text":"Great Thai and Hakka options in one location. What more could you ask for? So glad this restaurant opened in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm a Hakka Chinese so I know good Hakka food when I eat it. The food here is what I eat at home and considering friends and colleagues love my family's food this place is just as good. A bit far for a Toronto native but worth the drive if you want some good food. By the way there is a LOT of spicy food"}
{"text":"I write a lot of location reviews and retaurant reviews on trip advospr and I wanted to make sure this one accurately represents my experience across multiple forums.  This store is not at all focused on customer experience or satisfaction.   I walked in and began ordering for takeout with an extremely warm persona.  I got to the part of my order where I needed a slight modification to accomodate an extreme wheat allergy my wife has.  The reataurant staff, two members violently rejected the idea of hanging chow mein noodle for rice vermicelli noodle.  Also proceeded to tell me to buy the meat seperate and buy plain vermacelli (effectively doubling the price) and I could \"go mix it yourself\".  Despite the fact that the food was decent, their personalities and attitude make it very evident that I am not important as a customer and that all the people on my neighborhood who continue to drive from Stouffville to Scarborough despite the distance are better off than to deal with staff that would rather profiteer than treat their customers like they are valued.

Visit this store if you want a quick in and out with no changes (dietary, allegies or otherwise) and don't expect any smiles or pleasantries"}
{"text":"A great local Hakka/Thai option with great value!  

We've tried this place multiple times because of its convenient location and I'll admit they have their hits and their misses depending on what dish you order... but since we've found our favourites we are definitely repeat customers.  They are also very accomodating with varying the level of spice in their dishes to your taste.  Please note - my husband still prefers Federicks though.  

HITS - pakoras, chili chicken, shrimp in lobster sauce, mango salad, deep fried squid, basil chicken, singapore noodles, hakka chow mein

MISSES -  any beef dishes (tried multiple but none ever tasted right), lemon chicken (sauce tasted like very artificial)"}
{"text":"Got the Thai pineapple fried rice, taste very hard.  Go ahead and did the plastic rice test, rolled the rice and it did not change shape.  This place serve plastic rice!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super tiny, but the food is delicious, my favorite is the pad Thai. A good place for take out, as it is difficult to get seats (there are like 4 tables) The portions are also very large."}
{"text":"My first try here, it was the 2 of us and we grabbed the small table for 2.  It is a small restaurant, caters a lot to the takeout business, so do expect folks to walk-in and standby the counter, but still very quaint and not bothered.

I like the generous portions and the big slices of tender beef on the Shanghainese beef noodles.  

We then ordered to go the shrimp mixed vegetables which came with rice. The order looked very compact but when we took it out of the takeout containers, it was a lot!  Love the choice of mixed veggies, wasn't cheap fillers like onions or bean sprouts!

Will come back to try other dishes!

Glad didn't have to go all the way to 14th/Markham Rd area anymore for Hakka cuisine.  It's a bit of a trek for us."}
{"text":"Despite the name Hakka Wok, I much prefer the Thai dishes such as Green Curry Chicken, Basil Beef, Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup.  The owners used to operate a Thai restaurant, hence the number of Thai dishes offering.

The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. You get a 10% discount if you pay cash for takeout for order over $20.

Try the lunch specials, too as they offer Thai, Hakka and Chinese dishes for less than $7 with a drink.

Service is friendly and very prompt!"}
{"text":"First time to come here.   Had the vegetable pakkora and chilly chicken.   Both were excellent!   Small, but very clean seating area.   Very pleasant.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and i walked in to grab something small for dinner. It is a very small place and it seems as if it is catered more for people that would like to take out. Hence, it was very noisy as people were going in and out. I would probably not go back to dine in, but would probably consider taking out the next time i'm around.

My husband and i shared a seafood pad thai, it was decent. Definitely not the best pad thai I've had, but it was alright.
I may try some of the other items on the menu the next time i decide to take out."}
{"text":"Used to come here very often as i love their chickens wings and their prices are good. But recently their food quality has gone downhill as their bussiness has increased. U can get general tsao chicken on time and it'll be red and taste greate and crisp the next day you go it'll be orange and soggy lacking flavour or texture. Same with their fried rice it just tastes like moth balls lately, like its old or the rice hadn't been washed. 
Customer service here is horrible as the only two employees they have their look overwhelmed and irrate. Very snippy and the girl at the front desk acts like shes sleep deprived anytime u call to place to order it's as if u are annoying her by makin her wake up. Chicken wings are still good but after my last few experiences i refuse to come back here for the quality and service..."}
{"text":"They really do have some of the best chicken wings in town! Great quality food with good portions."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Very disappointed the food was very blan. Lacked any flavor.   Would not return if it was free."}
{"text":"We went here on Halloween as Fredericks was a 45 min wait for take out.  When I walked in initially we were completely ignored and not even asked why we were there after a few minutes the lady asked what we wanted and we indicated takeout she handed us a menu and we ordered the chilli chicken, Singapore noodles and beef ho fun with black bean sauce.  

I'm giving it a 3 out of 5 based on the 3 dishes that we did try.  The chilli chicken was ok but not terribly spicy so it lacked the kick in used to getting from Fredericks.  The meat we asked for all white meat and paid extra only to receive dark meat as well.  

The Singapore noodles once again lacked something that made the dish quite bland and probably one of the worst Singapore noodles I have tasted.  However, it was edible.

The last dish was the beef ho fun with black bean sauce which was actually the most pleasant out of the three dishes we ordered.  Just the right flavours and mix of beef and black bean sauce.  I prefer it to be saucier as it was quite dry.

Be warned though that if you eat here there is plenty of msg on everything.  Spent most of my night drinking water after having eaten the dishes.  

Overall, it is ok if you are looking to get a quick fix of Hakka food."}
{"text":"My first time ordering last week. The chili chicken was really good. The Hakka veggie noodles, very good. Mango chicken is amazing. The veggie fried rice was apparently very bland. The service was nice and the place was clean. There's only 4-5 booths for seating. If ordering over $20 and paying cash, they offer 10% off. Woild definitely recommend. I will likely try the other Hakka restaurants on 48 but I'd consider coming back here."}
{"text":"Summary: little shop offers solid price for decent sized portions of so-so fusion? Hakka food at lunch... but eye-rolling staff give off an annoyed-vibe to new customers (although the regulars get greeted)

Top Must-Get: to be determined...*
Top Regret: Bombay Chicken

*I've yet to try their pakora, chili chicken or fried chicken wings, which is what other reviews have raved about

I walked into a pleasant space. I wouldn't call it comfortable, with seven tables crammed in the small shop, but the overall cleanliness and simple decor was... pleasant. I was not greeted by a pleasant person, though - I definitely have met more enthusiastic and happy people than the cashier. She was there on both occasions I came; and the service was curt and impatient both times. 

For what it's worth, I got the sense she is just not particularly expressive as opposed to being a terrible person.

But the food? Yeah, it was bordering on terrible.

The Manchurian chicken for takeout was very sizable, but the quality was decent at best. 

The big disappointment was the Bombay Chicken. I've come to really enjoy the one over at Hakka King a couple blocks away, so I decided to try it here.

But while it came out fast (less than 10 minutes), it tasted inconsistently seasoned within the same plate: pieces of chicken would taste either 

1) bland but spicy,
2) flavourful but not spicy, 
3) flavourful and spicy, or 
3) bland and plain.  

Also, you could taste that it was over breaded on some pieces... And indeed, sometimes it didn't taste like meat at all, but a chunk of fried batter.

Having said that, their portion sizes are respectable and their price is fairly cheap. If you're looking for quality Hakka food though, it certainly pays to go a couple blocks south.

They do have a sign that says they serve the town's best fried chicken, so I guess that's what I'll try if I ever venture back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what I wanted to order so I ordered later then my friends who were dining in with me. The lady working at the cash register actually yelled at me for not ordering at the same time. That kind of treatment is absolutely ridiculous and is unacceptable. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great Hakka Chinese .. They also offer a bit of Thai.  (However I never ordered the Thai). 
Been here 2x now with family both times the food has been consistent in that it's really tasty .. Generous portions ... And most importantly NOT GREASY (Which I find most Hakka restaurants can be :( ). 

The only downside is that it's a tiny place (5 tables) So during peek hours you might have to wait. But it is worth it .. !!!"}
{"text":"When there around dinner time to order takeout  . There only three peoples at the table  Should know better!! Walk up the counter grab the menu to order and than suddenly cashier grab the menu out off my hand . She told me their a menu on the counter. OK !! Give her a dirty look. I order chilli chicken and Hakka noodle . The chilli chicken is so,so the hakka noodle is tasteless thank god they put hot sauce on the side it help a lot . I will not order there again . There a lot Hakka restaurants  at 14th Ave and Markham they have better price and the food taste a lot better too ."}
{"text":"Bombay Chicken is amazing! Prefer to get the noodles and rice dishes without the meat."}
{"text":"The bad: lousy service
The good: huge tasty portions and discount when you buy take out with cash. Get the fried chicken wings, pakora, chili chicken Hakka noodles.  Normally when I get 2 main dishes and 2 appetizer, I have enough for leftovers for lunch as well as dinner for the next day!"}
{"text":"Delicious food , chilli chicken n hot and sour soup are my favourite items .. Catered to my spiciness :) totally recommend if u are in the look out for Hakka chineSe food in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Hakka Wok for lunch yesterday. I was not sure what to expect since the restaurant is small. The staff person was very friendly. I ordered the orange beef and my wife ordered shrimp with lobster sauce. The wait for the food was not too long. The orange beef was delicious with big pieces of oranges and a tasty sauce. The shrimp with lobster sauce had big shrimps and the sauce was also delicious. Both dishes came with a side of rice and she even gave us more rice when it was done at no extra cost. The portions did not seem big but we were full when done. I will definitely return to try more dishes and hope they are consistent with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"6.99 for the best Bombay Chicken ever? Hell yes. I'm not even reviewing the rest of it. The place is a hole in the wall. Who cares. The chicken of killer. The washrooms are small. Who cars. The chicken is killer. The decor is non existent. Who cares. The chicken is killer. Have you noticed a theme here yet? Come get the chicken. It's killer."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef Thai spicy noodle.... not very impressed. Had a piece of beef and my mouth were full of starch and tasted like baking soda. Uneven chucks of beef. Noodles doesn't have much taste. Just a very weird dish. Also tried their Singapore noodle and pad Thai..... also not impressive at all so not gonna bother to write more....enough said"}
{"text":"Price and quantity was not what I expected. Ordered a Hakka noodle with shrimp and chicken. Cost = $11 taxes included. Pretty pricey for this dish. If I went to Tangra Villa, the same dish costs be $8.90.

Portion size was ok, and taste was ok, but nothing spectacular.

For the price difference, I will voyage to McCowan instead of Markham Rd and visit Tangra Villa. Tastier, bigger portions, friendlier staff, and better deal."}
{"text":"2.5 star

I am a little confused...

Hakka wok serves \"Fine Thai Indian Style Chinese Szechuan Food\" according to their flyer. I really have no idea what that is.. I guess is \"spicy\" fusion?

My Yelp Friend was nice enough to pick up 2 items for me to try out:

Chicken Pakora ($8.50) and Hakka Chow Mein with Beef ($7.50) probably not the worst \"Hakka\" food I ever eat. Chicken Pakora though a little dry because it used white meat.. The Hakka Chow Mein was surprisingly spicy with a good kick which I really enjoyed!

Portion size is huge.... I have enough for lunch the next day!

Hakka Wok might not be my choice for take out or even Hakka food but if some one going to pick up something for me to try again, I won't really mind.."}
{"text":"Excellent little Hakka place. Food is very delicious! Their Chicken pakoras are the best!"}
{"text":"I'm here now trying their Bombay chicken. My, my, my, this is delicious, the taste is definitely there. Very good portion for lunch, only 6.99 11-4pm. I'm surprised that it's not busier in here!! Come try the Bombay, especially if you like spice."}
{"text":"The food quality is pretty good I must say. I've had take out twice and I must say that the chili chicken is great and the quantity is very generous (Bigger portion compared to what is offered at Tangerine or Federick). I will also add that the beef with broccoli plate was also good. I highly recommend Hakka Wok."}
{"text":"This place is small but if you get a seat it's great (busy during lunch). I usually get take out ... they are quick and helpful when you order. Ordered the Hakka noddle and pakora  chicken and it was good ... shrimp and lobster not so good but ok it's a hakka place ...spicy chili chicken is good aswell as their chicken wonton."}
{"text":"This is one of those fusion places, serves Thai, Indian, and chinese food. 
Lunch specials are very cheap, I had chilli chicken. It was very okay; heavily breaded and not enough flavour; probably won't get this dish again from here.
The mango chicken was just a OK; little chunks of mango mixed into chicken, not very authentic Thai."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are very worth the price. Roughly $6 for rice dish with a drink. Also the service is very fast. Good place to come for a quick bite."}
