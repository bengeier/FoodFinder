{"text":"We saw this BBQ place and had to try it. I ordered a beef brisket sandwich and smoked wings, my son ordered the 2 meat dinner with pulled pork and  And brisket with pork and beans and coleslaw. The service was good and very friendly. I know the other reviews said bad service, but the kids working tonight we're great. They reheated the smoked wings per order and carefully weighed the portions of pork and beef. The smoked wings were excellent. They tasted great and fell off the bones tender. The brisket, not so good. The meat was tasty and tender, but it was more like chuck roast than brisket. Very fatty and greasy. Even the cut was in chunks not layers. The sauce we used was the original and very good. I cannot do spicy so didn't try any other sauces. The facility was clean but small. Give it a try and make your own decision."}
{"text":"Food was rather bland had to drown it in sauce...shouldn't you smell the smoker or something when you are walking in? Or at least inside!? I think that should of tipped me off"}
{"text":"Really good beef brisket sandwich, Jimmy Boy sandwich, fries and excellent baked beans. Portions were very reasonable and prices were good. I would ditch the hard, cold, dense bread and go with a fresh, warmed, crusty roll. The bread detracted from the delicious meat. Can't wait to come back and try the smoked wings and ribs!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ, best people, and best service around. Everything falls off the bone, and they even do some great nachos and burritos."}
{"text":"Had carry out order for work meeting, fun way to end the winter (we hope!).  Really enjoyed the food and sauces."}
{"text":"My kid and I tried out this new BBQ place the other day.  I had a quarter slab rib dinner, ribs were good, green beans were average, didnt much care for the parsley potatoes, yummy cornbread muffin.  My kid liked his PulledPork slider and the mac&chz was standard for a BBQ place.  The price / quality-quantity ratio was a bit high for my liking but overall I thought it was ok but not great."}
{"text":"Dissapointed,  would not recommend this place,  small portions, get double the meat at old Carolina, the sauces are bland, and the sides are terrible and they expect you to tip for just making the food?!?  I will not be back"}
{"text":"Whoa! Can't believe I've driven past this place so many times while I should have been stopping in! We tried it all, brisket, pulled pork, ribs, wings, Mac n' cheese, fries, parsely potatoes, cornbread, and all the sauces. I loved EVERY BITE. I consider myself a BBQ enthusiast and this place deserves 2 thumbs way up. Will go back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times. The owners are very friendly. The place smells delicious and is very clean. The food is amazing. I specifically eat the ribs and wings, with mac n' cheese, and the meat literally falls off the bone! There is quite an extensive menu that can satisfy a group, and they keep your drinks filled. The sauce choices can kick the meal up a notch, but even without, the food is great! I am surprised by some of the reviews. These people have done a great job not only sprucing up the location, but offering food beyond the typical sub shop. Keep up the good work Jimmy's!"}
{"text":"No. No. No. And just. N. O.  No smoke in the meat.... No flavor.  Daughter got the pulled pork sandwich. Again-- no flavor. Sauce was lacking full body.....????? Where did this place come from? I got the pulled pork \"nachos\".... And if you call Nachos--- chips swimming in cheap cheese sauce with little else--- well, then that's what I got.  The chips were soggy upon arriving home (less than 3 miles away).... Yuk.  Knowing the portions/measurements now since owning my own place-- I dare say there was 3 oz of meat in them. And that's being generous.  Pathetic really. They came in that spot and obviously is corporate owned. Why not do it right??? They've got the money to back it. Esthetically they transformed the little location fabulously. But who cares about that??  Use some spice rub in that meat--- and salt/pepper go a long way too!  From a previous visit, My daughter also said the Mac n cheese had no flavor as well.  Well, there's obviously a market for lack luster, tasteless food and the Falls has hit it!!!!  Sorry guys. I will continue to make my own food at home that's DA BOMB."}
{"text":"2 words...\"smoked wings\"! Total game changer.   I'm yet to have anything from this restaurant that isn't great. Everything is delicious...but the smoked wings are a real \"one of a kind\" treat. The pulled pork requires an immediate \"Mmmmm\" at first bite.  The staff is fun, friendly, and helpful. These guys catered a work event and did an amazing job. The cuyahoga falls location is always super clean and family friendly. Whom ever you decide to take here...friends/family/date...it is guaranteed to be a comfortably casual and delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in looking for a quick but tasty lunch while in town recently.  The place is quaint but the look / feel is very good.  We were warmly welcomed as we entered and the service was good.  It's a walk up and order your meal while they prepare it right there kind of place.  Felt like a BBQ version of Chipotle.  I LOVE BBQ and have had it in a number of places so maybe my standards are really high but this was just OK.  I got the two meat platter with brisket and smoked sausage.  I had green beans and cole slaw for my side.  The sausage was definitely better than the brisket.  Both were just OK.  The beans were mushy, think Kentucky Fried Chicken, since they were simmering in water.  My daughter hated them.  I thought they were OK.  The cole slaw was slaw, nothing fancy there.  The best thing was likely the cornbread muffin.  The meal was fine but given the chance, we'd likely try somewhere else next  time."}
{"text":"It was \"ok\". If you are going to claim to be authentic southern BBQ- you need to deliver that.  The BBQ was dry. Side dishes- bland.   They have potential. Would like to see them kick it up a notch or two."}
{"text":"Before I start, I really do want to recommend giving this place a shot regardless of negative reviews. Everyone, of course, has their own tastes but I definitely think this is BY FAR the best bbq around. The first time I went here (in early Fall of '15) I thought it was good but portions were small for the money. I went back tonight and the beef brisket sandwich was  FANTASTIC! buttered roll with brisket and just a touch of bbq. I've read the other reviews and I think when opening up a new restaurant those type of kinks still need to be worked out, in particular the service. I got great service and was stuffed after eating the sandwich and their fresh cut fries. I'll be going back much more regularly :)"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week and was pleased.  I arrived shortly before closing so I was the only there and got my food to go, but the food was great and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I was rather apprehensive about trying it because of the other reviews. The fall off the bone meat was tender, moist, and very flavorful! It was so good that after eating our lunch, we had to get carry out for dinner. We will definitely frequent this restaurant and if it was closer we would eat there regularly!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Fair prices and good portions. Try all the sauces. Brisket chili with rock your socks off. See ya again soon Jimmys!"}
{"text":"First time here over the weekend. My wife and I had a craving for BBQ and have always heard great things about this place. It didn't disappoint! Great food and friendly service. We will most definitely be back!  I recommend the ribs or their wings, both were fall off the bone perfection!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim after driving by it a few times and being curious about it. This place had some good reviews so we were really looking forward to trying it.  We got: -brisket -ribs -sausage -chopped chicken -chicken wings -mac and cheese -green beans -baked beans -corn muffins  The good: fast, no wait, friendly wait staff. The mustard BBQ sauce was good.  The meh: the food. The meat was not bad, but just generally bland. The smoked wings in particular were kind of gross. The skin wasn't fully cooked through and had a slimy, rubbery consistency.  For $30 for two people, really not worth it. You want a great local BBQ place, look up Sides To Go in Macedonia"}
{"text":"Ribs and wings are so tender about fall off the bone! Cooked perfectly, great flavor!!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken had a terrible and dry taste. The brisket was smoked for 2 minutes, if at all. I asked the person behind the counter if the lemonade was homemade and they said yes,  absolutely no way it was. Portion sizes are awful and they are not flavorful at all. I threw the chicken away rather than taking it home to my dog. I will never come here again or recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Took family there for lunch the sauce was great , the meat was tender and the service was polite and quick. I live less then 2 miles from  place but Tuesday was the first time I went. Will be back and will recommend to anyone. Good job!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Jimmy's but it won't be our last. We stopped in on a whim and boy am I glad we did. I have been to many barbecue joints in my life and this one ranks right up there even in comparison to the Memphis restaurants I visited. This is an order at the counter place. We took our time figuring out our order and I was offered a sample of the Wednesday special, smoked wings. It was amazing possibly the best non sauced chicken I have ever eaten, crisp skin, juicy, smokey, with a hint of dry rub. We had to add a dozen to the order. We also had the brisket which was chopped tender juicy and delicious, a slab of ribs, they came pre sauced and cooked perfectly. Most barbecue joints treat their sides as an after thought not here they were all above average.   While a lot of these negative reviews reference poor customer service our experience could not have been better. It did take some time for our order to come out but this is not a fast food joint. While we waited we talked to our server and sampled sauces.    This area desperately needed a good bbq joint.  I had high hopes for old Carolina but while good it's not great."}
{"text":"Disgusting!! Went here a few months ago, they heated up the ribs in a microwave and gave me cold sides and a cold and stale corn muffin. Not only was the Mac and cheese cold, it was also tasteless. My fiancé got pulled pork that a girl pulled out of a pot with her glove covered hand and then placed in a used styrofoam cup to be weighed on a scale before putting on a stale burger bun. Do they not have kitchen utensils?!?! This place should be shut down, will never come back!"}
{"text":"****Get the white sauce for your fries!!!!  The BBQ was better than expected - ribs were good and the brisket was very tasty, although lots of fat. LOVED the sauces (slap yo mama - FAVE!) and the fries were extra yummy.  Very nice surprise and friendly team - thank you!"}
{"text":"I would HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND eating here if you care about service.   I stopped in for lunch today and the counter service was chaotic to say the least.   My order was given to the person behind me and the staff was dismayed when I said no thank you to a 10 minute wait due to the error.   I called the restaurant and spoke to Judy who then made a litany of excuses as to why the service was so poor.   She offered me a free lunch but that was not the point nor the desire.   I wanted to make her aware that if she or her staff would have simply said,  may I offer you something else the error could have been erased.   She then goes on to tell me how much she does for the community and that she couldn't believe this issue would cause me not to come anymore.   Unfortunately in today's world restaurants are common and in this case so is poor service.   Also,  how long does food sit in plastic bins before being served?   A lot of the items were not fresh and had been stored for some time."}
{"text":"Let me start out by admitting that I never write restaurant reviews...I'd rather spend the time eating than typing on my phone. That being said, if there was a way to give this place zero stars, I would.  For atmosphere, I'd give an 8/10. It was very well put together, cute decor, but all too new, too put-together to be a good, gritty, rib joint if you know what I mean. At least it was clean.  My boyfriend and I ordered a platter that came with ribs, wings, 2 meats, 2 sides, and cornbread/rolls. Being the first time there, we asked what the girl behind the counter for recommendations: Recommended Pulled Pork - it looked exactly like canned cat food. It was the worst pulled pork I've ever had. Parsley Potatoes - Boiled potatoes with water running off them. And this restaurant is famous for them? Basically, everything was disgusting. Baked-beans no flavor, dry wings, meatless ribs, dry cornbread. We didn't finish anything and I threw it all away, which I hate doing. The thoughts that kept going through my mind were 'cat food' and 'moist cafeteria leftovers'. Ew. The thing that really stuck with us afterwards was why would someone cook such food and think to themselves \"Hey, this food isn't great, let's open a restaurant.\""}
{"text":"OMG these smoked chicken wings!!!!  i swear they were only one crispy piece of skin away from being the best wings in the city.  found this place randomly on yelp because i wanted some wings.  when we got there it was wing night so we ordered 20 wings.  they came out so quick!  they smelled amazing as soon as they hit the counter.  i could barely wait to get home to eat them.  the meat literally fell off the bone.  i have not had wings from a resturant ever that the meat just fell off like that.  they were so tastey.  the only thing i didnt like is the skin didnt get crispy.  im not a fan of slimy chicken skin but it was honestly not a deal breaker for because the meat slipped right off and it was still very flavorful!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Jimmys for the first time. The pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket were fantastic. They may move into the regular \"take out dinner\" rotation."}
{"text":"Not the greatest pulled pork I've ever had, but its good and probably the best in the area.  I'm a little surprised by the other reviews because my experience was good.  This place is brand new, so there might be some issues training new people.  Give them a chance."}
{"text":"Stop by for the heck of it . And the rubs and sauces are the best the Mac @ cheese  wow .  So if u see there name stop by and have a few runs best for me so far"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local BBQ spots in the Falls.  Great selection of sauces and the meats are always spot on. My personal favorite: BBQ rice bowl with chicken, original sauce, lettuce, cheese, banana peppers, and sour cream.   We've also used Jimmys to cater a number of family events and it's always a hit!"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything we had on our plates was great. The parsley potatoes were kinda blah... basically new potatoes straight from a can and had some butter and parsley added. But otherwise the rest of the meats and sides were great.  There was also a regular customer in there who goes by the name \"Larry\". He was great for entertainment.  A bit pricey... but I have no problem paying a bit more for good food."}
{"text":"Saw an ad for this place at the HiHo brewery. Not disappointed!!! We had the family meal for 4.  Big portions, ribs and brisket were tender and delicious. Skip the mac and cheese. The baked beans were excellent. Owner was friendly and attentive. It is not a fancy restaurant but the food is definitely worth a night out!"}
{"text":"Good beef brisket. The sandwich was very small but baked beans serving was good. Baby back ribs are good but not very smokey. Sandwich should be twice the size and you could charge 8.99 for it. Just a suggestion!"}
{"text":"This place is not a true BBQ place.....if you claim to be a BBQ place you better smoke your meats....waste of money"}
{"text":"Very below average.  I got the one meat dinner with the beef brisket.  The brisket was awful.  Lots of fat.  The macaroni and cheese had no flavor.  The BBQ sauces were very runny and none of them were very good.  Very overpriced.  Just say no."}
{"text":"Not sure why the other reviews were so harsh.  I enjoyed my experience.  Stopped in a few weeks back to pick up lunch. I decided on the plate with three meats because I wanted some leftovers.  I actually didn't care for the brisket.  I was there in the middle of the afternoon, and it seemed as if it had been sitting in the steam table for a long while.  The mac and cheese was just so-so as well.  However,  I was blown away with the rest of my choices.  The baked beans and ribs were both worth going back for. Tasty corn bread as well.  But what really blew me away was the smoked sausage. I want to eat it every day of my life (if my waistline could afford it)! As far as the price,  I felt it was on par with other BBQ joints.  The place is just getting it's feet under it. Give them a shot!"}
