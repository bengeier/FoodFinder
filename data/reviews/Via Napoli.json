{"text":"Amazing pizza, true Italian cooking. The chef is from Napoli and this is reflected in the quality of the ingredients and the amazing texture of the pizza dough."}
{"text":"Best Pizza by far in Etobicoke and one of the best in Toronto. Melenzane a Funghetti was delicious. Perfect restaurant for a date night. Great ambiance, Great Wine and most importantly Great people. Really happy to see a genuine Napoli pizza near home."}
{"text":"OMG real Neapolitan Pizza  in Etobicoke . Chef owned . The chef is a nice young guy from Napoli. He is obviously passionate and knows what he is doing. Had three pizzas Neopolitan  , Diavalo, Capricciosa, all incredible. The flour is from Italy yielding a nice chewy not overdone crust. San Marzano tomato sauce from Pulia, and fresh fior di latte cheese. You can ask for a side of hot sauce to drizzle on the pizza , its house made from Habinero chiles. A dozen or so craft brews available. Two thumbs up. One of the best pizzarias in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very average and one of the only restaurants that I've been to where you don't smell any food what so ever! Strange very strange.. Pizza was descent and probably the only Napoleon style pizzas you can get in etobicoke.. but I'd rather go downtown for a better experience"}
{"text":"The flavours were good however pizza was served on a regular plate which by the time it made it to our table (only 10 feet away) due to the steam became soggy underneath. Wait time for food was on the longer side."}
{"text":"New to the neighbourhood, Via Napoli is an authentic Neapolitan pizzeria. It has the most delicious pizza and great beers on tap. The oven (imported from Italy - I was told they had to break the door to fit it inside) is right by the entrance so you can watch the pizzaiolo make your pizza. I had the Salsiccie e Friarielli (sausage, rapini, pecorino, fior di latte mozzarella). Quality ingredients. The dough was perfect, soft and crispy at the same time. Then, some tiramisu to end the meal beautifully. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Highly recommended."}
