{"text":"Went back and had the Eggplant Parmesan this time; it was really excellent. Better impression overall than my last visit. If my last review was sort of 3.5 stars rounded up, this is more like 4.5 stars rounded down."}
{"text":"Nigro's is another restaurant I've been going to for longer than I can remember.   They have decent Italian food for really cheap, and excellent pizzas. One of their best items is the home-made wedding soup. I always take a quart or two home with me.   I am giving it three stars because unfortunately, it has gone down in quality over the past ten years. Waitstaff are slow and sometimes rude. I've found that most of their items simply don't have the same great taste as they once did.   For example, the lasagna was dry and the wrong sauce was used. Once, even my coveted wedding soup tasted like water. Nevertheless, Nigro's is a good bang for your buck. They also have a large bar and more than enough seating."}
