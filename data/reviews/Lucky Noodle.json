{"text":"Every broth is well done, tons of noodle choices and the service is quick. The milk tea or coffee that comes with the food typically comes pretty slow, so it's worth just getting it to go when you order it. 

A lot of fantastic toppings to choose from as well, tons of different meats though lacking in vegetables. The menu is also in English as well so you don't need to worry about not being able to understand what's written (and there's paper check boxes for you to fill in so you don't need to talk to the servers). 

Hadn't had a visit yet where I wasn't happy leaving."}
{"text":"Deep fish broth base great price includes Free coffee or hk tea or ice cream of choice. The toppings there are very generous. Service though was slow because of short staff. Maybe because it's still new. Although they tried their best to please even with the delays. Their hk tea was smooth and perfect. Just how it should be!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I came here, the service was great and so was the food. But now, the service sucks and sometimes they get our orders wrong. Also, if you're seated in the back corner by the washroom, you're literally not going to get any service. It's like a hidden room. You're going to have to get up and tell them your order at the cashier."}
{"text":"This is a place where our family a group of 7 people usually come for dinner once every two weeks on a regular basis lol. Other than its regular a la carte menu, they also have a so-called order list for you to pick your own noodle combination. You can choose your preferred soup base ranging from super spicy tom yam to fish tofu soup and a few toppings. It also comes with dessert or drink for the meal, such as ice cream, pudding, coffee, milk tea, and hot lemon tea. 

Except for the soup noodles, I recently prefer to pick a different dish - salmon teriyaki served with salmon, over easy egg, broccoli and rice. It also comes with an option for free dessert or drink. They really can make good salmon teriyaki, so yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Lucky Noodles for the first time last night and was very impressed with the service and quality of the food.  The servers were attentive and the drinks and food were served quickly.  We were a group of four.  A couple of us ordered the Japanese style thick pork soup and I thought it was really good.  It had good flavour and was well seasoned.  Another in our party ordered the Chaozhou style dried fish and minced pork fish soup and commented that you could taste the fish flavor (not in a bad way).  We usually visit Deer Garden, but have noticed a decline in quality the last few times we've visited.  The soup bases aren't as flavourful and tasted watered down.  I really like that Lucky Noodles provides a couple more soup base options as well as some toppings that aren't offered at Deer Garden.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place today after going grocery shopping. I liked their build a noodle bowl combo! Good number and variety of toppings to select from. Prices were great. 

Some of the staff did not speak English but a waitress who did not understand what we were saying was quick to get someone who could better communicate with us, which was greatly appreciated. I had the Japanese thick pork soup with beef slices, udon noodles and mushroom balls, beef tongue as a side and mango pudding for dessert. 

It did not take them long to serve us the food which was nice. The soup base was miso which was a tad salty but had good depth of flavour and was served at the appropriate temperature for optimal taste. Beef slices were good and thin and the pork/mushroom balls had a firm texture and mild flavour profile. Also the no msg thing was a welcomed bonus.

My favourite part oddly enough was the beef tongue side dish which my dad convinced me to try. It was coated in teriyaki sauce, was tender but still managed to have a good hearty bite and chew. 

Mango pudding tasted almost like panna cotta since it was so creamy and decadent, yet still had pieces of mango to make it light and refreshing. I only wish it was larger in size, although since it left me wanting more it can definately be labelled as a quality dessert. 

Really the only downside was that the tea had a sort of chlorine smell to it, which possibly may be attributed to the type of tea it was...not sure...anyhow it was complimentary. 

My advice would be to come here for good service, awesome food and great prices and avoid the free tea."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Lucky for a while and the dish size is smaller than when it first opens.

I have been eating there more frequent due to the 10% discount coupon which has no restriction,  However, when I try to use the coupon today on Labour day, it is disallowed as the owner said due to big holiday.  

It is not right as there is no restriction printed on the coupon and I would classify that the ad is misleading and first advertising !"}
{"text":"This place has amazing fish soup! It's great to be able to customize your noodle soup so you can try something different all the time. The portion is quite large (for me) and usually I can never finish the entire bowl. It is reasonably priced considering the noodle soup comes with a drink. The appetizers are quite small for $1.98/dish. I do think they are a bit stingey on the two toppings you're allowed to add to your noodles. Other than that, I would still always come back here."}
{"text":"Love their fish soup - its always hot and flavourful. I find their broth better than Deer Garden. The bowl always come fully loaded with veggies and two toppings of your choice. Tip: instead of ordering some side dishes for $3, you can add them as a topping for about $1.50.

Comes with a drink or mango pudding."}
{"text":"First time at this place. I find it pretty good for the amount I'm paying. Would definitely give it another try. The broth was sort of like a hot pot or instant noodle flavour... I ordered a spicy broth but found that it wasn't spicy at all. I love that I could customize my own noodles though. The service was okay and the food was served quickly."}
{"text":"DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR THEIR COLD DRINKS!!!...  They cheap out on ingredients making your drinks and it taste like water.  After complaining to the waitstaff about it, no one gave a s*#t about my complaint.  The soup base is decent BUT they cheap out on the ingredient (surprise surprise)....."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fish broth soup typically but I have to say I quite enjoyed it here at Lucky Noodle.

They serve up msg-free fish broth soup and also offer other broth bases as well that are not msg-free. You pick 2 toppings, noodle type, and a coffee, tea or dessert for $8.99. Can't really beat that price nowadays.  

The fish broth was flavourful and not fishy. It was a touch salty for my preference but it wasn't overwhelmingly salty. Aside from your choice of toppings they also throw in some fresh green onions, mushrooms and parsley into the bowl.  It's a hefty meal to be honest.

The fact that there's so msg in the fish soup was good because I feel like there's just so much msg filled options in Markham and it seems impossible to get away from it.  I didn't taste the difference and found my bowl of soup to be quite delicious!  Would come again."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I am quite pleased with the simple (and fun) ordering system. You take an order sheet per person, and use a pen to check some boxes to indicate your selection of soup base, type of noodles, omission of certain default toppings, and two desired toppings ranging from various meats to veggies. Additional toppings cost extra. And it comes with a coffee or tea. All this for about 10 bucks or less, with large portions, that's great value.

The Fish Soup:
Excellent! Most people are turned off by this because they think the soup will be fishy tasting, but it's not! It's actually really tasty and clean tasting. You wouldn't even know it's fish based if no one told you. Best of all is the clearly indicate on the order sheet that all their fish-based soups have NO MSG! How wonderful is that? The other soup options sound mighty tasty, but with MSG in them I had to pass, since I love drinking most of the soup when I eat noodles. I've been here several times and I always order the Fish soup with century egg. Ample portions of egg, if you love the stuff as much as I do.

The Noodles:
They give you a lot. Prepare to be stuffed.

The Toppings:
They have the Japanese pork that you can find at ramen places. Delicious tender fatty pork. Their bok-choy was fresh and crispy, what a perfect veggie to add to noodle soup. There is a wide, wide selection of stuff, so take your time deciding. My tip to you is to keep it around 2 to 4 toppings because you have to remember that a bowl can only fit so much, so too many toppings means they will have to reduce the quantity of those toppings, meaning you won't get your money's worth (toppings in excess of two will cost extra).

Complaints:
- The beef brisket was tough, not tender at all. 
- The milk-tea was powdery tasting, not a real Hong Kong style milk tea. It's from a mix, and it was unpleasant. 
- The default tea they served had a slight chlorine taste, I didn't drink anymore after the initial sip.
- I wish there was an option for more green onions and cilantro, I like a layer of green stuff on top of my soup.
- The outdoor entrance from the parking lot is locked, which is stupid. They should allow customers to enter from the front. Rather, you are forced to enter the mall and approach the restaurant from the inside. 


I've been back several times and can see myself going again in the future. Very good value."}
{"text":"God bless this place. A huge bowl of fully customizable noodles with so many options to choose from and a mango pudding dessert, all for $10.18 (including tax)! This place is my go-to, not only do they have great noodle soups, but also tasty sandwiches and rice dishes as well. Most importantly the place doesn't give off a unsanitary vibe, and their food isn't overly oily like the others. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Looking for a noodle soup place in Markham where you can make it your own way with your own choice of noodles and toppings? This is definitely a good go to! Went here for the first time with a friend and I was surprised! Sometimes I crave for noodle soup but not exactly the pho style and this place is perfect for that!

Menu is small but still has interesting variety and options. But never look for quantity over quality! Pricing is fair and food tasted pretty good. Service was fair as well but it was somewhat quiet although it was during the \"dinner time\". There were maybe a few other tables with us?

Overall I would definitely return to this place given the quality and also because you can put together your own unique noodle soup! Kind of a nice twist instead of being given the standard noodle soup options :)"}
{"text":"The worst and dirtiest restaurant ever. There was a small cockroach after im done with their fish soup. No apologies after i talked with them and complained. Please never go to this restaurant for your own safety"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:45pm, Enjoyed Happy Hour Special... $ 4.99 per order with 1 soup base, 2 toppings and 1 hot drink. Soup Base taste better than deer garden, the toppings I ordered were fish puff and luncheon meat. You can taste the supplier were of those were same as what you ate at deer garden but half the cost. The best part is the luncheon meat, they used Greatwall White Piggy which is one of most expensive brand for luncheon meat. Tried the teriyaki chicken, a bit over fried, ox tounge would be a must try ! Tasted very tender...Their complimentary tea tasted good also as you can tasted it was the HK Gold Tea King Tea Leaves Blend.  Forgot to mentioned they served COME BUY bubble teas..FYI = same owner as the once Jap AYCE
..."}
{"text":"Basically a typical 'Create your own noodle soup bowl' place (similar to deer garden) but I believe it's a bit cheaper. Considering on how cheap it is you would assume the bowl to have less than what it is, but mine came with a good amount of meat with veggies and a ton of noodles that I didn't even finish eating. The fish broth soup with no msg was good! Also ordered a couple of side dishes that were decent, the teriyaki chicken was my fave. And comes with a drink of your choice if you pay the difference! Service is fast! Definitely recommend if you're in the Markham area looking for something quick to eat!"}
{"text":"Very nice customizable noodle restaurant. Cheaper than Deer Garden (~$9 non msg soup/ ~$8 other types), more ingredients to choose from. (lamb!!!!) 
****They offer ice cream and pudding as desert/ drink! 
I definitely recommend everyone to try it. It's my go to lunch hub, they have wifi too!"}
{"text":"I'm so utterly disappointed with my experience here tonight. I used to be a frequent customer but this was my first time coming back in a few months and it seems everything's gone downhill.

Let's start with the wait-time. I arrived around 6:30pm for what I hoped to be a quick dinner and the my simple order of soup noodles didn't arrive until 7:15pm. It was evident that the restaurant was severely understaffed because more than 50% of the time, I couldn't wave down either of the two waitresses - they were both busily scurried away in the kitchen.

Then, my food came. I ordered the \"Italian tomato bone soup\" with thick noodles and for my 2 toppings, red sausage and beef balls. The beef balls were decent but the red sausage was a little too oily and had a weird aftertaste. What made me the saddest of all was that the broth was so diluted and lacking in flavour that I felt like I was just eating bland cooked noodles. 

And here's the kicker - in the middle of my meal, I noticed something odd floating around in my soup. I went to fish it out with my chopsticks and found this large film of garbage... maybe the leftovers of dried sauce in a wok? I have no idea. I was so turned off after that though.

The ONLY redeeming part of this \"combo\" was that it came with the choice of a drink or ice cream and the store-bought ice cream was the best part of the meal. 

Overall, was I full from the meal? Yep, the portions were quite hefty. However, did I derive any enjoyment whatsoever from my meal? Absolutely not. It's highly unlikely that I'll be coming back - at $9/bowl, I'd rather pay an extra $1-3 at a different soup noodle establishment for a much better dining experience."}
{"text":"It's decent but definitely not as good as Deer Garden. It's a fairly close imitation but I found that the quantity of meat was much less. The quality of the meat was also not great either. I ordered the grilled ox tongue on the side and it was small, hard to chew and not particularly tender. It is cheaper than Deer Garden but that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"Like Deer Garden, Lucky Noodle offers the noodle soup with a number of toppings, soup base of your choice, noodles of your choice, accompanying sides for a lower price, and a drink.   Here, they also gave the option of a dessert instead of a drink too.

I ordered a rice dish, the Teriyaki Chicken with Egg on Rice.  This was a standard-tasting dish."}
{"text":"Came here for the afternoon special.  A bowl of noodles with a hot drink for only $5.99.  

I ordered the coriander and preserved egg, fish soup base with the round rice noodles(lai fan). Toppings I picked were fish tofu and luncheon meat (they pan sear the luncheon meat and place it on a seperate side dish, so it doesn't get soggy in the soup, nice touch).  My daughter ordered the japanese pork bone soup base with instant noodles.  She got beef tendon balls and dumplings.  We ordered a side of beef short ribs too.  The bowls of noodles were a decent size, enough to fill you up.  Apparently, the special priced ones are smaller than their regular size so if you are hungry, you just order the regular priced bowls.  Both bowls were decent, only thing was my noodles were too soft.  But apart from that, no complaints.  Got hot lemon tea and hot ovaltine for our drinks.  Both were a small cup but nice tasting, we had already gotten a cup of tea before we ordered, anyways. 

Nice place to go for a filling decent bowl of food.  Servers are very nice and polite too.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad. I visited as a group of 4. 

Menu and style was completely like Deer Garden, except the drinks were must smaller and the quality was way worse. The price was only about $1 less than Deer Garden. 

One of the toppings ordered was Japanese BBQ pork which came on a side plate, covered in a different (and surprisingly bland) broth, rather than IN THE BOWL WITH THE NOODLES. That took an extra 15 minutes to arrive. There was only 3 pieces, too. 
Other toppings that we had were shrimp, fish puffs, and bean curd which all tasted like they all came straight from the freezer. We could all taste the freezer water as you bit into the food. 

All variations of the broths were bland, and the noodles were very soggy, and broke immediately as you tried to pick it up with your chopsticks.

The drinks that came with the meal were all watered down. The cups were hot, but the drink inside the cup was not hot at all. I would say it would be a little warmer than room temperature. The size of the drink was so much more smaller than Deer Garden. 

They gave a small cup of tea at the beginning and despite us finished all the tea in our cups halfway through our meal, we never got refills of tea. This left us very thirsty throughout the meal. 

I would definitely not recommend coming to this place as it is not worth the money for this quality and service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place on a cold winter day. I ordered the laksa soup base with yellow egg noodles and beef brisket and lamb slides, which came with a milk tea. I also ordered the lemon grass chicken appetizer. 
The milk tea was a bit flavorless but that isn't what I went there for. The appetizer came out hot and crispy. The chicken was pan fried perfectly with the skin on. For some reason most of the lemon grass sauce was under the chicken but that's just a little thing. I like the laksa soup base a lot. It was pretty spicy but still had a bit of that coconut flavour you expect. The spiciness also just sat on your tongue the whole time rather than set it on fire. What really won me over was the beef brisket because it was thickly sliced and generously given. I ordered 2 meats because I thought they would only give me a couple small pieces but I was so wrong. The lamb was fine but didn't really have much of a taste in the spicy soup. I also liked that this place automatically adds a good helping of cabbage, enoki and regular mushroom to your soup. I'd also like to mention that the bowl was pretty deep and very wide (but you can see that in picture).

All of this came up to about $10 which is pretty great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch due to a friend's recommendation. We arrived at the restaurant. My friend reminded me that the front door is inside the mall. Just a head's up for others on that. So I arrived and we had to wait for about 5 mins or so. After we sat down, a mad rush came. This is a good sign. 

So we saw the menu. And spied on other tables. The bowls are huge! Not just the bowl size, but also the content. That's a good thing. So I ordered noodles with dumplings and fish tofu. The base ingredients are quite hefty already that includes bamboo shoots, veggies and mushrooms. On top of the noodles and soup. Btw, the base price really give you lots of noodles. Taste wise it's not bad. Compare to other places, the flavour is about the same. But overall, I like it. 

Service wise, lots of staff moving and serving. So this place wins by volume. Service attitude isn't bad. They are busy, but they don't forget what I asked for. So that's a bit better than what you get for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I heard from my friend that Lucky Noodles is kind of the same as Deer Garden which we always go to despite that the price has increased cause it never disappoint me. I was thinking maybe i  should give it a try. However, this experience is so disappointing. The service was exceptionally bad as we were not greeted and just pointed to a table. When we were about to place the order, the waitress just walked by us even though she knew we were ready. The drink took half an hour to come. The food took a total of an hour to come. The table which sat half an hour later then us got their food before us. As soon as I saw the other table got their food. Then I asked the waitress, and she came back with the order papers asking :\"Are these your orders?\". Then we got our food after an other 10 minutes. I asked for the bill when we got our food. The bill came in like 10 seconds, and the waiter was surprised that we got our bill while we still having our meal. We ordered ox tongue as side dish which still did not come after we finish the meal. And I told the waitress we already finished eating, we don't want the side dish any more, and she said :\" once you placed the order, you cannot take it out.\" She literally walked away and came back in 5 minutes with the side dish. I took it to go. The noodle was too soft that i cannot even pick it up with my chopsticks. The fish soup base is not as tasty as Deer Garden. After all, I will never go back there again even though it is cheaper than Deer Garden. I enjoy going to Deer Garden even we always have to wait for the table, but they have the nicest stuff there and the service was fast and never disappointed me."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd rate it about 3.75 (if I were to be super picky). Having tried the popular Deer Garden relatively recently, I feel like I can make a pretty good comparison between the two. The noodle combo is exactly the same: soup base + noodles + 2 toppings + hot drink (cold = $1 extra) 

Good: 
Lucky noodles is $1 cheaper than Deer Garden (at time of review) 
Less popular so there's less of a wait 
More comfortable and spacious seating 
Seems to have more topping options 

Bad:
Less generous with their toppings 
Service seems to be hit/miss: the tables adjacent to us received their orders first despite ordering after us 
Laksa soup base is saltier/more MSG than Deer Garden - I was significantly more thirsty after eating here than at Deer Garden

I had the laksa soup at both Deer Garden and Lucky Noodles. The flavour and spice levels are comparable. The iced milk tea I had with it (perfect combination BTW) was a bit sweeter than expected, but not unwelcome. Although the portion seems to be a bit smaller here compared to Deer Garden, I actually don't mind because 1. price is less and 2. although it's smaller, I can still barely finish it (if at all). 

Final words, I would choose Lucky Noodles over Deer Garden just because I won't have to wait as long for a table (especially during weekends)."}
{"text":"Summary: South Markham's answer to Scarborough's Deer Garden, this build-your-own-noodle-bowl spot offers a bigger bang for your buck offsetting average service and meh drinks

Top Must-Get: lamb - topping
Top Regret: mango milkshake/side apps
What I'll Try Next: one of the rice combos

I came here on a Sunday afternoon at 3 pm for a late lunch. It wasn't? that busy (about a third full), and it's got more of a homely vibe (might be the potted plants they line up the shelves with).

To order, we grabbed an order sheet and just checked off the soup base, toppings, type of noodle, side order, and drink that we wanted.
They too, are missing the super wide and flat rice noodles... Alas, the journey continues. They also come with more \"base toppings\" than I'm used to (parsley, mushrooms and cabbage all come with your noodles unless you check off that you don't want it).

Anyway, their selection seems similar to competitors, but Lucky Noodle might have fewer drinks. However, while Lucky may have fewer options, they definitely come with bigger portions! 

FOOD
I got lamb and bakchoy as my toppings ($1.50 for extra toppings after two). The lamb felt a bit chewy and overcooked but it was decent. The bakchoy was standard.

The defining part of a noodle place is the soup base. One unique part about Lucky is the thick pork soup base at the same price point, which I don't think competitors offer. However, I didn't love it and will probably stick with chicken next time!

Big quantities is the name of the game here. Quality is decent. EXCEPT...

The appetizers. These are definitely smaller in size than other places, and took me about three gulps to down (to be fair, I was hungry, and most noodle-spot apps only take me five gulps to down anyway... But that's still a significant difference!)

SERVICE
Service was okay. Definitely not the most attentive servers as we had to flag them down a couple times, and they mistakenly gave us someone else's order of luncheon meat... But hey, the food came quick and they were patient with us.

All in all, it's my current preferred spot for customized noodles!"}
{"text":"Yep. Everyone's saying it, but the comparisons to Deer Garden are legit. I can't say anything about the fish soup (not a fan of fish soup), but the price point here is much more reasonable than Deer Garden. I just checked Deer Garden's website, and their noodles + toppings + drink come to $10.50. Here, Japanese pork bone broth, noodles, 2 toppings, and drink (or ice cream or mango pudding) come to $7.95. Fish soup is an additional dollar, if I recall correctly.

I was surprised to find lamb slices available as a topping. Japanese BBQ pork is also a topping option. Neither requires an upcharge, which I was very pleased to note. Those were my two topping options. The lamb was tender and flavorful and there was a decent amount of it. The BBQ pork was mostly fat, but also tender and delicious. There were at least four slices of that as well. This is made of pork belly, for those of you who care about that kind of thing. 

I had the thick vermicelli, but I was surprised to find that instant noodles and Shin ramen are both options. The distinction is nice. The broth was good, but not super milky delicious. Veggies included lots of cabbage, at least two kinds of mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. Because it was Japanese pork bone broth, there were a few slices of roasted seaweed as well. No egg though.

I also ordered the $1.99 deep fried pork chop side order in addition to my noodles. I was more curious to see what the portion would be like than anything else. It was about the size of a quarter pound burger patty. It was also, oddly enough, served with tartar sauce. I wouldn't say it was worth the extra two dollars.

I was stuffed after my noodles and pork chop, but I had opted for the mango pudding, so onto dessert! The mango pudding was larger than a shot glass, which was nice. It had a couple fairly large chunks of mango in it, and came with a side of evaporated milk. All in all, a nice way to end the meal.

Should there be a next time, I'm sticking to the noodles and mango pudding. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Went there for the weekday afternoon special.  Choice of soup, noodle and two items for $5.99 included HK milk tea from 2:30 to 5pm,

Place was not too busy.  Service was quick and efficient.  Chose the premium soup option which was the fish soup.  Very miky and creamy, not too salty.  Best of all, noodle soup was piping hot.  Chose intestine and beef brisket as the items - ok in terms of quantity.  Overall portion size of soup noodle was just right.  Don't know if they serve smaller portion because it was afternoon special but it was still a sizeable portion.

Would definitely return to try other options.  Since it's a checklist where you choose soup, noodle and toppings - lots of variations.  Will try tom yum next time with beef and squid balls."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a late night dinner. It was a cold night and we were craving something that hot and comfort food. I've passed by this restaurant several times so I've been wanting to try it. It is very similar to what Deer Garden offers. They offer various soup broths, toppings, choice of noodles drinks and side dishes. I ordered the peanut and chili soup broth with sliced beef and beef tendon balls. I chose the egg noodles, the deep fried pork chop for the side dish and cold HK style milk tea as the drink. Our food came pretty quickly. The soup base was good. It wasn't too spicy but had some meat. My only criticism here is that they need to add more meat to the dish. I felt they skimped on the meat. Aside from that, it was good. The pork chop was a nice side dish to enjoy. The drink is your average cold HK Style tea. Nothing too special. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. Loved the noodles and the soup. Will definitely be back to order some more delicious noodles!"}
{"text":"Alright this place is a no frills, quick, warming the belly goodness all for a very low price! At a regular time and weekends its $8.99. on Mon-Thurs after 8.30pm a large bowl of noodles is only $5.99 and I get ridiculously full. and you get an HK style drink to go with it. 

It's in a pretty dingy local plaza but it never disappoints and I've been mulitple times. As everyone else said its a choose your own noodle thing, pick a broth, type of noodle and what you want in it. It defaultly also comes with mushrooms and chinese cabbage. 

I usually get the fish base gingko and pepper soup and boy it is good, slightly spicy from the pepper and has a rich taste (not fishy at all if you are scared of that) they are quite generous with the squid ball and lamb portions which I usually get in my noodles. The laksa soup base is also quite good, strong curry flavour and quite spicy. 

There are also side dishes you can add for $2, the beef tongue is soft and tender and lightly panned fried. And the pork cutlet is also quite good and comes crispy. 

The booths are really spacious and while the service it mediocre it makes up for price and the food."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim and don't regret it at all. The bowls are massive and I was struggling to finish mine. I ordered one of their pre-made options but I should have customised my own because I didn't like the type of noodles they put in it. I can't remember exactly what I got but it had mushrooms, I think beef, and it was spicy. The spice was definitely there! For my drink, I got the honey green tea and it was refreshing and not grossly sweet.

I noticed that most reviews mention a comparison to Deer Garden- I personally haven't been there so I can't compare but this place was inexpensive, had large portions, and the food was good. I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"With the grand opening of Lucky Noodles, replacing what you used to be a long standing all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurant, it presents itself as another fish noodle restaurant, in competition with the popular Deer Garden. 

Taking advantage of the 10% opening discount, my friends and I decided to try out Lucky Noodles and also, to see how it fairs against Deer Garden in the fish noodle soup category.

We were surprised to see how similar the menu layout was set up to Deer Garden, but was excited to try it out anyways. Fish noodles combo start at $7.95, with the original fish soup at $8.75. Additional toppings or noodles is an extra $1.50. There is a large selection of drinks to choose from, with an extra option of mango pudding or ice cream if you opt out of drinks.

Service was attentive and quick. Food came out soon after without much waiting time. Trying out a selection of different bases from original fish soup, japanese style thick pork soup, tomatoes and pumpkin fish soup, it leaves one much more to desire. The soup base did not have that concentrated and flavourful taste, unfortunately leaving a diluted mix of disappointment. The toppings and vermicelli were decent, but what it comes down to with noodle soup, is the broth.

My friends and I wanted to like Lucky Noodles, but we would rather wait in line for Deer Garden, as quality is a desirable trait, and we did not find it here. 

Perhaps Lucky Noodles can work out their kinks and food over time, but I will not be repeating any time too soon."}
{"text":"Move over Deer Garden! This place makes better noodles at a better price.

Starting at $7.95, you can get your choice of soup base, noodles, 2 toppings, and a drink or mango pudding. In your selection, you also get tofu skin and mushrooms for free!

I recommend the laksa with sweet potato noodles, beef brisket, red sausage, and mango pudding! Only $7.95!"}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour with lots of time before 5pm.. But was charged full price and even though I told them before all the food came but didn't circle \"special\" which wasn't clear, they just ignored the request even though it was before 5 and before the food came. When we got the bill we got charged the full price and no apologies even when confronted. 

For the price you're paying, deer garden or chef Papa is a lot better quality."}
{"text":"In case you didn't know (or have been dead for the past few years..) there's been a plethora of fish noodle soups that have popped up and some are already gone. I often credit this crazy to Deer Garden and while they still do an admirable job of carrying the torch, there are many others (quality ones too) who have joined the race.
Enter Lucky Noodles occupying the space of a former sushi restaurant and many that have been there before it. This is yet another one of the \"dead\" spots in the city where it seems no business can survive for long. This just might be the turning point with this new tenant.
I would say this place is a solid 3-4 stars but I am giving the 4 because their value is unbeatable; especially with latenight value combo starting at 9pm.
These guys have all the favourites and then some various noodle and rice dishes too should you choose not to go with their staple (fish noodles). The soups are all pretty flavourful and the ingredients are all freshly prepared. This isn't premium quality but I feel you do get more than what you would pay at another similar place. The portions are quite large here and the snacks are nicely prepared at $2 a pop which is a steal! Things like pork chop, wings, beef ribs, fish fillets...all for a measly $2!
Go after 9pm if you want the late night combo of a drink and bowl of noodles for a ridiculous price! Also, ask for the XO hot sauce when you get your noodles; it adds another dimension to the flavours.
This is definitely my go to place albeit you can find better quality out there... you simply cannot beat the combination of value, convenience and flavour this place has. This is fish noodle soup after all... it shouldn't be so fancy anyways."}
{"text":"Another soup noodle haven!

After my girlfriend had been dragging me to Deer Garden (another noodle restaurant exactly like this one) and having the price go up twice already, we've found a cheaper restaurant that's on par regarding quality and above par regarding selection!

I said \"dragging\" like I didn't enjoy Deer Garden but I did, I just had it way too much. 
Lucky Noodles has the same order style as Deer Garden. You fill out a form choosing your soup base, noodle, toppings, sides and drink. Hand in that form and get your food. As little human interaction as possible. 

The quality, like I said, is exactly the same as Deer Garden. It's very good and hits the spot. No added MSG and great flavour. There are things that Deer Garden doesn't have like sliced lamb. 

Three of us had 3 different soups, noodles and toppings and they were all very satisfying.

One minor glitch is that their vermicelli thin and thick are swapped in the Chinese translation. We were told to follow the Chinese. 

\"Yay! I'm a fan.\""}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday evening with a friend for a little later dinner (8pm). Was not full but certainly wasn't empty. I would say it was at least 1/4 full.

Not too bad! Good price. I got the thick vermicelli with tomato and pumpkin soup with 4 beef balls and 4 shrimp. I enjoyed it! The soup was steaming hot, the portion is pretty big and they got all my orders correct! When I asked for no parsley, green onions and beancurds, I didn't get any of them! I know it's an option but I'm surprised they got it because Deer Garden NEVER looks at that part and throws everything in. Yes even the ones in BC because I've been there too. I liked that the shrimp did not taste frozen but rather crisp and fresh. We also got lemongrass pork chops and deep fried pork chops. Both were very good! Came with fish sauces and tartar sauce. My honey lemon tea had lots of honey/sugar in it but I guess it was alright because it balanced out with the soup salt. I mean all of these noodle soup places I've been to will automatically have a saltier soup so it's expected. 

Overall I was pleased and full. I would come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite fish soup noodle place! The broth is perfect and the portion and price are super reasonable. I always order from the pre-set menu, they have options from $6.99. My favourite is the spicy mushroom beef noodle (in fish broth). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of their free drinks. They come with the noodle, but the quality is mediocre."}
{"text":"Uhhh I got a little sick after eating here. 

It's a total rip off of Deer Garden which is also not that great to begin with. It's a build your own noodle soup bowl deal where you choose a broth, some toppings and type of noodle. You can also add on some side dishes such as beef tongue, pork cutlet, short ribs etc for a couple of bucks. There is a late night special (which we got) I guess, I dunno she just barked at us asking if we wanted the special. Which I think is $1 or $2 cheaper.

I got the original fish soup with beef brisket, fish tofu and with rice noodles. The broth was really salty but the portion was good. 

I switched my drink to a cold drink which on the order sheet said $1. Ordered a soda and Ribena which came in a pre-sealed bubble tea style cup with a sealed lid. You could tell it was pre made and sitting there for a long time because the lemon was completely soggy and wilted and it had that old lemon taste and zero fizz. When the bill came it ended up being $2 extra. The heck?

We got the bill and then were told if we wanted to pay the price of a special, it was cash only. Okay, but why didn't you tell us before when you asked if we wanted the special? 

Anyway, I will definitely not come back here. If you really desire something like this, Deer Garden is the better choice."}
{"text":"Price is great, portions are generous, food is good-tasting, and the mango pudding is delicious too! This place is definitely worth a try.

Food: 4/5 - Good tasting food, nothing too special but it hits the spot and is pretty filling.

Price: 5/5 - The pricing at Lucky Noodle is actually very good. Whereas any ramen joint sells their bowls at $12+, all of the noodle bowls here are $9, and you get a lot more than the average ramen joint (Tohenboku, Sansotei, Kinton, etc.).  

Service: 3/5 - Really slow service. Takes a long time to get seated, to get your order, and to get your bill. The biggest downside here. Staff were average for a Chinese restaurant.

I went with my family here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed. It took us a while to get seated and you could see why (they seat 1-2 people in a booth that can easily fit 4-6 people), and when we wanted the bill it also took them $10+ to get to us. It seems like they are pretty understaffed. 

I digress however. The food here for the price point (8.99) is actually really good. I had pretty low expectations but it was actually really good.

The premise here for all their noodle bowls is that you choose the soup base, 2 toppings, noodle type and you get a drink/dessert for free as well. I got the Japanese pork soup base, with beef brisket and chasu pork.  Both meats were full of flavour and tender, and they were pretty generous with their portions (I think i got 3-4 of each meat). The soup base was also very good and tasted pretty similar to what you would get at a real ramen joint. The ramen noodles were also good, they were store bought but at least they were not the instant-ramen noodles, but the fresh/frozen ramen noodles. Overall it was just below the quality/taste of ramen you would get at any other joint, but the price and portion makes it so much more worth it than any ramen place I've been too.

I also got the mango pudding for dessert and it was also really good. It was a regular mango pudding you would get at any other Chinese restaurant with mango pieces in it. Honestly, even without the mango pudding or drink, the ramen would still be worth getting by itself."}
{"text":"Great place with a build what you want type menu. It was our first time here and the staff were extremely helpful in helping us navigate the menu. I ordered the Malay Laksa Soup with recipe noodles. My two toppings were shrimp and beef brisket. 

The soup is very big and at 7.95 with a drink or desert included, it's quite a bargain. 

The soup itself comes with mushrooms, coriander, cabbage, green onion, parsley. 

The flavours are delicious and the ingredients are all fresh. 

Great food, great flavours, clean restaurant at a great price!"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp when looking for an AYCE sushi place actually, ha! 
The review are right, you can't go wrong with $8.99 for a meal and a drink! A group of us got big bowls of yummy noodle soup and tea or pop. My husband LOVED the chocolate coffee milkshake, too. The waitress was very helpful when we asked to have individual bills, but she asked that next time we tell them ahead of time if we want to split the bill. They mall has a nice big parking lot. I didn't have an opportunity to check out the washrooms. The restaurant does get busy so if you get there around 6:30pm you're more likely get a seat. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Came in here for a late night special (after 8:30pm there is a discount where a bowl of noodles is 5.99). We tried two soup bases - tomato with pumpkin and the fish with pork pieces. I thought both were excellent. The tomato one has a slightly sour but refreshing undertone while the fish one had a denser flavor. I liked both a lot.

The special price comes with less toppings (expected?), but they give you just as much noodles. I liked how they have cabbage and mushrooms included in every bowl. Noodles were a little bit too mushy for my taste, although I was focusing on the broth. Tried the lemongrass pork and fish filet as well. They were okay, but not sure I'd get them again.

Nice setting and decor given its surrounding mall area, and the servers are pretty nice.

The broths are definitely the highlight."}
{"text":"I've never been to Deer Garden. But I thought this place was pretty good.

They've kept pretty much everything from the old Japanese restaurant that used to be here - that being said it's quite spacious and the decor is nothing crazy, but modern and minimal. Would be good for groups. Before 9, you have to go into the restaurant through the main plaza entrances - I assume that after 9 those are locked and you go in through the front restaurant entrance from the parking lot.

We sat down and took one of the conveniently placed ordering forms that were on each table and from there you customize your meal. Noodle options include - and forgive my Cantonese to English transliteration - thick rice noodles (ho fun), thin rice noodles (lai fun), egg noodles, Korean glass noodles (japchae), vermincelli, instant noodles, and shin ramyun (the Korean instant noodles). There might be more. There are a lot of options.

You can choose from a variety of soups - fish based, or tomato, or a curry soup, or Japanese pork broth. There are definitely more that I can't remember. I'm not going to bother listing the range of vegetables and meats because this is going to be a boring review. You are allowed two toppings that come with your meal, any more are an extra $1.50 I believe.

I ordered the glass noodles in Japanese pork broth, with corn and Japanese cha siu. The noodles already come with napa, some mushrooms, and dried bean curd (fu jook). The noodles were hot and the portion was really big - I ended up taking half home. The Japanese pork was surprisingly the best and most tender I've ever had - it was so soft with pieces of fat hanging off it. It was really good. The soup was rich, smooth, and creamy. My mom felt like there was a lot of MSG in it... might try it again to see because it didn't feel that way.

You also get to choose from either a few drinks or a dessert (ice cream). Wasn't feeling a drink and the ice cream is pretty standard, but the portion they gave me was huge. Probably equal to two regular scoops. They have a variety of flavors. We also got a cold milk tea (cold +$1) which is sealed like bubble tea and it tasted fine as well.

Service was decent. Better than what I would expect from Asian places (close to nothing). Someone even came back and double checked to make sure they read our order form right. Left quite satisfied - good food, price, service, and location. Will likely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy Szechuan soup base, flat rice noodle, sliced beef and fish fillet with hk tea.  The food tasted very delicious at the beginning, however, was not able to finish the rest of the noodles (excess noodles)."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Lucky Noodles replaced what used to be a sushi restaurant at the same location. In fact, the restaurant design still resembles the Japanese feel compared to the Chinese-style feel that's typical of noodle places.

The menu bears a huge similarity to the one in Deer Garden. In fact, the design looks very similar, but they do offer some different toppings and noodles, such as ramyun. Also, prices for non-fish soup based noodles are cheaper than fish soup noodles (but prices in general are cheaper than Deer Garden), and there's a $4.99 special for all noodle orders after 8:30pm on non-stat holidays.

The first time I came I tried the tomato and beef soup base, and I found it quite good. The ramyun is okay, but it's somewhat undercooked for what it is. The second time I tried the pork bone soup base, but I found it to be too salty. It was okay if I didn't drink the broth, but if I did you can really feel the sodium. I had similar comments from my friends who went, and they also mentioned that the broth in general is on the saltier side, but nothing too overwhelming if you don't order the pork broth.

Service is quite good, as you do get a warm welcome and a general sense of communication from the employees.

Overall this place isn't bad, and would actually be very good if they lower the salt content in their broths.

Free wifi!"}
{"text":"As non fancy as this place is,  without any decor or theme,  I love this place.  It has  great  selection for you to build your own noodle in soup.  It has combos with drinks.  And  even  has  beer.  It is a restaurant within the  mall that  used to  house Fortinos.  Great portions and  great  price. Great service.  Place is clean although grassroots.  Enter from the mall side before 9pm everyday, and directly from the parking lot after 9pm.  They have special pricing for  Joshua after  8:30pm. Open late.  Great for later diners."}
{"text":"Another create your noodle type of place that doesn't disappoint.

Pros:
Large seating area
More topping options than other places of this style

Cons:
Drinks are not as good

Lucky noodles is another one of those places where you order a bowl of noodles and decide what goes in.  You choose the broth, type of noodles, toppings and some optional stuff should you want it or not.  My GF tells me this place used to be an all you can eat sushi place.

Being an all you can eat sushi place form before, they have tons of seating here.  If you look at the entrance from the outside of the plaza this place is located, you would never think this place was big at all.  With plentiful seating and fast turnover, you won't ever have to wait too long for a seat here.

Basically, if you've been to Deer Garden, Chef Papa etc. you will know the drill here too.  The one thing I noticed here is that they offer some more toppings that the other places don't offer.  They offer 40 different toppings to choose from.  The other places have about 25. My little one loved that fact that they have corn here.  

I always get the Chao Chou dried fish and minced pork broth when it comes to create your noodle.  The broth here was very good.  It would rank 2nd best behind the Deer Garden at Silverstar.  Overall, it was a very good bowl of noodles.  

My only gripe here is the drinks that can come with your bowl of noodles.  Again, they use the same style as other places.  They will place cold drinks in a bubble tea style to go plastic cup that's sealed.  The problem is they don't use the straws you're supposed to use with this cup.  They used a cheap plastic straw that they cut one end at an angle.  This flimsy straw has no chance to pierce the seal of the drink.  We had to use something else sharper to pierce the seal first. Contamination becomes a factor here.  The drinks themselves weren't as good as other places either which didn't help.

Factoring out the drinks, this place is a very good one to get a bowl of noodles at.  I defeinitly will be back, though I might skip ordering a drink this time unless I bring my own straws, lol."}
{"text":"Noodle place in a plaza on kennedy/Denison.  Huge parking lot. Outside door is not accessible so you have to in through the mall to the door which i find very inconvenient.

Staff was nice but doesn't understand english much. Service is ok. My hubby got annoyed when they provided 1 napkin for 4 of us.

Price is reasonable considering the size of serving and comes with a choice of coffee, hk tea or ice cream.  There lots of variety to choose from soup, meat noodle. I had the chinchou dried fish soup with ramen noodle, toppings- japanese pork and pork mushroom ball. The soup is very tasty and surprised they placed several pieces of the toppings I ordered whicj is  great! Additional side for $2.25 you got a good portion and its worth it.  I had fried fish with tartar sauce. Really good too."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Prices are fair, service is decent and food comes fast. This is a good place for a quick lunch fix! Not to mention their fish broth is rich and flavourful."}
{"text":"Good place for a bowl of fish soup. I have been there 3 times and have not been disappointed. No trace of msg, good thick fish broth. Only thing is, I have never been able to figure out their advertised $5.99 special even though I went during their \"happy hour\" (2:30 - 5 pm). I see one of the other reviews mentioned having to circle the \"special\". Gonna try that next time, hopefully the quality and quantity won't change compared to the $8.99! Overall good quality though, even at $8.99!"}
{"text":"I personally like this place more than Deer Garden (Hwy 7 and Leslie), fish soup tastes slightly fresher and never really a line up. It is my to go restaurant when I'm not sure what I want to eat since you can mix and match the soup bases and ingredients. Theres a special (cheaper price for a smaller bowl) if you go after 8:30pm.
Service isn't great though. It's some effort to get their attention."}
{"text":"The service is quick and the food comes really fast! Portions have a lot of noodles so it's filling. The prices are really cheap as well!"}
{"text":"It's cheap, but it wasn't great. Lucky noodles is essentially the same concept as Deer Garden. Its a choose your on adventure bowl of noodles. You have a choice of soup, noodles, 2 toppings and a drink. 

I had the peanut chili soup, flat rice noodles, beef brisket and bean curd. The peanut chili soup was watered down and definitely not as rich as Deer Garden. The brisket felt a bit old and the bean curd was just bean curd. The deer garden version is extra fried for more texture. Overall, it was a fairly sub-par bowl of noodles. Even their milk tea was a bit watered down and not as smooth. 

Food aside, the place has ample seating and service is decent, but very dark inside. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go for noodle in soup! Their fish broth tastes very fresh and clear. They claim to have no MSG which is always good. 

They have a variety of soup bases, toppings and noodles to choose from. The meal comes with a drink/dessert. I always get their HK milk tea (which is creamy) or mango pudding. They have real mango meat inside the pudding!!!!

All in all, I have nothing to say about this restaurant. 
Service is alright. However they think tipping is mandatory. They were supposed to give me back $2 in change but they said it's for tips. I just let it slide."}
{"text":"Really good noodle place if you want someplace simple. Mind you this place can get busy during lunch time as it is very hard to find places as it gets bombarded with people and sometimes you have to share it with someone. Overall it's a great place to eat and dine. However prices for different flavour of soups is sometimes of a turnoff. It is a knockoff of their competitor though."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Denison St and Kennedy Rd at Denison Centre. Note: the front entrance was closed, so this place was only accessible through the mall entrance until the mall closes at 9PM.  

[SERVICE] - 2/5
Self-serve, we selected our order on the order sheet and handed it to the server. When we requested our bill, we asked if they took card and the server said yes. Turns out, they don't take credit card, only debit. We paid with debit but I just didn't like the miscommunication even though we asked them in Chinese (because all the servers spoke Chinese). 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
I liked how there were a lot of comfortable and spacious booths. The restaurant was also quite roomy, and had seats for a lot of people. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
I enjoyed how they did not use MSG in a couple of their soup bases, which highlighted natural flavours of the broth. The veggie toppings also tasted fresh and wholesome. 

[ORDER] - 3/5
- Noodle Combo - $8.99: Tomato & Pumpkin Fish Soup Base with Century Egg, Dumplings, Ramen Noodles, and Mango Pudding Dessert: The fish soup base was slightly bland but I enjoyed the natural fish flavours in this broth. Noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente. Dumplings were too soft, so I would probably pass on that next time.

[OVERALL] - 3/5
$8.99 for a bowl of noodle was pretty good, but this used to be my go-to spot for a cheap bowl of noodles when the price for noodle combos started at $7.95 (4 stars for value). Now, I only think this is an average 3-star spot for Fish and Noodle Soup at that price."}
{"text":"Tldr: Soup-noodle restaurant, good portions at affordable price, ok service, would recommend

Lucky noodle has been a great place to satisfy my noodle-soup needs. The beauty of this place  is the option to build-your-own noodle-soup combo (8.99). This includes 2 toppings with your desired soup base and a drink (typical HK cafe beverages. Costs extra fora cold drink, but a cold pop is no extra charge!), though you can substitute it with a dessert. They offer a wide range of soup bases, noodle types, toppings, as well as the option to get extra sides (+$2.25). 

I'm not a big fan of the fish broth based soups, so i usually get the chicken broth, Japanese style Thick pork soup, or Malay Laksa soup base. For noodles i prefer the thick rice noodles or the Korean glass noodles, with  the Japanese BBQ pork and red sausage as toppings. The sliced beef brisket is always a good option as well. If i'm feeling really hungry i'll get a side order of the fried fish fillet (never a disappointment), or an extra topping (+$1.75).

The service is not bad, but it's not  the greatest either. The waiters mainly speak Cantonese and mandarin, but what's neat is you just fill out your order on a paper so you don't really need to talk to them if you don't need to. The portions are usually generous and it's relatively cheap for a quick lunch or dinner. They do offer rice combos, though i've never tried them as i always get the BYO noodle-soup combo. I am aware that Deer Garden has been serving noodles like this way before Lucky noodle opened up, but i actually prefer this place as it's cheaper, and they have more variety of soup bases/noodle choices/toppings. They also have free wifi haha. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"pretty good bang for your buck. $6 during happy hour, can't remember when it starts but it ends at 5pm. grand opening special.

you get a choice of a soup base, noodle type, 2 \"toppings\", and a free hot drink.
for a cold drink, it's an extra dollar and for a milk shake you add $2.
mango pudding is $1.75. it's like 2-3 spoonfuls. kinda small

for the $6 though, i left pretty full.

my order was japanese style thick pork soup, instant noodles, sliced lamb, dumpling, avocado milk shake and mango pudding.

the soup wasn't too bad, but i couldn't drink it all and usually i like to finish my soup after eating my noodles. just a tad salty.
instant noodles was instant noodles, always delicious. lol
sliced lamb. i think i only got 3 slices, but my friend got 4. otherwise the lamb was good.
the dumplings, were almost more like a meatball than a dumpling. only got 2 of those. would've preferred something more like boiled dumplings or fan friend dumplings.
i really like avocado shakes and make a pretty good one myself, so i'll be a bit picky with this one. i'm not sure what they used, whether it was like a milk or cream, or even vanilla ice cream maybe, but either way, it was a bit too creamy. the colour of the shake leaned more towards the white colour than a green avocado colour. this reflected in the flavour as well since the avocado was not the dominant flavour but the secondary flavour. so i tihnk that could be better.
the mango pudding is not your typical chinese styled mango pudding either. it's actually like pudding, not gelatinous like what you would typically expect from a mango \"pudding\". the flavour is pretty good, and has that real fruit taste too it, but the serving size is slightly small. i'd say increase the portion size to 50-100% more.

all in all though. pretty good. will come back to try some other combinations and flavours."}
{"text":"Lucky Noodles ???? is almost like a copycat of Deer Garden. 

Identical concept with Fish Soup based with different options for combo. Even the pricing is the same?!

There are though a few additional option for soup base and even Shin Ramyun.

Since Lucky Noodle is modeling themselves after Deer Garden, it is fair to compare it to the original.

Fish Soup not as milky and down right watery. Toppings a lot less and the fatty beef slice on my Spicy Noodle Soup ($6.98) was not fresh. 

So the verdict is just go Deer Garden and no point coming here. And Lucky Noodle will need all the luck to stay in business if they don't improve on their food at least close to the Original.

Btw, even the waitstaff wears the same uniform black with white strips."}
{"text":"A failed version of Deer Garden. No originality, the exact same menu format and content with a few additional items. The soup base had little flavour and the topping quality mediocre. i feel like someone just gave up halfway. Just pay the extra two dollars and go to Deer Garden."}
{"text":"Better than 'Deer Garden.' More selection and better price. The Japanese pork broth is very very tasty. The combo price is very reasonable. I had a good time. Has potential to be 4 stars. Wish I could give 3.5 stars but can't."}
{"text":"Replica of Deer Garden, just a little cheaper and a little more toppings. 

I came here with my parents today. We each ordered our own entree and some side dishes. The waitress was fairly nice and got our order in quickly. The portions are much like Deer Garden, I can never finish the bowl, thankfully, my dad helped me ;). They have also renovated since the last restaurant. I have noticed that the owner of Akina (which was the last restaurant there) changed their restaurant to what is now, lucky noodles. So, same owners. 

Our side dishes were pretty good. We ordered the pan fried chicken with teriyaki, lemon grass pork chop, and short ribs. 
Our entrees were, like I said about the same size as Deer Garden, but with a decent amount of toppings. 
 
Just one tip, remember to check your bowl for your toppings before munching. My mom asked for both the sliced beef and beef tendons; she was only given the sliced beef. While she has already eaten half the bowl without noticing, we never asked the restaurant to provide it as it may cause confusion. 

I will find myself coming again as it is relatively close to my home. But, it will certainly bring back memories of the good ole Akina :("}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 star if the service was better, food took a while to get to me but it was worth the wait. I got the Szechuan soup with korean style noodles with sliced beef and pork blood. It was amazing for around $10 for lunch! Just the right amount of spiciness and the beef was soft and easy to eat. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love their concept of picking your own noodle and toppings. They had a opening special for after 8:30pm special was 5.99. Good size noodles and meat, comes with a hot drink, cold drink or special drink extra charge. Sides are $1 or $2 depending on the option you choose. :) Good place came here many things. Their green tea expression drink was amazing!"}
