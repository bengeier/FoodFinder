{"text":"Best teriyaki place I've been to here in Vegas.  Foods always good and you can't beat the price for the portions they serve.  I'd recommends the chicken fried rice!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food!! And right across the street from my house. You can't beat that. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Ive lived in this area since july and only last week tried this place for the first time. wish i would have went sooner. love the food and love love LOVE the customer service. Ive been there three times now.
the wonton soup has great flavor. the generals chicken is delicious ( my favorite dish so far)! spicy  or not. 
they also have really good beef & broccoli, Mongolian beef and beef & chicken.
Melody and her family are great.
the only negative I have to say is that if you dine in its oddly quiet and could use some music. but no big deal.

well priced, great customer service, good food.
no pork dishes here.no big deal to me cuz i dont like pork,
just thought id let everyone know."}
{"text":"I accidently ended up at this place on a Sunday afternoon when everything else seemed to be closed still. I was the only one in the restaurant and ordered take out. It didn't take too long until my order was ready. 

Wanton Soup was pretty good. It had fresh vegetables and the wantons tasted fresh too. Glad it was take out though, cause I added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper and it was then even better. 

The Kung Pao was pretty simple and tasty too. Nothing to complain about. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"I went this place four times. It is so good! Specially my wife really loves house fried rice so much. I believe that everyone would like this fried rice and this place."}
{"text":"Will definitely eat here again.. small menu but very good.  I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and subbed chicken breast for whatever type of chicken they give you (I'm assuming dark meat) and I got a HUGE bowl with at least 1 whole chicken breast, veggies and steamed rice. My husband got the chicken breast with yakisoba. Huge portion as well. Our bill was $19 with 2 drinks. Definitely worth the $20 for the amount of good food we got. We'll be back for sure! And it's right down from where we live. Good wonton soup also although it looks like they just use gyoza dumplings for it."}
