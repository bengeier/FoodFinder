{"text":"I love this bar! Owners are friendly, staff is awesome and efficient! Come check it out"}
{"text":"Always interesting when the bar has 4 customers and the friend if the owner tells people to leave,  clearly been drinking and rude.   O well let's just see if this bar changes owners yet again in 6 months"}
{"text":"Excellent new bar off of the strip if you're looking to get away from the club scene. We had an excellent time and the bartender was beyond nice! I'll recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love the Locker Room. They have great food, great service, and cheap drinks. The entertainers are always fun to hang out with, and the atmosphere is very chill and drama free. Definitely a place to go and let loose and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Ummm... I have no words.  Don't bother to go to this place.  Gray walls, black floor and ceiling... no character.   If you have a name like Locker Room, work the theme."}
{"text":"New owners, new attitude!!  This is not the bar of two weeks ago. The owners are very nice and friendly.  GREAT DRINKS and the pizza is quite DEELISH!!  Great comedians on Saturday comedy nights!!  My favorite during the week are the 80's videos on the screens.  This is my new \"home\" bar."}
{"text":"This used to be a Zombie Themed bar. They must've changed the name to Locker Room. The plan of the night was to go to Freezone for an hour and then test the \"new\" Locker Room to finish up for the night. The parking lot was packed over at Freezone so we decided to leave our cars in the Locker Room parking room.   When we came back one of our cars got towed. The owner of the Locker Room apparently called the towing company to remove cars in the lot. There were plenty of empty spaces to go around but apparently he doesn't want anyone using them unless they have business strictly for himself. Envy is a hideous color.  So that completely squashed our curiosity to ever try out the new bar. Establishments are a direct impression of the managing party. Sir, if this is how you behave over parking spaces for your future customers then your business will not last."}
{"text":"Great drink prices and the staff is amazing. Super chill environment with fun entertainment. If you like a chill place to hang out at then this is the spot to be!"}
{"text":"This bar has changed owners and from a zombie/music bar to some kind of gay bar.. can't understand why my post was carried over?"}
{"text":"Personal pizza is awesome size and the Shaun Collins is my new favorite drink.  David came out and greeted us personally and was amazing to chat with.  Zombie fingers are yummy, parking is easy and, and, and.... Clean, smiles, well priced and I will be back..... NO QUESTION!"}
{"text":"This bar has a wonderful atmosphere with great bartenders and awesome food. The owners Mark and Joe are very friendly and ensure that each patron has a great time while there.   Was here with the man I'm dating and one of my favorite friends here in Vegas, and as always, a great time! Love you so much!"}
