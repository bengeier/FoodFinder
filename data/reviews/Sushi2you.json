{"text":"This is a hidden gem for all Sushi lovers. A gourmet restaurant quality sushi for a fraction of the price you pay at high end restaurants. Cheaper and way tastier then Edo Japan. I come here for lunch all the time as a student an on a budget. I highly recommend asking for the mango roll or house special roll and you will be surprise for the price you pay, it tastes like restaurant sushi."}
