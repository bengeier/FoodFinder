{"text":"Very good food.  I ordered the hibachi chicken with broccoli and steamed rice.  Actually ate there since I live on the other side of town.  Service was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the chicken nuggets which were superrrrr warm and good. It's a family service, its very quick. Mom makes the rice, dad foes the good stuff behind the cashier, and daughter does the orders! I was super amuzed sbecause I went to one of these, it was similar. Not the same thing. And I hated it! But this, was awesome. Enjoyed it. Keep it up, Tokyo one."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick, and so good! I never have to worry about calling it in because it's ready quickly. Very good, everyone's friendly and always get my order right. Never a problem and I've been coming here a year."}
{"text":"My sister first discover this place because she loves Japanese food. When I use to work in the Ballantyne area we would go here at least once or even twice a week for lunch.   The prices are very reasonable and you get your money's worth of food. The lady that owns the restaurant is also extremely friendly and service is always fast.   Definately worth a try if you love Japanese food and sweet carrots!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Definitely my go to when I do not want to cook!  Love the Hibachi shrimp.  The owners are also extremely nice and always remember me!"}
{"text":"Feel comfortable in here! My husband and I absolutely love this place.  The salmon is what we normally get and it is always cooked exactly like we want it..it is truly perfect every time. The sides are yummy, with the grilled zucchini being a favorite! The staff are wonderful and it's always a pleasure to eat here. I also have to mention that we get carry out from them as well and it's always top notch. I highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The Hibachi chicken and shrimp are delicious. I have eaten here twice and gotten the low carb version both times. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The prices are very reasonable and the food comes out fast and is hot.  The hibachi chicken and the shrimp tastes as good or better than the more expensive Japanese restaurants without the high price and long wait while they cook it in front of you.  If you want Japanese food that is delicious, quick, and inexpensive, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've never had bland habachi before. I got the teriyaki chicken and broccoli and everything tasted SO bland. Normally with habachi places the food stands on its own and the shrimp sauce is a bonus, but I had to drown this in shrimp sauce to even make it taste like something. Really disappointing since it's so close to me"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place ! Great tasting affordable hibachi , great vegetarian options! Super friendly staff"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed the food and pleasant service. The food was fresh, tasted great, and the family is incredibly nice. We will definitely be coming back again. I had the imperial to get a taste of the chicken, steak, and shrimp, and it was delicious. Love the rice, the sweet carrots, and the prices are awesome! No complaints, only compliments. :) Keep it up Tokyo Express!"}
{"text":"OMG, if you want the best Japanese food ever event this is the place for you. The staff is super nice and helpful. The sanitation grade is always good. It's in a very convenient location. When we get takeout the service is always prompt with no delays."}
{"text":"Love this little place. The owners are super nice. Most importantly the food is really good and they cook it within minutes. I love the hibachi steak and chicken. The shrimp sauce is amazing. The carrots are very sweet. Great value! Me and my husband normally split the steak and chicken combination and it is plenty food for $11"}
{"text":"Pretty good hibachi and great staff! Even the gentleman who cooks in the back always waves and smiles when i come in.  Always get takeout here.:-)"}
{"text":"Hidden jewel!!! I've been coming here for years and I have never been disappointed. They have great food with large portions. They are always happy to see you and their prices are VERY reasonable! Must try!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is surprisingly good. Quick, polite service. Large portions. Very reasonably priced. Lo-carb options on the menu. Shrimp were plump and delicious; perfectly prepared. And it's close to my office so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazingly, I lived in the area 15 years before trying this inconspicuous little restaurant at the corner of Camfield Corners and found it to be everything that my fellow Yelpers say it is - simply good Japanese food at really good prices served by appreciative, on-site owners.  I can't recommend much from the menu however as I always order the Hibachi Chicken served with broccoli, fried rice and sliced carrots (yes, carrots, which are in fact addictive!) Speaking  of addictive, all entrees are served with their own house-made shrimp sauce. The servings are enormous and consistently prepared. The dining area is very plain but that's okay as the focus here is the food. Hungry and need a quick meal? Thus place is a \"gotta try\"!."}
{"text":"A normal stop during the work week. They have quick service and the food is always the same great, affordable hibachi food. They are friendly and understand that most people are on their lunch break, so they are prepared to serve everyone quickly. After many visits, I might need to try a few new menu items."}
{"text":"Located near the Morrison Y in the Ballantyne area, this place has amazing take out!  Fast service...fresh food...and plenty of it!  We ordered the teriyaki chicken with broccoli, hibachi steak with mushrooms, an order of zucchini and onions, and a couple of salad bowls.  The entrees came with fried rice and carrots...and the carrots are so good they could be dessert.  I can tell it might be a problem living so close to this place.  The food is craveable..."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years with my dad! They offer brown rice which is rare in the fast-food hibachi world in this area! My favorite is the hibachi steak with brown rice and mushrooms. SO GOOD and tons of food!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and attentive service from Annie. What more can you ask for? Definitely my go to for super affordable hibachi!!!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy Hibachi and teriyaki place. Decent quality food and comparable prices. Obviously not \"cook in front\" quality food but is good for a hibachi fix if your looking for one"}
{"text":"Did take out for lunch from here and it's what I was hoping for: cheap, quick japanese! Carrots were a little too watery, but the hibachi chicken and mushrooms were right on point, my white rice was cooked perfectly and the shrimp sauce was YUM! huge portion (take out contanier filled to the brim!), all for $6.95+tax.  Totally worth the stop if you're in Ballantyne and looking for a great meal on a budget!"}
{"text":"Fast, good food, polite and friendly staff.  Good value."}
{"text":"I've had hibachi take out from here several times and its not bad but I've had better!  Lunch chicken hibachi entree is probably in the $7 range.  I'm not really big on the carrot side that you get either, just not a huge fan of carrots I guess.  As long as Tokyo Japanese is in business down the road I will not be going to Tokyo One for their lunch hibachi take out.  Tokyo's chicken hibachi lunch special comes with soup, salad, awesome chicken hibachi, and two big scoops of rice for $4.95 which is unbeatable.  It's good quality food to boot!"}
{"text":"I saw the 4.5 Star rating and tried it for carry out. It was very disappointing. Egg drop soup OK, but with wontons in it that did not taste remotely fresh at all. Noodles were spaghetti with Asian sauce. Vegetables like broccoli and carrots in the hibachi were not fresh or crisp, tasted like frozen for a long time.   Fried rice was quite dry. Salmon mediocre. Maybe it was an off night, but nothing in the seasonings gave me the impression that a good night would make it a 4 rating. Owners seemed nice.  It was cheap for Charlotte Asian food."}
{"text":"Such good fast food hibachi style food! Got the hibachi chicken with broccoli and it was SO good!! Came with delicious carrots and crispy broccoli and a side of yum yum sauce. Yowzers it was good!!!  Will come back to try their chicken teriyaki and steak hibachi."}
{"text":"Went here the day after Thanksgiving in Charlotte after turkey overload and lots of Black Friday shopping. My sister in law and I were ravenous and wanting take out to go relax and kick our feet up.  We ordered steak and veggies. Shrimp and seaweed salad. As well as a side of fried dumplings. All of the food was delicious, drizzled with white sauce made it even better. About thirty dollars ended up feeding four of us, with leftovers still. Great deal, friendly service, and very convenient location to the Ballantyne area. Kabutos or Nakatos quality without the show or price.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wish their have more dishes on the menu ... The food is ok I have some noodles  the noodle look like italian pasta wrong noodles for a Japanese restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food and even better customer service. This place really stands above the competition."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tokyo One Express since it opened many years ago.  Consistency in value and good service has stayed the same for all these years.   I have been trying different menu items over the past two years and have found everything to be very good.   I tend to revert back to my usual hibachi steak with double mixed vegetables.  The place is very clean, with fresh food, and \"service with a smile\" are the three main ingredients that make this restaurant a once a week staple for me!"}
{"text":"Went here with my Dad for dinner and decided to eat there. The food was good, the environment was really clean and the staff was friendly. My only complaint is for patrons dining in they should invest in reusable utensils, plates, and cups. Or maybe more eco-friendly since the majority of their business is probably take out anyways. It just seems like such a waste and it would be cheaper in the long run to invest in reusable for dine in patrons."}
{"text":"A week ago I was complaining to my in-laws that I haven't found a cheap hibachi styled Japanses restaurant in the Ballantyne area.  They asked around and discovered that there was one tucked away in a sleepy shopping center.  The prices are very reasonable.  The food is delicious.  My father in law kept pausing his eating to say \"this is so good\" 8 times (I counted). Lots of people came in to pick up to go orders while we were eating.   The biggest critique of this place would be that the food was served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. A real plate with real silverware is something I expect at any restaurant that I am sitting down to eat. In the future I will probably bypass eating at the restaurant and just pick up a to-go order instead."}
{"text":"This is my go to Japanese take out place!! Huge fan of their chicken teriyaki dish! Served with fried rice, broccoli and sweet, sliced carrots + SHRIMP SAUCE! Basically, you can put shrimp sauce on just about anything and it will taste good! Locally owned, you are greeted by the owners every time you go there and they are super friendly too. Yes...I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and reasonably priced. I get the mixed vegetables with rice entree for $6.50. I wish they offered delivery."}
{"text":"Went back to this little hole in the wall nestled in a strip mall. My first visit was not the best as the staff forgot 2 of our orders and put the food in the to go bag upside down so that they leaked. But even then, the food was good.   This time, no mistakes. Got a big order for my large family. I watched them triple check everything and bag it all up. The food - a huge order - was ready incredibly quickly even though I ordered there. Friendly as ever and even gave me a complimentary drink for waiting.   The food was just as expected - very good. This is not a fancy restaurant with high-grade meals. But that is not what I wanted or expected. It was exactly what we wanted and couldn't have been better. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting some quick, easy Americanized Japanese steakhouse food for a reasonable price - especially in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a \"fast food\" Japanese joint -  no more, no less. Got a hankerin' for hibachi? Hits the spot! Generous portions for reasonable prices. Staff is extremely friendly. Def one of my staple comfort food spots!"}
{"text":"Excellent for quickly prepared takeout. The hibachi steak and shrimp is my go to entree.  Good quality ingredients and of course the shrimp sauce is like liquid crack.  Very courteous and prompt service. Good daily specials and decent variety on the menu."}
{"text":"I came to this place as I waited for my oil change to be completed nearby. Everyone there working was very friendly. When I walked in it was a bit warm but they explained the air was broke. The entire time I was there they worked to get it fixed. I didn't mind it being a little warm since they were so upfront and friendly. The food was really good. Large portions and they use nice plump shrimp. The Zuchinni and onions weren't over cooked. Still had a slight crisp in them how I like it. The tea was nice and sweet. I would return to this location."}
