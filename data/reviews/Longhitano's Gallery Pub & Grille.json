{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on a Tuesday night for a quick meal before heading out to a basketball game. I was surprised by the size of the crowd since it was a Tuesday night. My wife ordered the cranberry salad and I had the eggplant parmigiana. There were large chunks of grilled chicken on my wife's salad and she thought it tasted good. She brought half of the salad home for lunch. The eggplant itself was very good. It was obviously made in the restaurant. Unfortunately the marinara sauce was too much and too overpowering.  We will come back again with the kids but I'll steer away from the pasta."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here this evening,  this is the first time at this location,  we had the fried pickles which were good she had the eggplant parmesan with noodles I had the mama spaghetti and meatballs the sauce was mild on both of them the service was very nice the food arrived quickly hopefully in the future they will improve on their sauce"}
{"text":"The food is okay. The service is unprofessional and slow. Overall, not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has been given bad reviews.  My wife and I ate dinner there recently and had a great experience.  I would recommend you try it.  The baked spaghetti and meatballs is amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have dinner and drinks here quite often.  The staff is wonderful and the owner Mike is professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Wasn't sure what to expect because of previous restaurants in this space. But staff was friendly, place was clean and food was good. We had: lobster ravioli, chicken breast dinner and the beer batter fish dinner. Chicken was tender and moist. The salads that came with a couple of the dinners were a good size side salad and had tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese -- nice size salad. The beer batter fish was amazing---I didn't order it but I ate half of my Dad's dinner because it was so good. Probably the best I've ever had. The French fries were also awesome! Fresh cut fries - a good rival to the fair!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great. It's wonderful to see the owner there taking care of his place and being engaged with the customers. He always asks how the food is. I have been to this place twice and I was really happy with how fresh everything was. The food doesn't taste like it comes out of a can. Recently,I had a amazing tomato soup and a turkey reuben, which was very tasty was not greasy. The first time I was there I had a nicely prepared fish dinner that was worth every penny. I hope they keep up the good work, and always have good service, which is something every place around here could improve on."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat. Best pasta sauce I've had and the white French salad dressing is addictive"}
{"text":"I have eaten here since the place opened.  They have been nothing but kind and courteous.  My wife orders the Meatballs and spaghetti every time.  I have to admit it is awesome.  The meatballs are addicting and the sauce is awesome.  I have tried many things on the menu.  The sandwiches are on amazing bread and come with homemade chips that kick any french fry to the curb in shame.  I just had the Hajah steak today and my tongue was dancing with delight.

I was once sitting at the bar when eating alone having an awesome Italian sub and the gentleman next to me told his wife.  \"If I were on death row and ordered my last meal this would be it.  I have to admit the baked pasta rocks.  But as a cheese lover the sauce and meatballs hold their own without the cheese.

Their choice of wines works so well with the food.  I like the Chianti with my pasta.  

If you have not tried the spaghetti and meatballs you are missing and experience.  Frankly, I don't know why this place isn't busting at the seams with people.  You owe it to yourself"}
{"text":"This place has some really good food. We randomly stopped in for a bite going through this town. The service was wonderful. They have authentic Italian food. I got the baked pasta and meat balls and a side of fries. They make fair fires which were amazing. My mom got the chicken salad sandwichThat was wrapped in a tortilla. She said it was excellent not too much on you and not too much mail it was the perfect amount of ingredients. Very generous portions as well."}
{"text":"Stopped here on Easter Sunday while visiting my niece at Kent State. Not just a regular 'pub & grille' like most 'bars' Their food and atmosphere was amazing.  Waitress was super nice and attentive. Manager/Owner checked on us twice. Everything was very affordable (fed my daughter and myself for $20 and was FULL).  The potato soup, garlic bread and fettucine alfredo was amazing. Definitely recommend for family dinner or a casual night out with friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant is actually good, which surprised me because this location previously housed a string of lousy restaurants. I had a salad on spring greens with candied nuts, cranberries, chicken and more, with the house dressing and it was delicious. It came with warm pita slices that were better than the garlic bread. . I also tried the sausage stuffed Italian pepper appetizer, which would have been enough by itself. Tasty! I had to take half the food home.Next time, I'll get a small salad and call the peppers an entree.  My husband raved about the chicken livers and he also had to take home half his antipasto salad because it was all too much food.  The service was good, the restaurant and restrooms were clean, and the owner was very friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A place where a waitress yells and curses at my 11 year old daughter in front of my 75 year old parents is not a place a family would want to frequent. I'm so sad that this experience ruined my niece's graduation dinner. Will never return! Disgusted by our entire experience!"}
{"text":"The Longhitano's Gallery Pub & Grille, formerly located near the State Road Plaza in Cuyahoga Falls, recently opened in Kent on the corner of Spaulding and W. Main (St. Rt. 59), in the old building of Firehouse Pub, Country Kitchen, and probably a dozen other failed restaurants. Based on my experience with an early dinner today, it will not be in business long. 

According to an October 9 article in the Record Courier, \"We're starting off with a small menu just to get out of the gate,\" Longhitano said, adding that current menu items also include burgers, salads and \"great Italian food.\"  Indeed, a laminated single-page menu was on each table, with maybe 20 menu items including appetizers, sandwiches, salads, soups, and entrees. There were no pictures of their food.

When I arrived at 3:30 pm, there was only one table occupied by two older gentlemen. The waitress who sort of greeted me told me to have a seat anywhere. When she approached my table, I had my back to her and she started talking to me before she ever arrived at my table. I had to ask her if she was talking to me. When she returned to my table to take my order, again, she started talking before she even got to my table. Her enthusiasm was underwhelming.

When she asked to take my order, she didn't volunteer any information. I asked her to describe the lobster ravioli, and she held up her fingers to show the size of the ravioli and said it had lobster meat in it (well duh) and their alfredo sauce. I asked her if they made it themselves, and she said no. I asked her if it came with anything, and she said a side salad. I decided to try it, and I think it was the most expensive entree at $15.

When the salad arrived, it was just unwashed (I think) romaine lettuce with one cucumber slice, one tomato wedge with a big yellow stem portion in it, and some cheddar cheese on top. The unremarkable dressing was on the side in a plastic condiment cup. 

A gentleman brought the ravioli to my table. I'm guessing he may have been the owner, and he looked a little dirty and unkempt.  I tried the first ravioli, and it was barely warm. I tried the second, and it also was barely warm, so I set the plate aside to wait for my waitress to return. I eventually gave up on that and asked a second waitress to get her. Before she asked me what was wrong, she said \"cold\"? That tells you something, doesn't it? They microwaved the plate, and the first bite was hot, but that was it. I didn't finish the meal.

The waitress charged me $8.99 for the appetizer version and did not charge me at all for the Pepsi. 

I have no plans to return. The attitude of the waitress was apathy, and if the staff doesn't care, why should I?"}
{"text":"Not sure where all the recent positive reviews are from but after my first experience, I'm not buying it!

Longhitano's in Kent resides in a cursed building (formerly known as Country Diner, Luna's, Diner 59, and Blue Fig in the last several years) and, although I was hoping the recent addition would make it, their food quality leaves me with little hope for their longevity.  

To be fair I've only been there once.  That being said, this joint touts its Italian courses and the marinara sauce on my chicken parm was the most bland I believe I've ever had at a restaurant - think tomato sauce from a can.  The breaded chicken  itself was ok but hardly noteworthy.  If I had to guess, I'd bet the majority of their menu offerings come to your plate directly off a truck.  The side salad, as others have commented, was also fairly pathetic.

I am giving two stars since my meal wasn't altogether horrible, just  what I feel is pretty poor quality for a \"restaurant\" I don't really ever care to go to again."}
{"text":"Nope! Took the kids here, always looking for family alternatives to fast food....HUGE MISTAKE!! We all got food poisoning. Understandable if we all got similar items, but was far from the case. I got a sandwich and a side salad, husband got a burger and fries, daughter got lasagna, son got baked pasta. Tasted fine, service was friendly, food made us sick. Never going back. Feel free to stop by if you're looking to purge those last few pounds."}
{"text":"Longhitanos Bar and Grille is located between Kent and Stow. I've driven by several times and finally decided to try it. Inside is clean and it was really cool to be asked where I wanted to sit. The booths all have private tvs and I was able to watch VH1 classic while I ate my food (that was really cool).

The menu is appropriate for the restaurant size and includes: typical bar fare apps, salads, sandwiches/burgers, and Italian food (which is their specialty). They also have specials that sell out quickly, but the chef replaced some that sold out for other specials they could make. I ordered chicken cacciatore and my wife had the Italian sub.

The salad was good that came with my meal and I loved the ranch dressing. The chicken cacciatore though was disappointing, especially for a restaurant that takes pride in their Italian fare. Presentation was okay but the dish was swimming in a liquid tomato sauce, the chicken was fine, green pepper/mushrooms were fine. Had the sauce been thicker my opinion would have been vastly different.  The highlight was the garlic bread, so buttery and good! The Italian sub was a bit greasy but good and the chips were great with it. Overall, we had an okay experience but would not order what we had again."}
{"text":"This place is my local watering hole.  I know the menu like the back of my hand.  If you want terrific service, great food, and great atmosphere, then you need to come here.  

Mike (Hodge, Philly Dog, Longe) is a great owner.  Super friendly and always willing to accommodate his guests.  

Wings - Outstanding (especially Hot Garlic Parm), (Tuesday wing night)
Burgers - Outstanding 
Pastas - Outstanding (and GREAT portions)
Apps - Outstanding (Wednesday is half-priced apps)
Biggest Haja Steak Sandwich - Outstanding
The Tammy - You wont be disappointed 
Beer selection - Not the best in the area, but plenty on draft and plenty of bottles 

Hodgey-Hodgeyo!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time going to Longhitano's. I drive past there every on my way to school and decided to stop in to take part of their Tuesday $.40 wing special.

Right off the bat, this is very much a bar and grill kind of place. Don't expect any kind of fine dining here, just good pub (and of course Italian) food and lots of alcohol. 

The prices were really good with burgers and sandwiches around $6 and pasta at $10. The service was acceptable. We did wait a while to get our menus but the waitress was very nice and kept up with drink refills and extra condiment request.  The food was also quick to arrive. It took less than 5 minutes for our appetizer,amazing fried mac-n-cheese bites, to arrive. 

As far as the quality of the food, it was pretty tasty. I assume they order in a large portion of their items, so keeping that in mind, I was quite pleased with my meal. I had (as I already mentioned) the wings, which were delicious, spicy, and very large! along with a basket of fries that were not as crispy as I would like, but still pretty good. My boyfriend had the meatball sub which he quickly devoured, and some fantastic thick-cut homemade chips. All for under $20.

I'll probably be visiting Longhitano's again, especially since it is the closest Italian restaurant. I look forward to seeing their new larger menu which will be coming out soon, but I think I will forgo to fries and stay with chips next time."}
{"text":"Food is great!   Very friendly,  very clean,  wings are huge and really cheap on Tuesday!   Hamburgers are about the best in the area.   Just a great place to grab a beer and get some awesome food.   And Mike the owner is a great guy.  Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pasta and meatballs!! Everyone is very friendly!!! The food is always consistent. I am Italian and by far the best Italian food around. My husband loves the Friday fish fry meal! It's available every day not just Friday! I have also
tried the veal and chicken parmigiana!! Amazing! We try to visit once a week but definitely at least a few times a month!!! Mike, the owner, is very personable and says hi to everyone. All of the staff are very friendly!! We have never had a bad experience!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
