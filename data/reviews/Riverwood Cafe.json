{"text":"Rude server. Tried to take my REAL id. Just turned 21 and is the only place I've had this type of experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"$1 Coors Light Bottles during Brown's and Indians games (not sure ab Cavs?) ... a deal like this keeps me coming back! Most recently was here for the Indian's home opener, which fell on a Monday this year. 40 cent wings, and 2 for 1 burgers were the Monday specials... burgers were surprisingly delicious!  I'd definitely come back for a burger again, even at menu price! Bar service way just ok... girls behind the bar could have been more attentive... it was busy, but not slammed. Bottom line, the $1 bottles are a great deal that keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food but the music is extremely loud. now this is coming from someone with hearing damage who is constantly told to turn the music down. Not like rock club loud but blasting elton john at noon on a wednesday.  its so loud i had an earache last two times i went. Also the service isnt great either , but like i said the wings are perfect, best ive hady.Plz for the love of god turn the jukebox down. My bad review is due to the obvious lack of courtesy,  Eat and gtfo"}
{"text":"Riverwood has the best wings and beer specials in Lakewood.  I've never been disappointing with the food, it's excellent.   The service can be a little a little slow on busy nights, but the servers are extremely nice and on top of their sh**."}
{"text":"Best happy hour and wings on the west side of Lakewood. Their deals during Indians, Browns and Cavs games are on point!!"}
{"text":"The service is slower than Christopher Reeve running the 40 yd dash even on a slow night. The bartender only payed attention to me because I'm cripplingly handsome. I can't imagine how it would be waiting to be served as an average person in this bar. The bartender slowly chews gum as she drags her feet, wishing she were at a Courtney Love look alike contest for brunettes instead of work. She poured strong drinks, but I only assume it was to get me drunk so that she could take advantage of my impeccable physique. At one point, our party of 4 had completely empty drinks and she only offered to refill mine, despite the fact the bar was nearly empty. I know I'm a stud, but if you wanna be my lover, you gotta refill my friends'. The only reason I'm giving it 1 star is because she wasn't that hot and Larry don't go slummin'"}
{"text":"My guy and I love this place! Great food, cheap craft beers during happy hour, and super awesome staff. There's always great specials and we've never had a bad experience. Melissa is the absolute BEST!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday to have a drink with a friend.  I ordered Fireball with ginger ale and my friend TRIED to order a glass of wine.  She was told they are out of wine!  What?  Out of wine, come on!!!  She then ordered coffee with Bailey's. She took one sip of it and returned it to the gal that served it to her.  My friend told her that it was very bitter and the server said \"yeah, the coffee is pretty bad here\".  I was cashing out with what should have been only my one drink.  She said the tab was $8.50.  I reminded her that the coffee drink was returned because it was bad!  She said I still have to charge you.  After protesting she said $5.50.  I don't know if she was charging for my drink and for my friend taking a sip of hers, but regardless, the server was not someone I care to ever have wait on me again.  Horrible!!!  We left and walked over to the West End where my Fireball and ginger ale was only $1.85."}
{"text":"My favorite Lakewood bar. Great food, amazing bartenders, and of course, best happy hour for beer. Always my go to spot."}
{"text":"I realize this is one little bar of many in Lakewood, but it's got an amazing taco night on Wednesdays!  $1 tacos and they are GOOD - large and not to greasy.  Two or three should fill you up.  They also have one of the best Happy Hours I've found yet!  4-9 p.m. and all draft beers are $2.  That means all, including foreign and dark beers!!  The only reason I gave this three stars instead of four is the that service can get a little slow.  It gets busy on Wednesdays, and I know the bartenders and servers do their best to stay on top of things and provide speedy service, but sometimes your table can seem like a dead zone."}
{"text":"I have stopped in here several times after work. They have a good happy hour. The food is good - especially the wings."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite spot but when it comes to sports on TV skip it and go elsewhere. The jukebox is always on and it's a fight to get the voice turned on the TV. Very disappointed and won't be back for Sunday football. Booths or Plank Road are the best for sports."}
{"text":"I go here for Taco night with my boyfriend, and we love it. I have never had a bad taco there. It is so delicious (love the homemade shells), and two is just the right amount of food for me. The cheap beers that night doesn't hurt either. Some nights, it is packed there and you have to fight for a seat, but that hasn't happened too often for us. Highly recommend it if you are in Lakewood."}
{"text":"My sister suggested that we come here for happy hour because she saw that the drinks were cheap and boy are they ever! $2 any draft! On Wednesdays (maybe other days as well) the $2 any draft special lasts until 9pm! Also on Wednesdays they have $1.25 beef tacos and $2.50 Fish and Shrimp tacos, $2.50 Coronas and $3 Margaritas! The beef taco was fantastic and you are able to choose your level of heat.   I can't wait to come back for more $2 drafts and to try other food items."}
{"text":"Bartenders are competent, prices are low and appropriate, there's always an under control and cool group of clientele, it's a fantastic neighborhood bar. Stop in for a pint, and the legendary tacos, and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour spot! All their drafts are $2 until 9pm on weekdays with terrific offerings that include Blue Moon, Stella Artois, New Belgium Fat Tire, Great Lakes, etc. They also have $1 Coors Light bottles during all Tribe games.  Come in on Wednesdays for $1 beef tacos and you have yourself a nice little evening. My only complaint is the low amount of seating so it can be difficult at times to get a booth or table."}
{"text":"The Riverwood is a local bar with some great pub grub. It is very casual, with a small area in the back for pool. Wednesdays are $1 taco (beef) nights with margarita and beer specials. This place is pretty much a dive, but it is a local favorite. The cheap drinks, laid back manner of the clients, and yummy pub grub keep us keep coming back. My friends and I seem to keep turning up there even though there are still tons of Lakewood bars left to explore. They have plenty of tv's over the bar to catch the local game (the run great beer specials during Cleveland sports games). It is a bit chilly, so dress warm in the winter!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am old.  Thus bar was buzzing with a bunch of low 20 somethings in a Friday night.  Terrible table service.  Just go to the bar and get your drinks."}
{"text":"I have spent many of nights here at the Riverwood.  Very good staff and superb prices on drinks.  during cleveland games 1$ coors light bottles and good shot specials.  I reccomend going if you like a laid back place to chill.  great food, cheap as well."}
{"text":"I debated whether to give 4 stars, but I tend to overstar sometimes. Yay dollar tacos on wednesday nights.  I've been told that they use left over steak meat or something like that. Either way, it's yummy and cheap.   Very casual, the definition of \"local bar\".  There are tv's and a pool table.  Just be careful who you challenge to a game of pool.  Some of the locals are a little too serious about their pool games.  Who knew you have to call EVERY shot?"}
{"text":"Riverwood is the quintessential Lakewood bar. It's a bit divey, a little small, and has great food and drink specials. Locals love this bar and for great reason. The happy hour is among the very best in the Cleveland-area and features $2 draft beers (yes, every beer on tap, including IPA's is $2) until 9pm every weekend. The wings are my go-to here. The are discounted for all browns, Cavs and Indians games. I've also had the tacos which are homemade and delicious. The bartenders are nice and attentive and the prices are hard to beat. Their is a pool table in the back and tv's all over the bar. If you plan on watching a game here plan on arriving early as the bar can get packed on game nights. There's about 6 large booths surrounding the bar but if you have a large party you may want to call ahead to ensure there's no issues! Overall, a great bar with above average food and a great happy hour."}
{"text":"This is a good dive bar for a group of people either watching a sports event or on a barcrawl through lakewood. I had a veggie burger and it was ehh-okay. Wasn't unedible but not very tasty. I've had their fries and other greasy snacks before too and it's your typical dive bar food, maybe even beneath that. I give it a 3/5 though because there is a pool table, plenty of space and seating options, and great drink deals. They have $1 coors for game days and $2 ANY draft until 9pm on weekdays. That's one crazy happy hour length and they have 10-12 great drafts. Fun to add to your bar-hopping list but nothing special besides great happy hour deals."}
{"text":"Stopped here for tacos and wings one night with my beau.  I went on a Yelp recommendation that the food was good.  Eh.....I've got to disagree.  Both the beau and I felt ill later that night and into the next day.  Food quality wasn't great and I don't really feel the need to return.  Ever.  The service was great, our server was prompt, nice, and informative.    The beer was beer.  They have the usual suspects and a few nicer selections on-tap.  For drinking...ok.  For eating....skip it."}
{"text":"Great dive bar! Lots of $2 drafts to choose from during happy hour and had the tasty Wednesday special $1.25 beef taco with medium heat.  If I lived closer I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"If you're into shitty and packed bro bars in the west end of Lakewood, this is probably your home base. Horrible place."}
{"text":"They allow my friends and I to stack beer bottles three to four deep the length of the booth. No other place allows this! There has to be some kind of danger in this but it seems as if no one cares. Probably asking why do this? Don't have a specific answer but for the fact that it is fun and usually a good conversation starter to folks who wander by our booth.   So yeah the service is a little slow but you're paying a dollar for coors light. It's not like you're drinking a craft beer listening to the lumineers you stupid hipster. Get over the slow service and go somewhere else. Allowing the loyal customers to get served faster.   As for the food. Order the sweet heat and honey chargrilled wings. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"$2 draft beers until 9:00pm M-F.  Great food specials, and a very friendly staff.  Perfect place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Cant be dollar twenty five coors lights during indians/cavs/browns games. Great wing deals and burgers."}
{"text":"My scattered thoughts on Riverwood aggregated from a bevy of over-drunken nights:   I am not a local at this local bar in the same sense as the other true locals. I hail from the other side of Lakewood but that doesn't mean I don't know exactly what Riverwood is and has to offer.   Cheap drinks - stopped in frequently with a small group of friends with the goal in mind of many beers. Many beers were had and rounds of shots were being bought without hesitation. The bar is simple and that's where its allure rises from. Pool table in the back which always has someone lurking it. Bathrooms are small and crappy but get the job done. Tall-backed, wooden booths make for a good fort to close yourself off from the rest of the bar crowd.   I've heard the food is tasty. Nothing shy of simply executed bar food. Nothing at all wrong with that. I've also heard that during CLE sports games Riverwood likes to offer $1 PBRs. Although I'm not entirely sure now that I think about it. I just know that its a ridiculously cheap beer special.   Its the cheap, local brewstop. Fridays and Saturdays can get quite packed after 10pm. I like stopping in on the weekdays so I can sit at the bar and relax, chat, watch TV."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but amazing experiences at Riverwood Cafe thanks to the bartender Rachel! She always makes me feel welcomed and had a good sense of urgency and respect. I will not stop coming to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Now I may be a little biased, but I swear it isn't just because if you were to look in my location services in my phone you would think I would give it a 10! They have great specials and good bar food!   They have the best happy hour around, $2 pints until 9 Monday-Thursday, you really cannot say no! Then during any Cleveland sporting events, Cavs, Browns or Indians they have $1 Coors and wing specials!  I mean come on, that is just asking you to come in and give it a try?    As far as a bar scene, it is young and usually pretty crowded but has a good vibe.  It is a 1 AM go to for my friends and I.  The only time I try to stay away is during college breaks, like Christmas, Thanksgiving etc.  It is like every 20 something came out of the wood works to go here.    Now onto the food, I have not had something I do not like.  Yes, it is just bar food but they try to add a little flair to each thing on the menu in my opinion.  First, their fries are delicious and not just from an Idaho frozen bag. The food is always fresh and served hot.  The burgers are huge, way bigger than the bun (and on Mondays it's buy one get one), their wraps knock it out of the park (favorite is their cajun) and I am a huge fan of their tacos and wings.    Another great deal they have is Wednesday is $1.25 beef tacos and they are so good!  They fry the shell which is something a little different and then you have a choice of mild, medium or hot for the salsa.  Their sweet heat wing sauce is delicious! (You can also have a chicken sandwich with that on it).    If I haven't convinced you yet, check it out on a Wednesday during a sporting event and you'll enjoy a descent crowd, dollar beers, tacos and wings with a bill under $10!"}
{"text":"Great wings. Check out this place for their wing night. That's pretty much the only thing I've ordered from here but other entrees look tasty too. Prices are good during happy hour and they have a lot of good beers on tap including some of my favorites, Great Lakes!"}
{"text":"I am from los angeles, and let me tell you this place is a steal.  I ordered two coors lites, and two jamison's, gave her $40 bucks.....i got $28 in return.  I guess it was buck beer night, how awesome.  Wings are actually very good and i eat a ton of wings!  I actually drove to Buffalo the next day to eat at Anchor bar."}
{"text":"Oh Riverwood... I am right around the corner, so this is my go to spot.  They have really great food and a ridiculously cheap happy hour.  Monday thru Friday from 4-9 all of their pints are $2 and they have a great selection on tap.  And to take the sting out of Cleveland sports, they have $1 Coors Lights during all Tribe, Browns, & Cavs game, so by the end of the game,  you don't care who won or lost.   Their tacos are probably the 2nd best on Detroit Ave.  They are HUGE and you can get them any day of the week.  On Wednesdays though, they are only $1.  The beef is good, but if you're looking for something different, the chicken ones are spot on!  They also have their award winning wings, Sweet Heat.  They are perfect, and on Thursdays and during sports games, they are 40 cents.   Between the beers, tacos, and wings, I could live at the Riverwood.  I might get very fat, but I'd be happy dammit!  I frequent this place mostly for some day drinking or Browns games (when you'll more often than not be Kickin' it with Kenny), as it gets pretty crowded on weekend nights, and seems to lose its charm.   There's a jukebox, pool table in the back, and the smallest restroom I have ever seen.   The old guys at the bar I work at like to tell me stories of the years they spent here when it was the Telstar.  I love that this place has history, and remains a favorite in Lakewood."}
{"text":"This place has the bomb wings for 40 cents on thursdays.  If you have.not been here you got to try them out."}
{"text":"Dollar taco night also carries the added bonus of $2/drafts. (Includes everything on tap!)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar in Lakewood! They have the best happy hour prices of $2 drafts that include many fine beers, not just the standard Bud Lite pap. Their daily food specials are generous and the food itself is top notch bar food. Their wings and sauces are solid and the burgers are always juicy! Even when the bar is busy you can usually find seating. The bartenders are generally efficient and charming. Couple that with the great happy hour beer prices and simple food done well, what's not to love about The Riverwood? My old lady loves the place so much she said she would have our wedding reception there if she could!"}
{"text":"Unlike other comments, our service is exceptional every time. The bartenders are fast, responsive, and nice.  Clearly one of the best happy hours in Lakewood.  Of course it often gets crowded on weekends so we prefer the weekdays.  For food, get the chicken firecrackers or the Friday fish taco. Awesome bar food!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm slightly over the fact that my iPhone was stolen from me here, because I have since been back for tacos. Ironically not even on Taco Wednesday...but the new bartender is nice, she actually waits on you unlike the others.   As usual very crowded, pretty much all guys. But still, those tacos are just so good. They just right there with Merry Arts...  So stop in on a Wednesday night and have yourself some one dollar tacos :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Whether you're visiting Lakewood or live here, you quickly discover there are many bars to choose from. Churches too. But they are each very individual. So if you like amazing happy hours, out of this world burgers and most important to me, great service. They are always so friendly. Check them out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! They always have the best specials. They have $2 drafts during their happy hour (craft beers too). For osu, cavs, browns, and Indians they have $1 coors.   They also have a some good bar food. Their sweet heat by far is the best sauce I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love Riverwood. They have the best tacos in Lakewood. And their fish fry on Fridays is the best! I love that they have happy hour specials until 9! One of my favorite places to meet up with friends!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Great for happy hour. Amazing deals during any Cleveland sporting event!!"}
{"text":"Seems like a great place to grab a beer at the old-school bar, but I was underwhelmed during a Saturday lunch -- it seriously took about an hour to get even our appetizer and drink refills. I don't want to sound like a complainer, but you expect a little more during maybe the busiest lunch day of the week. Nice ambiance, though -- I'll give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar to frequent if you live in Lakewood! I come here quite often for the insane $2 draft special -  you can get any of the beers on tap until 9 pm M-F. They also have a great taco night on Wednesdays with $1.25 beef tacos. These things are ridiculously addictive and the fact that they come with a spicy option makes me want to propose to the owner. The shells on these bad boys are similar to the shell that you get when you order a taco salad at a Mexican restaurant which is unique and why they are so tasty. They also have a fried fish, shrimp, and chicken option but they are usually $2.00-3.50 depending on the week. I'm not sure how late they serve them but it's at least 10 pm and they often run Corona and Cuervo specials on taco night if you're not into/past the draft deal.   After a while the servers/bartenders start to recognize you, which is a nice perk. Honestly, I'm even starting to recognize the taco night crowd (looking at you pool sharks). For the 15 or so times I've been here I don't think I've had anything other than the tacos which is kind of pitiful, but give this place a shot if you're looking for cheap alcohol and tasty specials. They usually run game time deals as well. Probably not somewhere to take your out of town friends, but still a great stop- grab a drink, grab a snack, play some pool, watch a game."}
{"text":"This little dive bar has the best happy hour I've found in Lakewood. $2 drafts from 4-9pm on weekdays and this includes the craft stuff. Pretty remarkable deal. For the look of a dive, they can pull in a pretty large crowd.   The staff is super friendly, albeit understaffed most of the times I've been here. Typically you've got two bartenders running the bar and managing all of the booths and tables. On a busy night, you could be waiting a while for service. It's not the most spacious place, so expect to get a little friendly with the people around you on the weekends or if an Ohio sports game is going on.  During the games they do $1.25 Coors Light bottles, so it's a hot spot for a cheap deal.   Taco...Wednesday?  While most places stick with the alliteration of Tuesday, I like that Riverwood dares to be different. If my first-born child makes the mistake of popping out on a Wednesday, I'll still find a way to make it to Riverwood for their taco night. I'm here every week and have to say their tacos are surprisingly my favorite in the area. The shells are amazing. They do a deep-fried flour shell that results in pure deliciousness. They come in a variety of proteins and spiciness. Check them out!"}
{"text":"LOVE!    Taco night (wednesday) is definitely something sent from heaven.  Stop in for happy hour any night of the week for $2 drafts of GOOD BEER.  Can't go wrong..."}
{"text":"My wife and I stop in here occasionally. It's a really good value. While we all know bar food isn't the healthiest, they do a nice job minimizing the grease and offer a few healthier options. They usually have some beer specials, but even when they don't, they have a good micro beer selection.   I really only have two complaints about the Riverwood. One they can't do anything about. The other they can control and the fact they don't is really annoying.   The first complaint is in the winter when anyone opens the front or side doors everyone within 20 feet gets the big freeze. Annoying, but since I'm from Cleveland, I can live with it.   The second complaint is why the barmaids can't put the game sound on during major sporting events instead of subjecting patrons to mind numbing techno music, or whatever hipster millennials listen to these days, is frustrating. I understand if someone puts money in the jukebox, but the NFL playoffs aren't on everyday. Don't get me wrong, the barmaids are great. They're hardworking and attentive. They just need to embrace the game day experience."}
{"text":"I used to live within walking distance of this place and I am completely kicking myself for never going there before for their taco Wednesdays.  For $1 for a beef taco, I was expecting some wimpy little hard shell taco---nope. I got them with the hot sauce on it, and I'm glad I did--it definitely wasn't too hot, and it gave it a nice little kick with some extra flavor. I got 3 tacos and 2 draft beers, and my bill was only $7.24. Please tell me how you can beat that!??!   I got there around 5:15 and there wasn't really a crowd, but when I left around 6:30 it was a lot busier. So, I would recommend getting there just a tad bit earlier in the night, but if you don't then it you should still be fine. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the bartender. There was one in particular that ignored us a lot, but luckily a blonde one would recognize when we needed something and come over and help us out. I get really annoyed when a bartender looks you right in the eye and then just refuses to come over and see what you need. My friend that  I was with got the bean tacos since she's a vegetarian, and it was kind of weird that they brought hers out and just let them sit on the bar until mine were done ten minutes later."}
{"text":"Riverwood is definitely the go to bar within my group of friends. It's definitely a dive bar, which I love. There are about 9 or 10 booths around the place, a large bar, a pool table, and tiny bathrooms. There are so many great specials that pull you in any night of the week!       During any Ohio sport team game (yes, any!) bone-in wings are .48 each and coors lights are only $1.50. You really can't beat that deal anywhere. Especially for the insanely delicious wings that you get. Riverwood has hands down my favorite wings, and thinking of them now makes my mouth water. I definitely recommend the sweet heat, but have tried so many delicious flavors.       Definitely the best happy hour in town (or anywhere I've ever seen) Riverwood offers $2 drafts from 5-9 Monday through Friday. While I've always struggled to find a happy hour that I could enjoy with friends that didn't end at 6 or 7 (because who can make it there in time?) I finally found Riverwood. The only exception is Christmas Ale, which I believe is 3.50(still awesome).       My favorite night of the week here is definitely Wednesday. They have $1.50 tacos plus happy hour. We make it a habit to come early to take advantage of both. The tacos are beef or shrimp for $1.50 or chicken for I believe 3.50(much bigger). The shell is deep fried and they are some of my favorite tacos!       No matter what day you come, you can't really go wrong. The place gets insanely packed during popular sporting events, so come early if you want a seat. Otherwise, there's plenty of standing room and usually not many issues getting to the bar."}
{"text":"This place is awesome it's definitely a go to hang out. They have awesome prices and good bar food.  Fried ravioli that's what I'm talking about.   Kind of creepy interior with an awfully odd group of bartenders but very nice and friendly.  Awesome place to go to go here you'll love it it's a bar it's fun it's cheap."}
{"text":"Decent bar, decent crowd during the week, the riverwood is a great mainstay. Their happy hour is awesome ($2 anything on draft, with plenty of micros and tasty beers), and on Wednesdays its $1 tacos and $3 margaritas, plus the happy hour specials. The food is good too! Its pretty cheap, and made fresh."}
{"text":"Go here often on Thursday nights for wing night and it never disappoints. They have a wide selection of wings at a good price. Their burgers are also pretty good, come on Monday for buy one get one free burgers. Happy hour draft beers are only $2 which is quite a steal."}
{"text":"There's just something about the Riverwood that I will always love. It's somewhere between the amazing wings, pool table, and cold beer!!! But this spot always has a place in my heart. Have a few wings and then ask Champ the cook to play pool with you. Pictured: Lemon Pepper wings!"}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week.  The staff is great and really friendly.  Food is perfect for the price and delicious.  When you order a burger medium rare, guess what?  Its actually medium rare that alone gets this place four stars these days.  The service brings it up to five.  Fresh fries is just the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Lot's of great food and specials. Drafts are $2 Monday to Thursday from 4 until 9pm. That's crazy good. Grab a Bell's Two Hearted while it's available, it goes fast! Coors lights are $1 during Indians, Browns, or Ohio State games. You seriously cannot beat this deal anywhere in the city. If you're trying to take advantage of those specials, then you need to get here early. This place gets PACKED. And I mean, can't move, barely breath, too hot packed, even during the depths of winter. There is no air conditioning of any sort to cool it down during those hot summer days. I will usually head somewhere else if it gets too busy, but getting here early and snagging some of the few seats they have can really make for a great time.   Grab some of their bar food during their respective day specials. They have some fantastic wing sauces, like the sweet heat. The wings are a good size as well. They have burger days as well as taco days. I would say check the website for their specials, but it seems that they haven't paid their website bill lately and it's currently down. Wednesday is taco day, with $1.25 tacos and discount tequila and Coronas. I think Tuesday is wing day.   They have a pool table as well, which is nice to use during casual weekday drinking. Bathrooms are tiny, and barely admit the two people that can use them at once. Bartenders are quick to get your drinks, food gets served faster than you would think, and the place is kept clean. Great, cheap food and drinks, sports, and an awesome crowd. What more could you want in a bar?"}
{"text":"Oh Riverwood. I always have loved this place. They have 2 dollar any draft all the time for happy hour. 1 dollar Coors light for most Browns, Cavs, Indians, and Buckeyes games. Pretty much anything is cheap most of the time anyway though. Taco night is on Wednesdays and are fantastic. The entire staff is great here. Bartenders are very open and fun. The kitchen staff is awesome as well.   Lets get to the food. Pretty much everything Ive had is great. It is barfood but definitely upper end barfood.  The burgers are what I usually go with myself. I like it spicy so I normally get the burger from hell. The Riverwood burger also rocks. One must... Anyone that has been here will tell you to get the SWEET HEAT wings! Best sauce around no joke.   Great place to watch games. They go sound up on all football games and most Cavs games. Atmosphere is normally pretty good. I only avoid UFC fights. Id rather watch those at home and not a bar. See you soon Riverwood."}
{"text":"Riverwood was a better place, before ownership changed. I walked in on Friday and walked right out. The Char Grilled flavor wings are still awesome. I guess it is still decent on weekdays. Weekends it is filled with scum bags."}
{"text":"Zombie crawl stop 4. At this point it was around 1 on a Friday night. On the west end of Lakewood. Party central. But it wasn't nearly as bad as i had feared. We all piled into a booth and kind of came down to earth drink wise. Those of us that had been sucking down fancy imports and well made mixed drinks were now downing Buds, stray Bud Lites and probably turpentine shots. Except for Mr. Fancy pants. i don't recall ever seeing that guy slumming it when it comes to brew. Ms. Kitty was falling asleep next to me in the booth. I think she started way too early at La Cave du Vin. Happy Birthday, Will!  I had to endure the Black Keys thanks to the head zombie. But hey, if you like that shitty band, you can hear them here. I've actually had lunch here on a Sunday and it was very quiet. A complete 180 from the frenzy of a Friday night.  Not a bad bar at all. Just not something that really stands out to me."}
{"text":"The food here has always been good. They have $2 drafts in the afternoon. There are plenty of food options with specials throughout the week. Monday BOGO burgers, Thursday night is wing night. Lots of flavor varieties for the wings."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start... The legally blonde bartenders should go into data entry positions in boiler room operations because they have business dealing with the general population. They have a sense of entitlement due to dealing with their legions of local regulars who put up with their attitudes and snake like dispositions.  I got eye rolls from both bartenders after asking them to perform their job duties. One passed my buddy by and I motioned her he needed assistance. She flipped out, saying I hate when ppl say their friend needs something. Dont pass up by then!!! I apologized four times she persistently kept arguing. GFY! I asked another for ketchup for my fries, another eye roll. Really?! Shitty tip well deserved. Steer clear of this place. My buddy knows the owner, real cool. Get new staff."}
{"text":"Riverwood is a great hometown Cleveland bar. Awesome happy hour, and it goes until 9! Food is also excellent, with Champ in the kitchen anything is possible. Great place to watch sports, with tons of flat screens and $1 Coors Light bottles during all Indians, Cavs, Browns, and Buckeyes games. Can't find a deal better than that. My favorite bar in Cleveland hands down."}
