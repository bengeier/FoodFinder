{"text":"We went to this place for Sunday brunch. The staff is very friendly, however the menu is very basic. We both ordered the breakfast special, eggs, toast, sausagd/bacon/ham ( I ordered sausage) and home fries. Home fries are kinda strange looking, just thick slices of potatoes."}
{"text":"This here is a low run down greasy spoon with a variety of option on their menu. We went their during lunch time and good see a lot of old regular people in the bar section.   The team went from burgers to poutine to fish & chips but I stuck to my roots but choosing an all day breakfast item from the menu! I had their vegetable Omelette with potatoes on top! The Omelette came with toast.. I would say it was not that bad!  The server was quite friendly, looks like its a family run joint."}
{"text":"Only been once, but plan to go again for proper 'reviewability'. Will update review later but...  Went for brunch with my sister, on a Saturday early afternoon about two weeks ago.   I ordered french toast, 2 eggs over medium, and  large OJ.  Upsides:  Both our meals came out together and fast.  The toast was surprisingly good, after she asked if I wanted white or wheat i feared only getting two slices of thin cheap white bread. I got 6 slices of good flavour holding white bread (not the IHOP thick huge bread, but average). Eggs done exactly over med, still warm even on the cool breezy patio.  Downsides: The 'large OJ' was a slightly larger version of the juice you get at Tim Hortons. Would have preferred something like Tropicana poured into a glass, or heck even fresh squeezed for the $2+ I paid. Smoking on the patio. Not a huge deal, but with the breeze every once in a while the cigarettes of the 6-7 familial Eastern Euro regulars would dose us in their scent. Not a biggie for me Being the only actual customers? The place is run by what 'appears' to be an eastern european family/friends and everyone else in the joint seems to live their lives there - which is fine, but it's nice to see other people visiting a restaurant too.  Would I go back? Yes,  Bang for buck? Yes (except for the bottled juice ;) )"}
