{"text":"It's not bad. The dining room is small, so if it's too busy like at the opening, it can feel cramped. Food was good, but I didn't find it worth the price. It's good, so you can't go wrong, but there are better spots in Montreal."}
{"text":"Almost everything I tried to order they were out of. No fish and chips, no smoked salmon salad so I settled on a Cesar salad. 20 minutes later was told they were out of romaine lettuce and would I prefer a garden salad instead. This place was slow,poor service and sucked."}
{"text":"De loin une des meilleures poutines de Montréal. Le snack bar d'un des plus grands chefs du Québec, J'ai mangé sa salade rémoullade, ses grilled cheese, son Club sandwich.   Tout est bon et le service est plus que chaleureux"}
{"text":"J'ai pris un Club sandwich avec un verre de vin. Les frites maison sont bonnes et la mayo à la truffe est un bel accompagnement. C'était bon et le prix était raisonnable. Le service est très sympathique et chaleureux. Malheureusement, les cocktails en pot masson n'étaient pas disponibles. La viande à hamburger avait l'air triste, style galette congelée...triste un peu."}
{"text":"This is a great local joint recommended by the hotel.  Food selection was unique and somewhat different.  Environment was more like a fast food style and service was decent. Food ordered was was flavorful & we loved the burger, the royal duck, with foie gras slice, duck confit & angus beef!  Just popcorn over soup was hard & stale. I would definitely return & try others on the menu."}
{"text":"Really great service, the food was great and the workers were even better. Recommend to all visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"C'était bon...mais je n'ai pas trouvé que ça sortait de l'ordinaire pour les prix. Des restos comme La belle et la boeuf ont un menu avec des prix similaires et ils ont des spécialités plus raffinées que d'un vrai fast food traditionnel. Ce que je n'ai pas ressenti chez jerry malgré les prix élevés pour un hot dog ou hamburger."}
{"text":"Ok I havent been at this location: it was a booth at the ''Mondial de la bière''. I ordered a burger there and it was extra fabulous! This is the first review I give 5 stars, so it was definitely something special for me. The cooks were pretty quick, and once i held the burger in my hands magic was in the air. Ok i'm exagerating a bit, but I havent had a burger as good since i went on a trip to a foreign land last year. I cant precisely describe why it was so good, so I will have to go to Jerry another time to better understand the taste."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to hang out and have lunch with my coworkers and a few of my friends in order to celebrate my next career move (yoo-hoo!), so I needed somewhere convivial with good comfort food, and Jerry Ferrer seemed like the best option (especially given that they had never tried that place before).  Jerry Ferrer is located on Beaver Hall near the Square Victoria metro station. We arrived around 1 PM, there was still a lot of people, but lucky us there was enough space for everyone. When we arrived the staff explained how it works: you take your order first, then pay and the waiter will bring your food to your table.  The service was quick and the portions were very generous! Everyone was more than happy with their order (and my friends and colleagues are usually very picky). I ordered a salmon and goat cheese salad with a chocolate milkshake and had a bite or two of my neighbor's poutine: everything was amazing. At the end, they offered us a little ice cream with the traditional Pouding Chomeur and it was just perfect, not too much sugar very balanced.  I would definitely recommend trying this place, particularly after the lunch break rush hour."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée avec mon père pour nous changer les idées après le décès de ma mère. Vous voyez le contexte, nous n'avions aucun appétit et moral à plat. Honnêtement, ca reste pour moi la plus belle expérience. Excellent service, un personnel chaleureux, rapide.  Mon père a pris un fish and chips et moi une poutine. Les 2 étaient excellents, les portions généreuses. Un seul plat aurait suffi pour 2.  Abordable. Pour moi, Jerry Ferrer reste gravé dans ma mémoire, à vie, comme un repas et un expérience réconfortants. J'y retournerai certainement. Merci d'exister!"}
{"text":"Le concept est parfait. Un neo fast food qui s'inspire du terroir. Tout est bien pensé, du menu au décor. Jérôme est un de nos génies."}
{"text":"Got Le Fromager with a Chipie beer!  Outstanding.  The sauce is hard to explain but can't be missed.  Wish we had on in Minneapolis!"}
{"text":"Nice dinner which is a little more fancy then most !!! A lot of comfort delicious food with a spin on local Quebec favourites. The portions are huuuge so none of could rally finish our dishes !"}
{"text":"I was so surprised to hear that this place is the low cost equivalent to Europea! The chef who made the menu for Europea made the one at Beaver Hall (right next door) and for this place.   Honestly, it shows. Everything on the menu is comfort food but with a gourmet twist (the wording in the menu clued me in). I got the Signature Grilled Cheese (the bread is heated on garlic butter, cheddar cheese, bacon, and truffle oil), the onion rings to share, and my boyfriend got the \"La 100 Saucis\" which is a poutine with sausage.  Most items on the menu come with a Free refill fountain drink (Given the layout of the restaurant, it can get tedious to walk to the soda machine which was their objective but still)(Also the cup they give is pretty small so you might be looking at a lot of back and forth if you drink a lot)  I thought the portions were very fair given the prices and the quality of the food. I just felt like everything we got was a bit too lukewarm instead of really warm but I guess that's a good thing if you're really really hungry and just want to dig in without fear of burning your tongue.  If it's after 5pm, you order at the counter and they deliver to your table. Otherwise, they give you your food on a tray and you pick your table.   The service is very friendly, they prefer french but they can speak english too. Also, they play only Beatles songs!  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A gentleman orders foie gras for his putine."}
{"text":"Pas une mauvaise place mais je crois que les plats nécessitent un peu plus d'amour. Simplement, tout est bien mais il faudrait une petit quelque chose de plus, un goût plus \"unique\".  On y trouve des plats simples, fish&chip, burger, etc. Mais rien de particulier.  Par exemple les frite manque de goût. Sûrement le type d'huile utilisé.  Toutefois je dois mentionner que le choix des boissons est particulièrement unique; enfin un resto qui offre autre chose que des colas moyens.  Avec une touche spéciale, cette place pourrait vraiment se démarquer de la compétition qui selon-moi est préférable dans le coin."}
{"text":"Meilleur Poutine que j'ai mangé!  Dimanche vers 6pm. La place est vide, étrange, mais le service était courtois et tres rapide, et la Poutine délicieuse!!"}
{"text":"The staff was really helpful and friendly. They provided great service. With that being said, the food was really expensive for what it was. Fed my family of 4 for 80 bucks! The burger was super small, overcooked/dry, and just a bad burger. The poutine was just not good. Fish and chips turned out to be super oily and a very small portion. Hot dog was big but I've had much better from street vendors. Ordered their shake and it was thin like chocolate milk. I hate writing bad reviews, but I don't think businesses should be getting away with charging this much for that quality. I was sent here because apparently the owners are well known for their food. Won't be going back, sorry Chez Jerry."}
{"text":"Went here to meet up with Alfredo n Aron for the first time...this place was perfect for meeting!  Staff were awesome, treated us like regulars even tho it was our first visit!   This place is a really chill lil diner style casse croute. The decoration is beautiful!! (Check out Aron's many photos of this cute resto!)   The food is amazing too. A bit pricey IMO for casse croute eats...but definitely worth it and not at all a deterrent to come back and pay more. I tried the grilled cheese with bacon which was served on two grilled hotdog buns: too kyoot n awesome! My only complaint is that it definitely needed more cheese but im a cheez-a-holic so maybe i'm being too picky.   When me n Aron asked for mayo and they gave use 3 choices... I chose the Truffle mayo n Aron chose spicy...we talked about how we would share n then our waiter brought us each one of each, how sweet is that?!?! And both mayos were faaaaannnnnntastic!!!!  They served us lil samples of Pudding Chomeur icecream which was delicious and the perfect lil finish to a very awesome lunch!   I'll let Alfredo or Aron fill y'all in on the background of this place 'cuz they seem to know it better but it apparently was created with a very chez nous concept to it, so expect to find local products more than imported.   They're having their grand opening party tonight from 10pm to 3 am (will close from 8pm to 10pm to prep for it) so I highly recommend to go check it out...they have beer on tap and a DJ will be playin sweet tracks from the loft inside which I expect will be awesome.   Will definitely be back!! Bienvenue Jerry's!!"}
{"text":"Le chef Jérôme Ferrer vient d'ouvrir son fast-food juste à côté de son resto le Bistro Beaver Hall. Et quel plaisir ! On était une gang de 9, et on a gouté pas mal de propositions : le fish & chips, le trio Jerry (1 grilled cheese, 1 poutine avec champi et foie gras et un maxi cookie pour 12,5$, qui dit mieux ?!!), la salade avec frites de patate douces et la guedille de homard. Miam ! On s'est régalés ! C'est sur le midi ça fait fureur et y a pas mal de monde, mais c'est du fast-food haut de gamme à pas très cher ! Le décor est sympa et le personnel très agréable. Une adresse parfaite pour luncher en ville."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a bright Casse Croute sign on this corner as I approached it early for a meeting and verging on hangry. It was empty with two young guys working, one of whom seemed like a manager - he was definitely warmer, more chill, and enthusiastic, and offering training tips to the other guy like for example, hey, why not serve folks napkins and cutlery with their food? His suggestion of the grill cheese was tasty and came out quick with tasty crispy fries. I indulged with a Red Stripe in the sun and watched the world go by through the big picture windows. I like the feel of what they've done in this room and I'd be back when hungry for classic and nouveau casse croute in the area."}
{"text":"We went on a very slow Monday so the atmosphere was not good but the decor is great. We could not tell it was open from driving by but decided to give it a try. I had a surf and turf burger and liked the lobster meat and beef patty combo. My wife had the mtl Poutine which comes with smoke meat and a little mustard and also liked it. She said a 4 out of five and I agree. Will have to try in a week end night to get a better feel."}
{"text":"The food is fast food but good quality.  The place was packed with locals so you know it's a good place to eat.  Didn't take long to revive the meal."}
{"text":"My husband bought a groupon. It's a set of three course meals with beer. Overall a OK experience.  The space is small. It was a weekday lunch time. Two tables. Not busy. The waiter was slow. Didn't bring us the soft drink and beer until we waited a while and asked for. They run out of two other regular draft beers, and only IPA left. The waiter offered us an imported beer from Czech. Very refreshing.  The food was just OK. My husband searched a lot of places and finally found clam chowder served in a bread bowl here. We ordered it even though we had payed for enough food. However, it came in a regular bowl without noticing us in advance. They just stopped using the bread bowl. Really a bummer. The chowder coming with crouton had veggie mix which seemed very strange to me. Good amount of clam though.  The calamari was good but not a generous portion compared to other places.  The burgers we had are lobster/beef and foie gras/duck/beef. We both think the meat patty can be more juicy. The flavour was pretty bland, and I even thought to put some slat in. Should be more sauce.  The burger come with soft drink, fries, pickle and red coleslaw. We never got our salad and we didn't realized it until we finished our meal.  The price was OK considering it included a soft drink. Next time maybe I will grab classic burger. This place only opened months ago. I could have been more considerate. It was truly a OK experience. I probably will give it another try."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time yesterday at lunch. Portions are very small. Its also overly expenssive for the food quality. reminds me a lot of some food truck we have in Montreal. Was  10,50 $ for a burger only, no fries, no salad nothing. You dont even have to choose what you put in your burger. the music was good. will never go again."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly kind and accommodating (20% student discount!!). Also, some of the best poutine you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"It was our last evening in Montreal and I was craving a poutine, but it was a really cold evening and I was feeling too lazy to venture out to the \"popular\" poutine destinations. So I decided to \"settle\" for a poutine at a restaurant down the street from where we were staying - Jerry's. However, it was not settling at all! Though I was very apprehensive about the quality and taste of the poutine, I was pleasantly surprised by the final product...  I ordered a pulled pork poutine to go and it came to just under $15. I initially thought that $15 was too much for a poutine, but when we got the box, it was heavy, and when we opened it, it was filled to the rim! They were not stingy on any of the ingredients. The poutine was filled with delicious and 'squeaky' cheese, lots of shredded and smoky pork, and all this was swimming in a sweet and smoky gravy. We would have given the poutine a perfect score if they had held back a bit on the gravy. There was so much gravy that it made the fries soggy.   In sum:   Great service We were in and out in under 10 minutes Reasonable prices Great portions Not stingy on the toppings The meal was delicious!"}
{"text":"We visited this place for an early lunch when visiting Montreal. We were slightly hungover and the Poutine here saved the day!! I had the Pulled Pork Poutine which was great, and they had 8 different variations of Poutine. My husband really enjoyed his Caesar! This was great for a casual bite and to sample Poutine which is a must when visiting Canada! Friendly, efficient service and the background music was great too!"}
{"text":"Very nice fast food joint with high quality ingredients. Not your average burger + poutine. Obviously that comes with a higher price tag, but I found the quality of the ingredients and the overall experience to be worth it.   I especially recommend the poutine, it's not like any other poutine you've ever had in the sense that it has many additional ingredients (including foie gras.)"}
{"text":"Ça faisait longtemps que je voulais essayer ce resto rapide et je crois que mes attentes étaient un peu trop élevées. Au menu, on nous présente diffèrents choix de plats style  \"delicatessen\" (burgers, club sandwich et autres) ainsi qu'une sélection de poutine. Nous avons essayé le club ainsi que le burger. Le resto prétend être un casse-croûte du terroir et j'ai longtemps cherché à savoir quelle était la touche spéciale (terroir) dans mon plat surtout en sachant que la chaîne fut fondée par Jérôme Ferrer de chez Europea!!! Tout était bon et frais, certes, mais mon club sandwich n'avait rien à envier à celui du Green Spot ou n'importe quel resto belle province......et ce à 15$ l'assiette! Bref, j'aurais peut-être dû opter pour une poutine, leur supposé spécialité, mais je suis hésitant a vouloir y retourner!  Pour ce qui est du lien avec Juste pour rire......je le cherche encore....le resto n'est pas drôle!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here through Foodora when I was in town.  The food itself was ok, not great, but I'd say worth a try.   My issue for the low rating is the fact that I ordered the Royal Duck and it had no foi gras on it.  Come on guys, WTF?  I truly only have that issue...the food itself was not bad."}
