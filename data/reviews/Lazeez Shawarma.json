{"text":"It took 33 minutes for a simple chicken shawarma and fries. I'll just leave it a that. They don't have their act Together at all behind the counter. Running around aimlessly or without a care in the world. Don't go if you want to eat within the hour."}
{"text":"I am (was) a frequent customer at the original location and also an avid shawarma lover. Since this location has opened up I have experienced fast and professional service. I have also noticed consistency (at least for now). The on the rocks is my go-to and done right here especially portion size as issues with this can be experienced at the other location and other shawarma spots around the city. I am closer to the creditview location but drive to this location for a quicker, better experience. This area needed a good shawarma spot. Sadly never tried Nick's."}
{"text":"Trust me, get the chicken shawarma wrap... It is literally soo good. Also the hot sauce is legit HOT, so careful if you can't eat spicy do not get it spicy.   Also half and half is really good (not on menu, but it's half rice and half fries covered with chicken or beef). My opinion better than only over only rice or only fries."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant that is at the front entrance to Shops On Steeles) by the 404. There is very limited single/double seating in the small place but there is additional seating just within the mall a few steps away.   They reopened under new management recently with a fresh and new redesigned menu. The previous owners had good food but the way they were setup and run, it seemed slow compared to the new owners. It's family run and they are all very attentive. We tried a couple of the new items... Lazeez on the rocks (Chicken swarma on rice) and Lazeez on the Sticks (Chicken swarma on fries) and both are delicious, though the rice is my favourite of the two. They ask you if you want Garlic, Tahini and Hot Sauce and it really adds to the flavour. They come in a few sizes and we have been getting the large whichbis a great value for sharing. 2 large orders is more than enough for our family of 4 including a teenager with a hollow leg.  Service is quick as the chicken and rice are usually ready to go.  There is a short wait for the fries as they are cooked fresh.  Today I was served by the youngest I think (that I've seen so far) and he was not just on the ball, but a little ahead of it, much like the young lady on my first visit. We were so satisfied with the meals and quick service from the first time last week that I've been back 2 more times this week. I can't vouch for any of the other menus items but if they are anything like the rice and rocks, they should be good."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Hated how chicken kebab tasted. The side salad was what I liked the most."}
{"text":"This place has messed up my order almost every time that I've been there. Order a CHICKEN SCHWARMA get home and find a cold beef schwarma in the bag. It was clearly food that had just been sitting around. Will not be going back ever again!"}
{"text":"Definitely prefer this location over than the one at Britannia. Family run place. Acceptable interior. More of a take out place for me never dine in here. We ordered the Chicken Shawarma large. They even let us customize it by adding fries. Most places fuss about it when I ask for fries to be added. The large is a pretty generous size good to share between 2."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I have been coming here since September, and enjoy the chicken on the rocks, and also the shwarma wraps.   What makes this location better is the guys that work there. They are super friendly and quick to make your order. I don't just recommend the company lazeez, but would say come to this specific location. I don't live to far from here, and originally only came because of convenience, but it's the customer services that is keeping me coming back!"}
{"text":"We came here right before closing on a weekend night. They had already put the chairs up on the tables and started the night mopping and cleaning, but the line up was still out the door. The girl taking out order was really nice and helpful. I found that ordering what you'd like on the sandwich at the cash register a bit strange but I guess that makes their service go faster?! Not sure about that.  Anyhow, while waiting for the sandwiches there seemed to be a bit of disorganization behind the counter in regards to whose order belonged to who. We got our shawarma sandwiches, and boy was it a big disappointment. I guess the guy making the wraps added extreme hot sauce instead of mild, and we hardly ended up tasting anything except the heat. Between the hot sauce and gulping down water, I couldn't really tell you what the ingredients tasted like. Might give it another chance."}
{"text":"This location is getting 2 stars based on their customer service. The food was great but the lack of customer service trumps good food. The woman who took my order was really nice and helpful but the woman that made my food was rude and didn't put enough sauce on my lazeez on the rocks. I asked her for more and she told me I had to pay. I let her know that she needed to put more on it as I wasn't paying more for a menu item that highlights their garlic sauce. The whole point of that menu item is the sauce. Hopefully they get a little better as this is the closest lazeez to my house."}
{"text":"Been a regular to this place since it opened last year..love their shawarma.. before I tried them, I thought no one could make best med food than osmows but Lazeez is just as good. They are very welcoming and professionally run. Consistently good food !"}
{"text":"Great taste, great staff.  Staff upgraded the serving size at no charge.  Recommended!!"}
{"text":"We chose this place for dinner on March 19 after citing some reviews on the Internet so we decided to give it a try. We ordered philly cheese steak and mixed grill platter. It was very tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Awful service, dirty and an unprofessional staff; I haven't heard so many F-bombs from a restaurant staff. I ordered a Shawarma and I am still waiting for it 20 min later. This place won't be in business long. I've now eaten the food; 6.5/10"}
{"text":"Not the best but it's ok for when you are craving for shawarma. The people who work there are not polite but the good thing is that their service is fast."}
{"text":"I've gone here 3 times, and each time something gets screwed up. My first two times, I ordered a Falafel meal and asked for pita on the side.  Service was extremely slow and no pita.  I went back the next time and ordered the same, with the same result!  Today I went back after a year, and ordered a Falafel wrap, they gave my order to someone who had just finished ordering (after I had been waiting for 10 mins).    There are many of these types of restaurants in this area, I would recommend you go to any of those instead."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The guy with glasses making the wraps has no decency in talking to customers and puts no effort into his work.  Stick to Osmows or any other Mediterranean food place."}
{"text":"Best place for a good shawarma plate...great portion size and at a great price. Tastes really good but spicier than normal - so just ask for mild if you like it spicy or none if you dont like it spicy. Dont bother wasting your money on Osmows Grill ...Osmows grill has poor service, over-priced, and small portions. This location has extremely friendly staff who know how to put together a perfect tasteful salad too."}
{"text":"I just found a hair in my need shawrmara sandwich, really upset cuz I couldn't return it to show I got the food and went home to eat it. Nop not coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Not good. My coworker and I went there for lunch today. Service was slow and food was mediocre. There was little chicken in my chicken platter. I also didn't like how one of the girls working there was checking her phone, adjusting her clothes, and doing everything with her gloves on and making food after. Unsanitary."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place since it opened at the plaza for some time now, judging from how popular it seemed to be I wanted to give it a try. I went for take out with my family on a Sunday evening and although the place was fairly busy the staff seemed to be working hard to keep up with the customer's demands. We ordered 2 on the rocks shawarma with fries instead of rice and 2 shawarma wraps, both chicken and beef. Although it took a while for our turn to order, the food was ready to go in about 10 or 15 minutes.  The on the rocks shawarwa was pretty tasty but I think I might get the rice next time just to cut down on the oil content of the dish. I tasted one of the shawarma wraps and we had ordered it spicy, and it was seriously spicy for sure! But me and my family are big fans of spicy food so it wasn't a problem for us, but if you cant handle spice maybe go for the mild sauce. Overall good food, service was good and its a good place for some take out shawarma. There were a few tables there for small groups that prefer to dine in as well."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at this location!!! Found a piece of plastic in my wrap!! I wasn't happy before I found the plastic either. Luke warm chicken and it tasted different from the other Lazeez locations that I actually enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I love the shawarma but the service isn't that great. They put phone orders and pick ups before customers waiting in line to order. Fix that!"}
{"text":"I tried the chicken shawarma wrap and it was fine, but I have to say that despite the inconvenience of Osmow's being a bit farther down Hurontario, I'm still more likely to go there than here.   The chicken at Lazeez is so dark it's almost like eating beef. Not just a small portion of the chicken, but literally all of the chicken. If you're a massive fan of really dark chicken, maybe you'll like it. I don't mind some chicken this dark, but not every shred. And it's not even that I dislike \"dark meat\" chicken. I mean, I will eat thighs and drumsticks. I just don't even understand where this chicken is coming from because I've cooked thighs and they are never this dark. Seriously, their chicken looks like beef. Maybe even darker than beef.   Also, I had this happen at the Creditview location so I guess they're consistent, but my shawarma was very unbalanced in composition. The veggies were on one side and the chicken and sauces were on the other. It was therefore hard to get all the flavours in one bite. I wish they would mix up all the ingredients before putting it in my pita if they can't do a better job of incorporating the ingredients during the assembly process."}
{"text":"Pretty horrible customer service.. if you're unsatisfied with something in your own personal life do not take it out on the customer  I asked the girl a question of something on the menu she was claiming as being unavailable. And instead of actually answering the question, she gave a look of annoyance and asked her coworker in their language to explain it to me (I'm assuming that's what she said).   His answer resulted in me changing my mind because of a sizing issue and I chose to cancel my order. At which point the cashier girl rolled her eyes.   Funny thing is that the place was empty when I walked in despite being during the typical lunch rush and now after my experience it all makes sense."}
{"text":"Food is made extremely well. The service is fast and nice. The store has a very cozy environment. I would recommend going here as I always come back."}
{"text":"The pickles were bad and smelled like shit ...went to change they did give me another one but again the same problem ....never again ....zero Marks to them...please check before you put something like that in your tummy ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service is great and the people that work there are so cool too. I once misordered a lazeez on the rocks as spicy and she changed it for me right away! Definitely going to come here more often!"}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes from this Lazeez location. It is my go to fast food whenever I'm hungry & (there's no food in my house)"}
{"text":"This is my husbands and I go to place after a hardcore gym workout! You can always count on lazeez to hit the spot when you're hangry! We used to go down to Ozmows down on queens street, but then we found lazeez to be cheaper, portions bigger and tastes better! Their staff is always very welcoming and very precise when reading and making orders. You can't go wrong with their sandwiches or plates (chicken or beef) the seating area is a little small.. when it gets busy sometimes you can't find a place to sit but other then that it will always be our go to place after the gym or when I don't feel like cooking haha."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood shawarma place.   I usually get the chicken on rice and fries... it's 100.  This isn't fine dining... it's the too lazy to cook a meal and need a quick yet delicious fix sort of place."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Smaller portions available in addition to larger options which is nice"}
{"text":"I was coming here quite regularly but customer service always leaves much to be desired. Tonight was the worse yet and I doubt I'll come to this location again. It took a full 20 minutes for them to prepare my order because the guy on the counter kept letting his \"bros\" butt in. The location is also filthy."}
{"text":"Amazing garlic sauce... trust me. The falafel is made fresh which I really like, most places have pre-made ones that don't taste as good. Great portion size and open pretty late. I tried the chicken on the sticks with hot sauce (it's pretty hot so keep that in mind) and garlic sauce of course, delish and very fresh. To avoid the long line, call ahead to place your order!"}
{"text":"Came here because i was craving shawarma and i walked in and started reading the menu to only change my mind to get the \"Lazeez on the rock\".   i proceeded to the front to order and the guy behind the counter told me to go to the side and pick my size. they had 3 options 1) Small \"students\" 2) Regular 3) Large.  They didn't have pricing for the small so i requested the small portion and they asked me for my student ID... as a CMA i clearly don't have one, other than my membership card. ALSO as a person with a small appetite, this portion would have been perfect for me. My finance was ready to order the regular serving so it's not like he wasn't making money, and i was willing to pay more than the student price.  the person behind the counter goes \"this deal is for HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ONLY\" in a really loud voice.  Instead of making money he turned two paying customers away! I was MORE than happy to give my money to Drupati's."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst lazeez i have visited.   Service is merely transactional And indifferent. Fast food took to a whole new meaning when I was served a beef wrap in a minute... fast you may say? No! Cold yes! The meat in the shawarma was scarce and all I actually ate was lettuce and sauce in a wrap. For the price charged this place is basically ripping you off.  Never going back. This is not shawarma. Its just a hodgepodge of random stuff thrown into a pita."}
{"text":"Great shawarma place, prompt friendly service and the food was delicious. I got a mixed shawarma platter which had beef and chicken with rice/fries and a fatoush salad. Everything tasted fresh, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat..we ordered philly steak sandwich and shawerma, they put so much hot sauce that it was inedible. We called the store and they said they will replace our order. When we went there, he completely flipped. How horrible is the new management..don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Really not the greatest shwarma.  My fatoush salad consisted of brown lettuce and pita and garlic sauce, that's it.  Bathrooms very dirty, urine everywhere.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around the it wasn't too busy.  Pros: - Seating area - Parking - Good service - Good food  Cons: - They upsell without telling you how much extra it will cost you."}
{"text":"Very tasty Shawarmas.  This used to be my number one favorite shawarma joint for a number of years.  Probably one the best in terms of traditional/more authentic shawarmas.  Service can be slow especially around the dinner rush.  If you are short on time and there is a long line ordering on the rocks will expedite the process.  Waiting for a shawarma especially when you are in a hurry can feel like you've been waiting forever."}
{"text":"Lazeez on the rocks is my favourite dish from Lazeez.   The spicy levels are pretty good, you can definitely get more than medium without worrying medium is too hot.  However, Osmows is a bit better when it comes to flavour.  Also, I recommend the fries more than the rice here"}
{"text":"I was passing by and decided to stop here to get a bite. It came as a pleasant surprise that that the food was amazing. On top of that the owner is really friendly. I definitely recommend going!"}
{"text":"There is often a line up and the place kind of looks like a dive.. Tables are not always clean but damn, the food is good. The staff is friendly and wonderful. Their garlic sauce is some of the best around. The prices are stellar for the amount of food you get. I would rate this five stars but on one of my many, many visits.. The rice was slightly hard. Also, the falafel are not memorable. Go for the chicken or beef shawarma and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service skills, and how is management never available?There's an old lady who barely speaks English and charges up the @$$ for sauces. Cheapskates!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite shawarma place in Mississauga! I believe this is the second place they branched off from the original location on Britannia and creditview. Chicken on the rocks is a must- chicken on top of a bed of rice, and sauce. The spice levels can get quite spicy. Very filling, welcoming owners and very filling!"}
{"text":"This place I've walked by so many times! My friend and I ordered the chicken shawarma. For my friend, she got her order wrong (with toppings off) but mine was correct. She had hot pepper on hers when she asked for none and her mouth was burning. The line was really long and there were only two people making the food so they were kind of understaffed. That's why she didn't go back and ask for another one to be made. But that was her experience.  The shawarma was hot and filled with toppings. The price and taste was good, exactly what you'd expect."}
{"text":"1.5 stars. This location has been a revolving door of failed restaurants. I expect the same from Lazeez.  The food is definitely below average quality. The meat is dry with not much flavor. This is a family run place and the parents have their 12 or so year old kid running the cash. I think he'd rather be playing games as he seems rather disinterested.  The food is good for a quite bite in a crunch but keep your expectations low!"}
{"text":"Really good Shawarma and very fast service. The clean restaurant gives confidence to have an impromptu meeting with your colleagues. Reasonably priced too.  Had a Chicken Shawarma that actually had a lot of chicken than the veges. I generally take it without  Hamus and the white sauces. These guys knew how to compensate with just the right amount of hot sauce.  The restaurant is always kept clean. I go there during as well as out of the peak times and it has always been clean. The staff are very polite and know their stuff.  Try the place and you will like it."}
{"text":"Just went for quick take out on a Sunday of the Family Day long weekend.   Ordered a large and a regular falafel sandwich one was of which was a combo (comes with fries/rice and a canned pop).   First there was a line up of at least 10 to order to food and most of them takeout and most of them with multiple sandwiches or platters. My order took a good 40 minutes.   The sandwiches were ordered \"mild\" but were fit to be called hot. Paid a extra for the hot sauce and garlic sauce. The hot sauce is spicy hot-not with flavour. The garlic sauce tasted more like ranch.   The fires were not crisp. The sandwiches were good. The large sandwich is large! Will come back for the falafel platter."}
{"text":"Came here today just to try their chicken rice plate. Here are my thoughts based on my first visit.  Place is bigger than the other location Place is a lot cleaner It is not as busy as the other location Staff has the typical middle eastern attitude. No smile no greeting no thanks no good night Food, the most important thing was far below from good. I say stick with Osmow's Shawrma place instead. Their chicken is hard and the white sauce is not like Osmow's  I don't think I will ever come back again.  Message to the owner, please train your staff on respecting the customer and how to take responsibility of the cash register.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Previously I would've given them 5 stars for the food after my first time here. 2nd time was lackluster and left me rather disappointed.   Our order was taken: shawarma on the rocks, one with all fries and another with all rice. So we take a seat at one of the booths, over 20 minutes pass and we're wondering why our order isn't ready? Even so we're patiently waiting and then we're called up to be told our food was already ready for quite some time, long enough for it to get cold. Oh well, I'm hungry, minor gripe that can easily be overlooked.   The major disappointment was finding a lot of tiny, sharp bones in my food. For shawarma on the rocks guys??? Come on, I don't want to be taking bites of chicken, rice and sauce then pulling bones out of my mouth or searching for bones with my fork. You don't want one of those things stuck in your throat. Trip to the emergency room on a Saturday night? No thanks!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but a bit disorganized with a few kinks that (minimally) tainted our experience - the cash register was down when we visited so the line was out the door (literally) and it took forever for orders to be taken and payment to be processed. It took another 20 minutes for our food to be prepared, and there was a lot of disorganization behind the counter trying to figure out whose order belonged to whom. Food splatters everywhere and not the cleanest food prep counter as they ran around trying to get orders ready.   The food itself was quite good but I feel like the other Lazeez location (the original on Creditview Road) is (slightly) better when it comes to experience and quality. We ordered the \"Lazeez on the Rocks\" (chicken on a bed of rice topped with various sauces) and the \"Chicken Souvlaki\" (chicken breast on a bed of lentil rice with a side salad). The Lazeez on the Rocks was a bit salty but the Chicken Souvlaki was actually really, really delicious, fresh, and flavourful, and surprisingly, I'd definitely get that particular item again.   Service was incredibly friendly, and I'd definitely return again as they (hopefully) improve and grow past the snags that come with opening a new location.  For 1 order of \"Lazeez on the Rocks\" and 1 order of \"Chicken Souvlaki\", we paid around $22.00."}
{"text":"This place offers best beef shawrma wrap in GTA Toronto. They have 5 to 6 spice levels.  It's authentic meditarian food. I didn't like the chicken shawrma wrap as it did not stand a chance against beef. It's a busy place so to avoid 15 to 20 min in line order on phone and pick it up.   Staff is extremely curtious and friendly. I have seen 90 percent people taking take away order.  For dine In its decent also"}
{"text":"food is amazing as always, but came to this location yesterday and the staff is AWESOME! the cashier is the worlds sweetest lady ever and even the man cooking the food was so nice, he double checked what meat i wanted and made my lazeez on the rocks look beautiful and it was perfect! i love this place, the food is beyond flavorful and the people who work here are so sweet :) so happy they opened a location near me!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this food place.. It's 5 mins away from my house and it's new and very ckean.. They do have tables and chairs for people that would like to eat in. But you have the option to do a take out.  We ordered the mixed shawarma platter which comes with rice beef and chicken shawarma meat side of salad and a choice of fries or potatos.. I choose the potatoes just because I likes bake potatoes in a broth.. I choose medium heat which is pretty spicy but good.. the meat isn't dry it's very moist and soft.  The other dish we ordered is a chicken shawarma which had all the ingredients in it and medium heat..  I do find the price is a bit too high but at the end it is worth it.. I would recommend anyone here"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a regular at Lazeez shawarma on Britannia and creditview in Missisauga. And even though there are a lot of other lazeez locations, I always preferred to drive 20 mins to go to Missisauga. This new location is 5 mins away from my house so I decided to check it out. And I wasn't disappointed. The staff was friendly, the tables clean, the owner talked to us and even offered some complimentary baklava. Their Caesar salad wasn't as great (not as crispy and less sauce) but when I pointed it out, they were happy to fix it for me. The meat is tender and flavourful. I end up going twice a week for my chicken/beef shawarma platter. Happy to have Lazeez so close to home."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome. Food is always fresh. Great portions. Never have to wait. Delivered with a smile. We stop by weekly"}
{"text":"It's a great tasting shawarma! They have specials everyday! I like to get shawarma in fries!"}
{"text":"I don't understand these reviews, Lazeez was probably the worst shawarma place I've ever been to. Their shawarma was so dry and flavourless, they try to cover that up by drenching your plate is a mixtures of sauces. It was honestly disgusting. I figured maybe the shish tawook would be better, but oh man was I wrong. The chicken was yellow on the outside and pink on the inside. It was so incredibly chewy that just thinking about it makes me want to vomit. Save your money people, this place is not authentic and the food is just plain disgusting"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and had good service but the food has no flavor the rice was bad the chicken was not cooked well."}
{"text":"I almost poo'd my pants when I saw another Lazeez Resto open up off 10th.  Incase you are wondering where this place is situated, it is on the north west corner of Tenth Line and Thomas St. Lazeez took over the old Nicks Shawarma unit. Lots of parking. Nice little place they got.  About 8 tables inside incase you want to eat in. I saw some familiar faces behind the counter which made the feel just right.  My standard go to dish at Lazeez is the \"On the Rocks\". The young lady that took my order was on the ball and very pleasant to deal with.  THE POOD:  I guess they must be working out the kinks in the kitchen because my OTR was, to say the least, not very yummy.  The yellow rice was so salty that I couldn't eat more than three bites. The chicken was ok but Dayaam the rice. I cut through all the layers and taste everything individually. Yeah, I is crazy like that. I am not giving up on this location though. I will give them another month and hit it them up again.  Please don't fail me again. Their Creditview Iocation still rocks!!!  I give two stars for the service.   Getting better."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before heading to Toronto on New Year's Eve.  The people behind the counter were friendly and made our food quickly.   In terms of this location itself, it was pretty dirty inside. Think tables with crumbs/grease, random food bits all over the floor, and a general disorganization in the kitchen (visible from the seating area).  Having said all of that, the food was decent (I opted for the falafel wrap and bae got a mixed shawarma) and we were satisfied in general - a ok!  Kind of random note, they don't have white vinegar packets here. Call me a weirdo but I love me some vinegar with french fries!  All in all, would not go out of my way to return to this particular location."}
{"text":"We've been to a few Lazeez locations in Brampton now and this one is by far my favourite.  Super clean interior plus the service was very polite/friendly.  This location just opened up in the last couple of months so it looks like they are still getting some parts set up. They have a cute patio off to the side which would be nice to sit at on a beautiful day.  The food was delicious. I opted for the falafel wrap with fatoush salad and bae selected the mix shawarma with fries. Everything was super fresh and made with care. A solid option for a quick satisfying bite in the area.   This will be our go to location in Brampton now!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, awesome food, friendly staff!! Me and my sister come to this location all the time we just love it! Their chicken shawarma wrap is awesome and the chicken on the rocks are a must try!! Best place in the GTA!!! Would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Be careful here.  They sell you the large size for everything unless you explicitly ask them for the regular size.  And when you ask to change your order, they refuse.  We ordered \"Lazeez's Favourite\" chicken shawarma and the \"Half and Half On The Rocks\" (chicken, fries and rice with white sauce), and both items were delicious and the portions were big.  The total cost was $21 with pop, so the price was good too.  Overall, the service wasn't good, but the product and price makes up for it.  I would come back here if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lazeez on the rocks (regular size)and a can of coke which came up to 10.78 which I think is kinda too much considering it was just chicken and tahini on rice. Thought that this dish would at least come with some veggies or potatoes. The flavour was very good though, the perfect amount of spice and the chicken wasn't dry like most places. Overall it's a decent place"}
{"text":"Lazeez has been a staple in my weekly diet ever since this location opened up in the tenth line plaza.  My usual gotos are the lazeez on the rocks(chicken&rice) or the chicken shawarma. I usually prefer the large lazeez on the rocks as i can usually save half of it for another meal later on(two meals for $10!).   The hot sauce can be a bit overbearing compared to other shawarma places(montfort, osmows, pita&grill).   Also a great way to reduce carbs and make the meal a bit more refreshing is asking for half salad(+50 cents) and half rice."}
{"text":"I found this place by mistake... their competitors were closed. But what a great find! Their chicken is so tasty, their Shwarmas are a great price and soooo filling! Their chicken on the rocks is delicious and generous. Their staff is friendly and efficient. This is now my Shwarma place!"}
{"text":"The food taste is good, beside that, everything else is average or below. But thats not big problem if you are looking for a tasty shawrma."}
{"text":"Great shawarma. The service is mostly good, although one employee was very rude once but every other time I've gone has been pleasant. The food itself is cheap and great quality. I highly recommend the Lazeez on the rocks with rice."}
{"text":"I was in the plaza and stopped in. It looks like any other shawarma joint in a strip mall but this place was surprisingly good. The service was quick. There was a steady stream of customers and quite a few already sitting. Its not really somewhere you would go to sit and eat as there are only 8 tables but the food quality was very high and the presentation was nice with generous portions. I will eat hear again when I'm in in the area."}
{"text":"Lazeez is trash just like osmows. Your food sucks. The exact same thing as Osmows. Garbage."}
{"text":"This place is beyond terrible. They treat their employees like dogs. They cut corners more than they hear the word Shawarma. I know when reading this, you're thinking, oh who cares. But trust me, they don't care about you just your money, so you shouldn't care about them and their business. Sizlos is in the same plaza, was better food and its cheaper. Ask for the student combo."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure why there's the word shawarma after Lazeez.  I walked in at 11:30 on a Sunday to find a ton of meat on the griddle being cooked and another two containers of very thinly diced chicken. This only tells me this is all very old chicken that's being reheated. Specially when there were two large spots that were not ready to served.  Someone needs to educate these people that a shawarma is meant to be sliced right from the spit in to your pita wrap. Not sliced reheated. And diced.  Why open a shawarma joint when you know nothing about it?"}
{"text":"Lazeez on the rocks! Simply the best! The Donair is good too! The white sauce is what brings it to the next level."}
{"text":"This place is great.   The staff is nice but come for the food. Some of the best Shawarma in the city.   Great sauces, good portions and super flavorful meat and rice."}
{"text":"Friendly family service. Great size portions and the price is great. Very authentic middle eastern cuisine.   4.25/5 *"}
{"text":"If you're local to North Mississauga, good eats are hard to find.  This location is too clutch when munchies o'clock hits.   Chicken on the rocks Or Chicken on the stix  (My usual go-to)  Instagram @EverythingMops"}
{"text":"Thie place is really good for the portions you get. The salad is pretty fresh. I get the chicken or mixed beef and chicken platter with the lentil rice. Much tastier than the regular rice.  The offer fries or potatoes with the platter, and you get a lot of fries if you go with that option. Potato tastes bland compared to other places so I just get fries or ask for extra rice instead.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma is really good here! Ive been multiple times. The only n his isnt 5 stars is because they sometimes add toppings I have said I dont want. Otherwise friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"Lazeez is a new middle eastern restaurant tucked into shops on steeles. It offers a full range of traditional fare including kebabs, felafel and Shwarma. Have to say i love this place. Food is always hot and fresh.  The custom chicken sauce is delicious. And quantity and value is off the charts. Often enough for two meals. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"TIP: if you get the chicken on the rocks, i /highly/ recommend getting it with their lentil rice instead of the regular yellow rice.  this does not cost a single cent, and it adds so much more flavour to the dish (lentils, spices, caramelized onions)  my face has melted somebody please, please help me why? lazeez hot sauce  fire in liquid form i need the extinguisher SOS, this hurts  even a dollop will have you calling fire crews okay it's yum though  that's a digression from my lazeez obsession now time to review  a decent-sized spot in my neighbourhood strip mall serving shawarma  this is certainly top-tier, bang-for-your-buck food an instant go-to  chicken on the rocks served not over ice, but rice sub-ten-dollar price!  packed styrofoam box topped with their tangy white sauce great if you're famished  affordable wraps i go for the falafel which never fails me  a value resto i can't recommend enough but beware........... hot sauce"}
{"text":"This place just opened a few days ago, so everything is clean and fresh. The staff were very friendly and helpful with the menu. The food was great, and the portions were generous and good value for the price paid. I had the chicken shawarma platter, and it was cooked very well, and comes with a large salad on the side. You'll definitely leave feeling full and satisfied after you're meal."}
{"text":"This place serves Indian style shawrama. It tastes nothing like a regular shawarma, don't waste your time and money going there."}
{"text":"Wow! If there is a Shawarma place that can compete with Osmow's head-to-head, it is this place! I am very picky with Shawarmas. These guys did a wonderful job! Price is good and taste is awesome!  Osmow's, you got competition!"}
{"text":"Always preferred their Shawarma over other competitors out there. Their meat doesn't have a lot of fat in it. The guy at cash gave me a good deal for my money, which I appreciated.   The student special is a good deal. My personal favourite is the lazeez on the sticks. One thing I like though is that with the number of franchises opening up. They are able to maintain the food quality and service. Serving size is pretty decent for the price they charge."}
{"text":"Great Taste !! Like a schwarma should taste  We ordered 2 schwarmas not the large but regular ones They were really big and very filling It's really o lot of stuff in it  The restaurant was full on a weekday and a long queue  My only problem here was you can not see while they make ur schwarma It's like I can  not tell to add more of something Nd less of the other  So you order ur schwarma and go to sit and then they call ur order number and u pick it up Don't like this I'd like tone there while they make the schwarma to get it customized to my taste Yes I will go there again definitely since it's soo great but I do prefer places where u can watch and get it made as per ur taste"}
{"text":"The sharwarma was really good. The veggies are crispy and they taste fresh, not like they have been sitting outside for a long time. Nice people great service. And the price is amazing, cheap and good quality."}
{"text":"First experience with shawarma!!  This place is clean, friendly and the food is great.  The staff was fantastic in helping me enjoy my experience and meal for a first time.  Will definitely eat here again.  Remember one line of hot sauce is enough to warm up the whole meal.  I like hot/spicy so I might try 1.5 lines next time, but not more.  My tastebuds are still warm and glowing from 1 line.    Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken shawarma, everything and medium hot. It was very good. Tiny mom & pop operation. Nice people . No complaints."}
{"text":"This is the 4th Lazeezs franchise location I have visited.  I am always excited to try out a franchise location to see if they are on standard to the original Creditview location.  Let me start off that this location is new build with new signs and new menu signs etc.  I came by her during the xmas holidays and surprisingly they were open, given i was in the area, why not try em out.  If it was any other Shawarma place i would have most likely skipped them but given the Lazeez name i will give them a shot because they are a part of the Lazeezs franchise.  What they have different from the other locations is that they sell small size box portions for $5-6 but IMO i don't think it's worth it. i ordered the regular size Lazeezs on the Rocks with lentil rice.  Price is $7.79 not including HST so their prices are a bit higher then the other locations. i guess all stores prices are not aligned.   If it's a franchise wouldn't they all be operating on the same menu prices????  Anyways i was watching the gentlemen put together my meal and noticed he wasnt filling the rice up to the brim of the container.  He was also putting chicken on top but flattening on the rice as opposed to burying the chicken on top of the rice. basically he was stinging out on the meal.  you would think if i was his only customer in the restaurant and he would give a healthy size portion of rice and chicken. One thing though he didn't skimp out on the garlic sauce, he thoroughly laid it down along with the hot sauce.   i noticed something was missing he didn't lay it down with another sauce the Tahini sauce he skipped out on that part.  i told him that he forgot to put the 3rd sauce and he said what sauce and i was like the Tahini sauce and he said \"Oh!!! i dont like tahini sauce that's why i didn't put it\" my response well I like tahini sauce can you please put some on.  Tahini sauce on Lazeezs on the Rocks is always a part of the toppings unless customer stating they don't want unless they changed toppings recently.  Anyways brought the food home started to eat it and noticed the rice texture was harder like it was a day old rice and same goes with the chicken.  This was the first time ever where i wasn't feeling up to finishing my food i was only able to eat half of eat and i didn't really enjoy eating it either. Not sure if the food was from day before but for sure the food didn't taste fresh at all.  With that said i won't come back here again. i'll play it safe and go to the Original location or the 10th line and thomas location.  not sure how this place has 5 stars from other customers if you really think this place is that good go to other locations i've mention and your minds will probably be blown.  To finish my review i've noticed one of the ppl working there pick up fries from the fries bowl with his bard hands and eat it.  not sure if that is Hygienic or not but that really  didn't make the food appealing when somebody is doing that are a restaurant.  i dunno thats just me   Would i go back here??? most likely not but if you want to try it out yourself please be their Guest!!!"}
{"text":"Lazeez is located in the Shops at 404 and Steeles. I walked over to the food court to order dinner one evening and came here.  The two guys working here were taking a break. I ordered the Koobideh kebob meal (#1 on the menu). It consisted of a large tomato that has been spit-fired cooked. You also get two ground beef kabobs, salad, and rice. He let me know that it would take ten minutes to prepare. He was courteous and friendly.  It is sad when I say that I only liked the rice. I typically don't eat that much rice, but I did. All of it.  The kebobs were salty. I didn't like how they tasted. I am also not a fan of a huge tomato that has been warmed up. It was unfortunate that my boyfriend wasn't with me. He loves tomatoes and would have taken over by eating it.  I disliked the salad dressing. I basically tried to eat the veggies and lettuce that weren't contaminated by the dressing. It was a losing battle.  I may need to just stick with the rice should I ever order from here again. The rice was good. I just need something with protein on top that doesn't make me drink tons of water.  (51)"}
{"text":"Amazing place..I liked their signature dish Lazeez Shawarma platter. Very nice flavour, good portion. All the best guys!"}
{"text":"The flavour of the Shawarma chicken plates were really good. I preferred the Shawarma wrap over the plate. Service was very prompt. The restaurant was clean and the staff were pleasant."}
{"text":"The employee at night hangs up on me before confirming my order because he says he's closing.   I specifically asked for no sauce on food. (Keep it on the side)  Someone picked up the food for me and when I got it he made sure there is extra sauce on the whole thing...   Unbelievable how low quality business and people are still in business.."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time and 2nd location I've been to, one in Sauga and this time in Brampton. My homie brought me here because he swears by it, plus im always down to try new spots. He ordered a large half and half, so its half rice, half fries, chicken on top and there garlic sauce, an then the spice level. I got the mild, it really didn't explain the \"level\" of mild, compared to Osmows.   the location is nice and open so your able to spot it, beside a hair&nail salon I believe. The environment is spacious so when you walk through everyone looks at you lol.  The rice... was okay, the fries were buried and bland, not sure if it was salted because it was drenched in the sauce which was fine. honestly didn't even remember there was fries in it lol. wasn't anything better that I had before. but for the price, the large HALF & HALF WILL GET YOU FULL! believe me. I could barely stand after I ate it. Heavy on the carbs.  imo its the same style when I went over 5 years ago, compared to OSMOWS, Osmows blows Lazeez out of the water. When it comes to this."}
{"text":"The food is really good specially on the rocks mixed rich rice and fires. I'm giving them 3 stars because of poor customer service. They are always getting orders wrong."}
{"text":"I've ordered the chicken shawarma from here about 3 or 4 times and it tastes pretty good. Only problem every time I've had it I end up with a stomach ache not even an hour later."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone and went and wasnt even made. Never going here. Whats the point of taking a order and not even make it."}
{"text":"What's with all the hype? The guy who puts together your  shawarma/toppings (the guy who looks 48 yr old..seems to have a but of an attitude he thinks he's cool or something)..THE FOOD - the food is JUST OKAY and the prices are not good. The price is a lil pricey for what u get would not come back..the spices are a lil off too"}
{"text":"Finally opened up a Scarborough location. Always had to travel to Sauga to get their specialty food. This place is a MUST EATS!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night craving schwarma. I ordered chicken schwarma platter and the boyfriend ordered mixed schwarma plate.  Disappointing. The meat was not very flavorful, barely tasted like schwarma. And the platter is covered in sauce so it feels like they're trying to make up the lack in flavor by drowning it in sauce.  Expensive and it's not even the right flavor profile. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great service! I had the chicken on the rocks and my husband had the shawarma. It tasted fresh and delicious. I would have preferred it a little more spicier. However, we will definitely recommend this this place to our friends."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple locations of lazeez and would always return for some more. This place is conveniently located 10 mins away from my work place so I come by during my lunch break.   So far I have tried the chicken Shawarma, falafel and lazeez on the sticks. The chicken is always well cooked, never smelly and appropriately salted and marinated. Their garlic sauce and tahini are a must add on top of any meal you get. The salads are always fresh and they add plenty of it inside the wraps.  Lazeez on sticks is fries, shawarma chicken and lots of garlic and tahini sauce. This also comes with your desired level of hot sauce. This is always my guilty pleasure.  Recently their service hasn't been on point. They will take your order ASAP and then 3 people will stand around while one of them will tediously juggle everyone's order. I really hope they improve this soon! But all in all I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Honestly.. The food was great. Service? Hell no. It's a quick service restaurant - Pay before you get your food. A group of my mates decided to go on a Sunday afternoon and pick up grub for work. They ordered eight things off the menu and was cashed out in a quick manner. Several people came in after and ordered after my mates and got their food right away. One of my friends inquired about the order and the attendant said \"hold on.\" 25 minutes after, an influx of people came in and ordered and got their food served to them once again. 40 minutes in, I wasn't having it and I told the attendant that I just wanted our money back because they were prioritizing other people after such a long time. The attendant talked to his coworkers shortly and started making the food and then we got the hell out of there. Was the wait worth it? No, but the food was really good because they starved us to death. I called the manager shortly and all he could say was \"sorry, I'll talk to my staff about it, it was a busy Sunday that's why you're order took so long.\" NO... It took forever because your staff couldn't give a rats ass about us. Thanks for the apology though."}
{"text":"Lazeez on the rocks half and half with extra garlic, that is all i get from this shop lol. I am a regular here atleast once a week. Consistant taste and decent customer service. Conveniently located and lots of parking. Would recommend trying the lazeez on the rocks."}
{"text":"I've been to the Mississauga location and really liked it but this location is awful.  There were two guys behind the counter. The guy who greeted me at the counter was friendly but the way he and the other guy interacted was really unprofessional in front of customers.  I ordered a large chicken shawarma and immediately regretted it when I sat down to wait for my  food. The tables around me were sticky and topped with flies. I also noticed that though the staff were gloved on one hand, he was also picking up my food with his money-handling bare hand. The portion size of shawarma was big but the meat to wrap ratio was way too small. I think going with on the rocks (on rice) would have been a better option."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Gave me and my husband stomach pain for 3 days straight. Not sure if it's because the food wasn't cooked properly or if it because the food itself was not clean. In any case - I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and it will definitely not be the last. The chicken shawarma was by far the best shawarma I have ever had.... and I've had my share.  Totally recommend it everyone. It's decently priced and the portions are GENEROUS. Not stingy on the chicken at all! Plus, awesome customer service!!! Can't wait to eat here again :)"}
{"text":"With a heavy heart I write this review.  This is a smallish Mediterranean takeout shop inside the Shops at 404 and Steeles.  The proprietor that day was making some good effort in selling their product, even goes \"satisfaction guaranteed or money back\" to me.  They didn't complain that we got some coffee from the next door store (I wasn't in the mood for cold drinks or bottled water)  Unfortunately, I have to say the taste wasn't my cup of tea.  I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt by ordering a few dishes including the shawarma and the ground beef, filet beef rice dish.  The rice is okay, but the beef were over seasoned, it was hard to discern the flavor of the meat anymore.  He gave us this digestive spice which buffered some of the other spices, but it still couldn't bring out the flavor of the beef.  The shawarma meat (probably because it was the end of the day) was very \"powdery\" in the mouth and was over seasoned with a sour blend that I can't tell what kind of meat it was.  At the very least he gave me some of the overcooked rice which I sort of liked. Sort of like tough chips."}
{"text":"Customer service is great and food is delicious. Tried shawrma from many other places but this ones the best."}
