{"text":"Good food. Been there several times. Great staff, very understanding when I threw up. (It was my birthday at the time and I probably drank too much). Wide selection of alcohol and multiple TVs for whatever sport event is on. And several pool tables and dart boards. Great place for friends getting together."}
{"text":"I'm picky about food and this is not my go to place. Dropping in for a beer is OK.   Nothing amazing here.... Not the food...  Not the service..  Not the beer selection.   Typical bar food. Healthy choices are not easily found.   The patio is OK.   Service has never been good here. Tonight I  walked in from the patio as I hadn't seen our server in a while and couldn't find anyone on the floor working... Not behind the bar... Nothing. Waited for a while and the nice girl did come back out.   Beer selection is pretty common... But you can always find something."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch at 11:30, stood in the front door waiting for someone to come and seat us. There was one guy sitting at the bar and no one else. Waited 3 minutes while the patron and the bartender were having a conversation. Walked out after that, the least they could've said is someone will be right out but nothing. Bad first impression."}
{"text":"On a random Friday afternoon, my friend & I decided to pop my cherry with \"never have I ever been in a bar mid afternoon\".   The parking lot is pretty decent for a strip plaza. The front provides a large section for smokers and possibly a patio in summer.  Walking in, it's a very large place for a local bar. There's a whole dining section completely separated from the bar.   The bar seemed to be busy regardless of the time. We walked in about 2 and didn't leave until about 7:30pm - which is a serious personal record. The day bartender was an older blonde lady with a very revealing shirt. She seemed nice enough when serving us. By 5:30 pm they dim the lights and music gets louder. The music is top hits so good for a wide range of age groups. Once evening hit, a few younger girls showed up for evening shift and wow...one was a fox. Think Jessica Alba cute sided with Jennifer Connolly sexy and she doesn't even know it. I later found out her name is Meagan. I tried to hit on her (for a friend of mine) but it didn't go too well. She got the wrong idea when I asked her if she was single. Is a wing woman really that unheard of?   The girls serve everyone and split the tips. Which is pretty cool for the customers. They are always ensured speedy service. We had sweet potato fries with dip. They had everything covered in 1 trip. Napkins, side plates, ketchup, dip. At any point my beer would be low, they would ask if I wanted to refill. Now, my experience at bar service is very limited but from what I received here, I would definitely come back. The rest of the servers were friendly as well and seemed very chummy to the regulars. And boy, was there a lot of regulars.      There is a small split to the immediate left of the entrance from the bar where you can have a private event. The room includes a few table/chairs and dart boards. With it's own entrance and an open window right to the bar, this is awesome for a group of friends to hang back, beer it up and throw some darts. Possible in that order. I like that it's sectioned off enough to have your own privacy but not excluding the friendly environment of the bar.   There are tons of shirts, mugs and hats promoting the bar. With a name like Scruffy, I suppose that is kind of easy to promote. It seems like it must be quite popular since the package was a t-shirt, hat and a cup for $10.99. I did ask one of the bartenders if anyone had bough it and she replied that they were out of the t-shirts a few times. Cool beans.   The rather interesting sight was at the end of the bar (closer to the main door and the sectioned off room) .There was a shelf full of random books. Now, I don't know why they have books at a crowded bar but I bet some of those titles have caused some serious laugh attacks. Especially if you are on your third beer..... and you have really good vision.......and you happen to catch the title \"supremely satisfying bathroom reader\".   Which conveniently brings me to the bathrooms.. The bathrooms are seriously questionable. While space isn't an issue, cleanliness definitely is. Everything squeaks and some surfaces are oddly greasy.   Overall, I will definitely be coming back. The atmosphere is very welcoming and even though the crowd is significantly older, I don't mind because it makes for excellent random stranger conversations and \"remember that time\" memories.   fun fact : I should mention this place is a game changer for people watching.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"came here with a group of friends for the hockey game and UFC night.   was disappointed with the TV settings, lack of sound and discoloured projector - not the type of place you'd enjoy watching a major fight.  we complained a few times about the quality of the screen and lack of sound but apparently no one knew how to connect the main speaker system - one would think they'd be better prepared for a major event.  I had the lamb Shepard's pie which was good other than the fact that it was super oily - to the point where, as much as I was enjoying it, I couldn't finish it.  I felt like they were short staffed which caused the service to be really slow.   not a place I'd return too!"}
{"text":"It's a fantastic bar, and I love going there. It's got the best wait staff I've ever seen! They go out of their way to make sure everything is perfect for you. The food is on the high end of good (nothing fantastic, but nothing is even close to awful).   I've gone many times before, and I'll be going back many more times."}
{"text":"Would have liked to order. I made eye contact with the pregnant waitress for a while. She was busy gossiping with the other blonde bar tender. She even had menus in her hand.  I have eaten here before, a handful of times. The food is standard pub food. The burgers are kinda weak. Nothing extraordinary.   I have no issues waiting to order if the place is busy. I do have issue when it's 1pm on a tuesday and the place is f*cking dead.   I now go to st james gate, few minutes away on dundas. Their customer service has been top notch every visit and their food is good."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I gather with my friend. The food is decent and the beer selection is good. The service is good and there are plenty of TVs for those interested in sports games on TV."}
{"text":"I walked into this \"Old World Irish Pub\" at 2pm Tuesday, sat down at the bar for ten minutes and the staff ignored me. It wasn't busy, maybe eight customers in total, yet the bartender thought it would be a better idea to chat up the local barflies than even acknowledge that I was sitting right in front of her.  No worries, because it motivated me to travel over to the Boar and Wing at Kipling and Dundas for A-Plus service!"}
{"text":"I walked in, sat at my table for 30 minutes then decided to walk up to the bar because there were no one coming around to take my order. They were all behind the bar snacking on apps. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Yes it's a pub. Yes it serves beer and has UFC nights.  Service is good and friendly that you'd expect at a neighbourhood bar.  Funny thing is they seem to have a great kitchen.  I have had surprisingly delicious fettuccini Alfredo and chicken parm here and other dishes you wouldn't expect.  Regular stuff is always solid - wings crispy and flavours good.  Fries are Swiss chalet style not McDonald's.  anyhow as far as pubs go this one serves up solid food."}
{"text":"Love this bar, and the staff! Whenever I've come here, I've always been greeted with warm and friendly service! They never have trouble altering something from the menu to fix a craving (like making a buffalo chicken wrap instead of a chicken caeser wrap). They're super good at remember orders, and have never had a problem with splitting bills! Fantastic place, laid-back atmosphere and always a good time! Surprisingly their chicken vindaloo is quite tasty!"}
{"text":"It took an hour for them to take our order then another hour and 15 mins to get all the food out to our party of 12. This was mostly because there was only 1 waitress for 6 tables also the management is oblivious to customers' needs. Don't waist your money."}
{"text":"What could be more fantastic than to discover Traditional Irish Pub in Mississauga? Nothing!  Come in and try authentic Irish Chicken Fajita or better yet most popular Irish Spring Rolls with Curried House Dip, no no wait you must be dying for the ultimate Irish staple - the Maharajah's Chicken Vindaloo Curry! You get the picture....  Don't count on Irish stouts either, you won't find any.  Anyway, if you're looking for a pub with usual pub food that's oozing with oil and the one that includes dishes from all over the globe (except Ireland that is) prepared by \"True Irish Chef\"..this is the place to go. But I'll pass."}
{"text":"We came for dinner before a UFC night so it was pretty slow when we arrived. You seat yourself and staff comes and greets you shortly after. We were immediately asked for drinks and service for the night was very good and attentive.   Food was just ok. We ordered the spinach dip to start with fish and chips + chicken pot pie for entrees. The dip was good. Large portion, with lots of fried pitas to dip. Fish was just ok; nothing special. Pot pie wasn't exactly what I expected. I images a creamy pie but instead it was more dry with chicken and veggies and gravy on top. It was ok, don't get me wrong, just not what I expected.  Bill came to 43.45 for two people with one fountain pop. Not too bad pricing.   Will probably be back, but will try new menu items   Food 4/5 Service 5/5 Atmosphere 4/5  Value 4/5"}
{"text":"Me and a groups  of friends decided to hit up Scruffy's for beer, laughs and good food. I still maintain that this place has above average bar food but beware the special orders!  My friend ordered a steak with a side of bacon garlic mash potatoes  for $12 (to f'ing die for). After finishing my appetizer I decided I too wanted to partake in mash potato goodness and asked the waitress if she could get me a side order. She said she wasn't sure if that was possible but would check with the kitchen and get back to me. Five minutes later, she came back to say that the order was placed.  My side order was more like a mountain of potatoes in a bowl. There was so much there that I only ate half. When the bill came we all scratched our heads trying to figure out who had ordered a $10 poutine... apparently this was my side order of potatoes!!! $10 for potatoes!? The steak and potatoes were only $2 more! You would think the waitress would have mentioned something about the price if it was more than a reasonable under $5 (granted I didn't ask either!)   Oh well. Lesson learned I guess! I still love this place."}
