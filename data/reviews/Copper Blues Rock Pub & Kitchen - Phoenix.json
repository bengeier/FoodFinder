{"text":"This place was so much fun!  The band was absolutely amazing.  The ONLY reason they didn't get a 5th star, was because I asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing, and she said \"yes, the band is awesome and they move the tables out so people can dance.\"  The band WAS definitely amazing, but everyone kind of just stood there and my wife wanted to dance on her bday.  Other than that.... awesome!"}
{"text":"If you like music, bands, dancing this is for you.  If you like food and drinks, it is okay if you can get past poor service and staff that do not seem to like to work there.  We enjoyed for the music and dancing, so it was okay for us, but service really needs to be improved."}
{"text":"Copper Blues always has AWESOME music, live or just playing over the speakers, and the food matches! I've had excellent salads and wings, everything is prepared beautifully with seemingly fresh ingredients!! There is plenty of seating And I've never had trouble getting a seat...I love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good, place is super cool and trendy. Drinks are good but pricey. The happy hour is not at a convenient hour. But I still love the place."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about this bar/restaurant, my husband (G.) and I were a little wary, but saw little other choice since we were going to StandUp Live with a large group of people who were meeting at Copper Blues.

I am happy to say that we had a great experience at Copper Blues and that we have no complaints. Well, their prices are a little high, but we expected this based on the location. That is a minor quibble.

Although they were moderately busy when we arrived (4:30pm on a Friday), we were seated promptly in the bar area. It was very loud since there was a two-man band playing, but they were good so it wasn't a big deal. 

The beer selection was good... a little bit of everything. G. and I are both beer lovers so this made us happy campers.

I ordered the macaroni and cheese with bacon appetizer and G. ordered the hot wings. The macaroni and cheese was tasty... not the best I've ever had, but it was good and filling. My husband liked the wings although he said they weren't that hot. I tried one and I thought it was plenty hot, but I am a bit of a wuss so there you go.

Our server was excellent. She visited our table often enough to make sure we had drinks and didn't need anything, but not enough to be a bother. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. 

If we didn't live so far away, we'd probably visit again soon. If we go to StandUp Live again, we'll definitely stop in for beers and dinner beforehand."}
{"text":"My husband and I went before the show at Stand Up Live. The service was very slow, but the waitress was very nice. The Maria Maria Bloody Mary was great, but that's where the greatness stops. My husbands 1st beer was flat, the food was not at all impressive. We ordered the Cheese Bites, Filet Bites and Burger. The cheese bites had no flavor and it was like we were eating air, the filet was cooked like it was roast beef, served with a huge toping of horseradish, and the burger came with the smallest patty served on the biggest bun I'd ever seen. We asked for medium but received well done. We have heard great things about Copper Blues, but we left thinking it was way over rated. We will go back to see the bands and have some drinks, but we will be full before we get there."}
{"text":"I had been here once before and the food was pretty good and I love all the beers but the music was WAY too loud - couldn't hear my friends talk. I went there last night before a comedy show and there were many empty tables but after an hour of waiting I got just 1 beer and had to run down to 5 guys and scarf down a burger. So food and beers are good but service isn't."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, usually with friends, and once on a date with my boyfriend. I absolutely love the atmosphere! and the fact that their stage is on top/behind the bar, with a fence of on-tap beers. The waitresses are always very nice, and some of these girls definitely know their drinks and how to suggest something new for you to try based on what you already like. Every time I'm here, I love going for the shrimp pizza, or even their seriously world famous spinach dip! you will not be disappointed. Go in anytime they have live music going on! you're bound to have a great time here!"}
{"text":"We were there with a big group & they were so kind to accommodated us. 
Food was great & our bartender Peter made us amazing drinks when we didn't know what we wanted. Loved the atmosphere & the live band was really great."}
{"text":"One star given for the food because it was actually very nice but a pity the same can't be said for the male bar tender! He was extremely rude and unhelpful. We figured we may have looked too old for this place. Travelled here from Australia to see Bruce Springsteen and planned to spend a truck load of money here but we left and went elsewhere as we will be doing today as well!!"}
{"text":"Initial impression was that this place was awesome - a ton of tap bears, great music, a kind of stage behind the bar for the DJ, lots of people everywhere dancing and hanging out, and what looked like a pretty kick-ass outside bar.

Upon further review - this is just a haven for douche bags.  Andrea hit the nail on the head - totally Jersey Shore, although I think the people here were more Jersey Shore wannabes.  

I'll go back again in case it was just a weird night.  Who am I fooling, they do have some great beers - I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to come here for the live music! We have never had a bad time here. The servers are so fun and friendly, and really knowledgeable about their beer. My husband is kind of a \"beer snob\" and he loves their selections. The food is AHHHHHMAZING!!!! The pretzel bread and macaroni and cheese are delicious. I also just love the atmosphere, the club is really nicely decorated and just seems really upscale- but the prices are very reasonable!! It is a bit more expensive then other places I've been to, but those other places have crappy food and crappy service. You get what you pay for and couple of extra dollars on your bill is worth it for a great experience!!! I love this place and we will continue going there! It's also right next door to StandUp Live where they have comedy shows and that place is great too so its fun to make a night of them both."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices are great. Nice beer list for $3 or $4. Nachos were huge and delicious.

Do NOT order the pork belly tacos. Happy hour price is $9 and you get three tiny tacos with one small piece of pork belly on each. We had to order more food. 

Everything else - service, ambience - were awesome."}
{"text":"Just got escorted out because one of our friends was carrying a military ID. thanks for respecting those who keep our country safe."}
{"text":"Aside from their exaggerated number of brews on draft and one marvelous view of the city, not much else alleviates the whole experience of an unmemorable suburban-flop-house-meets-swanky-airport-bar that is Copper Blues."}
{"text":"What a great time! Everyone there was friendly and made sure we were taken care of. With an insane amount of beers on tap, you can't go wrong. A special shout out to Lindsey for introducing me to some new brews! Great bar and a great stand up show next door! Had a blast! Looking forward to heading back real soon!"}
{"text":"Fun Saturday night date night! The band was OK - played your typical \"drunkin bar sing along songs\" (like Don't Stop Believin' and Sweet Child O' Mine and Sweet Caroline) and since we drank, we sang. 

It's a cool downtown venue that actually gives you that urban big city vibe we lack here in Phoenix, which I always find strange since we are a big city! The waitresses were wonderful and cute, and there are LOTS of beers on tap so the hubster was happy, while I drank the Mojitos which were delicious and refreshing ona hot summer night! 

The crowd  is eclectic and mixed ages, and I would say a little more toward the \"trendy\" side but not like Scottsdale crowds, and definitely not many hipsters like you normally find in Downtown venues. Casual and cool.

We would go back for sure! It was fun, not too over priced, and bonus! We can take the light rail there!"}
{"text":"No chicken wings on the menu. Went there because they won best chicken wings in the valley and no chicken wings. Food was decent but everything came out cold. Nice atmosphere and ambiance is cool."}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun!! We had a large time at Copper Blues on Saturday night. The band Furious George, helped us usher in the first night of vacation. The music was rockin and the drinks were flowin! We sang well past our bedtime and had memories of tasty shots the next morning. Way fun!!"}
{"text":"Best nachos I've ever had in my life! Happy hour was a great time to go. Drinks are just eh, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"first and foremost, i was glad to see so many choices of beers which was the main reason my friends and i came. i wish they had more double or imperial ipa\"s which i love. we all had a great conversation with all the wait staff and bartenders. what most impressed me was how knowledgeable some of the girls were on the beers and their recommendations. i dont expect them to have tasted every beer so the 1.00 shooters are a great way to try different beers. the food we tried was really good, the burrata with almond honey and flatbread. we ran out of bread and had plenty burrata left and the staff was nice enough to bring us extra bread, no charge. nice touch, dont want to mention names but was very appreciated. very nice upscale bar decor and atmosphere without the attitude. local beers are featured and i suggest craft beer lovers give this place a try. things are looking up for dowtown cityscape and wish much success to copper blues!"}
{"text":"Came here a week ago with my future wife. Had some of the best service, beer, and food, thank you Latecia. I hope I spelled your name correctly. They have over 50 beers on tap and all of the bartenders were super nice and helpful. I love the live music on the inside. This was my first visit to Arizona, and I will definitely be back to this place, when I visit again. The manager was on point as well, walking around, making sure everything was running smoothly. Thanks again for the amazing experience here Latecia. Don't forget to visit Victoria and me, the next time you come to Bakersfield, CA"}
{"text":"Went to listen to free Tuesday night stand up. Shared the fig, goat cheese, honey and almond pizza which was amazing. House beer was very good, service was fantastic. Loved it all."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible.   Did I say horrible? Tried twice, I'm done.   $9.00 for a crappy well drink.  Are you kidding.  We waited 45 minutes for the check, should have walked, but Im better than that.
We kept getting bounced around due to \"oh, we're  sorry, this table is reserved\"  researved for who, the Queen of England?  The music was poor, the sound system was worse, the fooooood suuuuucked.  Eat before you come to get fleeced on your alcohol.   Bring ear plugs so you can avoid the noise they must call music.  Come on, do you really want to hear Jesse's Girl ever again in your life? Just dont go."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Copper Blues. Came on a Saturday night. The place was jammed packed with an older crowd. Mostly people in their 40s and 50s. The live band was amazing. The dance area is not big and if you are not careful you could step on someone's toes. The wait staff were attentive. Overall we had a great night and I would def visit again."}
{"text":"I've never been here at night but I came here for lunch today for the second time hoping the food and service would be better than last. Both were awful. Service is slow and food was not good at all. Not to mention its high priced for the food poor quality. I ordered the pork tacos today. They were awful and very Unenjoyable. The pork was fried. It was disgusting. Definitely would not recommend this place for the food or service."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Perfect for wknd night out. Great drinks good service and lively atmosphere"}
{"text":"Amazing downtown chill spot. For the veggie's out there, you MUST try their veggie sandwich, really fresh vegetables that aren't overly sauteed. Also, super addicting shoe string fries with sriracha ranch. Had a really relaxing time with friends. Chanely (hope I spelled that right), you're super sweet thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"GREAT entertainment (live band and DJ), but horrible service. Our server (short hair, black frame glasses, half sleeve) checked on us once and when we asked for a round of water, we had to get her attention 2 more times to ask for the same round of water, just for it to be forgotten. 

Another employee (was dressed in slacks and a blazer, probably a manager) was bussing a table next to us and we asked for a round of water. She said it would be no problem. She proceeded to walk by us as if that conversation never happened. We ended up going up to the bar to ask for waters and when we were back at our table the server came up and said \"oh you got your waters\" and told her we went to just grab them."}
{"text":"Amazzzing food, great beer selection, fantastic service and live music. What more could you ask for???"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night to here some music after a show we went to. Band was great and we had the loaded fries.. to die for!!! Fun place to go!"}
{"text":"Spent a good 4 hours or so here last night.  The band was probably the best entertainment I've ever experienced at CB.  They were absolutely amazing, I felt like I was at a concert.  FINALLY received the BEST service by Becca, she had a great attitude, full of smiles, she was very helpful and attentive, super cute blondie.  I will go back solely bc of this badass band and the possibility of working with Becca again :)
I was so happy because the service is never ever ever good here, honestly the place usually sucks and we constantly ask ourselves why we end up here...it sounds attractive when you consider location and entertainment, but its a total buzz kill when you show up, the severs usually take forever, they are always miserable, the bar is out of your top 3 beers, the food is cold and sucks, and you're probably a good $70 bucks out.
Hope you catch them on a really really good night, good luck!"}
{"text":"Good selection of beers.  Hummus was weird.  Onion dip and guac were better but not outstanding.  Why two stars?  Service was awful.  More than 10 minutes of servers walking past us and saying nothing until we stopped one that had walked passed us a handful of times.   We asked if we had a server and her reply was \"well i can be.\"  Thanks.  Hope we aren't puting you out. It was downhill from there.  Forgot order and incorrect check, no management.  Looks like the inmates run the prison.    0 stars for service, 4 for beer and ambience.  Better options downtown."}
{"text":"Fell in here on a Thursday night, they had live band Karaoke.  What a blast.
Great brew selection, try the pretzels, we had great service all night!"}

By The Rue

These guys aren't messing around, 
My new favorite bar downtown,
So many beers I want to pound,
Will leave you sleeping on the ground,
What a wonderful place to have found,
I like my beer to be dark brown,
My waitress recognized the sound,
Of my voice I was astound,
They will not except a Brittish pound, 
Elvis sings a song about a hound,

Micheal Madsen's little brother is in the band, 
Not really but they could go hand in hand, 
He looked just like him, a little more tanned,
In first grade my friend and I would eat sand,
To impress the chicks it tasted bland,
I wanted to touch their mammary gland, 
My kisses are magical no one can withstand,
Especially when I softly brush away that strand, 
Of hair in your face, I'm sure you planned,
To leave your underwear on the night stand. 

MERCURY!!!"}
{"text":"Live music. Great food.  Beautiful people.  Great atmosphere.  Awesome selection of beers.  Killer service thanks to Jenna.  A++

Downtown PHX is hit or miss...this place brings everybody in!!"}
{"text":"Always a winner! Great Fri n Sat night live bands! Like draft beer?? It's here!! Excellent menu selection. Friendly and healthy service!! ;)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot at CityScape and also great place to hang after work or in the evening! Huge tap beer selection, great cocktails and wine. Haven't been disappointed with the food either. Friends have had a variety of items but I love their flatbread pizzas. Went once at night for eats and drinks and to hear the live music. Great cover band was playing that night. At night it's definitely loud so it's not ideal if you're going with someone you want to talk with. But for hanging out, eating, drinking and hearing some good music it's definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"Officially our new hang out spot. We have been the last 3 Saturdays in a row! The atmosphere is great and we love the live music. Plus, 65+ beers on tap and great food! They also rotate the bands nicely...each Saturday (out of the last 3) they have had a different band. The one last night was great...never seen a lead singer play the drums before!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Really enjoy their happy hour, especially because its on the weekend too! It was perfect to stop by before a Suns game!"}
{"text":"This place was really awesome. Very fun and lively night scene. We went with a group from our business that was in town and it was PACKED in there. We were served by the cutest little waitress - I believe her name was Tesha. 

We were all served with a big smile and can do attitude. The food came out super quick and was tasty, huge portions. I ordered a short rib crust pizza which was really awesome, personally would have liked a little spice on it but otherwise the flavor was great. 

Fun environment, lively live entertainment that was really fun and just easy. Again the server did an amazing job. Great spot."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer selection, really bad service.  This place is in desperate need of an overhaul of its operations - especially at the lunch hour.  Copper Blues has become a ghost town during the Phoenix lunch hour while restaurants around it thrive.  Service simply takes too long for a typical business lunch.  Despite the lack of crowds, servers are inattentive, food takes forever to come out of the kitchen, and at times the entire staff seems to disappear into back rooms."}
{"text":"This place is so expensive for nothing special!  $8 for a rum and coke? Eff that. $15 for chicken tenders and fries?  They better be out of this world and they're not. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Loved Copper Blues! New to Arizona and was looking for a Bar/Grill type of place with good food, drinks and live Music. Black Bottom Lighters were playing that night so that alone was a plus. The atmosphere was perfect, busy but not too loud. Was still able to have good conversation with my fiancé.

We were really there for the music and beer but were pleasantly surprised with the food. We had the Steak Bites, Pretzels & beer sauce. Sooo ridiculously good for our finger food cravings that night!  Our waitress was nice and really knew her beer list. I recommend this spot to friends all the time!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional!  The beer selection was quite good as well.

The food was alright, nothing special, but we had appetizers only. 

We came for the entertainment and were quite disappointed.  Lee Perriera was supposed to perform from 7:30 to 10:30 but only performed until 8:45.  Thankfully we didn't have to pay a cover to get in."}
{"text":"Why, hello Copper Blues, it's nice to meet you! I joined a good friend of mine for the opening this past week and had pretty decent experience. Let's just dive right in shall we?

The Atmosphere: my friend and I were lucky enough to grab a booth in the bar, since it was literally standing room only. The booths are very comfortable cushion wise, however since the place was very very busy, it made it hard to get out of the booth once you got in the booth. It seems that the tables have been placed too close together to comfortably move about during peak dining hours. I'm only about 115 lbs and I had to excuse myself to the woman at the table next to me every time I wanted to get out from behind the table, not to mention climbing over purses etc due to proximity. The musician that was playing on stage provided a lighthearted atmosphere, with acoustics that didn't blow your eardrums out either. Nicely done. Also, I love the lighting scheme, and the views from the patio. 

The Food: For the opening event we were lucky enough to be able to try various samples of food. I loved the green pea guacamole, the filet bites and the mac and cheese of course. Since we only got to try the sample sizes, I found myself definitely wanting more. I cannot wait to go back and try a full plate! I ordered a glass of the house Cabernet and suffice it to say I think I'll get something else next time. The cab lacked the full bodied flavor I was looking for and actually tasted very sweet for some reason. Anyhow, that is shame on me for ordering wine in a beer-oriented place. 

The Servers: I found that the servers were all very nice, but hopefully over the coming weeks they work on their flow. Since Copper Blues is connected to Stand Up Live comedy theater, you can bet that every night prior to a show it IS going to be very busy just as it was for the opening. That being said, they did not offer the full menu or specialty cocktails for the opening, which will undoubtedly make the servers job more challenging on a busy night. The servers will need to work on their speed and organization if they are truly going to be able to keep the customers happy with their serving time. For the opening, I found that I had what I call a \"ninja\" server. I would order a drink, and just as I was getting to the point of \"Where in the heck did my server go to get my cocktail\", all of a sudden it would magically appear on the table and I would see the server walking away. Very nice server, seemed to be knowledgeable about the products, just a strange flow."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that I wish I could give negative stars to. I went there with 4 friends recently and they took my card to start a a tab and told us we can split them up at the end of the night. At the end of the night we asked for separate tabs and I got mine and everyone got theirs and we all paid with our cards. I ended up getting charged my tab and also a friends tab. My friends say they were all charged also.  I called and was hung up on once. They took the last 4 of my card and said they would fix it. A week later still not fixed and everyone puts me on hold. I have spent a lot of time disputing this with my credit card and they want me to ask my Friends for their card statements to fax in to them. I would rather just pay the charge than do that but it's messed up to be put in that position. Patron be wage! This place is shady. I hate this place and pray it goes out of business. Never will go there again."}
{"text":"I went here the night of the Garth Brooks concert. My gf and I had a total  3 vodka cocktails and 2 long islands and the tab was $54. Is this normal? 8 dollars for a cocktail? Why so high? We did not specify the liquor just assumed it was well, but damn! However, when asked about this on Yelp, the manager responded promptly, I appreciate that. Plus the service was good and the bartender was attentive despite how busy it was."}
{"text":"Erin and Tyler are the Bomb! This place has great service, food, Live bands, and an excellent selection of amazing beer. This is one of our favorite places. Oh, and they have a top tier comedy club too..."}
{"text":"Bud light. No locals allowed. Well maybe the VIP. This is not who we want in Phoenix. This is not what we've been fighting for."}
{"text":"Always a good time !  Best live music, lively and Upbeat atmosphere, mixed crowd of Twenty-Somethings to Fabulous Fifties type folk."}
{"text":"went to this bar with my wife and we each had 3 drinks and when we closed our tab with tip was $35.00, just looked at my bank account and they charged me 54.00, I called the manager and she looked it up and said that we were charged the wrong price for the drinks and it should of been $45.00 and at the end of the night any tab that is open they automatically add 20% tip to the tab and that is how it became $54.00.
i signed the receipt and put the tip on the receipt and closed it out before we left and if they charged me wrong that is their problem and they do not have the right to change it after i signed the receipt.

here is the kicker the same thing happen friends of ours a few months ago but we chalked it up to it was a mistake but now that it happened again, if ever we go back i will never use my card again and pay cash.

waiting to hear back from the manager to see what they are going to do."}
{"text":"I can only speak about the experience of Happy Hour. I was all about cheap drinks and a new experience and that is what I got. $1 beer shots during the 3-6pm Happy Hour allowed me to try several different beers that I would never have known about. They have a pretty extensive wall of beers. The bartenders (I went 2 days in a row) were friendly and knowledgeable. They gave me beer education and guided me on what beers to try based on my likes and dislikes."}
{"text":"We had the best time here!  Between the music, the service, and the good food, you can't go wrong.  The happy hour prices are great!  Lee Perreira was playing the night we were there and he was amazing on guitar and singing!  Great blues/rock vibe. We won't hesitate to go back again. This was our first visit, but definitely won't be our last!"}
{"text":"Came for the craft beer 60 or so on tap great selection, great atmosphere. The food was good try the spinach dip do the up charge for the pita bread definitely worth it. Server was very quick. Next football season you'll find me here."}
{"text":"We went to copper blues for a couple of beers and appetizers before a Suns game and then went back the next day for late night drinks and live music.  The atmosphere was fun. The bartenders and waitstaff were knowledgable and friendly. They have SO many beers and ciders on tap to choose from. The live music was an added bonus! Would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially from out of town."}
{"text":"Pork belly sliders..OMG! Yummy. Cool place, great music, awesome beer selection."}
{"text":"Visiting from SoCal and was told by the hotel concierge to come here. Walked in and was overwhelmed by the amount of beer choices there was. Sat at the outside bar and the bartender promptly greeted me and gave me a beer list. Not being familiar with 80% of the taps, I just asked her to give me a beer, her favorite beer. She asked me what my preferred style was and I told her something dark, but not too dark. She gave me a couple samples and I went with the SanTan Epicenter Amber ale! Amazing! I found it pleasant that she took the time to find me a beer that I would actually enjoy and not just giving me something she randomly picked. There were a couple bartenders, all so attentive and friendly, didn't catch their names, however. Will be back if I'm in downtown Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"If you're here for the beer and live music, you are in the right place! (Check in for a free beer sample, too!)

To be fair, I have not eaten food here and have been multiple times in the evening (9-10 PM), but I love the beer selection and, more than anything, the excellent bands they have on stage. 

Service is pretty good--waitresses are always friendly and don't mind if we hang out for a few hours with drinks (after all, that's kind of what the venue is hoping for, I'd think). Prices are average. Not super cheap, but not breaking the bank. 

The outdoor patio is also great if you want some fresh air--and they have another bar out there so you don't have to keep running inside if you want another round! All and all, a good time."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food, and awesome live music. I was going to give this place a 4 star but I took off one star because of the waitress that served my friends and I. She was really nice and friendly up until the end when we paid. Apparently 15% gratuity in cash was not enough. She scoffed at the tip which made me want to just take it all back but I didn't because she did serve us well. What a greedy b****."}
{"text":"I've been getting pretty beer-y for awhile now, and LOVING Copper Blues! With their ridiculous selection of beers on tap and $1 beer shots during happy hour, I am able to sample a wide variety of craft and local brews or a fancy and more whimsical (to me, haha) beer blend and not break my bank. 

I love the beer shots for sample tasting, and also for the reason that you don't have to be a decider, because I'm really not. Order 4 different brews and if you don't like one, it's only a buck and you don't have to disappointedly chug down  of a pint. 
The House Chips on the HH menu are freshly made kettle-style potato chips drizzled with hot sauce and cheese... I was skeptical but now I can't walk in without ordering them. I haven't actually dined here, just grazed during HH. Friends have liked the flatbread pizzas here, and it seems to be the consensus. 

All of the waitresses I have been served by are pretty good about suggesting a choice, or describing something on their menu, though you probably wouldn't guess it by looking at them. I swear I'm not being rude, it's just a nice surprise when a waif-like blonde girl with those dumb feather extensions has something of substance to say about a stout.

Also, their stage set-up for live music is awesome. It is directly behind all the taps at the indoor bar (or stage bar) and gives the whole room a great view of whoever is wailing. Plus, Vinyl Station plays here, so that's pretty much an instant 50 pt bonus.

For the most part, I love where downtown Phx is going with the whole CityScape thing. Copper Blues is now one of my go-to places for an after work drink or a weekend night out downtown. We actually got to try this place before they officially opened as they participated in the Spring Fling pub crawl even though their grand opening wasn't until the following weekend. The waitress gets bonus points since she successfully coerced one of my party members to try a local beer rather than the Coors Light he ordered, and he liked it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Went there before a comedy show at Stand Up Live.  Apparently, you get the hook up if you are going to a show.  We got a hand held seating buzzer for priority seating in the show room.  Nice!

The filet with horseradish app is delicious but the horseradish is on the weak side.  

Great beer selection and the waitress we had was great.  Very attentive.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A lot of beer on tap.
A lot of cover bands.
Not a lot of blues.
A lot of pretty bartenders with big...smiles
Not a lot of alcohol in the drinks.
Meh.
I prefer to get drunk and listen to music elsewhere."}
{"text":"A group of us came out here for a friend's birthday and had a great time! The drinks were fabulous, with a large variety of beers on tap. The bartenders were incredibly friendly. Mondays tend to be my weekends so I can't speak on how busy it gets but they have ample seating both indoor and out!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Copper Blues with some friends that were in from out of town and staying at the Kimpton hotel across the way.  I totally want to go back! 

The place had a great beer selection (for my buddy who was into beers), the service was prompt and friendly, and they had a live band.  It WAS loud, so conversation kind of went out the door. I liked the outdoor fire pit.

I'll definitely be back to check it out and will update the review then."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and had a mixed drink and the spinach dip. The dip was really good with sliced baguette slices but the mixed drink was weaker than something from a cheap bar. I watched the pour and it was barely a second and it cost me ten bucks. Complete ripoff."}
{"text":"Great food and band. Friendly service. Lots of beers on tap and open to see a lot of downtown. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Honestly.. How can you mess up a simple order of grilled cheese with bacon and give NO BACON.  The beer was nasty and bottom of the barrel, the 'tap was out' and then you proceed to give me a cold plate of COLD LIMP BACON to make up for the mistake. This is a MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT... I'll think twice before I come back.."}
{"text":"60 beers on tap... what else do i need to say? ok- ill say more.  They are on the second floor at Cityscape downtown and the bar has a enclosed patio area that overlooks the downtown area.  The inside bar has live bands, open mic, and jazz on different nights of the week.  More of an upscale bar that a business person goes to after work with friends i wouldnt categorize this as a \"night club\".  Again 60 beers on tap."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times, many times with out of state or country guests. At Copper Blues every time we have had a stellar experience, from the food to music to the workers each time it has been our pleasure. We would certainly recommend to guests of all styles and ages depending on the night, band, it is always a unique welcome experience ! Thank you Copper Blues for exceeding our expectations!"}
{"text":"Maybe I will visit here next on a karaoke night.

First of all the waitress was slow;had to wait for 20 minutes before drinks could arrive.The drinks finally arrived but late.The cheese pizza was  alright and filling.

I want to be sure before i decide this place is a no no for me.I will visit on a karaoke night-who knows........"}
{"text":"Live cover band, fantastic drinks and tasty sweet photo chips and other yummy appetizers in cast iron ware! So cute. This place is awesome for a Saturday night with friends. An array of beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"We live downtown and Copper Blues is our FAVORITE place!

We have visited many times over the last 3 years and we will keep coming back. Copper Blues always has a good band playing which makes for a lively atmosphere. They have a diverse menu with good prices, and the food has never disappointed us. All of this is brought together by fantastic, friendly, efficient service (we love Dre and we always try to sit in her section.)

Not many restaurants can be consistently wonderful, but Copper Blues downtown has proved itself over and over, which is why I gave it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I enjoy hanging at this place. It's a nice set up the music and live bands are always decent and there is plenty of seating but seems to always have a crowd.  The crowd tends to be late 20's- 40's professional non obnoxious types.  I don't feel like I'm gonna get hit on by some creeper or my purse will be robbed.  I've been on karaoke Thursday which is super fun and also on sat with just a live band no karaoke.  
My biggest grip is the service.  Our server was horrible.  We weren't sure if she was drunk/high/ or plain incompetent.  She would drop drinks off at our table- leave before we even had a chance to ask what/who's drinks were who's since we ordered from the cocktail menu.  We had no silverware and had to ask several times for napkins etc.   she never came by and asked if we were okay etc.  she took drinks away from the table without being finished , never checked if we were doing okay etc.  and we are not a high maintenance group of gals either. this is a trend I've been seeing lately- either people are being trained badly or they are allowed to get loaded on the job.  I would of given this place 5 stars but service really was lackluster.  It was at the point where we considered not leaving a tip.   Will be back cause I like the place but hope we get a decent waitress next time."}
{"text":"Formally our new hang out place. We've been the last 3 Saturdays in a row! The setting is great and we adore the live music. Plus, 65+ beers on tap and excellent food! In addition they rotate the groups nicely...each Saturday (out of the last 3) they've had a distinct group. The one last night was amazing...never seen a lead singer play the drums before!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center.  Fantastic place!  Unbelievable beer selection, great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience.  Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible lunch spot. Bad service, long waits, and really overpriced. $15 for a burger without fries, throw in fries and a drink and you're looking at a $25 lunch with tip. Just not a very good value but the ambience is nice. We went last week and waited 40 minutes for our food after we ordered and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Took a friend here for his birthday. In spite of it being very busy there able to accommodate my medium-size party of eight people find us a good place to sit, get us all of our appetizers and drinks out quickly, and provided excellent service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is nice on a weekend night. Parking can be a hassle, and drinks aren't always the cheapest, but its good to be able to choose from a full bar, and not just beer and wine. Depending on the night there will either be a live band or dj; both are nice and don't stray too far from the mainstream. What this means is the dj isn't gonna play some tracks that sound like cats farting into a microphone. Check out Copper Blues, especially if you're leaving a show at Stand Up Live."}
{"text":"Copper blues will be missed.  Moving back to the midwest and this was my favorite stomping ground especially during hh.  Great food, peeps and live music, cannot beat it!"}
{"text":"We have been to CB a lot and always had a great experience, but Saturday, August 26 was different. The waitress, Sabrina, was not attentive and seemed annoyed if we ever ordered another drink. We were all going to get another round when she decided we were done and brought our checks. It was then that we noticed that we did not receive the happy hour prices. Of course coming downtown for multiple events & knowing they have happy hour daily, we questioned her on why we didn't receive hh prices. They decided to try something new and not do Happy Hour during bigger events downtown. I spoke with the manager and told them as a long time fan of CB, this wasn't a great move. He was totally open to understanding and affirming he made the mistake. Other than that, every other time we have been, the beer is great, the food is great and the live music is awesome!"}
{"text":"Karaoke with a live band is pretty cool and the selection of beer is even better!  Happy hour prices aren't bad.  Make sure to sign up for the around the world challenge!"}
{"text":"Friday night, Phoenix, was excited about coming here. I agree with other reviews that the service is completely horrible. Food was good, beer selection was excellent. Band was good. But can't get over the fact the girls think they're more than they are. I'm not looking for anything much, but to get the horrible service from our girl Karen was complete ridiculous. She sat at the corner of the bar talking with the bartenders while she had tables that she should've been serving. She then came up and screwed up our check, rolled her eyes when she had to fix. I've worked in the business for a long time, it's not hard to do this job, so just do it please."}
{"text":"Copper blues has somewhere in the area of 60 beers on tap and live rock music a few nights of the week with a stage built right into the bar. It is a really cool addition to the downtown area. If the music gets to be too much you can hang out on the patio (which in phoenix at this time of year is where we should all be anyway). The chairs are slightly uncomfortable, and it was a little confusing to figure out whether or not I was in the line for the comedy show or trying to go have a beer on the way up, but once you navigate through the comedy club line it was solid from there on out."}
{"text":"Went in with my family and 4 friends last night. I come in here like once a year with a big group. Boyfriend bought himself one cider to drink and a champagne for myself. As we are sitting at table boyfriend spins bottle for fun with our other 3 friends. About two minutes later our waitress says she can't serve him anything else and offers water. Are you kidding me? I should have recorded this as he had no signs of \"too much.\" I was the one who already drank the champagne in the tiny bottle plus added it to my glass prior to the spinning. So with that, forget me bringing groups here again after dinner cause you ruined it."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is a great addition to downtown Phoenix restaurants and bars. With over 60 beers on tap and live music, this is a great place to hang out with friends. I tried the Mac n' cheese made with beer and recommend it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Went in with coworkers. Good vibe, decent band, and fun crowd.  Ordered a few appetizers; steak bites and wings.  Flavorless!  Ever salt chicken wings!  If you go here,  have a cocktail, listen to tunes, and skip the food!"}
{"text":"Here in town for a bit and found this place ... 
Great venue and live music !!
Waitress was great too!

2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is off the charts. Biggest glass of wine I've had for 3$. The atmosphere out on the patio was the coolest in Phoenix . Very hard to beat. Waitress was very helpful. Went on a Saturday night and had no problem getting as good table ."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome live music! Best  beer selection in phoenix and possibly all of Arizona! Just when I thought I tried all the beers on tap they added a ton of new ones to their huge selection! Most beers are 5 or 6 bucks for great craft beers!! (Which is pretty reasonable for a great beer I think!) AND happy hour 3-6 every day of the week! No where has happy hour on the weekends anymore, except this place! I always think people don't remember me when I go to a bar but the servers and bartenders here always come up and say hi they're so friendly it makes me feel comfortable every time I walk in there!"}
{"text":"This was our first time there. Place seemed nice until the end. We asked our waitress \"Sierra\" to validate our ticket at the end of the evening. She took it without hesitation. She said she would take care of it. When she didn't return with the ticket we asked her for it. She said we didn't give it to her. The manager said he had to believe her because she has been working there 4 years. We ended up having to pay a $27 parking fee because THEY lost our ticket. Very unprofessional and unbelievable outcome."}
{"text":"Extensive craft beer selection and good live music.  Highly recommend the Super Salad"}
{"text":"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend."}
{"text":"This was a fun bar to start the night after the Suns game. We had a few drinks, danced with the band, and enjoyed the live music! Remember to check in for the free beer shot to test out a beer of your choice! Great service and fun place!"}
{"text":"It's okay. A little over priced. Happy hour is okay. Nice patio. Music and service is hit or miss. Foods just okay."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very relaxed and welcoming vibe with a very appetizing menu. My girlfriend and I dined at this location during happy hour and we were welcomed by Anna who was our server. We ordered the steak nachos which seemed to be a well liked appetizer and it sure didn't disappoint. The nachos came out shortly after we ordered; about 10 minutes. The nachos were very delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly; although I wish the steak portion to nachos could've been more generous, I was still satisfied with the appetizer.  Anna was an outstanding server. She was very attentive and extremely courteous and professional. She was very thankful for our positive feedback about happy hour appetizer and overall restaurant experience. She was also the first waitress to ever state that she didn't mind being flagged down if we needed her. We definitely need more waitresses like her in the restaurant industry. Overall, we enjoyed our time and meal at this restaurant and will most definitely be returning as well as recommending this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"This place seems so cool when you first walk in. It's great for a drink but I wouldn't suggest ordering food. The bar service was fast and friendly. The table service, not so much. I ordered the house made chips to start. For my entree I ordered a Greek salad with no olives and grilled salmon. Twenty minutes later, the waitress returned to my table to tell me that the salad without the olives would be very plain, just greens. She made my original Greek salad order sound un-appetizing so I ordered one of the other salads on the menu. I'm not sure why not having olives in my salad would have ruined the entree? The other people in my party eventually received their food and finished it before I I had to call the waitress over and ask her what happened. She said something about the kitchen losing the ticket and that it should be right out. I waited a bit longer and called her over to cancel the order. My party was finished and ready to leave. I left without my food. Thank god I ordered the house made chips or I wouldn't have had any dinner. Horrible experience, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Beer selection was good. My biggest complaint here is the loud volume of the music."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. This place looked really cool,  so we decided to eat here for dinner.  One hour goes by,  and we did not get our food.  Our waitress only stopped by once to say our food was almost out,  but 20 minutes later,  we still didn't have our food.  Water was empty several times,  and no decency from the staff to let us know when or IF the food would ever be out.  Went across the court yard to an awesome pizza place called pizza studio.  Great pizza!"}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the expansive beer selection on tap. I don't disagree and for that reason recommend Copper Blues as a go-to happy hour joint.

On top of that, I think the live music on Friday and Saturday nights at Copper Blues is the most underrated in the entire Phoenix area. While other locales - Crescent Ballroom comes to mind - attract both big names and indie rock to downtown Phoenix, the group that plays on weekend nights covers all the songs you love to hear. Since they aren't original in that sense, it becomes easier to overlook. That being said, these guys can hit all the notes and perform with an energy that makes you forget you're watching a middle age cover band. It's impossible not to have fun listening to timeless hits."}
{"text":"Beer selection, location and service is excellent!  Food is alright but don't overlook for that alone."}
{"text":"What a great location and love the live band! Copper Blues is a great spot to eat or if you just want to grab drinks and enjoy the music. Drinks were delicious and service was amazing! Order the nachos and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!! Great happy hour too! We arrived at 5:40pm and the HH ended at 6pm. Our waitress put in a double drink order for the HH price and brought our drinks over as we finished each one. She also did the same with our food order. My mom ended up spilling some of the chipotle sauce on her white pants and our waitress took notice and ran to get some club soda. I was out of water and before I could ask for more, there she was with a fresh glass.  Love this place :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Copper Blues since it opened and I've never had a bad experience there. They always have a great selection of beers on tap to choose from and every time I've gone, there has been an upbeat live band playing. I tend to sit away from the stage because it can get pretty noisy and hard to hear those in your party. The waitresses have always been attentive and helpful when suggesting new beers to try as well. I've never ordered food from Copper Blues but I always see several rounds of their giant nachos being brought to tables. (I'm assuming this is a favorite for many)
My visit on 2/7/15 was no different then what I have summarized above. There was a fun band playing and although the place was full we were able to find a table in the corner. Our waitress was sweet and always made sure our water and beer glasses were full. If you're looking for a place to sit back and enjoy some delicious beer and upbeat music then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"went for apps & drinks before the symphony.Lots of great beers to choose from. Beer Mac & Cheese with bacon incredible enough for 2. Staff was friendly & service great"}
{"text":"Nice place with mid age crowd. Very good band tonight playing 80's Rock & Roll. Pizza and nachos were tasty, good drinks and large selection of beer.  Outside section with fans and inside where band plays is air conditioned. Would definitely try again for light dinner, drinks with friends, and if you want music."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Copper Blues for my sisters 50th Birthday Party a week ago.  The live music was awesome and they did something I hadn't seen before, they had their karaoke \"regulars\" come onstage with the band and belt out some tunes, and they were perfect!  Drinks prices are average, $6 for a draft beer and the service was reasonably quick for what appeared to be a full house on a Friday night.

We did have some billing issues but they were handled quickly and professionally.  My wife and I travel to Phoenix a couple of times a year and when we come back next time, we will be going to Copper Blues!"}
{"text":"What a great place.

I had the strawberry chicken salad which was pretty decent.

My friend had the steak bites (which look great although I didn't try them) and the fries (which were really good).

They have a great beer section. I had the strawberry blond which tasted like Flintstone vitamins.

The best part was the gorgeous, awesome and friendly waitress Cassie. 

I'll go back for sure and am planning to try the steak bites.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Had my hopes up! Hotel concierge highly recommended Copper Blues. We walked in and I was extremely happy to see all the brews on tap. 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 25 minutes and no server even looked our way. I asked the hostess to please send someone our way. 10 minutes later... No one! We decided to head out, very disappointed. As we walked out I mentioned to the hostess that it was sad that we sat for over 30 minutes and no server gave us the time of day, even after I asked her to please send someone over to take our order. She smirked and blew me off. ZERO stars in my opinion, but they got 1 for the band."}
{"text":"I spent the summer working in Phoenix, and while I was there this was by far my favorite place to have a beer and hang out. There seems to always be live music and tons of beers on tap. They've got some good happy hour prices too. Also, go for live band karaoke on Thursday nights, it's a blast."}
{"text":"Not a very well run establishment. Came here twice and won't be back.  The service was less than mediocre. I had left something behind on my last visit, went back for it, was told they didn't have it but I left my number just incase it came up. I got a call in the middle of the night from someone's cell later that night telling me they found it. Then I got a few butt-dials from the same person around 3 am! Not very professional.  And when I went back days later to pick it up, was told they didn't have it. No apology, no explanation- nothing. I asked for manager & told her what happened and even gave her number of the employee that had called me. Manager never even got back to me. What a joke."}
{"text":"Friday night out with a friend, got a couple cocktails in, shared a plate of nachos, and listened to live music. It wasn't crazy packed, but then again we got there at 7 and left at 8:30 so I'm sure we beat the crowd. Good spot for a casual hangout in downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"Upstairs to a great happy hour. They have a happy hour band at least when I was there. Strong selection of beers on tap and some great apps. I had the steak bites and was not disappointed as they were nicely done and not overcooked"}
{"text":"I joined some of my peeps here the other night for drinks.  

I didn't really know what to expect, given that I'd not heard anything about this spot.  It was a Friday night, so it was pretty packed and super freaking loud.  No bigs.  They have TONS of beers, most of which (or maybe almost all?) were craft and/or local brews.  Score!  

I ordered a pint of Left Hand Milk Stout, which was the best one I've ever had.  The look is cool/casual.  There are two bars: one when you first walk in and one that the band plays behind.  

The music left something to be desired, but that could just be because I'm a music snob.  It was a cover band that seemed to be Maroon 5-ish (whom I loathe).  That's not to say they didn't do a good job singing and playing, just not my kind of jams.  

The service was decent, didn't really interact with the staff much.  I'd definitely go back on a week night to check out the vibe."}
{"text":"The wings and fries were good. The sound system was so loud we could barely hear the bands words. Our waitress was pretty much MIA so that was not good. I'll probably pass on this place next time."}
{"text":"I really like the beer selection and specials they offer.  The new menu looks great too.  The only problem is that they're always out of every good seasonal beer on the menu.  Went here tonight and they were out of six we tried ordering.  10% of what they claim to offer.  Service is always really slow.  Takes 20 mins to get your check or order a second beer.  Hopefully yard house or a chain piano bar won't take it over as I like having local businesses in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped and ate at Copper Blues, had a burger and a beer. Burger was nice and big worth  the $12.00. Beer was nice and cold. The chips that came with burger were ok. 
I would go again."}
{"text":"You can always count on a fun cover band on the weekends at Copper Blues! They have a great selection of draft beer, and with food being available late, it makes it a great start to an evening out in downtown.

The main couple reasons for missing 5 stars: customer service is mediocre, and finding seating is terrible. With so many standing, and so many sitting with chairs and tables in the way, it's hard to get to the bar, and get noticed, in order to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Staff is helpful & plentiful. Never have to wait too long for cocktails in the bar. Still haven't tried the food or a show but definitely will."}
{"text":"This place has really stepped up their game over the past few years. The food is delicious and the service is wonderful. Love the new renovation and the live music every night."}
{"text":"Copper Blues... Where they serve Moscow Mules (traditionally served in a copper mug) in this cup.... They also served our beers in plastic glasses-- The adult equivalent of a sippy cup. Disgrace."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great but our food and drinks were TERRIBLE! my margarita tasted like lemonade I how stay don't think she put any tequila in it. The spinach and artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese, bland boring nothingness cream cheese and it only came with 6 chips. How am I supposed to eat a bowl of dip with only 6 chips? My husband got a sandwich which looked like it was thrown together. The so called \"chips\" were DISGUSTING. I'm pretty sure they used an entire bottle of season salt. Terrible and way over priced. We will only return for their selection of beer."}
{"text":"Two stars, but only because the food was good (when we finally got it). We went on the 4th to grab a few drinks and apps before the Diamonbacks game. The place was crowded, but we found a table right away. Our server was initially attentive, getting us water and taking our drink orders. It was happy hour (on a Saturday afternoon - bonus!) so AZ beers were $3 and appetizers were a few bucks off. We quickly placed our order for the chicken drumsticks and scotch egg, then later decided too add filet bites and Brussels sprouts. 

About 30 minutes later, the chicken drumsticks came out. Quite a bit of a wait for chicken, but they were busy and the chicken was tasty so we were happy. Now about 45 minutes into our dining experience, the filet bites came out. No biggie, we added them after our initial order. They were good - nothing to write home about, but good. 

As we conversed, listened to the live music, and drank our beers, I politely asked our server if our other snacks were coming. \"The kitchen is really backed up, but I'll check on them,\" she said. Meanwhile, tables who arrived after we did were finishing full meals. Our server had clearly forgotten the rest of our order and was quick to pass the blame. 

Now about 70 minutes into our visit, out come the Brussels sprouts. Meh. I make them better at home. Plus the balsamic and butternut squash with the char of the sprouts and parmesan was just a weird combination. 

Now we need to hurry it up and bear the nasty heat to make it to the game on time. Thinking I could flag our server down to remove the scotch egg from our bill, she was of course no where to be found. We are now about 90 minutes into our visit and out comes the golden, err, scotch egg. Delicious! We scarfed it down and were able to get our check (finally). When it came, however, our server had charged us full price for the sprouts and egg. Another clear indication that she forgot them. 

Bill is settled, we are on our way, and now are late for the game. We missed the first inning AND the national anthem on the Fourth of July! 

I know this is a long review to say we had shitty service, but I did want to point out the positive notes. In summary, nearly 2 hours to get some beers and appetizers without dilly dallying with our orders is a little excessive. I get it when things are hopping and busy, but having your server lie to you about dropping the ball on your order and then overcharging you while trying to pass it off is totally UNACCEPTABLE. I won't be back to dine before any sporting events or comedy shows. There are too many other restaurants with good service that are more deserving of my hard earned dough."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. 50 plus beers on tap, can beat that. The food was really good. We had filet bites, Brussels sprouts and fried chicken sandwich. Foley bites were awesome with cilantro pesto and Bloody Mary sauce. Brussels sprouts were delish. Chicken sand was topped with cheddar and ham and mustard. We will be back."}
{"text":"I heard this place is really fun at night with the live music -- haven't done that yet. Went after work for happy hour on a Thursday, and it was super chill with a great beer selection and awesome cheese bread for an appetizer. If you are a hummus lover, don't get it here...it's not that good. I got the Papago Orange Blossom beer, and it was awesome! Service is better than I expected too."}
{"text":"Was here late thought it was gonna be bad but it was great food and the service was on point our server was nice and on top of everything. 
Couldn't have asked for a better experience. 
Will def be back when in town."}
{"text":"We liked it so much we came back a second time during our week stay. The first time was a crowded weekend night, music playing, heat warmers going. We ordered the pretzel sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, and hummus appetizers to share among the 4 of us (about $8 each for splitting the bill). Probably THE best spinach and artichoke dip I have ever tasted. I began dipping the pretzel sticks in it and even the carrots that came with the hummus. The second time was a week night, not as crowded. I'm not much of a beer drinker, or much of a drinker in general. So, it took me forever to decide what to get. Our server was very patient with us and kept bringing out different samples for me to try. Ciders, stouts, and fat tires were had by all. I think one of my favorites was the pear cider they had at the time- smooth and filled with an almost cinnamon/vanilla flavor. We had a great time and most certainly would've been back a 3rd time had our week not been so short."}
{"text":"Pretty great location.  Band was good, I think they were called 9-ball.  Great draft beer selection.  Really cool stage/bar setup.  Service was good.  Quick pours.  Losing a star because if you go off of the beer list things fall off  quickly.  Margarita was just plain bad, straight out of a premodern mix.  If it's going to be that bad just don't offer mixed drinks."}
{"text":"So, I just have to start with what an amazing place and staff! We came in Saturday night and had a wonderful experience with our exceptionally tall server Michelle, a delightfully well versed lady who engaged us immediately and thoroughly. The selection of beers is immense and we worked our way through quite a few finally settling on the Oberon and Seadog Blueberry as our favorites. The live music is a great touch, downtown has been needing a live music venue forever! The decor is gorgeous and the staff is attractive, but friendly, - all of them too!
We'll definetly be back to Copper Blues, we were shown the Happy Hour menu and it tickles us to see so many food items on it! We didn't try any food but look forward to trying filet bites and the cuban, they come highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came in for a casual thirsty Thursday happy hour and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Ashley (in the garden bar) helped us choose our next rounds of been and was happy to share tastes of beer she thought we would like. Excellent spot to enjoy a wide selection of beer and the beautiful Arizona spring weather! Also had some good food including the bbq chicken pizza and dip duo. One of the managers Rachael was an absolute delight! Will definitely be coming back to try some more beer recommendations!"}
{"text":"Okay the place itself is awesome and I'd give the building five stars... Where it goes downhill for me is the staff. When a few classmates and I  came for a few drinks after class we arrived and sat down at the bar. We ordered a few beers and then had to move to a bigger table to accommodate more people who were coming to join us. After we moved to a table close to the bar just big enough to accommodate all the members in our party a server came up to us and informed us that we were siting in \"HIS SECTION\" and he seemed annoyed to even be there. He continued to look at our table and roll his eyes at our already order drinks. Okay sir I totally understand the annoyance of guests moving around to different tables but in no case is it appropriate to give your customers attitude about moving to accommodate for a larger group of people especially on a slow night when there's plenty of tables open. Our rude server didn't come back over for at least 30 min so we continued to order food and other drinks from the bartender. When he finally came back, we had just received our nachos and more beer and once again he rolled his eyes scoffed and walked away.  We didn't seem him for the rest of the night which was fine by me.

I must say the girl behind the bar was very knowledgeable but she also wasn't too pleasant. The employees seemed to be friendly to one another and cracking jokes but as soon as they were talking to a customer it seemed like a flip was switched and they were now annoyed. I asked a few people that had been in before of what their experience was like they all said they had been in for dinner on a non-music night and the service was awful. Those who had been in during a show said they had a great time and the service was decent. 

I must say that this location would be awesome for a music venue which it is... So maybe ill be back for a show but I will not be back for dinner on an off night."}
{"text":"Havent eaten here, but they got a good happy hour and I like the live music. My friends all said food was good, so we'll go with that. Service is hit and miss, but its bar/restaureant that parades as a nightish club after like 9pm. PROBLEM - summertime they keep those big giant windows open and well, its hot. . . .and of course, the parking. Other than that, its a fun place to go with friends to hang out. Love there's no cover charge or drama at the door, just go in and have a good time!"}
{"text":"This place has potential - 60 beers on tap, live music, cocktails and food! I like the fact that there was no cover charge and that the food and drinks are reasonably priced.  The stage is set up in a pretty awesome way - behind all the beers. 

With all the great things going for it, a few things felt off...for starters, the band playing was not the band listed on their website.  It wasn't even a bluesy band - just some rock cover band! I was wanting to kick back with some blues that evening, but instead got a cover of \"Your Sex is on Fire.\" 

Also, what is up with the pea guacamole??! There is NO avocado in it (literally, its not just me being picky) - it is just mashed up peas with onions and garlic and lime.  I think that qualifies as a yummy pea DIP, but with guac, you need some avocado!"}
{"text":"Got to check out the cool bar that is Copper Blues. They've got something like 60 beers on tap and live music! The bar itself is just a nice bar, great place to have a beer. The windows overlooking city scape actually pull down so you can have a cold beer al fresco. The staff was friendly and the drinks were well priced (I think $6 for most beers). The only drawback I had was I ordered a mixed beer that was supposed to be blue moon and milk stout but they couldn't get the milk stout to work, so they just substituted Guinness for it. I still drank it, but would have liked them to ask if I minded. Not a huge deal, just a bit presumptuous. Overall cool place to have a beer, nice addition to Cityscape."}
{"text":"We came here after the Cubs game on a Saturday night. The band was incredible and very high energy. We didnt have any issues getting our drinks even though the place was packed, but we had seats right at the bar. We got lucky. Cant wait to come here again with friends. The only warning is the drinks are not very cheap....to be expected from this type of place in its location. (We paid 10 bucks a pop for vodka sodas with titos) Very fun time!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but is it me or all the dam server here is rude !!! Maybe this is not the job for them !!!! First of all the server never came back with my change. I was waiting for her to come back with my change so I can give her a tip... Guess she didn't want her tip ... To bad for her  !!! My friend and I order some food they never gave us any napkin or ask if we need anything else... I know it can get really busy in the place but a little care would be great... Anyways my friend decide to ask for some napkin from the same server she got so piss off and went to the bar start to mouth of to one of her worker ... Hmm excuse me we can see and hear you miss...Rude!! She was piss off because we didn't give her a tip... Not my fault you didn't come back with my change  don't assume the change is your tip... If you would had came  back with the change you would had got a bigger tip...  over all the food is good beside the rudeness !! The 3 start for the food !!!"}
{"text":"I always love the music and atmosphere of this plave and their beer  is incredible but i have yet go here and new helped within the first 30 minutes of sitting down.  Every time someone comes over after about a half hour and says \"have you been helped?\" Which confuses me because they send over another person after that.  Aren't there sections with specific wait staff working them? Basically,  the food, drink and atmosphere are great but the staff needs to get it together.

Go ahead and order as much as your can when you finally flag your waitress down."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, I'm not coming back for a while.

Last time we were there, it was cold out. They had 3 or 4 propane heaters, all out of propane. We got sat next to the window (more of a hole, there's no glass). Needless to say we were freezing the entire time. Our food got cold instantly. No one seemed to care. We had to start waving down the bartender to get us wait staff.

I used to like this place, but after that terrible experience and how little they gave a shit I will find a better place to drink at. I suppose what they do fits for that area. The comedy club next store is a rip off and I'll never be going back there either."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! The bar and wait staff were attentive and friendly despite the huge Saturday night crowd. The band was phenomenal! I'll be making the trek from Scottsdale to enjoy this establishment very soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Copper Blues before a Suns game. We were immediately greeted by our waitress who took our drink orders. We are craft beer people and their selections do not disappoint. Our drinks came quickly and as ordered. The place started to filled up but our waitress was still very attentive. We ordered the quesadilla off the happy hour menu and split the turkey club. Both were delish! Their sandwiches come with thick-cut kettle chips and fries cost $2.00 more but the chips were plentiful and tasty. Tip: Their happy hour is until 6pm each night, so be sure to get their early for great drink and food specials."}
{"text":"The stars are mostly because Cooper blues is the rare place to have live music any night of the week in downtown Phoenix. And the reason for not being a 4 or 5 stars rating is the price of the menu; I understand that it is a downtown bar and it is pricey but $9 for a short cheap whisky ( Jim bean ) and coke is very excessive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love love cooper blues. Huge huge selection of beer on tap. Always live music. Views are great. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Food: The food I have had here was fantastic! I was here just the other night and had the shrimp pizza. It was delicious! Great pizza dough and high quality ingredients. I had never come to Copper Blues before for the food but I was very pleasantly surprised to see that they actually had a very extensive food menu and the kitchen is open LATE! I will have to come back here in the future to try more of their food. I have also tried the fries with ketchup and sriracha ranch sauce. These were killer!

Service: I was disappointed to see so many Yelpers who have had terrible costumer service here. Every time I have been here the staff has been nothing but helpful and accommodating. The bar is always packed, no matter which of the three you are at, but I seem to always be served in a timely manner. Last time I was here I had placed an order for pizza and then almost immediately changed my mind on what toppings I wanted and as soon as I told the waitress she ran to go change the order. She was awesome! I wish I would have gotten her name so I could give her a shout out. I also really appreciate the staff's commitment to the themed parties that are held here. I have been around several times when everyone on staff is dressed in costume to go along with the night's party theme. The entire bar is also very well staffed. bartenders and waiters everywhere to help serve you.

Atmosphere: On friday night this place is rocking! There are always tons of people that come out to chill and watch the live music on that iconic stage behind the bar. Copper Blues also has a pretty awesome selection of beers on draft for you to choose from. Anyone can come here and have a good time!"}
{"text":"I was here for my friend's bachelorette party and they were the best! Server was awesome and the manager helped get my friend and on stage. Going to be back!!"}
{"text":"Copper Blues was one of the last spots I went to while out in Phoenix. Cool lounge area to kick it with some friends on a nice night out. Good looking bartenders, nice drink selection and live music....very spacious as well as I've noticed a lot in quite a few Phoenix spots. Definitely a plus for them. Another place I would go again too my next go around in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff that accommodated a group with over 25 people! Even during busy dinner hours and during live music (which was amazing!). 
I recommend the warm pretzel sticks, and the chicken nachos (which are huge, FYI! Make sure you have a few people to chow this down!)
Awesome beer selections and great vibes."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is a GREAT spot for fun entertainment and delicious food, in Downtown Phoenix. I went last Saturday night and it was packed! 

There was live music and fast service. The spinach artichoke dip is fantastic & the pizza is good too! 

I ordered a cocktail, but I know Copper Blues is known for their beers. If you're in the area, I would absolutely recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for lunch with a vendor.  I have never heard of this place before yesterday.  The hamburger was OK.  There menu was small because they are revamping it.  I liked the chips served with the burger too.  I would have preferred salt instead of the spice that was added.  They were good though.  I will give this place another try when they get their menu up to speed.   The do validate parking it looked like too."}
{"text":"Overall everything was very pricy but the cheese pizza and fries were delicious. We split this meal of champions between three people and it filled us up nicely. 
Well drinks start at $9 for a very tiny glass. 
Happy hour is 3-6 and the prices for food and alcohol go down significantly. 
Our server was very friendly and even our food runner started up a good conversation with us. 

Yelp check in-free beer shot of any beer you want! They accidentally poured mine as a 12oz instead of 3oz but hey I'm not complaining since they didn't charge me. 

I would come back here if I was in downtown phoenix, but definitely only if it was happy hour."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! The chicken nachos are huge!! Definitely meant for 2-4 people. We will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly fun. My girlfriend and I love exploring new bars when we go somewhere new, but since she is currently pregnant, I try to find places with Live music to keep her entertained while I have a few beers for the both of us. The band that was playing was pretty fun that night, the crowd was very mixed but they all looked to be having a great time. We didn't order any food so I ordered beer from the bar when i ran out. Over all this place was a good time."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beers on tap. But notably for me, they don't have the \"favorite\" ones. They have New Belgium's 1554, but not Fat Tire? O'Dell Brewing 90 Schilling but not the Red Ale? Dos Equis lager but not Amber? (Well maybe 90 Schilling is everyone else's favorite and the Red Ale is just mine.. but no Fat Tire?) Lucky for me though, Kiltlifter is on tap so I am happy. 

Happy hour is $3 drafts and $4 crafts. I still haven't figured out who wants/orders a beer shot and why this is available. 

The food is just ok. Ordered the trio of dips - beer cheese, guac and salsa. I would just say it's so-so. Not amazing, not bad - but pretty expensive at $11 for what you get. I would skip it for the price. 

The Mediterranean chicken sandwich is just ok - the bread is dry and the chicken is sparse. I wouldn't order it again.

This place gets packed on the weekends. Expect long waits at the bathrooms - partially because there are that many people there, and partially because you can't tell which stalls are filled and which aren't. 

They have live music on the weekends - which is pretty darn good cover bands. It's a fun atmosphere and the only reason I would dock it down is because the service can be sparse. Also - parking downtown just generally is not awesome. I found that the best place to go is on Washington between 3rd and 4th ave and just walk."}
{"text":"Great live music but worst Mac & Cheese I ever had. Old, dried out macaroni and the cheese was basically just grated parmesan on top. For $10 (!!). Service is not the fastest either."}
{"text":"This is the place to be in Phoenix tonight.  We were taking a walk (to get our 10,000 steps; after watching Greg Stanton speak): we heard the singing voice of RYAN Sims.  We had to go see who?  We stayed and enjoyed. I'm a believer and now a disciple of a the RYAN Sims band."}
{"text":"Copper Blues has been one of my go-to spots when bar hopping around downtown. Not always in the mood for live bands but I can enjoy it when I'm sitting out on the patio. The tap selection like most have said is absolutely ridiculous. Is it bad that I usually stick to the same 3-4 beers though? Not to mention, the $3 or $4 (can't remember the price) brown bag special where they pick any can, maybe bottled, beer they are looking to get rid of. So many options! Lastly, I want to give a big shout out to our server, Ashley (the one with the black dahlia tat (AWESOME!)) for being a great host while we're there. She knows her beer and usually picks out a good one for me if I'm in for one of her choice. Thank you!! 

Just a great place to sit down and have a great beer."}
{"text":"Overall the place was a pretty good establishment but there were a few things that take it down a few notches in my opinion:

1. The band (The Instant Classics) - while they were pretty decent they kept calling attention to the fact that they were doing more and more shots.  I'm sure that this was to encourage patrons to drink but it was pretty noticeable that they were getting a bit out of hand with their booze.  

2. The crowd - obviously the bar and band can't do much about this but when people yell \"freebird\" after every song, the band makes fun of them, it only encourages it to continue and takes away from the music.

3.  The service - I understand that any time you have live music or a club scene, its going to be loud and thus hard for servers to hear.  That being said, when you ask for a water and they bring you a Pumpkin Beer and then charge you for it, that's just bad service.  On top of that when asking for my bill (included my girlfriend, the others in the group weren't ready to leave yet), the first time the server brought me a bill that was completely incorrect, as in not one of the drinks was one that my girlfriend or I had.  The second trip she brought every ones bill EXCEPT for mine.  Apparently the third time was the charm (although it did have a beer on there that wasn't ours which the server acknowledged and removed before running the card).

Lastly, I am not a huge fan of the lack of parking downtown.  They treat downtown Phoenix as if it were San Diego or Chicago with the parking in that its all garages and any little event going on down there gives garages the balls to charge $12 for parking.

Overall the music was good, drinks were decent and okay on price, service left a lot to be desired and the location (downtown) isn't my favorite."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to hang out and drink but the very best part is the way they've designed the place.  If you sit out in the main front bar area you get an amazing view of downtown Phoenix.  The walls are nothing but windows and all you see are just layers of buildings- no sky whatsoever.  It's how I image new York city or Chicago might look.  I don't know, it's pretty cool for Phoenix.  and yeah, the food is good but small, so don't come here to \"operate.\""}
{"text":"Great selection of beers The amateur comedy is always good sometimes funny other times a dud but good non the less... Then the night gets rockin with live music"}
{"text":"Food was great, but Sonia was an amazing waitress! Make sure you ask for her if you come here!"}
{"text":"I would say this place is \"eh\".  Actually I tried to get my co-workers to leave after a few rounds but they seem to like to stay put whereas I would rather bounce around.  Biggest complaint...inconsistency.  My first waitress brought by Vodka Tonic with a nice little glass full of lemon and lime slices and the second waitress didn't.  Not a big deal, but you should get the same service from everyone.  The waitresses wear little tiny vests with not shirt underneath and their breasts popping out; so if that is your thing, you may like it hear (the men with me certainly did).  There was live music at 9:30 but it was advertised for 5:30 which is what we planned for so that was a bummer.  The pretzel appetizer was good, pizza was ok at best.  Overall, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ashley, the bartender, seriously took the time to give us great service. She's the best! Not something I've gotten a lot of other places"}
{"text":"Five stars for LIVE Karaoke!!!...the song selection is limited but really good!...they really make you look like a rock star even if you can't sing!!...lol...they will carry you, don't worry!!...really fun spot!...great drink selection...we had a great time!!...ROCK ON!!!..."}
{"text":"SO I was downtown taking pictures of \"First Friday\", then attended a meeting for #OccupyPhoenix. After I figured before I hop onto the light rail back to my vehicle I'd stop in here for a beer, a fellow co-worker recommended this place to me.  
When you walk in, there are about 60-70 bers on top, VERY attractive to a \"beer connoisseur\" as myself. I ended up just happening to talk to the bartender \"gabby\" who actually I know from my side of town, (the north west side of town). I did not eat here, just had a few different IPA's and watched 2 bands played, very decent place if you're downtown."}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal place for karaoke - real band with karaoke singers - what an experience - some of the singers were mind blowing"}
{"text":"I couldn't imagine showing up on a busier night... The night of the Eric church concert! The manager Casey gave us service like we were the only people there. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Can I give them a negative 4? Worst staff. Worst food. Worst management. Horrible all around. I have never in my life been treated the way I was treated tonight. I am embarrassed for \"Copper Blues\". Wow. I will never go there again. Ever. Wow."}
{"text":"Great place! Happy hour is very well priced, staff is cool, live band was great. Very open and spacious!"}
{"text":"Layed back bar with good food and great drinks! The atmosphere is smooth and chill.  Just drank a beer and some liquor. The waitress (Anna @ 11pm on 11/30/16) did an amazing job. She deserves a raise, she really made our experience worthwhile with her amazing service skills. The band was freaking awesome with the live music.  I liked my visit and will be coming back.  This place won't break the bank and will have you feeling nice real quick. Good service and positive vibes. Best place to go to after a Suns game regardless of whether they win or lose.  Love this place. Left Coast Asylum is a great beer that will get you wasted with almost 12% alcohol for 8 bucks."}
{"text":"A TON of Draft Brews and Amazing live music!!  Always a great time and great service!"}
{"text":"I'm from Denver and I am not loving it, maybe because it's a holiday and no one is here, but this place totally won me over. It's empty but everyone here is nice, and Linz is fantastic. I am a beer nerd and she hit it out out of the park on the first try. Incredible selection, fun people, and good music (sublime, incubus, and rockin the casbah in the first hour)."}
{"text":"My very first bar in Phoenix and I liked it a lot! 

Bites: Kimchi pork taco **not real kimchi**; the pork is super tender and juicy! Pita and hummus dip - the green one is especially good. Quesidilla was good too. 
Drinks - Four peak kilt lifter is a highly recommended drink if you like red amber. I couldn't finish the Four peak peach (yuck!)."}
{"text":"If I ever find myself back in Phoenix, I would totally come back here.  Awesome live music that kept the dance party going on for hours!"}
{"text":"I picked a bad night to go out as every place was an hour plus wait to get in.  The atmosphere here is great.  Live music playing and a very social and open layout.   Even just sitting on the patio waiting was nice.   The service was good, but not great.   I am not a big fan of finally being seated and then having to wait and wait for someone to take my drink order. 

I had the Carolina Pizza.   It came with pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and fried onion strings on top.  It was really good, and definitely a high of the evening.    

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a lively place to go and hang out at."}
{"text":"I loooove Copper Blues! They have TONS of beers on tap and they frequently bring in local bands. They really make efforts to keep things interesting here by participating in local events and all of the live music. The food is decent and I love the huge windows on the patio--it makes me feel like I'm sitting outside."}
{"text":"Recently visited this spot with friends and COULDN'T have had a better experience. Great variety of food and drink (Steak Bites, Nachos and Wings). Great prices all around. The staff was on point and attentive. The atmosphere is unlike many venues. The new renovation and patio is on par with the best of Arizona. The great management personally came over to our group and was more than sincere and generous just making sure that we were all having a great time. Great live music lead to a fresh and enjoyable night. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place .... the service & food is amazing!!!! Joel the owner has been nothing but superb.... help is amazing, super nice and so accommodating!!!!!  Again the food and service was awesome!!!!  Spent the best 5 hours there before going into Standup live and we were so well taken care of!!!  Thanks Joel for taking such great care of us ... signed your \"raisin crew\""}
{"text":"We were at a Rattlers game and our friends messaged us saying they were at Copper Blues and asked us to come meet them. The band was called 34 North and our friends said one of the lead singers wasn't there so they were a little disappointed but my bf and I had never heard them before and we thought they were amazing. Our friends had meals (pizza and burger) and said it was good. My boyfriend and I didn't eat but the food looked and smelled good. It was a little crowded but it was a Saturday night in downtown Phoenix so that's to be expected. I ordered a vodka soda and the waitress brought vodka cranberry. I let her know and she quickly got me the right drink so it was no big deal, it's hard to hear in there and we were right in front of the stage. Great experience for us and I hope they invite that band again because they rocked! They sang lots of cover songs and would even take requests. We'll probably plan better and go ahead and eat there next time too!"}
{"text":"Great Beer, AWESOME live music on Fridays, Good variety of beer, and good atmosphere. 

This place is a great place to come in cityscape (downtown phoenix) it seems packed every time we go there and is always a fun place. The live music is great, and most do cover music from anything to adele, mumford and sons, lmfao, and even black eyed peas. Its pretty neat. After the live band they have a live dj. There is indoor and outdoor seating. HOwever in the summer I DO NOT recommend sitting outdoors. Its a weird enclosed patio that has half open windows. They have ceiling fans but its hotter than the temperature outside really is, maybe it traps the heat in. Anyway, dont sit out side. Plus the servers outside suck pretty bad. On Friday night, or server managed to not get one of the drinks for our party, never get us water, and really never show up to get our other orders. But when we did find her and ask her for drinks she seemed happy to oblige. We had a group of 8 and perhaps it was overwhelming for her.

Anyway, they have some fun/different beers too. The top choices of my gf are the blueberry beer and there is another beer with a hint of watermelon. They have great porters and hefes as well. Lots of local beers, but I dont see many specials/deals for them in particular. The prices range from $5-7 for a pint."}
{"text":"I found this bar to be great little gem hidden in the middle of the city.   Huge selection of (a lot of local) beers, great food from wings, shrimp, salads and unusual dishes like pea guacamole! 

Staff were friendly and quick service.   They have 2 full bars and one half bar at the back.  Seating is scarce but comfy.  Music system is great and plenty of room for dancing!"}
{"text":"Our waitress dropped our menus off to us and then never came back...we were there for over an hour and no one came to our table. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Overall it's two separate bars, basically a sports bar, and then a dance bar (most people grinding along the bar). Of course I chose the bar with more energy and fun to sit at. The music they were playing was not recent, basically 80's dance, not my favorite but some like it. Try to come when there's actually live music playing. It's mainly a bar, with part dancing. Not a place to lounge, it's a restaurant style set up, thought that might be helpful to know. The interior was decorated alright, good use of lighting and color but most of the space was used for restaurant tables. There are some couches you can sit at with some tables."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed coming here before a show at Stand Up Live.  The atmosphere is great, looking out over City Center is pretty cool.  

I enjoyed the options on the menu, however, I was with 3 others that had a hard time finding something they wanted.  Every dish seemed to have a \"kicker\" item that they didn't care for.

The beer selection was great and helped those that weren't happy about the food still enjoy themselves!  Our service was great, the waitress was more than happy to talk everyone through the beer choices.

I would recommend this before a show or as a date night!"}
{"text":"If you love a live band and 64 beer choices this is your place."}
{"text":"We went for late night before the band NORTH came on, and the chicken fingers were really great, thick breading and tenderly cooked white meat. The waitresses were awesome, I think Jenn helped us out, she did a really good job. I will be back for both good food and music, which is something I can't say about most places, its usually one or the other. No! Not at Copper Blues, amazing food, feel good music, packed house, energy and noms for this foodie. :-D"}
{"text":"The food was JUST OK.  The waitress Sabrina was NOT.  Would I go back? Absolutely NOT."}
{"text":"Good joint with awesome band...don't forget the hot wait staff with the cool hats..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and to listen to the live music and enjoy a cold one.  Monkey Shoulder was on tap and tasty after working the trade show.  The band was very good- played several covers and had the place jumpin!. Great time - just has we had when we last visited a couple years ago."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop before anything at the arena, fantastic beer selection, and the food is always good. The bahn mi is out of control delicious. 4 stars instead of 5 cause the service can be less than great because of how busy it gets, but dealing with that is to be expected downtown and for cost/value this is one of the best overall places to hit in the downtown Phoenix area for a pre-event meal and drink."}
{"text":"Fantastic bar. Great drink selection. Loved the live music!  Great wait staff and bar tenders."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here early Saturday evening because we were seeing Brian Posehn at Stand Up Live next door. We arrived about 4:45 and it was pretty calm in there with only a few patrons at the time we arrived. 

When we're trying out new places we always like to have a variety... usually an appetizer or two and different main dishes so we can taste each others to get an idea of the overall quality of the food. Of course there is always the beer factor too. We both love beer.

The beer selection is excellent. They have a ton of local brews and I was impressed that they had Sonoran White Chocolate on tap. On top that that it was only 5 bucks which is fantastic. They have their local brew called the Copper Blues Bru which was decent too. Grand Canyon is good, also on tap. The only thing it was missing in my opinion is that they did not have Moose Drool. It seems so popular here in the valley and I can get it at so many places I was suprised with their wide selection they didn't have it. No worries though this just encouraged me to try new things. The waitress never left me waiting for another beer and was always there when we needed her.

As far as the food goes we started out with the mac and cheese and added bacon to it. We make mac and cheese at home all the time and believe me it's good mac and cheese. Especially smoked in the smoker for an hour or so. So we always have high expectations of mac and cheese and man this didn't disappoint. The cheese was nice and creamy and the bacon was nice and crispy! The flavor was fantastic and they added just shreds of green onions on top to bring it all together. We both were thoroughly impressed. 

For dinner I had the Southwest Burger. I ordered it medium and it came rare which I don't mind. I always order medium so there is room for error. Some may have sent it back though. My girlfriend did give it a try although she does NOT like rare meat at all. We both had the same reaction though. The burger was incredibly juicy and very good. One of the better burgers I have personally had in a long time. The only knock though is nothing stood out to make it a \"Southwest\" burger. The rest of the flavors did not do enough. The burger itself took center stage though. I ordered fries with mine and they were decent. 

Brandi ordered a Turkey Club sandwich with chips. Really you can't mess up a sandwich. Well I take that back yes you can. All of her ingredients were fresh and piled high. It was a nice large sandwich on a ciabatta bun cut in half. Just the right amount of all of the ingredients to make the sandwich what it should be. Everything worked good here unlike the burger that drowned out all the extras this was the perfect blend of ingredients. The chips were home made and crunchy. I personally love chips like this. The flavor was good and it was a good portion.

Overall it was a good experience for us. The time we went was just right. In at 4:45 and out at 6:00 to catch the show next door. We were done eating before that but just sat and had a few beers while waiting for the doors to open next door. We didn't feel rushed to get out or anything and that is a good thing. One last thing. You can take a beer over next door too... it won't count against your minimum at Stand Up Live though which is understandable."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere. They have one of the best beer selections in downtown. Always have live music and an awesome staff."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have had a problem paying high prices for mediocre food if at least the service was good. You would think that being as close as they are to US Airways center that they would staff accordingly too. No such luck tonight. $70 later, still hungry and thirsty, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Managers should pay more attention to the guests less to the hostesses."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is a cool place to some and listen to some music or hear some comedy.   My husband and I have been to Copper Blues a couple of times now.  The staff is really great and the food is great too.   Also they have a huge selection of beer on top that you can choice from.  If you are ever in town for a business trip or on vacation you should check out Copper Blues in downtown Phoenix.  Thanks Copper Blues for being a great restaurant and pub."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by before a game or event downtown.  Live music and great beers on tap make for a good time on their own.  Throw in a hip environment and solid food and your golden...err...copper."}
{"text":"I got hooked on this place about 2 years ago. 

AWESOME beer selection from big chains to micro, local to out of state. 

Live music.
Yes the other post are correct they play it so loud you wont be able to have a conversation so its a good place to take the wife or girlfriend. 

Every day is a different group or a different individual on stage. I've had the pleasure of listening to; country, reggae, hip-hop, dance, top 40, rock, if it has a beat they play it. 

People are friendly, good looking bartenders. 

if you get their late seating can be a little hard to find but the bar is really good about getting everyone their drink. 

If you're from out of town and looking for something social in downtown Phoenix this should definitely be on the list. Comedy club is next door so you might have a picture take with a \"star\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I snuck a rare evening out recently and hit a few new places downtown.  I'm not sure if I really loved this place or if I really just loved in comparison to the Titled Kilt, but I do highly recommend it.

They have an amazing selection of beers, many local.  The decor is awesome (the stage is the coolest I've ever seen in any bar or club BTW), and the staff is uber friendly (ok, possibly a little too perky and geared toward impressing the male customers but that may have just been a passing thing).  There are also some lovely beer cocktails and a great list of specialty cocktails.

The menu is great but I definitely get the sense they're cooking in a very chain/production kind of mode.  Hard to explain, but I didn't feel any degree of individual care or craft in the food.  Nonetheless, it's decent.

I was a little surprised about the wine list, but it's very telling about what this bar aspires to be.  Very few wines are available (and the list is not creative or interesting in any way), but either 6 or 7 types of champagne, including both Dom and Cristal by the bottle (at $600 and $700 or so, respectively).  Really?

Anyway, I'm hoping Copper Blues gets in some good local music to grace that awesome stage, and that they try to keep it real rather than trying to force some kind of poseur scene club atmosphere (we already have a couple of those...)."}

{"text":"Good place for any occasion. Love the live band!! Especially before & after comedy shows."}
{"text":"Copper Blues has become my go-to place downtown. Let me share some observations:

Pros:

1. Love the feel of this place. The design of the stage behind the bar with the tap handles on full display is pretty awesome.

2. Enclosed outdoor patio (never good at describing these things) is well designed. Less noise from the band out here. Great view of Downtown. Few more TVs if you want to watch the game.

3. The beer selection is fantastic. Over 60 beers on tap. They will have the beer you are looking for, including some local brews on tap. 

4. If you sign up for their Around the World Beer challenge, you get credit for each different beer you try. Try all 60 or 64 (can't remember exactly) and you get 2 free VIP tickets to a StandUp Live Show (which is right next door).

5. Solid food choices. Filet bites, Burger, and Cuban Pork Pizza (which may have been a special item for the day) are excellent.

Cons:

1. If it is really busy (usually right before a comedy show starts), you may want to head to the bar and order your drink. Drink service at the tables has been slow at times. As a result I can't quite award that fifth star.

2. This isn't a problem for me since I live nearby and walk here, but if you are coming here after 8pm, skip the parking garage and find a spot on the street, west of 1st Ave usually has some spaces. Somehow, someway, everyone who comes to CityScape seems to have to fork out a small fortune for parking in the garage. There also can be a line if a show has just ended."}
{"text":"Caught some dinner and tunes at Copper Blues. Great beer selection and the Neptunes were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We always have a great time. The bands are always good / great and the beer is fantastic. Gotta say, never had a bad experience. Customer service is outstanding. I always make an attempt to come here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I HAD been a long time customer(spend a Fri or Sat there every week religiously), had a horrible experience of being ignored by a bartender while he supplied his friends with free beer and flirting with females at the bar. Manager said he would call  me, never did!!!! Last weekend, my wife and i were in the area and i said \"hell its remodeled ,lets check it out again\"....walked in ,packed as always ....stood for about 30mins and i noticed a couple was paying their tab at a booth. Once they got up ,i went and sat down...the waitress came over and says \"the table is for them\" pointing at a couple that had JUST walked in, i told her the table was empty and i sat first and i had been standing for 30mins plus. She told me she was gonna wait on me and was going to call security, i got extremely upset and instead of causing a scene ,i took my wife and left. NEVER EVER will i go back to this establishment ,and i suggest you look elsewhere for your nightlife, this place has horrible horrendous service! #nevergoingback"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch,15 min for the server to come another 1/2 hour for the drinks then another 45 min for our food. The place was not busy. I will give the mixed drink 5 stars. Ordered a Chinese chicken salad lots of greens but only found 1 small chunk of chicken. Sadly won't be back was hoping for something special. Oh well"}
{"text":"I went here last weekend for a friend's birthday. I haven't been to any bars in downtown Phoenix in quite some time, as I generally go out in Scottsdale or Tempe. 

The crowd was diverse and friendly. 25-35 was probably the median. They had a live band playing some good tunes, and when they were on break the music on the speakers was a lot of alternative 90's music which I love and never hear at bars.

I was with a group of about 20 people and we were able to get tables/seats by the bar without any problem (something you have to pay dearly for in Scottsdale.) 

They also had 30+ beers on tap. I tried a 10.5% hoppy beer whose name escapes me. It was quite good. If I had any complaint it would be that the drinks are a bit over-priced... even for someone who frequents Old Town often.

Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly and good service. Fortunately,  got there before the music so a table was available. Place quickly filled up. Good club vibe. Food and drinks were good."}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Phoenix. Happy hour prices were great with $4 beers. We enjoyed the blue cheese chips which was a large portion even on happy hour.

The live music was great! Will 100% return!"}
{"text":"What a FABULOUS find!  In town for a conference we were looking for a place to kick back and have some fun - but not quite as crazy as the college night clubs. Walking below I heard good music and a decent size crowd - SOLD!

They were fairly busy but the hostess could not have been more pleasant and was lucky enough to find us a table in prim-o view of the action.  A beer list the length of the mississippi river? yup!  A cover band? yes! (Hold the phone...the cover band behind the bar - giggity giggity!) Creative and delicious pizza? They did it! I was definitely expecting something gross and greasy.  All in all a good night.

So good, in fact, that we returned the next night.  Again, a great band, great drinks, and this night we met a table full of very friendly locals and danced the night away.

(So when can you move to Ohio, Copper Blues?)"}
{"text":"Go for the beer and the nachos! Live music makes the environment fun and the patio/beer garden is the best with great views of DT PHX"}
{"text":"This is definitely a great spot to stop for a drink.  They have a huge beer selection and their signature drinks are excellent, but a little pricey.  We grabbed dinner here before the comedy show, and were both pretty pleased with our meals.  We started with the Spinach dip, just okay, nothing special.  For dinner I ordered the flat bread with Goat cheese, fig and honey. It was super tasty, but a little too sweet for dinner. When we left the comedy show I ran in to use the restroom, and there was a live band playing. They sounded great and the guests looked like they were having a good time, made me want to go back.  Overall experience was, good, not great, but worth going back and giving it another try!"}
{"text":"Copper Blues was a lot of fun. The night I was there they did not have a live band but were playing tons of good music. The place was spacious enough to move around without being up in someone's grill. The downside was that when a comedy show let out, there was a mad rush to the bar, and it took forever to get your drinks.

That being said, -- being next door to Stand Up Live is awesome. When you're done with the show, head next door to Copper Blues and have a great rest of the night recanting the jokes you've heard earlier. Often, the comedians will also come out and join you for some drinks between sets. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Can't beat happy hour every day, the chicken nachos were great and they also have a great beer selection. Service was also quick despite a busy Saturday night.

They boast being a rock pub but sprinkled in some other music I wouldn't consider rock (like songs by Avicii and other pop? hip hop? contemporary?) I guess I'm too old to even know what I'm listening to."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! I had a Champagne Supernova and the Steak Bites. He had an Ultra or maybe two and the kale salad. We popped in before going to the comedy club next-door had nice quick service on the patio waitress Ariel was wonderful highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the place where the beer flows like wine.

Sorry Lloyd and Harry, you should skip past Aspen and head here. With what looked to be 40+ beers to choose from on tap, grab yourself a cold and frothy one on a moments notice. Order yourself some of their Rockin' Chicken Nacho's, a fig and goat cheese pizza, the southwest burger topped with roasted green chiles and Monterrey Jack cheese, or what can only be described as \"Pig\" on their menu. A 1/2 lb of bacon served with a side of dipping maple syrup. 

I've been twice now on a Tuesday for their Open Mic' comedy line up \"Laughs and Draughts\". $3 Santan brews, $6 Chicken and Mac n Cheese, and other nice priced bar foods to choose from like wings. As much as I want to love this local joint for a mid-week night of comedic stylings; unfortunately, I don't think I'll be spending too many more Tuesday's here. There's just something that seems to be missing. No, not the food. It wasn't the drinks, not even the service itself. That's right, the comedy. I'm not sure I laughed but 2 or 3 times the entire hour and a half I stuck it out. The saving grace was that the Olympics were playing on the TV's in the background, but I could have got that same olympic sized entertainment at my own home, and the beer is cheaper there.

If you're looking for a laugh on a Tuesday night, I'd try to stick it out til Wednesday and find your way over to Stand-Up Scottsdale; their open mic is usually worth the time and effort, and its put together in much better fashion - no run on comedians who don't seem to cut the mustard or know when to exit stage left. 

They do, from time to time, have live music or a DJ spinning records. Check out their main site for a calendar of events. While I can't speak on those particulars, I imagine you can't really mess up music too badly. 

I would like to leave you Yelpers with the following words of advice. If you're out for a great selection of tapped and bottled beer, wine, or liquor in a cool down town atmosphere. Race on down, cause you may have just won gold.

Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. They have a good selection of beer including a personal favorite\"Delirium.\" They have good live music but no true dance floor. After a Delirium or 4 I made an impromptu dance floor in front of our table and made a fool out of myself."}
{"text":"I only gave 3 stars because even though the atmosphere was nice and the food was good. Our server seemed to have a problem with the fact that I ordered ribs and when they came I didn't realize they put honey mustard and hot peppers all over the ribs. I asked if I could have done without sauce and told her I will still pay for these. Usually the server would say oh no problem let me go put that in and I will be right back. But she had this attitude and then when she brought the check she said she didn't charge me and I said thanks you didn't have to do that. And then she proceeded to talk to me like a child and remind me that bbq sauce only comes on the chicken and one other dish and not the ribs. Thinking to myself the issue is done why talk down to me again when the issue had been resolved. I will most likely not return, sorry but one can spoil the bunch."}
{"text":"I would like to mention first, this could have EASILY been a three- or four-star review.  My bf and I went on the Friday before Halloween, which was 80s night and I liked the live music; HOWEVER, our server never put in our dinner and we were on a tight time-frame to get to the Louis CK show down the street.  I loved the atmosphere of the place.  The menu was extremely selective, which kinda sucked but I can't even say whether or not the food was any good because we never got it :\  Nice beer selection though"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere. Cant believe I haven't been here sooner. Mixed drinks are a bit high but the atmosphere and crowd is very cool."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch last week, for a quick bite to eat and had Rachel as our server. She was quick to greet us and had many recommendations for beers! We had two of the best burgers we had ever had! Rachel knew we were in a hurry to get in and out, so she hurried us our check and still gave us great friendly service! All around awesome experience!! We will definitely be back when we can stay longer and try out more drafts!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer list and best Mac and cheese ever.  :)"}
{"text":"I so love this place! This is where I had my first date with my living boyfriend and we had an amazing time... The bands they bring are amazing, the staff are great and the drinks are delicious... If u want to have a great time and listen to some great music I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very cool place - lots of beer on draft, great band playing Saturday night when we were there, and cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"What a fun place--and right next door to Stand Up Live! 80+Beers on tap, great food, excellent service. I couldn't have asked for a nicer visit!  Crowded but not overly so, food served hot, beer served ice cold. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ronus was my server and she was a great. Delightfully pleasant and attentive. Also was really good at recommending a good beer to go with your food. The atmosphere was lively and fun. I can't remember the name of the burger I got but it was amazing! The burger bun was flaky like crosant yet still fluffy, it had cheese caramelized onions but the real star was the bacon, they were cut nice and thick but candied yet somewhere in there there was just the tiniest hint of spice. Other then the water not tasting good I enjoyed the service food and environment."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Friday Happy Hour...plenty of beer options on special. I also ordered the Brussel sprout and steak bite appetizers = YUM. Good service. Live music started around 5. Not my first time here and won't be my last."}
{"text":"So i originally gave this place a 3 and my only reasoning was the service. My bf and i eat here alot during the Suns season. Every time we came here to eat we always got a crappy waitress. Crappy as in she disnt know how to serve. Now we would get seated and no one would show up until 10 minutes past by the same when ordering our food. 
Okay the change. Chad a manager at cb reached me on here about the experience. He invite me and bf as his guest to come back and get a better experience. I felt bad because i didnt want to seem like a crazy whining bitch but we went back and it was way different. Our waitress was amazing she was on her serving game. The food was amazing like always. There food is really good! The waitress asked me what happen last time and i told her about the crappy waitresses. I guess they got fired because i didn't see any of the old ones. I thanked chad for the night. He made our experience much better than before. It takes guts to invite an unhappy customer back but he did it and that's management."}
{"text":"Yup, its amazing for music and the number of beers on tap.  Food just gets the job done and helps you not throw up from too much alcohol.

Short rib pizza wouldn't be so bad if they didn't cut it with so much caramelized onions.  Double the meat, forget the onions!"}
{"text":"I was really happy to find this cool bar right near my hotel.  It was great to find live music which was actually good.  The atmosphere was very nice, it has a cool rock vibe but also relaxed and fun.  There are plenty of tables as well as a large bar.  For dinner we had the Ham and Cheese Gougeres, which were ok, a Scotch Egg, which was good and Pepperoni Pizza which was surprisingly really good.  The service was good, the bartender let us taste a bunch of things and made good suggestions so we could decide what we wanted.  The beer list here is awesome.  It is huge with plenty of local beers and more unusual and harder to find taps.  This is a good place to eat and drink good beer while listening to live music."}
{"text":"Oh Arizona, you surprisingly have so much to offer in downtown Phoenix and Copper Blues is one of them. It's a nice bar, albeit a bit pricey and their claim to fame is having hundreda of beer taps! I tried counting them all, but stopped at around 50.

The place has a rather nice decor. When I went all the staff were dressed as Elves and other Christmas related things as a sort of \"Christmas in July\" during the summer. They were friendly and got us a seat within seconds of us arriving even though the place was packed. For those interested (ie: you perverts out there), the waitresses here seem to dress in skimpy outfits here that show off their cleavage ;-)

We waited for a bit before waitress came back to get our orders and this seemed to be a common theme throughout the night, but she came around just before we were about to get up and find someone everytime. I got the ribs, my colleagues had pizza, wings, and a burger. Of course we put a few drinks down the hatch as well. The food took awhile took maybe 20-30 minutes to come out, they warned us beforehand it might be awhile. When it did come, everything was cooked to perfection. The ribs weren't fall off the bone, but they were good nonetheless.

There was a live band playing too although you could barely make out the vocals over the crowd noise. My only big gripe is they sat us in high chairs when there were booths and other tables available...although these seemed more comfortable than the usual ones. 

Next time I'm in Arizona I'll make sure to stop by and try out this place again.

4 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Have stopped in numerous times and the food, service and drinks were great.  Try the Brussels sprouts and mussels, both were excellent. Have other menu items during other vista. Food was always great. With 70 different beers on tap. There are a lot of choices.  The  venue is modern and there is plenty of seating.  The nice part is if you live on the outskirts of town the train is the best way to this place.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Check the website and board for entertainment."}
{"text":"I visited here during Comicon this weekend. They had offered 25% off drinks for Comicon guests, and though we drank there most of the weekend wearing our badges, it was like pulling teeth to get the discount (when we managed to get it at all). 

It was also nearly impossible to get service, as it took 45 minutes for the waitress who we'd been trying to flag down when we joined an existing table finally showed up tableside, grumpy, and smirky. My $9 chips had maybe 2 teaspoons of blue cheese crumbles around the edges and 1/2 tablespoon of bacon scraps. There were about 15 chips on the plate.

My friend and I ordered well tequila sunrises which tasted like rancid everclear.

The overall impression was decidedly negative, being treated poorly, even if it's just one very rude staff member, is not something I was expecting from a bar I'd enjoyed previously."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating Copper Blues for a few weeks. I had heard good things and I can't stay away from live music. The evening started slowly when our server told us they were out of half of the beers on tap. I'm not sure why? No big deal, I found a nice selection and ordered some food neither of which disappointed. The music was fun and entertaining.. a nice selection of modern favorites and even some 80's classics. The band had a powerful sound and the crowd got more and more dense. Its noteworthy that this crowd was a bit more eclectic and \"real\" than the normal Old town feel, which was what I was looking for. A good time was had; music, beer, friends and good food!"}
{"text":"The gf and I headed downtown to see our friends, notes from neptune play at copper blues, had never been before and excited to check out a new place. Bellied up to the stage bar for a great view of the band and amazing beer selection, along with a pretty cool cocktail menu. Decided to stay on for the instant classics and wow! What a great time that was! We had so much fun dancing and singing and we had maybe a few too many drinks which leads me to the main reason I'm writing this review. We had a situation where we paid cash, and upon checking my bank account the next morning, they had accidentally charged my card for the full amount too. I called and spoke to Casey, the manager, and he checked into the situation and promptly called me back and told me that my card would me credited. I really appreciate the honesty and look forward to many more nights at copper blues! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I went to Copper Blues on my first night out in downtown Phoenix. The first bar to your left as you enter Copper Blues has many beers on tap, which is a plus in my book. The bar then extends to a larger room with a bar and stage. This stage area of the bar is huge! There are several clusters of high tables and chairs, so it's not difficult to get your group seated together to enjoy the live band. I didn't think that there was a lot of space up towards the stage for dancing, but I didn't stick around long enough to see how much more packed or how drunker people at Copper Blues could get. I'd say that this place is fun if you're looking for something more low-key or a great spot to pre-game for the night."}
{"text":"A couple girlfriends and I visited Copper Blues a few weeks ago for a round of beers before an event. We grabbed a table and waited 10 minutes before ever seeing a waitress. Once we finally were served they took my credit card to hold the tab open and I told them I wanted to pay with cash at the end and NOTHING to be charged on my card. 

Of course, we get the tab and leave cash when leaving and I look at my account the next day and they STILL CHARGED ME! I've called the merchant multiple times with no answered phone call. Terrible service and way to treat your guest."}
{"text":"best happyhour downtown! !!their servers are top notched & the entertainment can't be beat .you wont regret a visit"}
{"text":"Love this place for an after work evening HH with my girlfriends. Great drink specials..... my fave is the mule with the muddled pineapple,  the name of the drink escapes me right now, but it's yummy! Great music and ambiance and the wait staff is always very friendly and attentive. Haven't had too many food items off the menu to comment on that.  Their drinks are yummy and they have an extensive amout of beers on tap for the beer lover."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great. Our food was really bad.  There were several things we ruled out. However, fried chicken sandwich... Okay it was bad. How bad was it? Well, I got the ranch and sriracha sauce and dipped the bread in it. Yes, the bread was less dry than the chicken.  Ugh
Beer was cold. 
Service was good. 
Great views. 
Don't eat here. Arrogant Butcher is just around the corner."}
{"text":"Something different depending on when you come in. You've got reggae rock, sing-with-the-band karaoke, cover bands, stand-up comedy...

There's a great selection of beers on tap, and the food is actually really good.

I've been in on a few Friday nights - very busy, very loud at the bar, definitely not a place for a quiet conversation, or really any conversation that doesn't involve sign language or yelling. But that works for me sometimes.

I'm there a couple times a week, and I love the place."}
{"text":"3 stars are for the hearing impaired person who booked tonight's cover band. Perhaps the worst I've EVER heard. So bad. Cleared out the place it was THAT awful. And I'm normally sympathetic to artists but PHEW...it was worse than awful."}
{"text":"I should have followed my instincts at lunchtime today. We wanted to try something new downtown for lunch. Upon entry I noticed there were only two tables seated at 11:40. That should have made me turn around. The redeeming thing was our four groups waitress. But she made us wait quite a bit. We both ordered the same thing... Fried chicken sandwich. Awful! Terrible! Chicken breast obviously factory breaded frozen food. It was too thick and very dry. It came with nasty chips too... Lucky us. It was $13 for what should have been a $6 sandwich. I won't go back there for food ever again."}
{"text":"Best nachos ever!!! Seriously eat the nachos! Spinach dip is great too but the nachos are amaze balls"}
{"text":"Great live music! The quesadilla was ok. Atmosphere is jumping. Was overcharged on the drinks. Just an average  experience."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour for a friends birthday before a D-Backs game and we had a great time! Great selection of beers, great service, great ambiance and awesome location! It's great to see a place like this (and the whole dining center) finally going up in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get drinks in downtown Phoenix! There's always tons of great beer to choose from, and I love the live music :) we always have good service too, even when it's super crowded."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times after going to the gym. The service whether they are busy or not is always meh at best. The beer on draft is plentiful, but they always seem to be out of my first choice. The atmosphere is nice. The food only acceptable, but PRICEY for a bar."}
{"text":".. In a day and age where social media has overcome the art of social interacting, where most conversations are typed then rated by a click.  I would like to take a moment to compliment Rachel (manager) and Tieme for their time, effort and exceptional social etiquette! You two are amazing and I cannot thank you enough for last night and allowing my nephew to perform."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a Diamondbacks game for a quick nosh & drinks. The weather was great so we sat outside - the waitress was right there (and I mean right there in all her glory!!) to take our drink orders. After 1 round, we ordered a couple of starters which were very good and another round of drinks. Then she went missing. There were other patrons outside, too, and they were waiting for someone to wait on them. Finally, we caught an employee's eye and asked to get our bill. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.

Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.

Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.

On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.

We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.

This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !"}
{"text":"This place is great and one of our typical stops on the weekend.  One great thing about them is that they have live music every weekend! They are almost always great bands.  They also have an amazing beer selection of over 60 beers on tap! The only thing that really brings it down to a four star is that it can get a bit expensive! Their beers generally range from $5-8 and only some local beers apply to happy hour. Their Happy hour is from 3-6, with great deals on their appetizers and pizzas. Their food is also delicious! Try the nachos."}
{"text":"Hung out there with a couple of friends.  Beer selection was great!  Live band playing anything from Journey to AC/DC, but NO blues...not sure where the \"Blues\" in the name comes from.  Entertaining, nonetheless!  We had a good time, I'm sure the alcohol we consumed had nothing to do with that!  If I'm ever in Phoenix again, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Dined on a Friday night during happy happy hour. They have a well priced limited menu that includes food and drinks. The resturant offers shaded cool patio space or resturant seating. The resturant seating had live music. My guest and I sat on the patio. We had to wait 15mins before someone asked us what we wanted to drink. This resturant does not have the 2 min rule like most resturants do for a server to greet you. The surrounding tables had the same experience. The resturant was not to busy just not enough servers.

The menu is limited but has a great variety of options to choose from for all dietary needs. I am not a beer drinker but my guest who joined me was VERY impressed by all the different brands. I ordered the Sasuage, Peppers, and Tomato Jam Flatbread. It was good. My friend ordered the same thing but his came about 20 mins after mine did. The server knew we were not splitting the dish but for some reason it took forever to come out. What appeared to a be a manager dropped of his flatbread with no apology or sorry it took so long. We both enjoyed it! For a place that is not known as a pizza parlor I was truy impressed. All the food that walked by our table was nicely presented and looked really great. We will go back to try the other well priced options they offer. I will mention they validate parking for up to 3 hours which is nice. Parking is in the same building."}
{"text":"The beer and whiskey selections ate amazing! I also had some pork belly tacos that were very yummy but over priced. It's convenient to stand up live before and after a comedy show. There was live band karaoke the night we stopped in and that was really pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Went in for the atmosphere and happy hour around 4:30. Got all the way through our meals and rounds of drinks, only to be informed that happy hour wasn't occurring that afternoon due to an event. Happy hour was listed in several locations and weren't informed otherwise till it came time to pay. It was either poor management to not inform guests on arrival or the server isn't very good at serving her guests. Food was so so and server wasn't attentive at all. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere!  The place had a ton of people in it but the place is laid out so you can still move around without having to squeeze between crowds.  We came here on a pub crawl and it was by far the best bar we went to.  It was the last stop and my wife was a little hungry so she ordered some food -- she was eating it within 5 minutes.  I can't remember the last time we had service this quick after midnight at a bar.  Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"We arrived late to the party so did not expect to be treated as great as we were!  We were greeted at the door and found great seats in the back.  Anna, our waitress, was friendly, prompt, positive, and delightfully efficient.  We had nachos and beer that were served super fast and tasted great.  The chicken was fresh and the chips hot and crispy.  The band was even better than the service (Is that possible??).  It was a great night.  I'm so glad we decided to spend our time and money at CB.  We will definitely go again the next time we want a guaranteed good time after attending a show in downtown Phoenix.  Super awesome!"}
{"text":"I really use to love this place until last Thursday. My friend and I went in there and had a few drinks. We were enjoying our time when the bar manager, last name Moronne was absolutely rude to us. She had asked us to leave so we did. The way she talked to us made me bring out my camera to start recording her. I told her I was going to record her and she literally twisted my phone out of my hand. I'm pretty sure that's an assault. I def will not be coming back here. It was embarrassing and unprofessional."}
{"text":"The good: live music, awesome beer selection, good atmosphere, centrally located in the heart of downtown Phoenix. 

The bad: awful service, food was just ok.

Would I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"If you like beer and live music this is the place for you...I've been on a Friday and Saturday night and both times it was packed...the bartenders actually know about the beers too...if you're not into beer they have woodchuck and other flavored ales to get you through the night"}
{"text":"Went last night for my birthday. We sat out on the patio because the description on Yelp stated it was loud. The menu was pretty limited, mostly beer. I had a Copper Blues Burger, wife had a Steak Salad, The food was great! Waitress, Amy, was cute, had her boobs pushed up to her neck. Which I kinda like. She spaced out a couple of times forgetting to get a drink, but quickly remembered, apologized and had a great smile. Which makes it up for me. I used to bar-tend and I'm pretty forgiving. And I like boobs. ;)  
   The music ended up not being that loud. Zimi was playing. We are 50, so it was mostly classic rock. They were okay. We planned on moving into the bar area until we got the bill. What burnt me was the drink price. $10 for a Jack n 7.  The drinks were pretty weak, not much ice so they tasted watered down. So we decided to leave. Ended up sitting in the parking garage for 25 mins. with a bunch of grumpy people that had seen Dana Carvey at Stand Up Live that just got out. He must not of been that funny."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 12. We knew to get a reservation in advance but when we arrived they didn't know of the reservation. That was a huge inconvenience. Also, do NOT get the nachos. $15 for a huge mound of chips with just enough toppings to classify as nachos. I posted a photo after eating off the small quantities of toppings. Note the still-full plate of chips."}
{"text":"I left a review for both copper blues and stand up live (different names, same owner/entity) on SUL's Yelp page but wanted to make sure CB gets recognition too (copied same review over) Seriously wish I could give 10 stars to this place! We usually start at copper blues for happy hour, amazing selection and the service is even better! Our waitress (so sorry I can't remember the name!) recommended me a fantastic local beer after I described the type that I like. She even told me about a \"mixed\"  beer she invented from 2 hefefeizens and it was AMAZING! we ordered an appetizer as we waited for our friends to arrive, they were a little late and we were worried about getting good seats for the show next door. Our waitress volunteered to go and reserve us the best spots still available so we could finish our food! When we were ready to head over she escorted us to our table-amazing location- and even carried our drinks. This was above and beyond customer service, by far the best comedy club/restaurant duo I have been to! Unlike Stand Up Scottsdale, water is free, the drinks are delicious, the food is fantastic, and the service is impeccable. I recommend this spot to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I like this bar overall. There are a lot of business people who go and that makes it feel a little classier than gypsy. They have a huge beer selection and the drinks are pretty tasty. They are a bit pricey though.

They always have live music and the band plays above the main bar and it's really cool looking. I'd say this bar is less dancey and more chill at a bar stool/table etc. 

The only other real downside, other than the price is that it tends to be a real taco fest, so if you're a single lady that can be disappointing.

Everything is clean and elegant. It is a bit more upscale than most bars around there, but you will fit in wearing jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels. It is a little less hipster full than the usual too so I enjoy it when I'm sick of the hipster scene at lost leaf."}
{"text":"Strawberry fields martini + late night food +amazing live band = best place down town!"}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the better bars in DT Phx. The food this last time we came here was certainly mediocre and not very much flavor. Huge bar and huge restaurant on the second floor next to the comedy club. The great thing about this place is that all of the servers (majority of them) are super attractive! Prices are steep in my opinion, sadly (just as high as Old Town Scottsdale but certainly not the same environment or atmosphere). If the prices were $$ as opposed to $$$ and if the food had better taste/ingredients maybe then I would definitely give this place 5/5 stars. Until then, maybe next time..."}
{"text":"This place is rad! Like the most epic Bar\Club that I've ever seen! great live music, 60 rotating taps, pretty sweet crowd, awesome location. The Works!"}
{"text":"Attended a gathering at Copper Blues on Monday night. What a rocking place, friendly staff, great decor and location. The food was very good, I ordered the small order of chicken nachos and it could have fed a table of 5. Live music and an atmosphere that is conducive for having a loud good time. I don't go to many loud drinking places but this one was loads of fun and I can totally see why folks would go there and enjoy every minute. Although I will not be a regular (not a regular anywhere), I will go back as I had such a good time."}
{"text":"GREAT selection of local beer, good food, trendy and semi-classy, loud live music that kills conversation and packed. 

If you are looking to go out with friends for a drink and a live band and don't care about conversation, this is a great place.  The set up is cool, the band plays behind the bar, but that makes it really hard to talk to the bartender. They have A LOT of beers on tap and I was impressed by their selection of local brews. They even had a few THAT Brewery beers which I can't recall seeing anywhere else.  
Another good feature is that the kitchen is open late and the food is very good, it's much better then typical \"bar food.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here on the regular. The food is delicious, served promptly and the staff is always super friendly. The Mac & Cheese is our personal favorite. Also, endless beers on tap!!! If you're looking for great live music with great food this is the place to go! You won't be disappointed, we never are!"}
{"text":"While I appreciate the craft beer selection, the food is over seasoned and it's wanna be elevated bar food. The same cover band has played the last 2 times and all I can say is the sound guy should be fired. The acoustics is not conducive to a live band. The drums cut through everything, the bass was way too high so we had a hard time hearing the guitar, and the vocals. Two vocalists lost their voice in the first set cuz they couldn't hear themselves. It was bad. Plus the setlists had no flow, way too random jumping decades. We won't be back unless forced."}
{"text":"Great place! Come here before the comedy show. Great decor, great service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The only thing holding this back from being a five star review is the bad service.
Great beers on tap."}
{"text":"After all the good compliments my sister said about this place I was so excited to try it, we went in on a slow Monday night I think in the whole place there was only about 2 other tables there was servers standing around everywhere we didn't even get sat we sat ourselves the servers were taking pics flirting with 2 businessmen that were there it took 45 minutes for our appetizer and they messed up on it the server didn't even care her name was Sydnee we were there about 2 hours we had no refills and the soda was flat I asked if she could check the soda and she seemed as if it was a bother like anything we asked for was a bother and normally when its busy I understand but with as slow as they were especially only 2 tables and a bunch of servers I didn't understand and I work in the service industry so I know they were just playing around"}
{"text":"Good music, great drink selection, great happy hour specials, nice appetizers and tons of seating and open space to enjoy it all.  It always seems to be hoppin on weekend nights, and they have great variety (for example, Reggae on Wednesdays).

It's a good-looking place, lots of wood and a nice layout.  The service seemed pretty good, but we were a large party spread all over the place, so it was really hard to tell.  Definitely a great stop if you live in the city, especially with the rest of City Scape for entertainment."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town; Copper Blues is one of my stops for sure.  Great live music, ever changing beer selection, and a pub menu that is above average.  Service is usually spot on.  The places gets really busy during late night.  They have different themes some nights, like live band karaoke on thursdays.  You won't catch me on that stage, no matter how much liquid courage they dispense, but the caliber of local talent that sang was quite impressive."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I visited Phoenix on Christmas day from Los Angeles.
We expected a clouded bar as this is one of the few bars open around downtown.  Fortunately the venue had plenty of room.

Copper Blues was located in the center of the city.  Obviously it is a prime location.
There was an Ice Skate Rink outside of the building, and many people were enjoying skating under winter night sky.

I ordered a beer and the copper burger.  Copper Blues had a wide variety of beer.
The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was fairly good and satisfactory.
Free music made our night more enjoyable.  It was far better than we expected from a random bar on Christmas day.

Thank you Copper Blues for warming up the travelers' hearts on a possibly lonely holiday night."}
{"text":"There wasn't the best seating for a large group when we got there but the atmosphere and live karaoke band were great! I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Whoever thought up this place is a genius! It's tropical, trendy, and classy.  It's outdoor and indoor.  It's bar and restaurant.  And they have live music which is a plus and it's right next to the comedy place.  The food is good and worth going back for seconds.  We were a table of six and more than half of us had the Mac-n-Cheese.  Dang good! The only hiccup we had was the sour attitude that our waitress was wearing. A smile goes for miles, lady!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner before a comedy. About 6pm got a table got drinks at 6:20pm ordered nachos, turkey club, Italian sandwich and grilled cheese at 6:30. When Tits McGee our waitress came by and brought us our 2nd round of beers she was flirting with two drunk guys and after that she said she will check on our meal but after 45mins I were wondering if she was gone. We finally asked for a manager because it was now 7:15 and no food and no idea if it was even close to being done. We debated on leaving but the girls I was with were starving so we stayed. Manager came back offered us chips and salsa and paid for our drinks because the kitchen was backed up and he said that he wouldn't be able to get our food down here in 15 mins. I'm thinking Tits McGee forgot to put in our order. I have a groupon for this place and I can never ever seem to use it, this is the 3rd time I've tried!!! Bummer! Anyways manager offered to fix our next visit and have us his cards. I will def get in contact and see if he can fix this previous visit."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is still the best place in Phoenix for draft brews. Cooper Blues is better than the Yard House. Copper Blues offers better value, has live music or other entertainment most nights, and it is conveniently located near all the hot spots and attractions downtown."}
{"text":"Remodeled better scene makes you want to move around. Before you were happy to get a table. Nice improvement. Love copper blues"}
{"text":"Super loud, but they have great live music, great burgers and fun drinks. The servers are super cute and attentive and the bar is laid out really cool. Its great for friend gatherings and big parties and their indoor, patio seating is nice as well. 

They do a lot of special events and always have something fun going on. The fresh herb garden along the windows of the patio are pretty nice and it makes the scenery more homey. 

If I had to find an opportunity for anything to be better, I think maybe the speakers are too loud during the live music sets. But Im getting old, so what do I know. :P"}
{"text":"The bartender made us drinks after we said we didn't want more. Then he was like, just have them. Then he charged us. The place was empty. The live music was a dated blues band. They were talented musicians, but it was a boring show. The drinks weren't good at all and the also weren't inexpensive. I haven't any reason to return."}
{"text":"I'm a semi-regular here. Thursdays they have live band karaoke which is the bomb!  Mad props to the manager at Copper Blues. 

So today I hurt my knee& I come in limping, manager asks me what's wrong, immediately offers to get me a bag of ice, tells me to go sit down & make myself comfortable. Comes over & props my knee up, puts ice on it, puts another stool at the end of my foot to make sure nobody runs into my leg, brings me Tylenol since I'm allergic to the ibuprofen they offered me, personally brings me a Bells Oberon instead of having the waitress do it. Seriously way above & beyond. I'm so appreciative!  

Two years ago on my birthday I went to the other (now closed) location in Tempe & they had their chef make me a birthday cake. Super unexpected & so sweet. They seriously treat their customers well!"}
{"text":"Good beer and good food. Saturday and Sunday happy hour from 4:00 to 6:00.  They also have great live music on some nights and it's differently the place to stop before and after a comedy show at Stand Up live next door. And with 60+ craft beers on tap Don't  order a bud light , if you are not sure you will like something ask for a sample. You never know what you mite like untill you try it."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.....64 beers on tap, mouth watering menu designed by local Celeb chef Aaron May, Super hot and friendly staff, and right downstairs from my office at CityScape! What is not to like, The decor is awesome, and the live music at happy hour was fantastic. Today was my first visit, but I will be making Copper Blues part of my weekly routine."}
{"text":"Food: quite delicious. Atmosphere: rockin'. Customer service? I'm disheartened to say that it's extremely disappointing! Therefore the three stars is only for the food and atmosphere. I've been to Copper Blues three times now and every time there's always been some sort of hiccup. However, the hiccups were short lived and soon forgotten. Unfortunately the hiccup during this last visit won't be so easily forgotten. 

This past Friday night, we went to see Bob Saget perform (he is absolutely hilarious by the way). Before the show, we wanted to grab dinner so we decided to make it easy and eat at Copper Blues. When we arrived, we were given a buzzer and quoted for a 10-minute wait. We asked if there was open seating anywhere and they directed us to the outdoor patio and said that was the only open seating. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we checked back with the hostess on the status and at that point, she said it was going to be a 35 minute wait. We said that we were told 10 minutes initially and then she said, \"oh well, then it's 10 minutes I guess.\" It was all very confusing. So after about another 10 minutes, we checked back again and at this point they said that they never quote a wait time and when I told them that I had been quoted twice, she said again that they never quote a wait time. I felt like I was on crazy pills! It didnt seem like the staff knew what was going on that night! Well, the saga continues on... 

At this point, it's around 6:00 PM and we are hungry and eager to get some dinner before Saget. It was also freezing on the outdoor patio and we were hoping to sit inside. We decide to check out the inside portion of the restaurant (even though we were told initially that the only open seating was outside). Well, when we got inside, we realized that the entire bar area was also open seating. Now this is where the hiccup will forever stay with me and it will be hard to get over this next part. We find two high top tables and are told that one is in use, so we take the other one. It has three chairs and we need two more chairs. At this point, a waiter comes up and confronts us. I let him know that we are in need of two more chairs and do they have any (this is in the open seating bar, remember.) He turns to me, stares at me dead on and says \"well are you even planning on eating here or are you just going to be using this table to wait?\" Now regardless of whether we were going to order one drink or a whole meal, I don't think a waiter should ever question a customer and treat them the way I was treated. I proceed to tell him that we are wanting to eat dinner and we have been wanting to eat dinner there for a good thirty minutes! I was blown away by the treatment and I will admit that I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. Someone must have seen my anger and utter shock because about five minutes later they told us they found a table at the bar for us but sadly at that point, the experience at Copper Blues was ruined. We ordered several drinks and a couple appetizers (which were delicious) but after the treatment, decided to just eat dinner at Stand Up Live. 

I hate writing a disappointing review like this one. I visit restaurants wanting a good experience and wanting to enjoy the atmosphere. However, customer service can either make or badly break an experience."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour deals! Met a friend i haven't seen in over 20 years here. I'd never been and since he was in town to see a baseball game, i YELP'd nearby spots and this place popped up!

it's in a cool little area with lots of other chains and the comedy club in the same complex. today was even neater because there was a free jazz concert in the plaza. 

when we arrived, the place was empty (about 3:30pm). we grabbed a seat outside and were immediately served water. their happy hour deals are tremendous....nearly all their beers and their entire menu is discounted deeply for HH. my friend had never had AZ beer but he got his fill of San Tan's and 4-Peaks. 

for food, he ordered a burger and said it was pretty good. i didn't anticipate any vegetarian options but lo and behold! a veggie burger! the food came fast but i was sorely disappointed by my \"burger\". it was essentially a bunch of grilled greens....mostly like cabbage type. it was ok, but not filling in the least. 

the ambiance is nice for a drink spot and for the guys, ALL the servers are eye candy so be careful after you've had too much too drink...you'll tip WAY too much!!! btw....it's on a light rail stop! and....they validate parking! woo-hoo!"}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere if you're feeling a good cover band and a drink, but don't go just for the food, cuz yikes...It was terrible. I had the chef's daily pizza - ham & pineapple. I requested jalapenos be added because just ham & pineapple? Boo-rang. The crust was limp, jalapenos pickled, and cheese cold. 

One of my companions got the ribeye sammy. I was told it was \"ok.\" 'Nuff said. My other companion got the ribs, and that's where it really went downhill. I asked for a bite, and he gave me an entire rib. I should have known I wouldn't have gotten a whole rib if they were any good. They weren't...not even a little bit, tough with ketchup-tasting sauce. On the plus side, the live band was a lot of fun..."}
{"text":"Great craft beer collection. I was extremely impressed with the local taps as well as the large variety. There truly is a beer for everyone.

Servers and bartenders were knowledgeable and friendly - Honestly great staff. Will definitely come in again on a busier night to see how it is."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! We came here for happy hour (drinks are strong, delicious and cheap) and decided to stay for the live music performance (awesome setup but no dancing). I guess you can't have everything you want in a bar but this definitely comes close. We'll be back and hopefully we can dance!"}
{"text":"Love this place, has great bands, views, beer and food. The steak bites are the best, perfect for a small dinner. Located in the beautiful CityScape, there's lots to watch on the patio while enjoying the bands."}
{"text":"Finally another downtown lunch option.  I'm viewing this as the \"in-between\" place, in-between Arrogant Butcher's heavy on the lawyer, heavy on the political scene diners, and in-between \"Celtic-Hooters\", I mean, Tilted Kilt upstairs.  The food menu is interesting, a lot of appetizers.  Not enough salads for my taste. 
Compared to Arrogant Butcher and likely Tilted Kilt, the menu has less salads and less fried foods, but it'll be hard to find something healthy to eat.  It veers towards the comfort food side, with options like chili with cornbread souffle, and flatbreads served with burrata fondue.  There are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza.  The day I went, the lunch room was busy. (You enter in through the a lobby shared with Stand Up Live).  Didn't get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection, will have to try that out the next time I'm here for a show.  The management and service is very friendly.  (Not in a scary way, just in a \"I really want to enjoy your experience way).  This is in sharp contrast to the service at Lucky Strike across the way which I've found to be downright rude at times.  Keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to describe this place.  It's kind of like sensory overload and anywhere I sit, I feel like I always have to watch my back.  This is not the place to go for a relaxing cocktail.  This is the place to go when you have a very limited taste in music, you're desperate to be seen and you don't really want to interact with the people that you're with."}
{"text":"Super cool place I've been to 3-4 times now and only drawback is the noise if you are with someone you want to have a conversation with. Service could be better, but location and above average food at decent prices cancel that out."}
{"text":"Pricey, but a lot of craft and seasonal beers!"}
{"text":"copper blues is my favorite place. I live downtown about two blocks away. I usually end up there between 6 PM and 8 PM. I am usually there early to mid week. My wife and I enjoy sampling unique beers. And enjoy their selection. We usually gravitate towards the sexy strongs like Left Coast Asylum, or Chimay.

The waitresses and bartenders are usually very nice and attractive. My wife and I enjoy sitting in the outdoor area. Later in the evening, around nine o'clock they usually have a live band. I'm usually gone by then, as it is hard to have a conversation. The weekends can get really packed. Especially late at night.

Whether the place is packed or not there's always plenty of good people watching. There is a decent after work crowd during the week as well.

The wings are good, the taco appetizers good, their pizzas are good, and the burgers are good. I've not had anything else."}
{"text":"Loved the decor- came here on a bar crawl before a show and it was packed. We had no trouble getting a seat though (sat at the bar) and got service immediately even though it was pretty much standing room only. The bartender was friendly even though she was super busy and found time to pay attention to us even though she had many duties that evening. 

They have a massive beer selection and great beers on draught as well. We did order some nice stuff, but they also had $3 pints of a really nice beer on tap, so we partook in a few of those as well. It's great to see the range in prices- something for everyone. 

We even nabbed (ok, were given) glasses from a snazzy beer that they were discontinuing.  

We will come back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"A friend and I wandered in by chance.  We'd been at the symphony and wanted to grab a bite and a drink.

The hostess was very nice and seated us right away (they were not too busy on a Sunday afternoon, although that changed pretty quickly after we were seated).  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The menu of food paled in comparison to the beer menu, but I didn't mind that a bit.  

We started with the Spinach & Artichoke dip, which was heavenly.  Next time, I'm ordering the bacon appetizer.  Yup, just a side of bacon... makes me giddy.  I had the Copper Burger and my friend had the Cuban.  Both were delicious.  I would definitely make the trip back to try more beer!

OH!  Beer... we had the watermelon ale.  Amazing.  I believe they do $1 beer shots, possibly on Mondays, my memory is failing.  What a great way to try a ton of beers."}
{"text":"Never again. I'd like to blame my ignorant brother for insisting on going here even over my staunch objections but, ultimately, it's on me for staying. It's my fault that the only thing Copper Blue has going for it is the location. It's my fault that I allowed myself to walk in and be looked around, over, and behind while the manbun behind the bar worked on, I guess, more deserving customers. It's my fault that we couldn't even get noticed until a couple sat down in the open seats next to us and, to get to the napkins, manbun had to knowledge our presence. It's my fault the turnaround time on any drink is however long it takes for the bartender to take the order of other customer at the bar, chat with the waitress, mix the other patrons' drinks, and then get to my whisky. 

But Copper Blues pays the rent and, for that, they'll always have customers. I guess different hospitality places measure success in different ways. For my two cents, a visit to Copper Blues is one that I will never be at fault for again."}
{"text":"Wow. The Jersey Shore meets the Real Housewives of Scottsdale. 

This was our second stop of the night, and maybe because the first stop was so cool it made Copper Blues all the more lame.

I'm looking around and I'm seeing popped collars, gelled hair, really dark eyeliner, Ed Hardy and Uggs with leggings. Seriously? People still dress this way?

I will say, they have an amazing selection of beers on tap; about 60, plus a large selection of bottles as well.

The reason we came here in the first place was for the live music. Above the bar is a stage for a band but unfortunately, there was a \"DJ\" last night. This guy sure was moving around a lot like he was doin stuff and having a grand ole time, but I have no idea what he was actually mixing. He just played Top 40 songs from start to finish. So. Lame. 

Picture this if you will. 40something MILF wearing a mini dress with a slit down the back and thigh high stockings grinding on your dad. They were basically dry humping one another in the middle of the bar. If you're that old, can't you just go home and bone? I don't get it.

This is definitely not my scene and I will never return."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times to listen to music.  There was a band that I particularly liked, but the last time I was there, dunno.   It wasn't speaking to me.   Therefore, I won't mention the band.

Sometimes it is hard to get a place to sit, but if one waits till after break time of the second band, which is usually around 10:00-10:30, a lot of people clear out.   And, voila!   Lots of places to sit.

I'm not particularly into greasy bar food, so haven't seriously tried their food, but their drinks aren't bad.   Just make sure they don't get watered down as the night gets later.

I like the place.   It's clean.  The restroom is shared by the comedy club next door."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time at night arounf 10pm and I was very disappointed with the bartenders. I tried to order a drink but none of the girls asked me what I needed, so I relocated to another spot on the bar were I was more visible. I then asked one of the bartenders right in front of me \"Hi, when you get a chance can you please get me a...\" she then interrupted me and told me \" everybody else here is before you wait your turn.\" I was speechless, I have never had any bartender say that to me. So we walked to the other bar by the stage and I was able to get a bartender's attention, I said my order to her and she didn't hear me. I repeated it two more times and she didn't lean any closer to hear me she actually back up a little. Bottom line I doubt I'll ever return due to poor customer service. My boyfriend and I felt unwelcomed."}
{"text":"Jackie is the best! It's weird to tip people who don't do anything. Trust me I worked for tips. Jackie is the reason why you tip. She is thoughtful and attentive even when the bar is crazy busy and hectic. She's going somewhere in life."}
{"text":"I wound up here because Tilted Kilt was full and I am so glad I did. I had a great time here and am sad that I left to go back to Tilted Kilt later on. I went on a Thursday at 6:30pm. They had live band karaoke and the crowd was fun and lively. I have never seen so many beers on tap in one place in Central Phoenix so needless to say I think I've found my new downtown post-work watering hole. The bartenders are friendly and attentive and it's just a cool place to hang out. I have to go back to the beer selection again because it really is breathtaking. There are SO many choices it will take you a while to decide which one you want. The Breckenridge Vanilla Porter is AWESOME!!!  Another great addition to Cityscape."}
{"text":"This place is a blast. They have a huge draft beer selection, live music, and it's huge. I used to go out a lot in Scottsdale and Tempe, back in my hay day. If you bumped into someone or somebody bumped into you, which was inevitable, the other guys seemed to always want to fight you. At Copper Blues everyone is out to have a good time, listen to great music, and have a few quality drinks. I didn't try any of their food, but the atmosphere, the drinks, and the music will definitely encourage me to come back again."}
{"text":"I came here during HH, which is everyday from 3-6pm. We walked in and sat near the bar, which had high top tables, floor to ceiling windows, and even plants growing along the windowsills. I thought bugs might be a problem but not one showed up anytime during our visit.

Our waitress handed us menus and told us all food items are on HH and certain beers are only $1! And, when I checked in on Yelp, I recieved an offer for a free beer shot! They have over 60 beers on tap so lots of classics, local brews and more! In addition, I also ordered a Moscow Mule, which did NOT come in a copper mug :(

After drinks came, we ordered food. I ordered a turkey club on cibatta with house made chips and my friend ordered the cilantro shrimp pizza. Food came out and was delicious. Service overall was fine, I really liked the restaurant and food. Even though we weren't here during the evening hours to hear music, Copper Blues is definitely somewhere I want to check out again!"}
{"text":"Copper Blues could become one of the valley's hottest clubs. I couldn't give it a five star however, because there are some annoying negatives.

The environment is very impressive. Inside it is posh with expensive looking furniture, and there is plenty of room. An outside area gives impressive views of downtown Phoenix.

The selection of craft draft beers is extensive. Some of them are hard to find ales like Dogfish 90. 

Wednesday night there are free dance lessons with no cover charge. After the lesson a live band plays. Dance lessons are from lindy hop guru Steve Conrad, who is teaching \"blues dance\". Blues dancing is an intimate style of dance that hasn't caught on in the Phoenix area, but will be popular when people find out about it.

Unfortunately getting to the club is frustrating. It's somewhat hard to find because it's on the second floor of a building. Parking underground is free but it's always full, so get used to the idea that you are going to fight for parking with Suns fans and other multitudes downtown. Expect to do a lot of walking if you intend on avoiding paid parking lots.

Dancing is problematic because there is no dance floor. For the lessons tables and chairs are cleared to reveal a nice wood floor. Usually you have to dance between tables. Considering that millions were spent to build this place it's incomprehensible that an expensive wood floor was installed without putting in an area that people can use to dance.

A band called the \"Sugar Thieves\" played the live music after the dance lesson. Unfortunately their music was far too fast for blues dancing (which is usually danced to very slow and sleazy blues or slow soul music) and was too fast for almost any dancing besides Lindy Hop. They are good musicians but obviously don't have a clue what kind of music dancers need to have fun.

To add the to the problems the live band is on a stage behind the bar. The distance to the band is makes the live music experience somewhat impersonal. Even worse, to order drinks you have to yell across the bar loud enough to be heard by the staff who are standing directly in front of the band. What a lousy floor plan!

Beers are expensive and yet the pints seem small because there is too much foam. The waitresses are cute but they don't know how to pour beer. Tsk! Tsk!"}
{"text":"We sat at a table for 10 minutes without service on a slow night. Had to goto the bar for a drink and still no one checked on us. Not with it."}
{"text":"Love this place for the live band and drinks! The staff is friendly and there are a lot of drink choices. I've never eaten here but I'd imagine the food is decent. 

The in house band is what makes this place fun on a Friday or Saturday night! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday night for some drinks and food. First off, getting a table was nearly impossible (open seating). The atmosphere of this place was cool and they had a live band. Our server was friendly and informative but seemed very rushed which was unpleasant. She made some beer/liquor suggestions and they did not disappoint although I feel my glass could have been filled more (see picture). For an appetizer we got spinach and artichoke which was great but nowhere near enough chips for the dip. Some of the items on the menu weren't available so we opted for the nachos which were OK. When you've been drinking, anything tastes edible. I would come here more for the atmosphere than the food.. Just being honest. Good place to pregame. Free beer shot with yelp check in was cool!"}
{"text":"I came for lunch last week & had a great meal. I ordered the super food salad which was full of healthy stuff that I could only manage to eat half of since the portion is really big. The atmosphere for lunch is cool but I can imagine it being a lot better in the evening.

Great menu choices - I'm sure I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is one of my favorite Cityscape spots. A great venue for live music and great beer selection. Whenever I have a planned night out downtown I check the music calendar and if EastonAshe is in the house I make sure to stop in. They play here often and they're one of my favorite, rockin' Phoenix cover bands. 

It can get crowded when the bands playing but the outdoor patio is usually a little less crowded so you can at least step out there to get away from the crowd, if needed. 

We were offered penny pint tickets on the way in and that was a big score! I'm sure the bartenders love those deals as well. We definitely tip more when the drink is pretty much free! ;)"}
{"text":"Super Food Salad for $12 is amazing and HUGE! Moscow Mule with Jameson is money (recommended by waitress). Great atmosphere, good bang for your buck, awesome food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I honestly haven't tried the food at this place. We went here as a group after dinner because we wanted to experience something else besides the usual Scottsdale and I I was hooked since the moment I walked in. It was a Friday night and The Instant Classics Band was playing that night. Amazing voices, music, and show! I know some other reviews say that Copper Blues compares to Blue Martini, yes I agree, except that it is more casual and I can testify that the live bands are waaaayyyy better along with the prices. Let's just say I danced all the way until they closed. The band stopped playing around 1 am I believe ( I had a few cocktails so that statement may not be fully true) and then they just played 90s and top 40s. I highly recommend this place. It is in Downtown Phoenix, very nice, chic, affordable, and FUN, FUN, FUN!! Perfect for going out with friends and have a lovely time!!! Now, if you are like me that looooooves to dance non-stopping and your date is not really a fan of dancing, this is still perfect. Because you can eat, have a beer or cocktail,  sit if you want to, dance your butt off, sit down again, go outside and have a ciggie, go back and have a tequila shot, dance again, another shot, and FLOOR! Just kidding!! you get my point! All you need is here =)"}
{"text":"Very Cool place and good place to drink...5 stars on that.  Lunch was less than that and unattentive service and C- food.  Looks like drinking place is way to go!"}
{"text":"I have been here once and had a really good time, the staff was friendly and made my friends and I felt welcomed. This bar is very clean and serves great food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - the first time, almost all of the local brews on tap were out. I tried to order more than 4 local brews, and they were completely tapped out. They only had the worst beers available. 

The second time I was there, I wanted to eat. They said that they were a \"tapas restaurant\" and only had small offerings. I got their baked shrimp for $12, and it was disgusting and small. I also ordered a diet coke, and it was completely flat when I got it. It was incredibly frustrating, and the service was terrible. I love City Scape, but if you're in the mood for a great place with good beers and drinks, either go to Tilted Kilt or Arrogant Butcher...this place won't last."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is awesome! I love how the menu has H.H. on it so you know what is available and the price. 

 Okay, I'm going to preface this with the fact I am prejudiced regarding their Pretzels and Beer Cheese...it's awesome.  OMG...awesome. 

The chicken nachos and drumsticks are good too...worth the trip without happy hour. 

Enjoy and I'm tellin' you...get the pretzel and beer cheese sauce. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Got here at 10:30 on a Wednesday.  Received  ZERO service. It seems that we were an inconvenience to the staff. The music was great but unless you were at the bar kissing up to the staff the service to other paying customers was close to none existent."}
{"text":"No no no no. The bartenders were rude and looked miserable. Clearly they hate their jobs as much as I hated being there. Skip this place. Not worth it."}
{"text":"We are out of Towners but was looking for good live music. Stumbled on this place and ended up staying for 4 hours. The love band was awesome! Would definitely go back if I come back to Phoenix"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came out to Chandler for the Pot of Gold Festival.  We ventured out to Phoenix to check out the scenery and restaurants.  Came across Copper Blues and walked in, sat ourselves down in the middle of the restaurant in front of the stage (perfect view to see the band playing, right?!) thinking we were going to just listen to a band play but little did we know...it was karaoke night with the live band.  It was amazing and there were so many talented people going on stage to sing.  This place is incredible with great atmosphere, delicious food, good music and beautiful friendly staffs.  We will definitely be venture our way back."}
{"text":"Fun, fun bar. Great live music and decent service. Went with a couple friends, we had a great time. Food was good, drinks too. I don't recommend the nachos, but the meat eater pizza was delish!"}
{"text":"Great food, music and service. Live Karaoke tonight. Drunk people ripping shit up.  I'll be back def!.."}
{"text":"Love this place every time I stop in! Went this past Saturday night to listen to the band. They were amazing! Large crowd on a Saturday night but nothing to make you claustraphobic. They also have a late night happy hour, even on a Saturday night! We ordered a spinach and artichoke pizza which was perfect for our late night munchies. As we were walking in a man on the street offered us coupons for any pint beer for a dollar. Score!!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good service, but the food was just ehh. I got the superfood salad and there was no quinoa in it, which is a pet peeve when food comes out missing components. There was a lot of couscous, which is just pasta, not super nutritious & I wanted  something nutritious. The chicken was really dry too. My husband had wings & fries & they were average. The beer selection was fine. I'd come here again but not for the food."}
{"text":"Great spot! Sat on patio overlooking downtown with a band playing great music right below us. middle of the day. Great food and drink!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend on a Sunday night while walking around the area and watching the ice skating. There were probably three people in the whole place. Why so dead? It seemed to have gotten slightly more crowded by the time we stopped back in to use the restroom. So we didn't experience the staff past the greeter or order any food or drinks, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"During a conference held downtown, a company hosted a happy hour party here.  Although I've been in the area dozens of times, it was my first experience in this place.  The party was held out in the patio area.

It was a great spot to host the party....we had our own bar and food setup, so getting drinks and appetizers was easy.  It was an open bar during the party, so I don't have a sense of how much the drinks are here.

The party was held in early April, so the weather for a party out on the patio was perfect.  The place looks like a cool spot to come hang out before a Suns game....will have to keep this in mind for next season.

Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Energetic atmosphere and lots of different beers.  The music was good too- a nice variety on Saturday night. Karioke on Friday was a blast too."}
{"text":"I will start with the positive - the chips were awesome. The bbq sandwich was just ok - I left most of it on the plate. The service was poor, especially for how slow the restaurant was at the prime lunchtime."}
{"text":"Walked by after work and that it would be a fun place to check out. I give 5 stars for the venue. Awesome bar/restaurant and the live music was awesome. Also 5 stars of the beer selection. Have seen some of those craft choices in awhile. The prices where a little high but that was as I expected with the location and amenities such as live music. Service was a huge disappointment. I would give two stars. Ordered a medium burger 20 minutes later after bartender went to check I got a well done burger. Was still good just not as ordered. Bartenders spent most of the time talking to each other and doing more watching that serving. Not sure if service is better at tables as I say at bar. Overall above average bar food, great venue, great beer selection, and poor service."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is awesome!!!

We were in town for a company convention, and trying to arrange for a team dinner seemed impossible but through the amazing help of KC, Ryan and Kate, we were able to set up a team luncheon for 120 people and it went flawless! Kate was able to create a menu that fit within our budget, the food was great, came out fresh and on time. We blocked out the entire restaurant so we had access to the stage and microphone and that was the cherry on top!

We were only expecting 60-80 people at first. But about  2 hours prior to the lunch I notified Kate and she was quick to respond and work with the kitchen with our new numbers. The restaurant doesnt usually open till 3pm, but the crew was able to get some staff to come in early to serve us, so I have to commend the girls that ran the floor, because they  were able to keep up with the crowd, was very attentive to each guest and still had a smile at the end!

We usually have a convention in Phoenix once a year, so I definitely know where my to-go place is. Thanks team, you guys were awesome.

Aside from our team luncheon, this place is just great. Awesome vibe, their renovation is impeccable, the beers on tap has a huge variety, clean, big space and you can try to get tickets to the Stand Up Live comedy shows next door. The food is great as well."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Downtown Phoenix. Best happy hour specials, both in price and beer selection....service is outstanding (and pretty easy on the eyes, not trying to sound too chauvinistic). Great place to settle in and enjoy a few before a show next door at Stand Up Live, food selection is \"sophisticated bar food\" (which is right up my alley); artisan pizza selection is to die for. Smoking patio you can drink on, which has my favorite view of Downtown Phoenix at Central and Washington. Great place to see a band, as their stage is right in the middle of their wraparound bar. Great place to start or end the night."}
{"text":"Awesome beer list, fabulous live music, great ambiance....  HORRENDOUS service.  Egregiously bad.  Do not try to go here before a concert, event or game.  It took over an hour to get our food and when the waitress brought it, it was wrong.  My husband asked 3 different people for more water, and all that happened was that our airhead waitress took his empty glass away.  What?  I hoped that they would have had their act together a little better considering their proximity to USAC, Chase and Comerica.  I will say that the various servers were friendly and polite, I just didn't understand why we were ignored so badly.  I can't really comment in detail on the food, since all we wound up eating was a side Caesar salad and an order of the filet bites.  I wasn't a huge fan of the filet bites, it was more like overcooked carne asada than what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, great food!!! Started with pretzel app. Beer cheese dip was SO good! We had Mac&Cheese with short ribs, nachos, and chicken drumsticks too. All of it was delicious and happy hour every day 3-6! Awesome HH pricing. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"They had a bit of a rocky start in my opinion, but each week they improve. I generally end up here for happy hour every Thursday with my school and always end up enjoying myself. The servers are attractive and attentive, the drinks tasty and the karaoke entertaining. Bathrooms are clean (they fixed their wonky toilet seats) and they now have a bathroom attendant that sells assorted goods and gives you towels (classy ^.^).

Fun place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to go to at the new City Scape in downtown Phoenix. The food, drinks, music, and atmosphere are all great. Copper Blues is the perfect decision for pre-show drinks and dinner. The restaurant is attached to the Stand Up Live comedy club and this past weekend my girlfriend and I met up with another couple at the restaurant before seeing Stephen Rannazzisi. 

For an appetizer we all really enjoyed the French Onion Dip with some BBQ potato chips, despite my girlfriend's hesitation to order this dish since it was \"something you can easily pick up at the grocery store.\" For the main course three of us got the Copper Blues Burger, which has cheddar cheese, hickory bacon, roasted onions and tomato jam. Usually I'd do without the tomato jam, but I figured the hell with it and kept it on. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I have to say, I wasn't expecting it, but I was blown away by this burger and I'm definitely adding it to my list of best burgers in Phoenix. My friend's wife had the Caprese sandwich. Pretty standard, but it looked very good. All sandwiches came with a side of their house made BBQ chips, which we all ended up using to dip in the left over French Onion Dip. 

For the beer aficionados there are over 60 beers on tap. Check out their extensive list here:  http://copperblueslive.com/page.cfm?id=1028

Me? I'll take a Coors Light."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out and dance to some live music downtown. Check in for the free beer shot... they have some great craft beers on tap!"}
{"text":"We were excited to come to this place because it is \"NEW\" and it has an open mic/live music experience. . . . I wanted to play a song. That would never be an option we would find out 3-4 songs into a drunk ex-marines shit-show of \"music\"...my god he sucks, isn't a musician and over achieved by getting this gig!! Well, we sat at the bar. Maybe a bad choice, bartenders weren't very friendly (no smiles)...the kegs were blowing on their beers so I got half a glass of the beer I ordered and chose something else. . . French fries were cleared from my seat without asking /before I had finished them...maybe just because we ordered another basket, but we really weren't done.... Also, the beer lines are too warm here, poorly designed their bar...they have foam for days, and the girls behind the bar have absolutely no idea how to pour a beer. They are literally fucking the spigot with the beer glass, dipping beer and spigot - this is totally unsanitary!!! and likely they chip a lot of their glassware with this bad habit. They also cannot keep up on their dishes, serving warm glasses with their foamed beer...  okay, lastly... the music. what. a. shit. show. they have NO IDEA who or how to hire musicians. Out of tune, out of rhythm (terrible musicians), out of phase (terrible sound techs), and cringeworthy song choices... the open mic disaster at copper blues may be every tuesday, go for 'uncomfortable listening hour' and get terrible service by 'attractive' people... Owners need to rethink their strategy for such a high volume/value location, their investment is going to tank at this rate!!! won't be returning, seriously advise against this place..."}
{"text":"Great addition to the CityScape lineup!  This is a big place with TONS of beers on tap, sweet cushy leather seats and friendly employees.  So far I've only been for happy hour, which is great because they offer deep discounts on local beers.  I'm definitely looking forward to sampling some of the food options.  
My one complaint - most of the songs we heard here (I've yet to see a live band here) were horribly outdated top 40 hits that I wish I had forgotten about.  Clearly that's a matter of taste though ;)
Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"After swinging by Gypsy Bar and Lucky Strike, I popped into Copper Blues on a Thursday afternoon.  The outdoor bar was pretty packed, but the indoor bar only had two people.  I liked the indoor atmosphere better, anyway.  It was dim with lounge lighting and they had the A/C blasting.  We pulled up a couple of seats in front of Alyssa at the bar.  She was friendly, talkative, and easy on the eyes.  The music was set at the right level to maintain conversations, but kept the place lively.  Before we knew it, the bar was packed for happy hour and $1 beer shots.  Everyone was so nice; it was easy to chat it up with the other folks at the bar.  I didn't have time to stick around for Thursday night Karaoke, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous tap selection which always pulls me into a spot. Live music is always a great show! Nice crowd with a variety of individuals. I highly recommend grabbing some drinks before&after attending a stand up show next door."}
{"text":"This was sunday night and no decent restaurants open. The drinks were generous and fairly priced but the food was expensive for the Quality and the portion size. The service was friendly but inexperienced, slow and forgetful. ( maybe too many tables??) They comped the first drink because the wait was so long without a complaint from me. That earns them the 3rd star."}
{"text":"We are here at the New Years Eve party. The band is great but no place to dance!!! The food was fair, my Tiramisu was still frozen. We paid $100.00 a person and people are standing on the dance floor and crowding people that would like to dance and paid a lot of money. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We were downtown so figured we should stop by before we head back to our part of town. Normally the only time we get to Cooper Blues is before a comedy show, and just like those times, it was crowded. We got a seat before it got too crowded & the live band started. Our waitress was very nice, she messed up my drink order a few times but I will take some fault because I was being complicated :(. We got a few apps at our table -- chicken nachos, pretzels, and mac & cheese -- all super good! The nachos, like most places, were ginormous, and even 6 people couldn't finish them. Also, if you check in at yelp you get a free beer shot :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for Happy Hour and was glad we did. Greeted by the hostess who was friendly. Once seated our waitress provided very good service and we never waited for anything. We ordered the Humus which was excellent and also had the Chicken Quesadilla both of which we would order again. This is an awesome place to sit and enjoy a cocktail and a bite to eat. Music was very not too loud and everyone seemed to be working hard to make it a great visit. This is a definite place to visit. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is a Blast! Karaoke night is a great Time! Most favorite place to visit downtown!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and service is great and prompt. I always recommend this place to any friends or coworkers I meet. Its a very clean environment and the quality and quantity of beers is excellent. And the staff is easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Really one of the better tap selections in the Valley. What it lacks in higher-end Belgians or obscure specialty beers, it makes up for with Arizona taps. And, with those Arizona taps at only $3 during their generous happy hour, this makes for a must-stop bar for beer lovers. Almost every available Valley brewery seemed to be represented, as well as most of the ones in Flagstaff. Impressive.
I love the space too. Cityscape is such a cool development and it's nice to see it doing well. But, in the front bar, you've got this great view out of huge open windows. It's a wonderful spot to sit for an after work drink, and it seems as though the clocked out office workers constitute much of their early evening business.
I've had good service here, but I don't appreciate their Hooters-style skimpy clothes. It just doesn't seem necessary.
The food isn't great, but it's really cheap during happy hour. We had the mac & cheese, and I would more appropriately call it \"mac & grease, with cheese.\"
The bathroom (men's, at least), is pretty weird. It looks like that of a very fancy restaurant. I wouldn't be surprised to see a guy in there handing out towels later in the evening.
Overall, I really liked this place and have already suggested it to others."}
{"text":"Was just here during their slow time, between 3:30-4:30pm on a Thursday, and I'm beyond disappointed with their customer service. I was sitting on the patio at an isolated table with only about 5 other tables being serviced and no one inside, and I left realizing I forgot my sunglasses on the table. I called within 20 minutes to see if they had put them aside and the woman who answered the phone said, \"nope, we didn't find any sunglasses\". I asked her to please check again and she came back to the phone saying she asked the entire staff and no sunglasses were found. This is disconcerting, because she didn't even care to ask for my name and number in case something was to show up. These were Oliver People sunglasses so they don't come cheap, and they are my favorite. I'm sorry, but a staff member had to have picked them up! What a huge disappointment with this establishment."}
{"text":"First and last time here.

We were not greeted by our waitress for at least 10 minutes after sitting down.  Service went down hill from there.

One order came out wrong.

Chicken on nachos was dried out.  Nachos were below average.

Waitress disappeared for almost our entire visit.

There is a short hair blonde female manager that walks around the place but never talks to customers.  She walks and walks and walks.   

Music was way too loud. It made it hard to have a conversation.

For me, this was a hugh disappointment."}
{"text":"I was really torn as to whether I should change my original star rating to a 3 or 2. Some things were really great but some were really really not.

We went here on Sat for my husbands 35th birthday. I called a week ahead of time and reserved a table for 20 at 5pm w/ their concierge (i guess thats what she'd be called). She said we were all set. When we got there at 5 on Sat the hostess didnt see anything about our reservation but said she \"guessed they could accomadate us\". Then throughout the next hour, she proceeded to try and seat people at the other end of our table since not all our people had shown up yet (because of the dust storm) and kept pointing at us and telling the people she was trying to seat that it was our fault they couldnt sit there. Rude. So rude.

Our waitress (Lexy) was great. She was very nice, funny, knowledgeable and attentive. She was one of the best parts of our experience.

About an hour after getting there, we ordered food. Tacos ( that took 45 minutes), the \"Pig\" ( a half lb of bacon w/ maple syrup for dipping that took an HOUR), and a caprese pizza (that took an hour and 45 minutes). Unacceptable. I can do nothing but blame the kitchen for this since Lexy was great. One persons food came out promptly, ours see above, another couple waited an 45 minutes for their pizza that when it came out the very rude male waiter told us it was our caprese pizza when it was our friends pizza. When we told him that we'd waited an hour and 45 minutes for it, he said \"Uh huh.\" shoved it on our table and walked away. Again, SO rude.

One of the managers came over to apologize (cuz the food service didnt improve) he said he'd take 40% off of our check. Fine. Great even. When we got our bill, not only was their no discount like Ernie promised, but he was suddenly no where to be found.

Im so disappointed that this place wasnt better. Thankfully, our friends kept my birthday boy distracted all night so he had no idea that any of this happened, thus not ruining his party.

I wouldnt recommend this place for anything more than a few drinks before or after an event downtown or as a stop on a pub crawl. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by here one night when i was hanging with some friends.  I found the bar tenders to be rather rude and not interested in helping the customer.    The venue is really cool and does have a great vibe but bad customer service isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Great semi-local spot in the corporately developed \"heart\" of downtown Phx. Impressed by the selection of draught beers of course, but the kicker was how quickly they stocked up on Phoenix Ale Brewery which just opened relatively recently. Fair happy hour and comfortable staff.  I'd like to see a little more risk taking as far as hours and specials, this could be a staple in the downtown community if they play their cards right... we'll see."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for Happy Hour.  The beer list is extensive and the prices can't be beat ($3 local pints and $4 craft).  If you grab a seat at the bar, you will get better service and the bar tenders usually take some time to help you make a selection.

Having tried several items on the menu, the Chicken Nachos are the best!  It can feed 2-3 easily. The Brussels sprouts are also very good and so are the fries.  The Hummus was flavorless but came with great pita.  I would not recommend the pizza, every time we order it, the crust is soggy.  They have also recently changed their menu and added several items including mini appetizers. We tried the Ham and Cheese Gougers (?) on our last visit and were disappointing.  $5 for 5 small, dry biscuits with a few chunks of ham just isn't worth it.  They need to be stuffed with cheese or have a sauce.

Service is hit or miss.  This last time, we had to constantly ask for our orders.  Our waitress would bring 1/2 the order then ask if we needed anything else (uh, yes...the rest of our first order?)  After finally getting our food, we she was no where to be found for more drinks or the check."}
{"text":"Copper blues is the place to be for live music! They have an awesome variety of beer on tap and it's cool that way the stage is set up behind the bar! They always have great bands! The service is always good. This is one of my favorite places to have dinner, beer and enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"A very extensive tap beer selection and the menu features several delicious small-plate apps. I had cheese puffs and the shrimp appetizer and both were prepared beautifully and with good, interesting flavors. Service is not intrusive and the use of space and seating is comfortable and upscale. I was not fortunate enough to see live music, but the stage is positioned well for good viewing. I will make it back here when I am in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Such a big place to bring groups! I was told I would need to pay a reservation fee for 8 people or more but I decided to wait it out until night of and see if I could get a \"walk in\" table for about 15 people. It worked out and our group sat in the side area and still had a good viewing of the live music. The live music is always up on the stage behind all the draft beers. That evening, we saw Black Bottom Lighters and they were funky, hip hop and rock kind of group. Great food and good service!"}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews I'm wondering if we came on an off night.  We had a groupon and went there just for food, a little later on a Sunday night.  Our waitress was nice but inattentive.  It took a long time to order.  Upwards of 40 minutes.  We ordered the pretzels, Mac and cheese, and the bbq pizza.  The pretzel sticks were so chewy there was no way they were not reheated from hours earlier, I could barely bite pieces off.  The cheese dip that came with them was the only redeeming part.  The Mac and cheese tasted like metal, as if it had been sitting in that cast iron pan all weekend before it was cooked, and they left off the chip topping that was described in the menu. Also, we got the wrong pizza.  The pizza we had was okay, don't know what it was- something with pepperoni and sausage.  I realize we didn't come during prime food hours, but still.  I'm usually the least picky restaurant person at the table, and I thought everything from service to food was pretty bad.  We will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"I'm all about the bartenders, the floor staff is doing better. The food could use some work."}
{"text":"They won best wings in Phoenix! We had to come. I have had beers there when we came to comedy shows, but never eaten.  So me and my wing loving posse jumped in the SUV and trekked to Cityscape, enjoyed watching some ice skaters fall, and headed in for these wings. They didn't open for about twenty minutes, so we hung on the balcony, chatting up staff. They all knew we were \"first in line\" As we spoke to ALL of them. Well, as opening time gets closer, several other groups gather up with us to get a seat. Of course, the staff was SO nice to seat them all before us as we watched and said \"Hey\", \"Excuse us\". Etc. We dealt though, because the waitress who finally apologized and sat us was very nice. She saved this review from tragic one star prison. Anyhow, we sat down and all wanted to start with wings. \"Sorry, we have been out of wings since yesterday\". We checked out the rest of the menu, beer specials were not very special at all. So we bailed and went over to Tilted Kilt and had a kickass time. BTW, their wings are not hot, they are whiskey sweet sauced. Just so you know."}

{"text":"Great place. Fabulous band that played 80's music. Terrific beer selection. Had the short rib pizza. Will be back."}
{"text":"Can't help it, I like this place. Great selection of beers. Bud and Miller lite drinkers, go to a chain bar. Happy hour food okay but not great. Always enjoy the visit"}
{"text":"I had to update my review because I was contacted by a member of the band that had played that night. 

So the reason for the warm beer--electricity went out earlier that day. 

The electricity going out also meant that the band was told to take the night off. But then told to come in with little notice. 

I can see now that crappy circumstances led to a subpar night. But I also think it's cool that l was contacted and that they were super friendly about it and wanted to make it right!"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. Nice drinks. Yummy appetizers. And waitress was super helpful. Mushroom pizza was awesome. We had live music. It was a little dark. Thanks for an awesome night."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is one of my favorite downtown bars!  I usually come here if I'm going to Stand Up Live to see a comedian.  They offer a great selection of beers at a very good price.  We come early for the great Happy Hour with drink and appetizer specials.   We also have come after a show and there has always been good live music!  The waitresses are usually very friendly and offer great service.  

Over all, I love this place and think its a very cool place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Super friendly bartenders and I had my first Moscow Mule experience (vodka, ginger beer, and lime-YUM!).  A little sad my drink didn't come in a copper mug, however.  Great place to grab a drink before a game or show downtown-a little pricier than what I'd like but that's my only complaint!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I met up at Copper Blues last weekend. It wasn't the first time that I have been there before, but it had been some time. I never really realized how big the inside the place was. They had live music, which was entertaining (nothing special). The band played a lot of popular older songs that are always a good time. 

In the past, I would stop by here before a live comedy show or ball game, so, I haven't really given the place my full attention. It was always a shorter visit. This time, we were there the whole night and it was actually a lot of fun. I really commend them for their beer selection. They have a fairly large wall of different craft beers that are hard to find at other bars... especially in downtown (how sad is that). 

I haven't really been a huge fan of the Downtown seen, but thanks to Copper Blues, my perception of Downtown has slightly increased. I know that I will def give Copper Blues another chance in the near future.

I had some 90-minute dogfish IPAs and some Firestone double IPAs and they were both hoppy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice happy hour spot!! Located beside Stand Up Live with a great view into the city Copper Blues is your happy hour destination.

Delicious food at a reasonable price, live music, nice crowd, strong drinks what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Probably one of the (if not the) coolest spots in downtown city scape. Tons and tons of beer on tap, you can sit by giant open windows and look out to down town from the second story. 

I didn't have any food, so I can't say anything to that, but the beer was pretty good. They have probably 15 local beers too, which is awesome. Many I had never heard of. 

Unfortunately they don't serve food past 10, and they do last call at 11. What? It was still decently crowded on a weekday to close down that early. But it seems like everything closes early downtown on weekdays. Cmon now."}
{"text":"After a Suns game on a Saturday night, we were looking to go out and enjoy some drinks. Copper Blues Rock Pub & Kitchen is a short walk from the arena. It's a spacious bar with sit-down service, a long bar, a balcony, and a stage. They play quite a bit of live music and they had a musician on stage while we were there. We chilled out on the balcony for the most part which was a cool spot. It's not big, but if you can snag a spot, you get a nice view of the city. A nice breeze when the weather's nice and you're living the life. Another thing that stood out? Quite a few waitresses were lookers. Eye candy galore. I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"My friend and I come here for live music on Friday nights. We always order a pizza to share and some drinks. It is a little packed but fortunately there are two bars and a ton of servers. So far we've always managed to find a place to sit but it takes time and patience."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is a great happy hour spot in downtown Phoenix! They always have great live performers. They have 60 beers on tap! Perfect location to everything. There is an amazing view of the mountains in the main dining room. Again, their happy hour is AWESOME! The blue cheese chips are really great!!"}
{"text":"Copper blue , copper blue, now copper blue has a little competition across the \"alley\" but overall good bar. Drinks they make them , the only a bar should strong. Very big selection of beers and the food is actually okay. But I will say the big winner is their stage for cover bands and performances . I am little stuck in my kanye ways but they have a good choice for a wider audience . bands are multi genre talented. Also bartenders are lookers so watch your eyes if you are bringing your girl. I would recommend this bar if you have some friends in town , plenty of room , and you can sit back and just relax. O and nice bathrooms very nice. My only negative is , I had to ask if they validate parking . parking in down town phx is expense and not easy. They do validate parking for a public lot across the street but it would of just been nice to have that be a general question. Who doesn't like to avoid paying for parking after good food, good music and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's just something about this bar that made me love it from the second I stepped foot inside. Maybe it's because it is a glimpse of what downtown Phoenix could be: a hot spot for the night life scene. CityScape offers a very real potential for revival of social activity in the heart of the city, and Copper Blues is off to a good start!
My wife and I went on a Saturday night. We live right down the street, so we had to see if it was worth adding to our list of hangouts. The vibe was very casual, hip and festive. They offer around 50 beers on tap, some delicious small plates (and some larger ones), and live entertainment! That night we tried the Filet Bites, paired perfectly with a creamy horseradish sauce, and knocked back a few beers while enjoying a band playing some great covers! The prices were a bit higher than surrounding local bars, but it was well worth it to enjoy a more upbeat night in a NICE setting!"}
{"text":"Beautiful sexy servers. Walk up the stairs and find a place to order a drink and relax. We had the nolan martini served in an unusual lipped martini glass, like a martini and a champagne glass had a baby. Made imbibing extra special.

The cheese sandwich with soup was a crispy ham and cheese sandwich accompanied with a sweet tomato soup. Brussel sprouts were special, served together with cuts of chorizo and pumpkin. Mmm.

They had live music, but they must've been so good that it felt like the band took too long of a break between sets."}
{"text":"So I did give Copper Blues another chance. Glad I did because it was a good time.  The bartender was very attentive and pleasant. Beer selection is awesome and the prices are especially great during happy hour.  Food tasted good too and there was something on the menu for everyone (vegetarians included)."}
{"text":"Had a 10 person band play, with all kinds of different instruments last night. The band was truly amazing and played such a wide variety of up best music. Kiss FM was also there and offered $.01 drinks, so our table got a free round!

There was probably 80 beers on tap, had the big blue van beer and it was delicious. Never heard of a lot of the beers, but have so many local beers to try!"}
{"text":"The first time we came here our service was very very slow. We decided to give it another chance but we waited at a table for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged so we just left. We let the guy at the front know as we were leaving but his response was \"Gotcha\". It's obvious that the employees there are only hired for their looks and not their skills or work."}
{"text":"Updated:   I have finally tried their food!  I crave their nachos and pizza, they are very delicious!  I cannot believe after many years of coming, I hadn't ordered their food.  I still love their different types of beer and I love the free live music.  As of now my favorite band is \"Tick Tick Boom\" and there are two others, but I cannot think of their names.   It is a very chill place you see all ages.  They have happy hour from Mon-Fri from 3-6pm.  I recommend this place for a weekend night out.

They also validate your parking ticket, if you park underneath."}
{"text":"Zero customer service. Not even an hello. I don't even care if the food is any good here. Don't state that you serve food until 2 when clearly NONE of your staff wants to. Huge profit losses."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been to Copper Blues several times, the location is ideal if you're doing anything downtown Phoenix.  I like the patio much more than I like the inside area.  During the day they're fairly comparable (depending on the weather) but inside gets way too loud once the band starts.  It's fine if you're there for the music, but if you want to have any kind of conversation you are out of luck.  They have a great selection of beer on tap, with even more in bottles.  The chicken nachos are off the hook.  When they came to the table we had to clear half of the space just to put them.  They taste as good as they look, so fortunately there is plenty to share.  My friends always get the soft pretzels and they are consistently delicious.  The mac and cheese is good, but the bacon is much better than the short rib.  We will definitely continue to come here when we make our treks downtown."}
{"text":"Everything is always on point! Music is too loud to have a conversation but it's okay if you sit far enough away, by the window, outside, that you may be able to enjoy their terrific wait staff, your friends/family, and the delicious meal without too much of a headache

Ask your waitress about mixing the beers - SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Good music nice atmosphere the band was amazing first time there we had a blast drinks were good too they have a lot of beers on tap best place to be on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"So we finally got a chance to check out Copper Blues in downtown after driving past it for a while. Glad we did! We had a super fun time here. This was my first time but won't be my last!

When I liked about the bar so much was the cool strange that is behind the bartenders. Mad the center of attention of the bar focused on the band playing and it was a nice touch having all the taps of craft beer at the base of the stage. Speaking of craft beers, they have over 60 and they are great! Kinda like a live music Yard House. 

We came here in a night of a Dbacks game. Bar was crowded but because there are 3 bars, and a dedicated area for smokers right outside the. Bar, I really didn't have to wait for a drink or find a place to stand and watch the band. Band was great. So how can I rate a place that has live music and craft beer anything lower than 4 stars.lol.

I didn't have any food, but I think I might have found my too go before Dbacks game or event downtown spot."}
{"text":"30 min for a thin crust pizza seems like it would be too long of a wait when there is only 20 people in the entire place."}
{"text":"Been to Copper Blues a couple of times, but only for drinks until this past Saturday night. 

Attended a friends birthday party this past weekend, and when we arrived I told the hostess that I was there for a party that had a reservation. She told me that there were many parties that night, and that one claimed they had a reservation but didn't and she would show me that table to see if it was my friends party. Honestly I thought that was a bit more information than was necessary, and kind of rude. Turns out, it was my friends party so I joined the table. 

I was told as I arrived that they had just ordered appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered beers and even though they took some time to be delivered, the server brought water immediately. The place was packed- Van Halen was playing at US Airways Center that night so we already expected a delay in service. 

I ordered the roasted artichoke hearts and they arrived almost immediately. Then I noticed that the rest of the party had not yet received their appetizers. We finished our appetizer (not what I expected- a little soggy but tasty) and our party was still waiting for their food. 

Our drinks were delivered quickly- despite the crowd and obviously came faster as the concertgoers cleared out. Our server Lexi was great- you could tell she was \"in the weeds,\" but doing the best she could & did it with a smile. 

I ordered a white pizza with tomatoes for dinner. As I was waiting for it, the rest of the parties food arrived. It took my friends over an hour to get their food. The expeditor brought out a pizza and walked right by me to the other end of the table. I tried to get his attention by saying \"excuse me,\" but he repeatedly ignored me. I had to yell (which is not like me)-- \"Excuse me- is that a white pizza with tomatoes??\" He finally turned to me & said, \"No it's a caprese pizza. They got your white pizza. Sorry.\" He then dropped off the caprese pizza to that end of the table and walked away. He had delivered the wrong pizza to my friends who had waited over an hour for their food- and they had already eaten it. 

The manager came out & addressed the table, saying that he understood there were some problems with our experience and he would take care of it, even offering to take some of the bill off. As a group, we are more laid back than others, and many of us had worked in the service industry and know that when you're busy, stuff happens. We were grateful for the apology. 

The manager then brought out a new white pizza with tomatoes for me. It was delicious and filling! 

When I asked for the bill it took at least 20 minutes to get. Then I noticed nothing had been taken off my bill. Instead of arguing at that point, I paid it and still tipped 15%. Despite the awful experience, Lexi did her job and I didn't want to take out my frustration on her. I hope she understood that our table didn't blame her- it seemed like everything had just collapsed.

Finally, when walking out past the hostess stand, I thought it was rude that she didn't thank us for coming. She wasn't busy, she wasn't dealing with customers- she was just standing there & we walked right past her. Now maybe I'm just being picky, but when I worked in the service industry I was always taught to thank the customer. It was their last opportunity to leave us with a good impression and they blew it. 

I'm not the kind of person who complains unless something is really bad, so if you've read this rant then thank you. Bottom line- I will probably go back to Copper Blues for a drink as they have a great beer selection, but I don't think I'll eat there ever again."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times before comedy shows and have always been happy with the service, drinks and food.

Copper Blues is a fairly large place that sits next to Stand Up Live.  One of the nice things is that you can buy a drink here and take it to SUL.  Though it doesnt count as your two drink minimum.  

Their appetizers are pretty tasty.  We ordered their beef tips which were delicious and also an order of their wings.  The wings were ok, but nothing fancy.  

My only beef would be that when a live rock band goes on, they forget that it's a restaurant/bar and crank the volume as if they were in a 20,000 person arena.

Over all good place and we always go here before a show."}
{"text":"My friends and I love copper blues, but then again we've only gone on karaoke night! The band is always great and the crowds that go for karaoke are a lot of fun. Dancing and singing, it's a good time.  

 I'm not impressed with the food. The best item on the menu would have to be the fries and the chicken nachos. But the drinks are pretty bomb! Huge selection of craft beers, and I have yet to find a Moscow mule from anywhere else that I love as much as this place. 

I also enjoy that the age of the crowd is varied.  Its the kind of place that you can take your dad to, to grab a drink and listen to some music. But It has also been a pit stop on a 21st before."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I've stopped in a few times (most of the time when there was a live band). The band was always fun, playing top hits. The crowd always varied. It can take a while to get a drink at the bar, but they do have a good selection of beer."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for a quick dinner before a Phoenix Suns game and decided to try Copper Blues.  It's in CityScape, upstairs about The Corner/ formerly Chloe's Corner.  It was a nice evening so we decided to sit outside, which was lovely.  It was happy hour and they had some great specials going on!  They also have over 60 beers on tap so we tried a few of them.  One in our party had the BBQ Chicken pizza and loved it.  The burgers were excellent as well.  Even though we were outside on the patio with just a few tables our server made sure to check on us regularly. This is definitely a place we'll be returning."}
{"text":"2 stars because they have a ton of great beers, and they are all not crappy, over-hopped hipster beers!

give them 1 star for food. overpriced and under-flavored. 

go here to drink, not eat.

others in the group said their wings were good, but the rest of the food was not."}
{"text":"Great burger, beers and drinks. The nachos were good, but not the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by Copper Blues for happy hour last Saturday afternoon during our trip to Phoenix. We sat in the outdoor seating area which has a view of the courtyard of the Phoenix CityScape area. 

We ordered a couple of local IPAs (which were $4 during happy hour). We enjoyed listening to the 90's music and watching the security staff of the comedy club next door getting ready for the show that night. Who knew Daryl from The Office would need 8 security guards at his show?

We weren't planning on ordering food, but the people at the table next to ours ordered several appetizers and they all looked really tasty. In the end, we opted for the soft pretzels which came with beer cheese as a dipping sauce. They were just as good as they look in the picture I am including with this review. 

Overall, Copper Blues has a really great happy hour with wonderful deals, tasty food, and a lively atmosphere. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We have gone for happy hour. The food is okay but what can you do it is a bar. The drinks were good. The soft pretzel are good too. They had a good selection of draft beers. The live music was good. The place is really fun to hang out because a variety of people are there.  It gets packed on Friday and Saturday night. So I would get there early if you want a place to sit."}
{"text":"The best place in city scape. Open seating and great service! Not to attentive but just right! Honestly I love going here even if we not even close to it! Love the beers and food is a plus"}
{"text":"Ok, Copper Blues isn't cheap dive bar, but it's worth it everything they charge, and worth leaving a decent tip!

The bartenders (and that is plural) are always alive and crazy busy trying to help you behind the bar.   They get you a drink if you can only squeeze an elbow in through a crowd.  But it does get crowded at times.

If you are at a table, the staff is still pretty decent, they get it.  They know it's a popular and busy place, and they try to keep up.

At least of spring 2013, the staff and service makes it worth going to on a Friday or Saturday night. They make you feel like you matter.  I can't say it's the cheapest place, or best food.  But, the selection of beer and the service makes it worth spending some money there, if you have it to spend."}
{"text":"This establishment is quite funny and by funny I mean a joke. We came to Copper Blues for dinner before the Suns game, when we went to order drinks we were turned down because our Alberta identification was not acceptable, instead we were required to have our passports \"per Arizona state law\" we were refused alcohol service because there was no way to verify that our identification cards were \"legit\" in their verification book, I have to admit... I thought google would have been a good alternative to an ancient book..  

After being refused service I looked up the Arizona department of liquor, and it clearly states : \"(1) An unexpired driver's license, identification card from any state or Canada provided it includes a picture of the licensee, and birth date\"

If you don't plan on carrying your passport with you around town then I would not recommend this joint.

Ps. The food is sub par at best"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential if you hire the right staff.  Been here on a few occasions now so I'm a bit mixed on the review.  

We saw this place while going to see Craig Robinson at Stand Up Live this last weekend.  We made it a note to stop back from drinks the next day.  If you see my tip from that day, the service was terrible.  We sat outside and were appalled at the waitress or how a place could even hire someone who doesn't acknowledge their guests.  We sat down and she literally walked up to the table, didn't smile, and stared at us like we should introduce ourselves or request her service...uh, no thanks.  So she then said she'd give us a minute.  Thanks, we should maybe use it to bolt right out the door.  But, we gave it time.  We ordered two glasses of the expensive cabernet knowing that it will still be cheap overpriced wine which is standard at any restaurant most of the time.  So, she brings it back and it's blazing hot.  I mean, like it's been nestled at the bottom of a fireplace.  Of course she's nowhere to be found so we ask another waitress to correct the situation and we see her go talk to the bartender and then they looked over at us and looked mad?  Whatever.  Nobody is knocking your bar tending abilities just give us good wine!  So, the manager comes over and he was cool about it and went inside and got a bottle that was good.  

While this is all going on, the table directly behind us is complaining and before long, the manager was at there table really complaining about their server.  So far the servers were 0/2.  How is this possible to hire people like this?  As a manager when you can visibly see the annoyance of your staff its' probably not a good idea to have them working the floor.  If I wouldn't have went back the next day and had great service I would've always remembered the place for the crabbiness.  

We went back the next day and sat inside and had a wonderful server.  She was great.  She smile, checked back often, and went above and beyond.  Not sure if it's just the outside bar that needs to be featured on Bar Rescue or not but they definitely need to cheer up!!"}
{"text":"Three of us just moved to Phoenix and live on Central in uptown. We've been here for about 3 months and went to many different places around central, camelback, old town scottsdale, n scottsdale rd, etc. but not downtown Phoenix. We finally came down this past weekend and loved it. Copper Blues was such a fun time with live music, a ton of excellent beers on tap, and a great vibe. The live band was playing country music and mixed in some other songs throughout the night and they were really good. We will definitely be back again for"}
{"text":"Dang! Some of the hottest young ASU sourced lady wait staff in Phoenix. Dressed in cowgirl outfits with revealing black leather chaps and open vest. I got whiplash. And some beer and a burger - I think. Anyway, it was expensive pub food.   We went to Hooters later up the street and there is no comparison - Copper Blue wins hands down for food, ambience and the view."}
{"text":"Boring!! The bartenders could card less if your $12 drink taste good or not!! The band could care less if you listen or nor not. Not a strong vibe just a place to cool your heels."}
{"text":"~Update~
I have to assume that our service experience wasn't the norm because the manager saw this review and 1. Got back to me promptly (within hours) and 2. did everything he could to make the situation right. I think I'll give this place another chance and keep all you Yelpers posted! ;)

Original review:
Good in theory: Copper Blues has a huge, well-sourced beer list and live music.  I wanted to like it!  I really did!  Alas... I went with friends on a Thursday night and the place was almost entirely empty, yet it STILL took us an eternity to get our drinks - JUST DRINKS, no food.  No wonder it was empty..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to check this place out for a while. I live that the stage is set up behind the bar and taps. It looks really cool. Being Sunday evening it was pretty slow, but for Cinco de Mayo they had this neat band from Tucson called Santa Panchita...I think. They were good and weren't too loud or obnoxious. They had a really talented trumpet player. Unfortunately, I don't speak Spanish so I wasn't sure what they were saying but the melodies were upbeat and fun. 

We didn't order any food this time, but the beer selection was great! I am NOT a beer fan by any means, so I love that they offer a free beer shot when you check in on Yelp. I tried the Papago Vanilla Orange Blossom beer. The 2 ounces was just enough since I was DD. My boyfriend and his friend love trying new beers, so they tried a few and really liked that there were so many Arizona brews represented. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wife and I met friends for food and drink before the DBacks game.  Although it is 4 blocks from Chase Field, the walk isn't bad.  The good news is the food.  I had the wings (honey hot, long on honey, short on hot) while the wife had a small pizza.  Our friends followed suit.  
I think we all agreed the food was good for the price (we ordered off the happy hour menu), especially considering the location.  The beer selection was exceptional.  Between the four of us, using fingers and toes, we could not count the taps.
There was a two piece band playing.  One guy on guitar and vocals, the other played sax and, incredibly, the accordion.  But hey, the were good and I enjoyed their performance even though it did make conversation more difficult.
So much for the good news.  Now, about the service....it was slow but not as bad as other reviews might suggest..
Bottom line, we'll be going there again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my first and only experience here was very poor. We came before a comedy show downtown, working in the service industry, I know how crazy that can get. We came 2 hours before we had to be at the venue, so about 2 1/2 hours before the show started, and quickly found seats at the bar. We ordered a couple drinks and some food, accepting that it may be some time before our food comes out. 1 out of 4 dishes comes out after about 45 minutes however, nothing else did. The bartender was very sympathetic and kept sending people to check on our food. Given the bartender could not leave the bar, we knew that and did not expect that, however no one ever came. We sat the full two hours, with no update on our food. Eventually we gave up. We paid for the one meal and drinks we got, and ended up just getting hot dogs at the concession stand in the venue. 

Typically I never leave one star, being in the restaurant industry I understand crazy circumstances. Sometimes it's just sooooo busy, however for no one to check on us, especially a manager to apology or discuss what was going on, I am very disappointed. We had no issues paying for the sandwich and drinks, however in all the restaurants I've worked for, this never would have been acceptable. Again, our server was very sympathetic. And I hope my experience perhaps is the outlier, and extremely out of the ordinary!

Here's hoping others had and continue to have a much better experience than I did, cheers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here last Friday for a pre-DBacks game Oktoberfest deal sponsored partially by the DBacks. The place was jammed but we were able to score a couple of seats at the bar right near Julie the bartender in the outdoor section. She was extremely, friendly, helpful, personable and fun! She helped us choose from their huge selection of draft beers and made sure we were aware of the current happy hour deals. Scored some free Oktoberfest suspenders too! There was a decent band playing somewhere inside the dining room and we almost didn't go to the ballgame! Can't wait to go back again and maybe try some of the food!"}
{"text":"The bartender Jake is great! Amazing service and great conversation! Will definitely be coming back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Good beer,  live music, hella hot waitresses. Good food. Great place for downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"If you're in downtown on a Saturday night and you want to listen to some live music then this is your place.  They have over 60 beers on tap and you'll be sure to find the one you like.  They're pretty cool about letting you taste a few before deciding on the one you'll quench your thirst with.  We arrived at around 11:30 and the place was already packed.  I could hear the live band from outside, but as we walked they sounded great!  No tables available at all so we waited about 15 minutes hoping someone would get up and leave and that's exactly what happened.  A group of 4 people got up and left and I quickly made my move to reserve the 4 seats.  You can't beat live music.  This place is great and I hope it stays open for  while.  Staff is friendly and management is helpful."}
{"text":"We are out of town from Seattle and stumbled upon this place and it's so awesome and all of the bartenders are so great! They accommodated about 25 of us. If we ever are in town again we will definitely come here"}
{"text":"The liquor is good and the bands are fantastic. The food I had was a major disappointment. Had the Ham & Cheese Gougeres... The ham was deli meat in the bottom of a skillet with cheese-ish dough balls. That might sound great, but it wasn't that amazing. Also had the Beer Braised Chicken Drums. Giant drums! Amazing size and the flavor was good. But the center of all of them were cold!! And not just, they cooled down cold, no. They weren't cooked all the way through. And the Coleslaw that came with them was AWFUL! Who knows, maybe I hit a bad night. But I feel like the food should be at least decent for their prices. The band saved the evening."}
{"text":"Super cute hangout in downtown Phoenix! We were in town over the weekend visiting my best friend for Valentine's Day and were looking for someplace fun to grab drinks and quick bites. Since it was a Sunday afternoon, a lot of the local restaurants were either closed or completely dead. We asked a security guard where all the cool kids hung out, and he pointed us towards Copper Blues.

The decor and ambience at Copper Blues was exactly what we were looking for. The crowd was older (late 20s, 30s and 40s -- not crazy 21-year-old party animals), and the restaurant was decked out in an eclectic array of rock-themed gear and memorabilia. The bar area was open seating, so we selected a high table with bar stools next to the open windows. The bar is located on a covered patio that opens to the street and plaza below, and small herb gardens line the open windows. They have heat lamps in case it gets cold, but on Sunday afternoon the weather was crisp and breezy.

Copper Blues has an awesome menu, but we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't try out more of their food. Since it was Valentine's Day, they were only serving a special menu that had very few selections to choose from -- and even fewer gluten free or vegetarian options (on a side note, their regular menu lists what items are vegetarian and gluten free, which is always a plus in my book). I really wanted to try out their spinach and artichoke dip, but they weren't serving it on their special menu that day. Instead, our table split an order of the brussels sprouts, the filet bites and the cheese board. Everyone loved the brussels sprouts, and the filet bites were delicious -- especially the green pesto dipping sauce. The cheese board was a bit of a disappointment. It had Port Salut, blue cheese and a third variety that I didn't recognize, but the portions were tiny. It was supposed to come with fruit, but they left it off our order. For the price, next time I'd pass on the cheese board.

The happy hour specials here are excellent and are served daily from 3-6pm. They have a huge beer list with tons of local and craft brews, but since I'm gluten free I ordered a mixed vodka drink. I was not impressed by their drink menu, and my vodka drink tasted like pure vodka with a dash of disgusting berry juice in it. I wasn't a fan, and the waitress was awesome and didn't charge me for the drink. Instead, I ordered a $3 house cab sav -- can't beat that price.

Our waitress was super cute and gave us excellent service, and I'd definitely like to give this place another shot the next time we're in town. They have nightly live music, and their full dinner menu has a lot of interesting selections I'd love to try out next time!"}
{"text":"Are you not entertained? This is a great crowd, and a fun place to hang out. I've gone a couple of times during the amazing live band karaoke. When I brought my friend along to jump on the mic singing CeeLo Green (all songs uncensored, because this is for fucking grown ups!), the audience went wild and he disappeared to presumably walk around giving everyone hi-fives. 

This is a good beer bar, in which you'll pay reasonable prices from the draught selection. It's an eclectic mix of brews that will please lovers of any genre, whether it's a hefe or a porter. The porters and IPAs are awesome here. Just be wary of ordering something a bit off the beaten path. My Dogfish Head 90 Minute seemed more than a bit flat. 

The outside bar is where I prefer to sit, even if it's exposed to the brutal Phoenician summer nights. The inside is always packed...absolutely full when I enter, and it's not really clear how to maneuver myself to order a beer on the inside. Especially with live drums going on full blast and almost nonstop behind the taps. Awkward.

Overall, I'll be back many times to say \"cheers!\" and laugh with my pals. It's easily the most fun I've had in Cityscape."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow to say the least. I know there was concert and a limited menu, but plan accordingly!
Chicken nachos were great, quesadilla was average, pepperoni pizza was pretty tasty too. We had a few drinks too. It was super busy!! Furious George was playing and they were really good!!! I would definitely go back. Also, we took the light rail from east mesa and it brought us right here."}
{"text":"The boy and I finally check this place out last night. 
It was everything I imagined it to be. Great view from the semi-outdoors bar area, lots of beers on tap, and nice patio area. It was a Monday night so they weren't very busy, which was nice, I wasn't in the mood for a crowed. 

When checking out their menu online I saw they have my favorite beer on tap, SeaDog Wild Blueberry. It was delicious! Completely different on draft, but yummy all the same. They also had an Apple Cider on draft, my pick over a pear cider any day, that I could have in my Black Velvet (cider and Guinness). I was a happy camper. 

Only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked, but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers. 

The bartender was great, she let us try anything we wanted before committing to a full on pint. I tried to get the boy to be adventurous, but he stuck with the Stella, not bad at all, just a little boring. Oh well ;-)

I am looking forward to checking out Stand-Up Live soon as well, and the live bands they have at Copper Blue. I also hear they ahve a pretty awesome Ladies night on Thursdays, saweet! Menty menty more trips in my future, I can just see it. :-)"}
{"text":"Eh.   So I've been here a number of times and have been deeply annoyed by it being so busy and crazy with a lot of out of hand patrons.   However, they are just having fun so I shouldn't be such a grump.  Coming during less busy times is way better as the servers are all very sweet and cute, very few of them are dickheads (or at lest they so a good job of pretending) and at least some of them (Shelby in particular) actually know good beer.  
They have a lot of singer songwriter types that play covers (defeats the definition of singer songwriter, I know), but I have to deduct a star because they cut off an Alice in Chains song in favor of playing a bunch of dumbass bullshit on the \"juke box.\"  Bad taste.   This is a personal preference review, obviously."}
{"text":"Had reservations here at 5pm for the Ken Jeong Stand Up Live show. Waited 40 minutes and still didn't have water served or even a waitress/waiter. We asked three different waitresses for service and still completely ignored. It is now 5:45pm and we still don't have water. One of the waitress said they are extremely understaffed, which seems to be a management issue. It's no excuse for patrons to be waiting for so long without even being acknowledged. We didn't even get menus. We had to get our own menus. It looks like self-seating, self-grab menu, and being completed ignored was their special for the evening. I guess we were the joke for the night. Completely disappointed. 

The steak bites and quesadillas were pretty good though. Probably three stars if it wasn't for the service.

Edit - I changed this from one star to four because the GM, Fabio, came and sincerely apologized. He showed us that this was out of the norm because two people were no shows, and did everything to try to fix our experience. Will try this place again after he did that."}
{"text":"If your a fan of local music and unlimited amounts of local beers on tap, then this is THE spot to go! 
During sporting events and all events for that matter this place is jammed packed and with no availability to even sit down or wait for a table. The tables are few and the bar seating is few. its insanely hectic during the events and I've had my bill mixed up a few times.

Even though they misplaced my bill or brought me the wrong debit card a few times they always compensate you with something to make up for it. 
 Copper blues is a great place to go when they have no events going. If you happen to be going to Stand Up Live they literally connected to each other. So you can have a few drinks and some food before the show!"}
{"text":"Big beer selection, I discovered a new beer I loved there, the Piehole Cherry Vanilla Porter by the Historic Brewing Company. I give the place only 2 stars because of the very slow service. And I did not like their pop music, I think rock or jazz/blues music would suit this place more. Good place for single men, the waitresses all wear skimpy clothes. No equivalent benefits for single women, though..."}
{"text":"Went to a good show at Standup Live last night and not ready to call it a night when it was over popped over to Copper Blues next door.  The band was rocking, so I headed to the bar for an adult beverage.  Great inside/outside feel to the bar area.  But that's when the vibe turned sour.
The crowd is clearly a late 20's-early 30's bunch and I am old enough to be their father.  The \"hip\" mohawked bar keep must not see be able to see anyone who doesn't meet his age standards.  Look, I would have served the cute girl standing to me first too - but after that - come on.  My money must be covered in shit, because he just wasn't going to touch it.
Never did get a drink from the asshole.  Too bad - the band was good and we would have stayed for the rest of the set, instead we left."}
{"text":"Went last night.  Basically the only thing that saved them from getting one star is the food.  The Copper Burger was excellent, cooked exactly Medium Rare, as ordered with lots of competing flavors that worked well together. The cooked to order potato chips were, well, probably the best I have ever had.  Their Hummus was good also and I loved their choice of brews.

Now comes the service.  It was a Monday night so it wan't really that busy.  It took about 15 minutes before the server came over to get our drink order, then it took about 10 minutes after that for us to get our drinks.  Then, she disappeared for at least 15 and finally came back for our food order. 

I ordered the Hummus that comes with flat bread with an option to add veggies for 3 dollars more.  Sounds reasonable, I wanted veggies, my friend wanted flat bread so I asked to add the veggies.  So what happens, the Hummus comes to the table without flat bread.  So we let our server know, she said she thought I wanted veggies instead of the flat bread (i know, this sounds really boring and mundane but it gives you a good idea how things went) and then went on to say that the flat bread would be a dollar more. Big Deal, $1.  Like I was going to balk at adding a dollar to my check.  In the meantime, the entrees arrived which kind of blew the whole concept as the hummus an appetizer.  The flat bread arrived about half way through us eating our burgers.  

With good service, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I am hoping this is just one of those random things and that next time my experience will be better.  I do want to come back because besides the service thing, I love the atmosphere and the food."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night and had a great time.  They had live music (free!) and the overall vibe was fun and relaxed.  They also have a lot of different local beers on tap, ranging from $5 to $10 each."}
{"text":"I would rate this place higher if I got to eat here. Unfortunately I missed out. Real beers, real selection for wine and spirits as well. The live music blows any Mill Bar out of the water. This place should be more of a relaxer then say, meet up with people becuase it will be loud. Go next door for that. Sit, drink and listen to music... This is your song!"}
{"text":"I quickly became a regular here during my week long business trip to Phoenix. You can't go wrong with a place that has as many taps as they do. You're sure to find something you like! 

They had live music (Tues.) and live band karaoke (Thurs.) It is pretty loud sitting inside when this is going on so don't go in expecting to have a conversation or alternatively,  sit outside. The bartenders were really nice but the table servers were a bit impatient. The beers were pretty reasonable but some were a costly. They also poured a double whiskey on rocks by default which made it $14!

If I lived near here, I'd probably check it out after a game or as a stop during a bar crawl."}
{"text":"Awesome place have a few too many beers!! Great food great live music. Restrooms are clean. Love the deco."}
{"text":"Love this location! The beer options and live music are awesome. Their spinach and artichoke dip was really good too! Always enjoy my time here."}
{"text":"Matthew really knows how to take care of ya! Good drinks, decent bar food. Definitely a good time. Good tunes too. Love it!"}
{"text":"I went to Cooper Blues to eat after the Joe Bonamassa concert at Comerica theatre on Oct 28th, 2017. I had a beer spilled on me by a guy who was clearly wasted and the bar continued to serve him and his friends who were belligerent...another guy paid for my food after his friend spilled his beer all over. That was very kind of him I suppose. They told an older gentleman, who was standing at the bar talking to me, that he needed to move out of \"our area\" and when the man told the bartender she just smiled. I don't know where security was and how people get away with this crap but I will never go to this place again. I feel bad for the downtown Phoenix. They just can't get it together and attract a better caliber of people."}
{"text":"the husband and i met up with some other bay area friends after last nights game, decided to drown our sorrows in beer after a crushing loss. holy beer selection! awesome! nice view, mediocre cover band, attentive staff (the joint was packed)...i'd recommend it if you're a beer person...dogfishhead 90 minute and lagunitas ipa on tap! can't really say too much as the husband and i had 2 beers and jammed out to relieve the babysitter aka my dad."}
{"text":"Live music, plenty of beer on tap, and a very happening place.  This place was packed with people however with a group of 6 we still found tables and chairs.  

I enjoyed some beers on tap, but wanted to try some food so we ordered the Copper Blues Burger.  Very good burger, fresh tasting and the bacon and cheddar hit the spot.  The fries are good, which I normally do not eat at all.  

Nothing like enjoying a nite out with friends.  Live music, great food, and plenty of drinks and beers on tap to enjoy.  We all had a great time out.  Service was great and everyone seemed pretty friendly there.  Great atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Meh.

Not a bad place, I suppose... just not that special. Great beers on tap, I'll give them that, but it's a bar experience you can have at a dozen other places, honestly. If you're already downtown for some other reason (Suns game, dbacks, etc.) it's a decent place to grab a drink and some food, but not a destination place. I'd probably flip a coin between Copper Blues and Tilted Kilt, and not really care where I ended up. (both try to over-compensate for any potential shortcomings by subscribing to the \"dudes like boobs\" theory.)

Why 2 stars? It's a mix. Service wasn't great, and I think i was just a little disappointed in the general atmosphere - I was really hoping Phoenix had actually gotten a Blues bar. This is just a bar with \"blues\" in the name. I mean, the band was playing covers of top-40 hits. I mean... really? I guess I was hoping for some kick-ass old dude sitting in a chair in dim lighting that can rip out a couple BB King tunes. Or a great jazz quartet to pound out some Miles Davis. Oh well. 

Guess I'm just sick of bars trying to pander to the hip, college / scottsdale crowd. There's such a gaping hole in the \"blues - jazz club\" scene in Phoenix  (by \"gaping hole\" i mean \"none\") and I was hoping this could help fill that hole. Guess not."}
{"text":"Ashley at the bar was friendly, fun, and had a great attitude! I come hear once a week and love seeing her! Keep her around! Beers are cold and food is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place for the live music. Food is good but pricey, though it's downtown so it's expected. Definitely don't go here to talk because the music makes it impossible. Otherwise love it!!"}
{"text":"I went here last weekend for a sister-in-law birthday. Fun atmosphere.  Great place to grab a drink, and maybe even watch the baseball game on a Sunday.The crowd  is eclectic and mixed ages, and I would say a little more toward the \"trendy\" side but not like Scottsdale crowds, and definitely not many hipsters like you normally find in Downtown venues. Casual and cool.
 They had a live band playing some good tunes, and when they were on break the music on the speakers was a lot of alternative music which I love and never hear at bars.
 I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Copper Blues.  I would definitely come here again to have some beer and cocktails.."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, food and music!!! Friendly staff. Came in on a Wednesday night. Tried the pizza and burger - both good. Kassi Jayde Band was playing - they were awesome! Definitely recommend and will come back when in the area!"}
{"text":"It is really pretty in here. The staff was ok, not overwhelmingly warm, but decent. However, the ambience is amazing!!! The beer selection is expansive and the drinks are made ok. Rachel, the bartender, is quite rude though. She totally killed our whole vibe here... Smh..."}
{"text":"Beers were good and a selection I was surprised to see (they have dogfish head 90 minute!) It's a very nice atmosphere and for an older crowd in my opinion. Seemed to be mostly late 20s early 30s"}
{"text":"Every time I go here the place is packed.  Being located in the heart of cityscape it's at a great location. There is always something going on here, live bands, comedy, and good friends."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the food. We shared a bleu cheese burger and the wedge salad along with the potato chip appetizer.  While I do think it would be difficult to mess up said items, they were very good.  Then again, perhaps it was only the depth of my hunger pangs that had me thinking so....

We dined on a Friday night before a Suns game a couple weeks ago. Since it was a busy day and time, we gave ourselves ample time to enjoy our meal.  What lured me into Copper Blues was its upstairs location which provided a beautiful view and the live music seeping out the open windows of the patio.  This place looked like the perfect spot for a beer and a burger on that mild January evening. And if the service weren't so poor, it would be. 

When we arrived at Copper Blues, there was one couple in front of us at the hostess stand and a large sign that said 'Please Wait to be Seated'.  We obliged.  We waited and waited.  There was not a host in sight so finally the couple in front of us flagged a server down who promptly sat them.  By this time, there were a few more parties in line behind us.  The server, having seen the line that had formed, I assumed would alert the necessary staff and/or return to seat the rest of us still there waiting, but she did not.  Again, we waited.  Five more minutes went by until finally, we flagged down security and he sat us- at a dirty table.  It was quickly cleaned and a smiley and sweet server approached us within a few minutes and asked for our drink order.  

We ordered a beer and 2 waters.  We got the beer, about five minutes later, and only one water.  We elected to share it and not complain.  We ordered another beer and the appetizer- potato chips and an onion and sour cream dipping sauce.  She returned about 10 minutes later with the beer and we put in our burger and salad.  Then, we did what I was beginning to see was a theme at Copper Blues- we waited.  The appetizer, which was an item that did not need to even be cooked, took 30 minutes. Then, a full hour after placing our order, our burger came out- with chips instead of fries.  We accepted it anyway and did not complain.  The salad had been forgotten but she assured us it could be out quickly.  The sweet server apologized once more. It was 10 minutes till tip off now.  We hurried through our meal and left just in time to miss only a minute or two of the game. Phew.

When we attended the Suns game the next Friday night, we went to Tilted Kilt instead.  There was not an unrealistic wait for the food and we didn't miss a minute of the game."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times before heading into standup live to watch a comedy show. I love that they always have live entertainment and it's usually pretty great artists/bands. Tons of beers on tap which is nice. They are known for their monster nachos. Come for happy hour before 6 to enjoy them at a discount!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing vibes! Definitely will be coming back to enjoy some food and a comedy show"}
{"text":"Amazing and they totally redeemed themselves!  the food was killer ! drinks were good and our service was spectacular! thank you again so much to Renè    we are very grateful how we appreciate it. Once again amazing service amazing food. Shelby was awesome."}
{"text":"Great \"Copper Blues Burger\" -- every element done perfectly!!  Fries also perfect-- and a Belgian Beer to accompany.  Band is pleasant and the scene lively."}
{"text":"We went on a VERY busy night before Super Cross. Took a while for someone to take our order and food took way too long to come out. Both managers came to our table and explained what had happened and went above and beyond to make sure we left happy. Our server was friendly and kept us updated on our food (it took quite a while). The hot food that we got was great-we especially liked the pizza and gravy fries (traditionally a Canadian food). Also-they have a ton of beers on tap. Happy hour beer and food prices and selection are great. It's worth trying this restaurant if you aren't in a hurry and want a cool place to hang out downtown."}
{"text":"Good music, not afraid of a heavy cocktail, nice staff. Great atmosphere with friendly patrons.  

Go.  Drink.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and energetic. The customer service is amazing, the food is pretty good - it's basic bar food. The beer is what I normally go there for because the happy hour is great!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey and not the best happy hour selection. Also, confusing on cider selection and slow staff. However, despite the above we had a great visit and enjoyed the music and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places downtown.  
We love live music!  In fact, musicians play on a stage above the main bar and behind the beer taps.  Sweet set up.  There is no set dance floor so expect myself and others to be dancing around your table.  Some nights there are some really great bands playing and others have the bands that play the Vegas style top 40 mash ups that I find a little strange.
The staff are super friendly and know how to mix a drink.  I can always count on Willis to serve my vodkas up right.  Not too stiff, not too weak.  A great bartender that always adds to our fun time.
The location is fantastic.  The sister to Stand Up live, across from Lucky Strike, on the second floor of CityScape, so the view on the patio of downtown at night is a winner.
I haven't ate here yet, but if the food is the same as they serve at Stand Up Live, it's pretty tasty bar fair.
It's a great choice if you're looking for a fun time downtown.  (You don't need to be a hipster to fit in either)"}
{"text":"Live band karaoke.  Holy balls this is an amazing concept.  Add in some shockingly amazing talent from some (apparently) regular karaoke stars, and you've got yourself a great way to spend Thursday night in Downtown Phoenix.  Outstanding beer selection with a competent and attractive waitstaff.  Feels like a night out!"}
{"text":"Best bar in downtown Phoenix! Love that they have themes almost every day of the week and a large selection of beers and food!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  Great place to grab a drink, and maybe even watch the game on a Sunday.  Plenty of other options nearby as well if this doesn't suit your taste, but worth checking out."}
{"text":"Copper Blues is a second story restaurant/bar located in CityScape with amazing views of the immediate area. Cute spot perfect for pre-event Happy Hour.  

Food; The Warm Pretzel Bites with dip, was good but sadly have had better.  The pretzels were a bit cold, but it was a little chilly out so it may have been waiting to be delivered for a minute.  The Filet Bites were actually very tasty, bite size steak with a pesto bloody mary sauce.

Service; The service was a bit slow, may have been shift change but she was very friendly."}
{"text":"If I could only give this place 0 stars... Also people you might want to read my review and take it into consideration since I have been working in bars  and live music venues for over six years. 

I will start with the place itself, which I think is pretty cool and I love the bands they invite there. Really good vibe, great selection of beers and liquor . That's the good side of it. 

As for the service..nah. Some bartenders are great some are pretty bitchy with horrible attitude towards you for no reason. ( I was a bartender myself, I know I haven't done anything wrong to them) 

And now l would like to share my story. One night me and my friend went to this place hoping to have a great time. As we approached the door guys, they asked us to showed them our id's, which was no problem since I am 26 and my friend is 32. I showed them brand new Arizona state drivers licence! (Brand new since I moved here from New York and had to change them). The door guy was looking at it for over one minute and said that he doesn't like my licence. No reasonable explanation. We asked to talk with a manager, whom I showed my other government issued id and he said that my licence say I am 6'2 but there is no way I am that tall. After rejecting both of my government issued Id's and telling me that is no good for a \"liquor law\" I had to leave. 
What I call that.. is overuse of \"power\". You really don't need a lot of brain to be a bar manager  really, but that was something beyond stupid. We were totally sober, looking great, just wanted to listen to some live music but some manager, who probably had a miserable day or life decided that we can't have good time. No real reason beyond that.  

Owners of that place did a great job with that place, but I would really advise on hiring a manager, who knows what he is doing and don't ruin good customer's impression on this place. 
My company were considering to throw our corporate party in the place but now I won't let that happen."}
{"text":"we came here prior to going to stand up live last night.  cool bar and staff was friendly enough. they had all sort of beers on tap if you like beer. they have a convenient feature that we used where you give the hostess your ticket and you get a pager. you grab a drink & once it's time to get seated the pager buzzes. I would probably be back when I'm in phoenix."}
{"text":"Last weekend, my boyfriend and I visited Bisbee, AZ and met a gentlemen there who told me to visit Copper Blues when I returned to Phoenix.  I'm a big beer fan, so when he said that the bar had 60 plus beers on tap, I was ready to try the place out.  

My best friend and I wandered into the bar around 8 pm on a Wednesday, and I was surprised to see many customers sitting around the bar and at tables.  We sat at the bar right in front of the stage, and the bartender greeted us promptly and took our order.  I was pleased to find some of my favorites on tap - Delirium Tremens, Lost Abbey, Chimay, etc.  For those of you who do not drink beer, they had a great liquor selection to choose from.  

I thought it would be ridiculously loud sitting at the bar once the live music got going, but I could still carry on a conversation with my friend without screaming at her.  A reggae band was on stage that night, and they were quite entertaining.  

The only thing that I really didn't enjoy was the food.  My friend and I were both quite hungry when we ordered the food, but it wasn't good enough for us to finish it even though we were starving.  We got a plate of wings and the chicken nachos.  The buffalo wings were quite salty and lacked flavor, and the honey hot wings were not hot and tasted just like honey was poured on the wings.  As for the nachos, the actual nacho chips were way to salty, the salsa didn't have any flavor, and the chicken topping was dry and cold.  

I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Copper Blues.  I would definitely visit again to have some beer and cocktails, but I know I am going to pass on the food."}
{"text":"Was rather disappointed with the vibe and attitude. This place has a really cool atmosphere, but the energy was kind of lacking. We were here on a Saturday night and the place was packed, but everyone was just sitting there with no excitement. So much potential, but missing the mark."}
{"text":"Check in for a free beer shot (shot of beer)! There are over 60 beers on tap.

Fries:
These are so good! The fries are seasoned very well and taste great by itself or with the Sriracha ranch sauce. They weren't quite as crispy as I would have liked, but for me, the seasoning made up for it. The Sriracha ranch added a nice spicy kick. I would definitely order this the next time I'm here. 

Shrimp pizza:
This was okay. The tomatoes were delightful. the dough was nice, and the sauce was savory. I just wish there was some more shrimp on the pizza and that the shrimp would taste fresher. Maybe it was just the few that I had, but the shrimp just didn't taste that fresh to me.

Atmosphere:
I was here on a Friday night, and the place was pretty full. There was a live cover band inside, which I believe was air-conditioned. It was a fun place."}
{"text":"When I was living in Phoenix this was a decent place to go to so on my visit this past weekend it wasn't anything I really questioned until Saturday night. We arrived at about 1:45a and the server was bubbly and gladly took our drink orders. We received our drinks and enjoyed our tiny bit of time we had left. At about 1:55a the server was well aware of what time it was and was still very cool and asked if we wanted one more round before it was closing time so we said sure! We ordered 2 more beers and 7 shots. The shot wasn't complicated but when she brought them back they were wrong as far as appearance so we teased the server for a discount on them because the bartender clearly messed up. She laughed with us and said she was there watching him and at least knew it was the right ingredients. As we are sipping our drinks the manager rudely comes over and makes a passive-aggressive comment in regards to us still being in the establishment despite what time it was. He simply could have asked us if we would mind wrapping it up since it was closing time instead of being a jackass about it. After his snide comment the energy in the room was just dead. We were finishing our drinks and talking amongst each other about how rude he was and how as fellow bar industry employees we would NEVER talk to clients that way especially when our employee still chose to serve them before closing. This jerkoff decides to come back over to our table and butt in our conversation with more unnecessary commentary about Arizona laws and how they've been nice to us and this that and the other. Needless to say this manager shouldn't be a manager if he doesn't know how to speak to people without being passive aggressive and unprofessional. He was a complete ass and will I suggest to everyone to seek a beer bar elsewhere so they don't have to put up with such a pathetic individual and an overall RUDE person."}
{"text":"[Solid 3 stars for food and 4...dare I say 5 stars for ambiance] 

Sooo slacking on my reviews....I have been here a few times. Mostly to drink but I have been here to eat too. They have over 60 beers on tap and others in bottles. Wines and a full bar are also available. I really love their patio with is mostly enclosed and well ventilated with ceiling fans but if you need to be cooler go into the main bar area and enjoy the entertainment from a live band or karaoke (with a live band) that sits up behind the taps at the main bar. 

I have found the servers to be rather attentive and friendly. But each time I have been there they have not been \"slammed\". 

The last time I ate here I tried their beets and greens salad with candied pecans. I would have preferred the goat cheese crumbled on the salad with the pecans and not watered down in the \"dressing\" that coated the salad. It would have been much better with a light champagne or even balsamic vinaigrette. Underwhelmed and slightly disappointed I ate the beets out of my salad and half the greens. It was quite a generous portion. My dining companions both opted for the pulled pork Cuban sandwich, which they both seemed to enjoy. 

I work and live near by and I have and will continue to go back and enjoy my occasional happy hour, lunch or late night at Copper Blues...."}
{"text":"Very decent cover band pub with an excellent array on tap (including a decent cider selection) with very decent local coverage and a good selection of the 'in' pretentious imports to make the self-appointed cognoscenti feel special.  The food's typical bar fare, but not bad for that, and suffices reasonably for the venue.  The ambiance is excellent (consistent with the venue again) with an excellent location and situation (upstairs, windows, central venue...with several other entertainment businesses right by).  The cover bands have been very good and the crowds 'fun'.  I have been on several occasions,    drop by fairly regularly,  and consider it the 'go to'  local joint for the casual drink or two and a listen....or a brew and a nosh....  Recommended for the 'drinks and music' deal, for sure.  A special experience would depend on the circumstances, but for a decent and honest set-up, Copper Blues provides an excellent and consistent product.  Service can be inconsistent, but in my experience it's varied from fair to excellent...hey guys...it's a busy urban bar scene...don't be so farkin' 'precious'!    

Recommended meet for drinks and nosh, listen to some tunes, downtown pub.  Some of the covers are good enough to go just for them...."}
{"text":"We went here Saturday night.  The band was awesome."}
{"text":"I visited Copper Blues because it is right next to Stand Up Live. My friends and I came here on a Thursday evening before our comedy show started. We were a party of six and seated right away! Service was quick which was awesome since I was so worried about the line for the show after. 

We shared a few appetizers: nachos with chicken, spinach and artichoke dip and crispy chicken wings (sweet chili). We destroyed each of them because they were so delicious! I am generally not a fan of nachos, believing its like eating roulette. You either get a great chip or a plan chip; however, these nachos were absolutely fantastic I would definitely get them again! Each plate had a good portion for sharing and none of us were disappointed!

I ordered the Strawberry Fields drink which looks gorgeous but I will warn that it was quite strong. The good news is I definitely know alcohol was in it and I think the bartender must have had a heavy pour. Can't complain when you get your moneys worth!

Overall it was a great vibe with loud music, good service and tasty dishes - I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Copper Blues was a random find prior to a DBacks game. Pure Awesomeness. A veritable sea of beers to choose from!

Hoh. So. Happy! 
(Shoot me. I'm biased. I never met a beer I didn't like.)

Warning! The entire bar area is first come, first serve seating. So pony up soon! Those seats fill fast. 

Happy Hour makes everyone happy. Right? But before a DBacks game you can score big! M-F, 3-6pm make everyone happy! (Have no fear, weekends happiness abounds. Just 4-6pm.)

$3 Pints (Domestic & Local)
$4 Pints (Crafts)
$5 Call Cocktails 
$3 House Wines

I initially offered a $1 beer shot. THEN I learned it was a way to explore different types of beer. Cool-i-o. 

They also have a neat set of specialty drink on special called Rocktails and Rocktinis. They looked beautiful, but for another time. I'm a BEER drinker!

With beer, you (meaning, I) had to indulge with the following:
- \"Pub Chips\" are actually potato chips layered w/blue cheese & hot sauce. You haven't drank a beer until you've tried this. Seriously. So simple and oh so good.
 
- Fried shrimp = We shared, otherwise I might have licked all the mayonnaise stuff.
(Did I just say that out loud? ;)

Oh, before I forget! The servers in their trendy little vests were a hoot! Both times! Great service. Seems like a neat place to catch live music. It's on my list to try again on a non-game day, perhaps before a comedy show. 

Thx Copper Blues!"}
{"text":"Great food, SO. MANY. BEERS on tap, incredibly friendly staff. Thursday nights is the longest running live band karaoke show in PHX, with The Instant Classics taking the helm. Unrelated to my review of this place, but still, totes worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Sierra our server was wonderful always smiling really outgoing friendly always walking by asking if we are good even though it's super busy. We came to our friends birthday to celebrate.  The server Cindy in their section was really rude and terrible customer service.  We been here before and always had outgoing fun servers and bartenders but this other server treated the group really rude.  I'm giving a 3 star because our server was wonderful but lost the others because of the ones terrible attitude.  Place was fun with great music as always, and is clean."}
{"text":"We caught the tail end of the live band performance here and instead got the sterotypical LMFMAO song playing.  Seems to be a nice little place with a cool view of the city.  I bet it is nice in the evenings when the sun sets.  Service here was good even though it was a busy Saturday night.  I can't speak for the food since I did not try it.  The place has two rooms, one with the stage and another seperate room.  Lots of tables in both it seemed."}
{"text":"Not sure about the older reviews....this business has picked up a lot since 2012. I was here a few times this past November and December and it was really dead then. No cover, talented bands, but far from blues...and a huge variety of beers on tap (e.g. Bell's Oberon from near my hometown). Typically a nice mix of people here. Copper Blues reminds me of Martini Ranch minus the thugs and UFC wannabe types in the Shaker Room. (remember when that place was cool?)

I was here last night (Thursday) around 11.30 and saw a decent crowd, but it certainly was not packed. I noticed it picks up some patrons leaving the comedy club when that lets out. This bar/club is probably not for everyone but might be worth checking out if you're in the area or plan to come downtown for a weekend."}
{"text":"Superb job by the Copper Blues staff during last night's grand opening. The crowd was asses to elbows but we never waited terribly long for snacks or drinks. When you consider it was a hosted bar and the girls probably weren't making a ton of money in tips their effort becomes even more admirable. 
If you like a beer selection that runs 60+ deep, eclectic music, a killer patio with Downtown views, and wading in a sea of attractive people, odds are strong you'll have a good experience at Copper Blues. It really is a beautiful space with exposed ceilings, rich wood floors, gorgeous bars areas, and sumptuous attended bathrooms. 
Aaron May's menu is still a bit of an unknown based on last night's samplers but it's hard to doubt the man responsible for so many restaurant successes (Vitamin T, Over Easy, Mabel's On Main, etc.). The big man was in attendance last night overseeing the finger food service, which included caprese on crackers (meh), meatballs (strong), tuna tartare (spicy and delicious) and sweet pea guacamole (five stars). I'm looking forward to getting busy with one of his entrees soon.
Copper Blues is a big win for Downtown."}
{"text":"Bands are always good but it's a very tight place because they have some many tables. Forget trying to dance. You're stuck between the tables and bar. 

As far as the bartender staff: Rude. I don't know what their problems are but they act like miserable girls. Maybe one was nice. Will ignore you on purpose and are just uncouth. Maybe it's different if you're a male customer. In my case - No tip for you!"}
{"text":"Best place downtown for sexy music, sexy staff, and strong drinks! The Instant Classics will blow your mind!!"}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place - live music, fun to sit at before you see a comedy show next door. The food was tasty. My only complaint is that the service was ssssslllllooooooowwww. It took over an hour to get our appetizer of chips. They were delicious, but it should not have taken an hour. Other than that, great beer selection on tap. Hopefully the service improves with time."}
{"text":"This one was tough to pick out the 'rating number' for... as it's been mixed. The food has been good. Fairly typical bar food but with a twist of sophistication. They also have a humongous beer selection!! 

If you sit AT one of the bars - the bartenders there are HILARIOUS and super helpful... one of the gals even mixed two beers for me to make a delicious blueberry oatmeal one for me... LOVE her for that! (And guys - the lady bartenders here are SUPER cute!) Whenever I've sat at a table in the evening to watch the bands the service is really slow, which is too  bad. I've actually left CBL because drinks have gone so long without being filled. Last time I was here with a gf of mine, we waited (after waving her down) over half an hour for our check. Bleh. 

I say visit CBL, watch the awesome groups/bands they have FROM THE BAR... or sit at the outside bar and find some fun entertainment from those bartenders. Of course I'll be back because it's as neat place! Check em out!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once, on an early Sunday evening after a few friends and I walked over after a D-Backs game. It was before the evening comedy show crowd arrived. This is the reason I listed noise as average, as I wasn't there when live music was playing. 

I like the setup of the place, with an outer bar area in an all glass area; gorgeous view of downtown. The interior bar, like the outer bar, has over 50 (I think around 60) taps. They have everything from your mass-brewed American lagers/pilsners (PBR, Bud, Coors, Miller, etc) and a good selection for the beer geek/snob (Sierra Nevada, Stone, Dogfish Head, etc). If you (over several visits) choose to consume one of each, you get two VIP tickets to Stand-Up Live (the attached comedy club). The interior bar area has some different style seating arrangements (booths that face towards the bar, high seat tables, and a nice wraparound bar by all the taps. There are a couple of TVS for sporting events and whatnot, but this is meant more for background sites than to be that place you go to hear the commentators during a game (I don't get the impression this place is meant to be the hangout during the game, but a great after game spot). 

The food was very good, we had a cheese pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, basil oil (tasty). We also got to try a Cuban sandwich pizza; that's right, if you love the pork, cheese (Swiss), and pickles of a Cuban sandwich, you will LOVE this pizza. Overall the beer and food rate from a 4-5. 

The owner (who spoke to me and my friends about our first impressions), Peder the head chef, and the on duty manager (Michelle?) were very friendly and answered all our questions. Breanne (sp?) was a very nice, and knowledgeable server. All of the waitstaff was very nice to my friends and I, even when we started to wear out our welcome. 


I enjoyed my time here and look forward to going back to complete my beer list. I want to come here during a lunch, and during live music/weekend to make sure I have a complete picture of the place before giving it a five. However, my first impressions are that I will ultimately do just that."}
{"text":"Came in on a slow night, took thirty minutes just to get our drinks. The staff spent more time chatting together then taking care of the customer. Ended up just paying for our drinks and leaving"}
{"text":"Average.  I went for dinner, not drinks, and the food was unimpressive.  The bloody mary was served with a slim jim straw, which was different to say the least.  It seems this place is all about image, but not about substance."}
{"text":"This place has good food but they have shitty service and skimp on the fries! They literally give you just shy of a handful of fries when you order them as your side! I truly think they count them out, \"8 fries per plate\". I don't think it would be so bad if fries weren't provided at an additional cost.  It's considered an \"upgrade\" to your meal, they are at an additional cost.  If you're really  hungry or thirsty, then prepare to starve and dehydrate because the wait staff takes AT LEAST 3-5 mins before acknowledging the fact that you've sat at a table, despite the fact that someone has walked past you a couple of times. I can't tell if they're prejudice or just suck!
I have a love hate relationship with this place. Keep up the good job with your food but please have meetings with and/or change your wait staff to those who care about the patrons who come to enjoy food, drinks and live music! I hope to get the attn of the manager or owner with this review!"}
{"text":"The service is slow at times.  Great happy hour prices and selection."}
{"text":"If it's a Saturday night, then it's likely you'll find me at Copper Blues. With 64 beers on tap, ranging from locals to domestics to seasonals, there's a brew for everybody! They even carry Red Bridge in the bottle, which is great for us Gluten-Free'ers! There are cover bands every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday night, and you never quite know what you're going to get! 

The food is amazing! If you're a mac 'n cheese fan, you would be amiss not to experience this dish. They're also happy to make minor substitutions to swap out pita bread with corn chips for us gluten sensitive people. So while many items on the menu may not be gluten-free friendly, the staff seems happy to substitute.

You can always find a table inside or outside, and the service is always great."}
{"text":"4 stars for the atmosphere and live band.  Don't come with an appetite.  Saying the food menu is limited is an understatement.  Avoid the ribs in their Bigger Bites menu.  (See picture of ribs and my hungry hulk-like friend in the blue shirt.)  However, the manager on duty was really nice and made sure my friend didn't leave hungry.  Overall, good environment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place if you want to go somewhere to JUST dance to live music (not talk to anyone) and you own a pair of earplugs.

I came here on a Friday night to hang out with some friends.  We wanted to sit inside because it was a hot night and we needed A/C but it was SO LOUD in there with the live band... wayyyy too loud.  Even if you weren't interested in talking to anyone else and just wanted to listen to the music, it was so loud that it was hurting my eardrums!

So we decided to suffer through the heat and sit on the patio, because at least it was slightly quieter out there.  It was still really difficult to talk to anyone though!  And the high-top table we were sitting at was very unstable!  I went to put my elbows on the table and the whole thing tipped over and would've fallen to the ground had we not caught it.  Good thing there were no drinks on it yet!

We left after about 10 minutes bc it was just too loud to communicate with our friends and too warm out on the patio.... I guess I'm just getting too old for places like this... but I'm still in my 20s!"}
{"text":"Copper Blues is so fun & a great place to bring friends to listen to music or grab HH. Everyone is nice & provides great service."}
{"text":"The server was super nice and accommodating! She always had a smile and made us welcomed. The food was so delicious, we order several appetizers and none of the disappointed! We will be back for the live band kareoke!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at a table for over 15 minutes, my wife got up and spoke with someone. They then brought the menu over 5 minutes, we weren't allowed to ordered with her and she said the waitress would be over. Well waited a total of 20+ minutes and no service, we left and didn't order any food. No one apologized or even cared we waited. Horrible impression and horrible service."}
{"text":"Great to start or spend the night away at. Live music is always great and excellent service. 

Large selection of beers on tap. Lots of seating and a shuffle board table. 

 One indoor and 1 outdoor bar. 

I usually just come in for the drinks so I'm not very familiar with the food here.

Small crowd or large l, tou will have a great time here for sure."}
{"text":"I won't be going back to this place.  I went here while waiting for my show to start at Stand Up Live, the comedy club next door that has the same owner.  There was a live band playing that was playing soooooo incredibly loud.  The place is only so big, but the band was playing like they were at Madison Square Garden."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! I am a huge fan of live music & a big beer snob, so I was thrilled to find a great band & a huge craft beer selection at this funky joint! Service was friendly and quick, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Copper Blues and see Ashley,  it makes me feel like they need to change the name of this establishment to golden blues. Because she always makes her guests feel like gold. Leticia is alright too"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the live music was fantastic! It's a place almost anyone would enjoy, the vibe was on point."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bit of imbibing and light dinner before heading to the comedy club next door. Great service, 60 beers on tap, and a good menu. All I could smell coming in to this place were the nachos and they did not disappoint. Loved the veggie ciabatta sandwich and the house chips as well. Our friend had one of the burgers and he said it was terrific. Loved the vibe here, lots of seating choices and standing too if you're so inclined. I could see that this place might be busy busy on a weekend, but it was pretty fair for a Thursday evening. Might be one of my new favorites downtown and I'm planning to head back one night for live karaoke. Fun."}
{"text":"They had a good drink special going on for local beers but it seemed like everything was out. The bartender suggested a beer and I liked it. Didn't stay very long, a little too uptight and stuffy for our group. But it seemed like a cool place to hang out. Staff was attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Copper Blues has been on top of our list of happy hour places after work, and has proven to be a solid establishment for that purpose. This weekend, as part of our Drinko de Mayo festivities (which involved going to predominately Irish pubs to order margaritas), this place topped the charts. Seriously, the margaritas here were crazy good. And you get to take the skull tequila bottle home with you.

The servers are consistently amiable. The beers are always incredible. And the music last night, as in most nights, was stellar."}
{"text":"This place has all the beer you can think of. Great music and amazing service. Came here on a busy night and that didn't stopped them from giving the amazing service I alway receive. Try the strawberry blonde beer it's a really good lite beer."}
{"text":"I have been to Copper Blues a couple times and I don't anticipate returning.

On the last visit, we came by with the first ever George & Dragon Toga Pub Crawl.  

Our group was pretty respectful, despite most of us having had a few.  Still, we showed up with cash, credit and great attitudes.  

The waitstaff ignored many of us.  One waitress actually pushed me out of the way when I was waiting at the bar for a drink and told me \"you guys need to find seats.\"  I wasn't blocking any walkway, so I think someone just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  

The prior visit to Copper Blues offered me similarly cold/nonexistent service, so I've got a poor taste in my mouth.  

Sad, because I love Stand Up Live and Copper Blues was so much more promising than Lucky Strike."}
{"text":"Great staff and live music most nights. The bartenders are very friendly and the tap list is the main attraction here. There's no shortage of beer selections and there's always something new to try. Try coming during happy hour, the food is delicious as well. The nachos are massive and delicious at $9 during HH!"}
{"text":"This is a really chill spot especially if you are a beer drinker.  They have 60 beers to choose from and the atmosphere is super chill.  I had the time of my life with the live music.  The crowd is fun and everyone that works there is really cool.  This will definitely be my new spot Friday nights."}
