{"text":"Tried out this cute place Rosemont. They serve a mix of Vietnamese specialities including Bahn mi sandwiches and Venezuelan ones, like Arepas. We tried the Vietnamese iced coffee to start which was really good. Then had an Arepa with pulled beef, plantains, cheese, and beans. It was served with an avocado sauce. It was pretty excellent. Much better than the others Ive tried in this city. Only downfall was that it took at least 30 minutes. I then took the caramelised beef Banh mi to go. It may have been because I didnt eat it fresh on the spot but that was a little disappointing. There was too much bread compared to meat, but to be fair that is almost always the case when it comes to banh mi's I find. The meat could of been a little more tender as well , and would of liked more pickled carrots/daikon. I will for sure go back and try another one though and eat it on the spot. Overall it was a good find and glad we tried it."}
