{"text":"I have an extremely picky wife when it comes to food. Three kids, who all have different tastes. Went here for the first time and they all loved it! The Pork Fried Rice was great. The family meals easily feed two people. We ate inside the restaurant and after our meal for the five of us, which was about $37, I went to buy a 2 liter soda, and they gave it to me for free. We had Sweet and Sour Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Bone in Rib meals. All were excellent. With the family meal you get Won Tong Soup, which was really good, an egg roll, pork fried rice, and your entree. Some of the meals aren't part of the cheaper family dinner, like the Bone in Rib or the Boneless Ribs, but you can still get those as a meal, just not the family dinner meals. Finally, one of our real tests is the \"after\" effect. Will any of us five suffer from explosive diarrhea or get ill while eating, or later on that night, or the next day. Well, three days later, and none of us five had any of those symptoms. We had lots of food left over, and after eating the left overs, still no one was ill. This is a great spot that I highly recommend for the quality, quantity and price."}
{"text":"Delicious every time! Fast delivery and good prices. I recommend the won ton soup and chicken with broccoli."}
{"text":"I received a menu under the door of my Apartment for this Restaurant last Sunday on June 2. After reviewing the menu, I got hungry for good Chinese and since I hadn't eaten, I decided to take a walk and enjoy some Chinese food. After I figured out I needed to order at the counter, (The cashier did not speak very good English) I ordered combination style Cashew Chicken which included Pork Fried Rice and an Egg Roll. It was quick, had great prices, and delicious. The rice was wonderful and the Cashew Chicken was great and had plenty of Cashews   The restaurant does have tables but no wait service. I  defiantly would return for a meal. Good value for someone on a budget like myself."}
{"text":"This is the best take-out Chinese I've had in the Cleveland area. It is reasonably priced, ready on time, and is flavorful without asking for extra spicy. The food is better than many of the more expensive, sit-down Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great value and reliable.  Nothing amazing, but just plain good.  Lakewood, as a city has a lot of great dinning, but is weak in Chinese food. So this place is our go-to Chinese DELIVERY.  I have never been amazed, but I have never been disappointed.   The prices are very reasonable and the service is good.  We have tried several other places and Peking is the one for us."}
{"text":"There is nothing so soothing as hearing, once you dial, the sweet sounds of: \"Peking. Meh I hep you\".   The folks here do a fine job of rustlin' up quick, inexpensive Americanized Chinese food.   Spend $15 bucks and get a free 2 liter of soda."}
{"text":"Take out Chinese is one of those things that seems homogeneous and commodified, but somehow still has quirks and a lot of variety.  Maybe its because there is no real franchise model in the industry, but dishes and presentation varies.  Still, nobody expects Chinese take-out to be surprising or inspired.  It's a fast food staple in American culture.  All we expect is decent food, a lot of it, and quick and reliable service.  In all of those areas, Peking shines.  The food is very stereotypical New York style Chinese food, with plenty of General Tsao's chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork.  The fried rice, egg rolls, and egg drop soup are all very solid, while most variations of \"deep friend chicken bits\" are tender, with a not-too thick coating.  The sweet and sour pork is caked with breading, so avoid unless you are trying to bulk up.  For the standard fare, they do a good job.  They do have some other fun dishes as well.  My favorite are the Mei Fun dishes.  Little more than thin noodles with veggies and a meat, they are flavorful without being deep fried.  If you're leaning towards \"deep friend meat in a sauce,\" try the Sesame Beef chef's plate.  Yes, it's not a combo plate and you have to order your own egg roll, but if you want something different but nonthreatening, it's a great choice.  Like any good take-out, you get more than any healthy person should eat at a sitting.  It doesn't stop me, but yelpers who aren't binge eating will probably have left overs.  They also do a good job of packaging the food so that it arrives without too much spilling. Prices are very reasonable. and you can track down a menu for some decent coupons!  Service is the hidden secret to good takeout.  Aside from one lady, most of the counter staff have good enough English to take your order without too much hassle.  I've always gotten what I ordered, and it's often ready faster than they estimate.  Delivery is solid, although that wait can be longer, especially on the weekends.    Overall, if you like take-out Chinese, the Peking is a great option.  Reliable, fast, and competent, with a few twists in the menu to offer something new to people tired of General Tso's chicken."}
{"text":"I really like this place, their food is very very good and I have come here for years. The service sucks when the one particular woman is working  the counter; she is BEYOND rude, but everyone else there gives good customer service and even better food. I go ONLY for the food because you'll never now what you're going to get service wise."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around! Love the lo mein and wonton soup. They're always so nice there. You can also order online!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese in Lakewood. I've tried several others and hated them.  Our orders are always precise and made very quickly. This restaurant allows you to order online which I like to take advantage of since it is easier to customize anything vs. phone ordering. I did not give them 5 stars just because this is typical Chinese food and it's not gourmet or over the top but still always good. 6 year customer and counting."}
{"text":"Love Peking restaurant! I have been getting food from here for years and it's always yummy. The fried rice is delicious! I've tried all the other Chinese place in Lakewood and Peking is the best by far."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place for years. Efficient delivery and great prices.   I stopped in last week to pick up an order and as I stood at the counter waiting, one of the workers dropped one of their complimentary small bags of fried noodle on the floor. She picked that bag up and threw it back into the box containing all the other bags they drop into your order. And then she looked over her shoulder and saw me watching, and turned away. I'll never eat at this place again because of this. If they're doing things like this when customers are around, what are they doing when no one is watching?"}
{"text":"Quick, great prices, and delicious! Been going here for the last 15 years and regret when I try somewhere else. Best Chinese food in Lakewood! Oh, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Good food, big portions and very prompt.  The 2 meals with pop for under $20 is a great deal. They always give fried rice with sweet & sour chicken, even when you request white rice.  Also, they do not have spicy mustard like other Chinese places have.  Otherwise it's legit."}
{"text":"Typical carbon copy of all the other take-out Chinese restaurants in Lakewood.  It's not bad, but it's hard to mess up food when most of it is pulled from the freezer and reheated."}
{"text":"I regularly order lunch delivery from Peking.  They are usually pretty fast and the order is accurate.  Food is good for your standard Americanized Chinese delivery.  They have become my go to Chinese delivery restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like cheap traditional Chinese food, this is the place to go! We tried every place in lakewood and me and my wife get this probably 3 times a month! We would recommand this place to our friends in lakewood but I would replace it for your favorite chinese place in your city, just best in lakewood that delivers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese takeout place in Lakewood. Sure, its not super high quality nor much different from any other generic numbered-menu-item Chinese delivery, but they are fast, friendly, and consistent. I like my General Tso's Chicken on the crispy side and that is how they make it here."}
{"text":"Peking is my go to Chinese food restaurant of choice. With all the numerous places you can get your Chinese food fix at in Lakewood, Peking has been turning out to be my 1st pick. When I first moved to Lakewood I literally tried just about every Chinese restaurant there was to offer in the area. Peking won hands down. The workers are very nice and polite."}
{"text":"I lived a block away and if i called an order in they would have it ready by the time I would walk there. Amazing food for the price!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the food. Meaning, you are not going to bite into anything on this menu (huge selection though very similar from one dish to another) and say \"that's the best such and such I've ever had!\" You're not going to write a banging review of the Po Po platter (I keep reading it as poo poo platter).  It is a hole in the wall that serves take out who DELIVERS! That's what the third star is for. When the lazy me and the lactose intolerant me gang up on the \"I want to eat healthy\" me= my phones speed dials Peking automatically. I think they deliver all over Lakewood and some areas in Rocky River."}
{"text":"I liked the food nothing special, but its ok. I'd orderer again cheap and u get a 2 litter coke if u spend 20 dollars best chinese food in lakewood, hands down!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to screw up take-away Chinese food, but this place sure is trying. Things that should be crispy are soggy. Dishes that should be spicy are bland. The proteins are small or nonexistent. The service is poor, from sharp responses to hanging up on calls. It's fine in a late-night pinch, but don't go out of your way for this."}
{"text":"My family has been getting Take out from this great little place for years, every Friday night.  The food is consistent, tasty and fast!  We always order over the phone and can drive right there and pick it up. Family faves are the steamed dumplings, (the secret's in the sauce), Shrimp Mei Fun and Crab Rangoon.   Delicious and NOT loaded with celery/Bok Choy as filler.  Ingredients are fresh and tasty.   Only once was our order missing an item. When we discovered this, my husband called them and they drove it to our home!  Now that's good service!  Many other Chinese food places seem to have great food when they first open and after a month or two it is all celery and veggie filler.  This little spot has delivered the goods for many years. See you Friday."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant, the food is always tasty and hot.  I usually order from them once a week and never disappoints.  Plus the employers are always nice and funny."}
{"text":"Really good chicken lo mein. I think this is the cheapest Chinese I've found in the area; with super fast delivery! Guy on the phone could be friendlier though."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Fresh, tasty and fast. Great Chinese take out! Always my go to and I'm always more than satisfied."}
{"text":"This is the only place that I've been where I've liked their food. I hated Chinese food for the longest time and then my boyfriend ordered from here. Their pork fried rice is my favorite but we also get the wonton soup and the steamed dumplings. If you order some of the meals make sure you ask for the sauce on the side and add according to how you like it. This place is worth checking out for the picky Chinese eater."}
{"text":"Been going here for years for great \"hole in the wall\" Chinese but I sometimes wonder if the people working there now are on drugs. They forget what you order and stare at you with a blank face when you don't want what they happen to bring."}
{"text":"Hah! What was I thinking? I strayed to another delivery place and regretted it. I won't be so foolish again. I've returned to the Peking. 20 minutes and I'm happy again. They are fast, dependable and pleasant. You won't go wrong. I'm give them an extra star for promptness."}
{"text":"Even though peking is convenient for me, i would still probably go out of my way to get some of their take-out. I know when you walk in to peking you will be drawn towards the General tso chicken...however, I STRONGLY ADVISE that you fight that urge to order, even though there is nothing wrong with the generals chicken (it is actually quite good, i get it extra spicy) you must order their PORK FRIED RICE. easily some of the best pork fried rice I've ever had. Its not greasy, just full flavor, its made perfectly. i cant stress the quality of their rice enough!  Furthermore i usually get shrimp lo mein, friend dumplings and wonton soup....oh yea the wontons are incredible. at just $2.70 for a quart, you can be your bottom dollar that I add one of those bad boys on to every order that i make.  I don't drink the stuff but after $15 you get a free 2 liter. even if you are under $15 and ask. they sometimes just give it to you. Awesome place always friendly. Chow down west end."}
