{"text":"Best lasagne I've ever had. One man shop. Simple but simply amazing. Better than your moms !!"}
{"text":"I was craving lasagne and I'm so glad I found this place really close to where I was staying! I think most of the business they do is take-home-and-heat-up-yourself lasagne and catering but of course you can also eat it in the shop. One hearty serving was about $9 and a double serving was (I think) $13, so it is a good deal to get the bigger size and either share with a loved one or have leftovers to eat the next day. They have three kinds of lasagne at a time and the kinds change each week and use seasonal ingredients (for example, eggplants in August). When I visited there was veggie, meat with red sauce, and meat with rosé sauce. I ordered the veggie and waited about 20 minutes for it to be heated up. I chatted with the owner while I waited and he was really nice. The lasagne was heavenly. It tasted really home-made, hearty, well-balanced, and fresh. It was very saucy and cheesy with perfect little pieces of zucchini and carrot. I will definitely come back and try the vegan lasagne that he told me about!"}
{"text":"Tried to go here and this place is either out of business  or has the worst business hours in the history of restaurants.  I recently found out that this place is closed 3 days out of the week!! I didn't believe this, I thought it must have been a mistake. Nope! It really does have these business hours.   I wish I could say I will go back and try again, but the likelihood of this place being open is pretty remote."}
{"text":"À manger sur place ou pour emporter (excellent dépanneur pour la famille!). Sauce tomate maison délicieuse. Les lasagnes sont savoureuses et réconfortantes et leur prix est raisonnable (ce qui ne court pas les rues dans le Plateau). Très sympathique"}
{"text":"I live nearby and recently had a chance to try this place out. Sublime lasagna, really affordably priced, friendly and quick service. If you're thinking about standard take-out fare this evening, give this a shot instead. You won't be disappointed.  Since my initial visit, have been back many times - staple in the neighbourhood if you're looking for tasty comfort food."}
{"text":"Great lasagne that really hits the spot! Service was very friendly and the lasagna is fresh and well priced. Will definitely return!!"}
