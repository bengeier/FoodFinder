{"text":"Super impressed with service, food & drinks. We went only 4 days after they opened & you never would have known. Kudos to the management & training that was provided to the staff. Went back 2 weeks later & same experience. I definitely recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here randomly. Sat at the bar and had some drinks and dinner and It was amazing. Would never guess that It had been opened less than a week. Had great quick service at the bar and the pizza and salad came out quick and perfect temps. This will definitely become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Atmosphere, food and staff great!
Had lunch inside a couple days ago and back to sit on a sectional on the patio for a drink. Heaters in place for the evening chill. And our 11 year old loves also!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a solid selection of cocktails.  Say on the patio and had dinner and drinks. Lots of TVs for football. Menu has a nice variety."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks, server pressured my girlfriend and I to conclude night so she could receive credit for service and gratuity before her shift was over. She created uncomfortable vibe and rushed feeling, would not recommend to friend"}
{"text":"Received a coupon in the mail, we live nearby, so decided to come and try it out. Love the decor, firefighter theme and red white and blue. A little uncomfortable inside, as the windows/garage doors are opened. I can hear the a/c working overtime. Please close the doors. 108 outside. Service was awesome, not a full house but multiple waitresses teaming together to refill our waters. Food was delish. We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This was fantastic! Ate at the bar. Emily and Derek were superb!! Service was fast and friendly. Food was spectacular. Bursting with flavor!"}
{"text":"Terrible service - waited on a beer and took over 15 minutes from the time I ordered - then waitress didn't even apologize - it was not even busy.  I watched two couples sit down and wait to be served and they got up and walked next door to get better service.  I spoke to manager but he didn't ever say he addressed the poor service with his staff.  Offered to give me a gift card but I said we were from out of town.  Will never be back!"}
{"text":"This nice little sports cafe that has an excellent atmosphere has the worst food in Scottsdale!  They will have to fix the kitchen or they will quickly go out of business.  I feel bad for the server whom was friendly and attentive, she can't help the fact that at 7:30 they are out of their signature dishes much less the food quality was atrocious!  Dried up rotisserie chicken, under cooked pork loin, and a salty pizza.   There are way too many great restaurants in Scottsdale to compete with.  Word of advice:  Fire the chef!
This place blows and you can tell by the fact that they are half full on a Friday night in Scottsdale when every other place is packed.  This place will not make it in until the end of the year unless they improve the food quality!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant service in Scottsdale. Went here yesterday and asked for a table for three. They said \"we have no tables.\" There were a plethora of open tables so I said I see plenty of open tables currently can you help me understand why we can't be seated. Again the man stated we have no tables available. I proceeded to take opentable app out on my phone and make a reservation for 7:00pm for 3 people successfully right there. It was 6:45pm. I held up my phone and said \"if you have no tables why was I able to make a reservation for 15 minutes from now on open table?\" I said \"should we just wait 15 minutes until you can seat us?\" Again the man replied with \"we don't have any tables for you.\" I asked to speak to a manager to which the man replied with an attitude \"I am the manager.\" I am a manager at a 5 diamond resort in Scottsdale and I have a degree in hospitality management. This is NOT how you treat your guests and not how you respond to people wishing to dine at your establishment. I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to any of my clients or any person in general. I will be telling everyone I can possible tell about this horrible experience. Your management really needs to take this review seriously and do some reflecting or your restaurant isn't going to last very long."}
{"text":"Great location, helpful staff and good choices on the menu. I would have given them four stars if the beers on tap had more of a selection. Overall not a bad place to come in and sit outside for some food and a drink."}
{"text":"Third time trying this place, third time is not a charm.  Did not eat this time because the food is below average.  Wanted to sit at the bar and have a drink and watch a game.  Bar service was ok but one of the members of the hostess staff felt necessary to make a rude comment on a game I was playing on my phone as she walked by.  Another testament to the poor quality of the employees and management here.  If you are thinking about trying this place for the first time, do yourself a favor and go anywhere else in Old Town other than here."}
{"text":"Immediate seating with nice waiting staff. Food was good and quick. Manager checked on table twice. I like indoor/outdoor seating. For very competitive area, it was a nice surprise. Probably will go back to watch a game or hang outside."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great atmosphere.  Food and customer service is excellent.  I had the pleasure of coming here for a soft opening.  The pizza is terrific, but start out with skillet shrimp (incredible).  I also got to have the spinach con queso as well.  Great view of TVs for everyone.  Please see bartenders Cherina and Julie.  They will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"This place is head over heals better than Cold Beers Cheeseburger which is next door. You will mot be disappointed. Excellent food quality  as well as the service and bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ate a late lunch here, great atmosphere and location! Sat outside. The food is excellent! The Nashville Chicken and Burger both great. Save room for the apple pie and ice cream dessert. Salmon appetizer also excellent."}
{"text":"A buddy of  mine and stopped in yesterday (veterans day). I'm a veteran and I was surprised to see there was no recognition of the holiday if not for the easy publicity and, you know, the whole America theme... 

We immediately noticed the excessive pricing but figured it must be worth it. I ordered an $8 orange blossom which came in a can and my biddy got a $12 margarita that had way too much lime which made it undrinkable. 

Unfortunately it's just another one of \"those places\" with the least amount of effort put forth knowing that they can just sit back, provide excessively priced chain restaurant level food. 

The extra star is strictly for our kick ass waitress."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time back and first review. 
Very happy with the decisionTo have a New Year's eve dinner at:  Famous 48! 
All five of us had fantastic dishes.  
Our server Riley was top notch.  Catered to all of our needs."}
{"text":"This place was very cute inside.  They have dim warm lights and some cozy booths to sit in while you enjoy the pop country music.  They were very slow the day I went so I expected the service to be faster.  I also thought portions would be more sizable to the price of each item but it wasn't too disappointing.  I would have preferred to get the lunch menu but because we went around 1:30-2pm, they were only serving the brunch menu which limited our options quite a bit.  If I ever came back it would most likely be more nighttime and for the full menu instead.  To end on a better note, checking in here have us a $5 discount so overall it was not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Went at night and for brunch and loved it both times! Great food & drinks with a great & friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I first went with a 4-star rating but then I had to remember how great service was at the bar. My bartender definitely made sure that my cup was not empty and I like that it's been a long time since I received. I don't remember her name. I had the short rib Fry's and Men I tell you they were good. I will definitely be visiting this place again it is so much on the list that I want to try I definitely want to try the waffles mac and cheese sounds pretty interesting and they do have a great Happy Hour which is a plus because I like to drink and then eat"}
{"text":"The newest spot on Scottsdale Road may also be one of the priciest. I stopped in for lunch the other day and while I enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the food a Spicy Chicken sandwich, fries and a Coke shouldn't cost almost $20!

I do like the set-up with large open doors and a patio looking out on Scottsdale Road. There is a good mix of high-top tables and booths inside along with bar seating and the aforementioned patio.

The service was excellent with the hostess seating me and my waitress being very attentive. They've only been open for a week so the restaurant wasn't crowded and it did seem a bit odd that at 50 I appeared to be one of the youngest customers there for lunch. Maybe there was an AARP special that I missed or something.

As for the food, my server recommended the Nashville Hot Chicken which was good, but not nearly as spicy as she represented it to be. The fries were also good and she kept the refills coming on my soda.

Honestly, if the prices were a bit more reasonable I would consider going back, but considering there are numerous other options in the area, I will likely spend my hard-earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"GET THE WINE BREAD. If you like cheese, bread and wine... This is your heaven. We also got the deviled eggs as an app- it was ok but seemed too yolky and not creamy. I got the famous 48 pizza which was huge. So I took most of it home but it was good. My husband got the braised rib sandwich (not sure the name). He said it was really good and super filling. Overall nice vibe and great set up!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed a guitarist/singer.  It is an open style bar/restaurant with several TVs tuned to sports events.
The menu is limited but the items that we had were excellent.  The southwest egg rolls were outstanding.
The staff were very friendly and accommodating.
The only reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 stars is due to the lack of misters.  It is getting warm outside and since two of the four walls open up to outside it was starting to get a little uncomfortable.
The \"Cheeseburgers and Cold Beer\" restaurant/bar next door has misters and they had a bigger patronage.  Whether or not it was because of the misters I don't know."}
{"text":"First off, this place has to be the most patriotic establishment out there...literately everything including the logo screams red, white and blue.

When you enter the building, it is very hipsterish. Make no mistake that the decor is not the only nice thing about this place. The service was amazing...simply put. Which, after spending a week in Scottsdale, it became obvious that service in the food industry is hit and miss. 

The service from the waitress (Hannah) was exemplary in itself. However, these guys want you back to the point that the manager himself checks in with your table twice during your visit. It's hard to find many places that care that much any more. Good job F48! 

She had the wedge salad and Brussels sprouts. I had the Chicken with Asian green beans and smashed taters. Everything was delicious including the fresh, local beer on tap and the cocktails.

Very clean, fun environment! Would come back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Great time being one of the only people there cheering for Villanova as the beat Michigan in the NCAA championship game.  Food, drink and people watching was equally as good friendly servers who aren't on top of you every 5-10 minutes either. Thank you for a fun night"}
{"text":"We met some friends here that were in town visiting and they wanted to check Famous 48 out.  First thing I did was check it out on Yelp and wanted to object at first.  Being a new establishment I figured we should be fair and give them a chance.  For being November and a Tuesday night we had pick of seating.  We opted for outdoor seating as the music was loud inside.  Comfortable atmosphere all around.  The waitress was very courteous and helpful.  We were early and ordered the Wino Bread ($10) to munch on while we waited for our friends.  The Wino Bread looked better that it tasted.  Had a couple drinks before they arrived and had picked out what we wanted to order.  We went basic and got the Fish and Chips ($15).  The proportion is something I'd expect with a children's menu and the wife and I were splitting.  I can't say the food was great, but it wasn't awful either.  It is in a nice location and if they can establish a following with better priced food they might just succeed.  

Service- 5 stars.  Our waitress was attentive, helpful and very friendly.  No issues there.
Atmosphere- 4 stars.  Nothing special but comfortable.  Plenty of TV's with sports to watch.  The outdoor area was nice.  
Food- 2 stars.  Nothing we had was great or stuck out in my mind.  I think the price versus proportion was what bothered me.
Value- 2 stars.  I would not come here to eat again.  The drink prices were competitive with area and if other places were packed and I just wanted to drink and watch TV then this is why I'd come back."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest. I had been here twice before, and because of huge Scottsdale crowds, we had planned elsewhere but that didn't work. So brought out of town guest here thinking, \"We know this place.\"  Sorry to say, none of us were wowed this time. At all. Music was too loud. Pork dip sandwich was DRY and bland. Asian green beans? Way too spicy hot. Mac and Cheese waffle? I honestly liked it, but, my guest was not impressed in the least. It was burned. I looked at the pics of the mac on the Yelp and that is not how they show it in the pictures. Prices are WAY to high for what it is. $16 for a hamburger? Way out of line. Sorry...Think I'm out."}
{"text":"Brittney has an old bar maids soul. Managed to keep everyone happy all the while listening to this old broke down Marine spin yarns. Great atmosphere and service. Wino bread is the perfect pre-flight food to begin a Saturday night drinking exhibition. Five stars."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wine special.  Food was fairly good.  Very weird that this place is closed through August since it hasn't even been open a year.  I want to frequent places in tourist areas that stay open year round, them closing for summer is disappointing.  For that reason I will not be going back.  I actually liked Crab and Mermaid that was there prior to this better.

Here is their statement:

THANK YOU TO OUR LOYAL GUESTS AND PATRONAGE AT FAMOUS 48.  WE HAVE CLOSED FOR SUMMER BREAK.
We will take this time to travel, search for new recipes and make some changes to our interior. While we know this may be an inconvenience now, we hope that you will stop back by in late August to try some of our newest creations. Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you at Famous 48. If there are any questions, please contact our corporate office (480)-941-0101"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a busy night during spring training at 7:30 pm to find all of the outside tables were full or reserved however we found seating at the bar without a wait.  Bar staff was prompt to greet us and take the drink orders along with refills.   Food was delivered promptly after having to wait a little longer than expected to order but we never felt ignored, perhaps another bar staff member would alleviate the backlog.    The teriyaki chicken which was one of the few healthier options on the menu and was quite good, the grilled chicken was prepared well and came with seasoned rice,  broccoli and is an entree that I would order again."}
{"text":"First time here. Great crowd. It was a chicken day so I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. It delivered! Spicy, tasty, and incredibly delicate. Pillowy soft! I'm not a fan of deep fried food, but I can't think of a tastier chicken sandwich in oldtown! I did the Asian green beans as my side and they were great too! Crisp, green and the sauce rivaled the Nashville hot in intensity! I'll get this one again!"}
{"text":"I am still trying to process what this places theme is... comes across kind of ranchy but has an odd american fusion menu.  

The entree sizes should be evaluated as the salads too small and the pizza too big. Food generally tasted good. 

Most combinations are executed well and the staff seem to just be getting their feet under them. 

Gorgeous space which is perfect for the area. 

A little on the spendy side but overall experience was a good one."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink on Friday night after having dinner nearby. 
Famous 48 was pretty popular with the Spring Training crowd, but we luckily found two seats at the bar.  Lively atmosphere, friendly bartenders and quick service.  I enjoyed a strawberry lime cider - one of my favorite brands.  Typical bar food menu, but good place to eat and drink after a game."}
{"text":"Yea 5 stars baby. Why well let's start with the fact that on PGA weekend when every place in Old Town is jammed they were able to accommodate us. Yes they did some searching and got us a high top outside. I'm not a fan of dining overlooking the sidewalk but I'm flexible especially when they accommodated us on a super busy night. So, we get seated and 10 minutes plus go by with no server... Hmmm I was really looking forward to some god ole fashioned comfort food but... I was able to track down the person who seated us and she apologized and lo and behold Brittany came to the rescue. From that moment on we had tremendous service.

I had their brisket burger and plus 1 ordered the hot chicken sandwich. As advertised this is comfort food and we were both comforted. You guys turned it around so take your 5 stars and we will see you again!"}
{"text":"The female bartender that works Sunday mornings is the best server in this town. I had a group of 11 and each and every one of us has positive things to say. The brunch menu has lots of options and has a lot of good drink deals. She was making some great drinks. We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service EVER. There was literally one other table, but it still took over twenty minutes to get our appetizer. Then, the server didn't even ask us if we wanted to order an entree.  The fried pickles were phenomenal, so hats off to the cook. After we finished out appetizer and the server finally asked if we wanted anything else, she sat down in the back and played on her phone. So we waited another five minutes, left enough cash to cover the bill (hopefully, since we never even received one) and left. As a server myself, I suggest hire some new servers, because that was a joke."}
{"text":"I made reservations for my birthday. I saw the good reviews on yelp, so I wanted to try it. It was a Monday night so I didn't expect it to be crowded, and I was more than right. It was dead. We accidentally went into cold beers and cheeseburgers. I should've taken that as a sign and stayed there. Everything we had was ok, but nothing was special. The brisket fries would have been good but they were way too salty and I like salt. The burgers and sandwiches were meh. I will say the dessert was really good. We got a baked cookie with ice cream on it. It was free for my birthday, which was nice. The service was good, but again it was dead in there. All in all, I wouldn't come back and I wouldn't recommend this place. There was nothing memorable and I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"No complaints. Just like we all want!
Teriyaki chicken, cilantro lime rice & broccoli 
Half toasted chicken, mashed potatoes & green beans 
Moscow mule & Jalisco jalapeño margarita 
At first my rice came out a tad bit uncooked but they quickly fixed it by bringing me a new side and it was satisfying. Came out before I finished my plate so all good in my book!
The chicken was cooked so perfect! seasoned so well, Not overly salty, crispy in the right places & juicy.
The margarita? I Love Tajin so I enjoyed the drink that much more.
Kitchen, bar & Server were on it.
We'll def be back."}
{"text":"wow another great visit!

However I arrived at 8 and left just after 9pm and was the only customer.
My chicken sandwich was soo good, bar service was kind and personable, but I just couldn't pull out my $5 off coupon.

I paid full price and it was worth every penny. Why in late February is a restaurant this good empty."}
{"text":"Famous 48 Restaurant recently opened in Old Town Scottsdale. This is a small full service restaurant that serves mostly American Comfort Food. The interior is dimly lit and the atmosphere is kind of loud. They pipe in a variety of music from old country crooners to rap like the Beastie Boys. Most of the dining room tables are high top tables but they do have regular seating and a few booths. They also offer a patio with an indoor/outdoor bar.

A friend told me that the wino bread was very good but we started with the Waffle Mac-N-Cheese. I didn't expect this dish to be light or low calories in any way...But for me it was a bit heavier and slightly dry with less cheese taste than I was expecting. I personally didn't care for the smoked taste in it. Maybe the smoke over powered the cheese taste. I asked if it had bacon in it but I was told by my server that they used a smoked cheese in the blend. I can't say that it was bad and told them it was good because I figure that this one just isn't for my taste.

I really liked the Nashville (inspired) Hot Chicken Sandwich. It was intensely HOT with a good tang. The chicken was crunchy with a nice seasoning and that sauce they topped the chicken with WAS Delicious! I was suppose to have my choice of side but my server said to me you are getting the fries right so I just nodded because I thought that was the servers way of telling me that the other sides weren't good......?.....They served the skinny fries. They arrived hot but seemed to cool off in an instant. The fries quickly became hard and almost tasteless and reminded me of fast food fries. I really didn't care for the fries but the sandwich was delicious. You have been warned the sandwich really was fiery hot and isn't for the masses. 

My husband ordered the Slow Roasted Pork Dip. We think he received the Short Rib Melt. I asked my husband what the Pork Jus tasted like and he said it taste like watery beef. He was expecting slices of pork in his sandwich but it was filled with minced meat that had little flavor he said. He wasn't able to tell if it was beef or pork. He also didn't have any caramelized onions that he was expecting in his sandwich but he did come across a scant amount of jalapeño at the end. We were checked on by our server and management. I told them my sandwich was good. I think my husband just didn't say anything. He also said to me he thought my sandwich tasted great and he would have been happier with my sandwich.

Newly opened maybe still working some things out. Like any other restaurant you are going to like some things more than other things. We both liked the Nashville (inspired) Hot Chicken Sandwich. We thought the other sandwich and the fries need a tweak."}
{"text":"This place is awesome but I'm so disappointed that they decided to close for the summer to travel. This is the note that was left on the front door"}
{"text":"Great happy hour with a great bar staff -- excluding the young puppy bartender that enjoys chewing his gum wayyyyyy too much.The staff looks a little ASU Oldtown beautiful hires -- but they have actually been trained and you don't have to do jumping jacks to make eye contact with them.  The new decor is ok -- the bar is bigger and they left some of the cording as decor from Crab and Mermaid. It's owned by the same people who also own Bourbon and Bones and Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. I tried the house wine which was quite nice and some sliders (very tasty). Found the other customers to be open and chatty - unlike a lot of cold fish tourists or uppity Snottsdale types. Overall - thumbs up for their first week."}
{"text":"I've only lived in Phoenix for 3 weeks and I've been to this place twice. The service is outstanding. The food is great. The managers walk around and check on you and it's quiet the change from the strip bars in Vegas where I am from. This place has the best atmosphere.. get the ribs! Get the mojito.. get your butt to famous 48. Merica!!!"}
{"text":"I genuinely hope this restaurant doesn't follow in the footsteps of the previous restaurants in its location and actually stays open. The food is booommmbbb!! I love that it's open late because it's the perfect drunk food!! (Sober food too cause we weren't even tipsy)

We got the grilled mac n cheese (Mac n cheese baked in a waffle maker) and the braised short rib fries. It was so delicious!! The fries come with a side of gravy which honestly sounded disgusting to me but I dunked the fries in the gravy and the heavens above opened up and the angels started singing. It's a huge ass order so they didn't get finished but I asked for a box and even asked for an extra side of gravy to go.

Slept like a baby that night"}
{"text":"Rolled in New Year's Day with a posse of 4 to recover from terrible hangovers and watch some college football. Plenty of TVs all over the place for viewing.
Lovely waitress - super-friendly & helpful. Had the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich while my paisans ate the short rib sliders offered on Happy Hour. All really good. The fries and fried pickles were wayyyyyy salty though so beware.
Good vibes here. I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Ate here with lunch crowd in a Tuesday and ordered the \"build your own\" mac and cheese, and drank perhaps the best IPA that I've ever had (Lumberjack Flagstaff)
The mac comes with American, Pepper Jack and Provolone. I added gruyere, bacon, and ham, and it was fantastic. Arrived in a reasonable time, hot, and with the serving bowl stacked in an additional bowl. That must have been to insulate the dish, and it worked. It was hot to the last bite.
The restaurant sits on a busy street, but once inside, even with the large doors open, I heard very little street noise. Good music in the background and the staff did a good job. One of the bartenders was new, but attentive and on the spot.
The weekday lunch crowd was casual to business casual and I didn't feel uncomfortable in jeans.
Recommend you give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First time at Famous 48. Had a nice ambiance. Plenty of TVs to watch sports programs. Michelle was our waitress and was on point with her service. They also have a kids menu. The food was good and the service was better, therefore 3*. I would go back and try another menu item."}
{"text":"Have the wings. Even if that's the only thing you come here for do it. They are awesome. 
I had the burger also and it was good as well. My husband liked the ribs. 
Excellent service and fun place."}
{"text":"Nothing special and over priced.  We had a bet at our table if they would be open next year at this time.  The consensus was no. It's sandwiched between \"Cold Beer and Cheeseburger\"  and \"Bourbon and Bones\" both great places, why would you eat here.  It gives the customer no reason to come here. The menu is limited and pricey, fine dining prices for bar atmosphere food.  It doesn't work.  

To be fair the food we had was ok, no complaints about the taste, but nothing special as I've said."}
{"text":"Famous 48 was super, super average. There are so many breakfast places in the area that I just can't recommend eating here. 

It's nice that they have bottomless bloody marys and mimosas, but so do other restaurants. 

The service was good but the food was meh. They don't have many healthy breakfast options - which probably isn't why you would come here anyway - but $2 for a side of avocado that's just two bites is a little insane. 

We ordered a number of things in our big group and I didn't hear raving reviews about the food from anyone in our group, so I'd recommend going elsewhere. There are loads of delicious and creative places for breakfast and brunch in old town. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The service was good but a bit rushed. Kinda understandable as it was NYE. However the food was terrible. My food was very burnt for both appetizer and entree and not seasoned well. It's like a five year old cooked it. We drove a whole day without eating and I was starving but couldn't even eat much because how bad the food was"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, once for happy hour and once for dinner. Sat at the bar both times and a gentleman with tattoos helped us out with excellent recommendations, the manager also stopped by very humorous and welcoming at the same time. 

They flavor their own vodka very spicy AND addicting. The Bloody Mary, the smothered fries, deviled eggs, and the Mac and cheese waffle were all worth another visit."}
{"text":"Cab here on a whim after the movies. We sat at the bar with Derek who very cool guy as a matter of fact all the bar staff was great each one checked in us at different times during our meal. For only being open 5 days they have it running pretty smoothly. I ordered the chicken teriyaki it came with 2 pieces of chicken,rice and broccoli. I really enjoyed it the teriyaki sauce was super delicious. My husband ordered egg salad sandwich which was one 1 slice of bread with the egg salad on top with tomatoes jalapeños on top he enjoyed it thought is was unique it also came with 1 side which he chose coleslaw and that had very nice flavor. The prices are reasonable the ambiance was very cool. Lots of TV screens and the chairs had cushions which is great for a bad back we also love the open door concept. We will be regulars her that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Great for gluten free menu! We had the deviled eggs, spinach con queso and bbq baby back ribs. Great food, service and atmosphere. Gluten free pizza crust and buns available!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich and hubby had The Famous 48 pizza. Both were good by nothing special. Chicken sandwich is big and filling. I couldn't even eat half. The pizza has thin crust, very filling but you still can't eat it in one settingZ Our server Angel was great. She greeted us not long after we sat, got our order and we received our food in a timely manner. It wasn't as crowded as expected for a Friday night. Overall decent place. Not the best ever but certainly not the worst."}
{"text":"Flag us off the street to come and try this new restaurant.  My one son got sick after eating.  Better choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Posted a 0 minute wait on yelp, couldn't seat us when we got there minutes later. Can't comment on anything else, but ignore the posted wait.  Staff incredibly rude, simply told us \"booked for the night\""}
{"text":"This concept is the hottest new restaurant on the block! Went with a girlfriend for happy hour, had a glass of Sauvignon blanc, the short rib fries with delicious short rib, jack and cheddar cheese, and a brown gravy to dip them in. For my main entree I had the nacho mama pizza which was to die for. It was to sum it all up like a luxurious Taco Bell pizza. Emily was our server/bartender and she was personable, friendly, always smiling and had great suggestions. I would come back just for her! Hannah and Jessica made sure to stop by and make sure all our needs were met as well! This will definitely be my new spot for happy hour and dinner with my boyfriend and girlfriends!"}
{"text":"Was out of town for work, stopped by Friday afternoon, greatcservice, relaxed crowd, great short rib fries."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The half chicken with the mashed potatoes was absolutely delicious juicy and flavorful. Ask for extra gravy on the side it was delicious. I also had the wedge salad with Caesar dressing that was very good as well although I wish they would have chopped it up."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. Great for casual work lunch."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Famous 48. We stopped in for brunch. Menu had a good selection, portion sizes were small compared to their prices and other restaurants in the Four Square group. 
I had the Salmon Nicoise and my daughter had the skillet breakfast with grits. I would have liked more salad with the nicoise,but it did have good flavor and all of the components of a nicoise. The Southern Skillet was tasty, but again a small amount for the cost. No accompaniment with it, such as toast. I had a Bloody Mary of course. It was quite spicy, but very tasty. Not sure we would make another trip here."}
{"text":"Good food, easy going atmosphere, great place to people watch on Scottsdale Road.  We had brunch but will be back for a Happy Hour or after a game!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  
The facility is nice but it sorta ends there 

After being seated I had to wait at least 15 minutes to meet my waitress.  In all fairness she was being trained.  (I hope that they are not training her to be that tardy.)

I was able to finally order a beer However I almost left waiting to get it.  Considering the restaurant was not that busy and I was less than 5 ft from the bar. I really should not have had to wait.  

I wish I had known that would be the best part of the meal.  

I ordered the short ribs.  It came with Brussel sprouts.  I was pretty excited I like sprouts and you don't see them on menus that often.  
When it got to the table...finally... the Brussel sprouts were under done and had little seasoning.   The short rib was ok but a little dry.  It had a gravy that could have fixed that but it was so salty you couldn't use much to moisten the beef.   I didn't finish it despite still being hungry.

Like I said earlier.  The beer was good.   

Skip this place and go to the other restaurants on either side."}
{"text":"Three words:  Waffle Mac n Cheese.  Or is that 4? Whatever, just order it.  
This is not a waffle stuffed with mac n cheese, gross, it IS mac n cheese poured into a waffle iron and grilled. It's then cut up and you're given a cup of cheese sauce to pour over. It's magical.

We also had the Southwestern Egg Rolls. Just enough spice and lots of flavor. NOt greasy at all.  We had a small issue with our egg rolls and a gentleman not only comped the cost of the rolls, but then gave us gift certificates.  So not necessary but we appreciated it!
Our waitress was so sweet and we chatted her up. 

Super laid back environment, happy hour is 3-6 pm.  

That waffle mac n cheese situation... I can't even."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, it won't blow your mind or anything but the food is solid. Went with the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and it was really good, the fries that it came with were really salty but not a deal breaker. I felt that it was a fair price at $13 in Old Town although it could be a bit bigger.

Drinks were a different story, getting beers from the patio tables took forever. I think our first round took over 10 if not 15 minutes and I'm not sure why because we watched the server put them in quickly after we ordered. Had a couple beers and none were particularly cold but maybe that's something to do with the tap system.

Place was like 75% full on a Saturday night so that's a pretty good sign, server was nice. Would come back and try a few other things."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Arizona Beer Week..
Waitress was lovely (thank you Kendall)
Appetizers were yummy but we didn't have any full food dishes.
Only stayed for two beers and moved on but this place has a nice patio area and the staff are lovely.
My beer order was wrong and they gave me a few beer (which was a nice touch and appreciated)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here. The food is amazing and we always have great service. Emily the bartender is the best!"}
{"text":"The food and service was incredible.  Really enjoyed the Mac n cheese waffle.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Happiness - 3/5
Deliciousness - 2.5/5

This place is fine, but underwhelming. I have really enjoyed the other concepts by this company (like Crab and Mermaid and Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers), but 48 fails to meet those standards.

I came in at 11:30 on a work day and I believe only one other table was seated. The menu has lots of interesting stuff on it (like mac and cheese baked in a waffle iron). But honestly, none of the food was very exciting when we finally got it. I ended up ordering the steak sandwich and it was bland (except for the cheese, which was great). My wife got the Tennessee hot chicken sandwich and the heat level left a lot to be desired (i.e., pretty mild). Again, it wasn't bad, just underwhelming. The ranch dressing also had a somewhat offputting tangy taste. 

The oddest thing was that they marketed a monster bloody mary.... and it only came with olives and the lime/lemon (it's supposed to have bacon too, but we ordered without due to not eating pork). Those are very normal toppings for a bloody mary. Also, they only gave two olives. I feel like when you forego the most exciting thing in the bloody mary (the bacon, in this case), they should be willing to overload you with olives so that it still impresses!

The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating to our requests, but disappeared for long stretches of time. I ended up having to change my order to something else and they charged me for the cheaper of the two entrees, which was very thoughtful.

But when we walked in, the TVs were tuned to a Yankees baseball game (go Yankees!) and as we were the only ones in the section, we were really enjoying it. Then, before the game was over, they switched all the TVs in our section (again, with us the only customers there) to  lacrosse. I mentioned that I was watching the game and the waitress said sorry (but did not offer to change it back). Not terrible, but just an odd thing to do. 

Personally, I'd stick to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers next door."}
{"text":"Love the southwestern egg rolls! I have never been disappointed about my experience here and has been my go to for Sunday football games. The margaritas are super sneaky though. So tread carefully with them. Marcel has always made my experience top notch."}
{"text":"I love this place!! My boyfriend just moved to Phoenix and we are trying to find cool little spots to make our own. This place has amazing drinks and delicious food!!! The customer service is great and i would come here again!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great service and patio. We had an eclectic pick of the menu and no one was disappointed. Fresh salads, great cocktails. Cool vibe and we enjoyed the open air bar. Draft beers where nice and cold so that's always a plus right?!?!"}
{"text":"The tenders were good and so were the deviled eggs, fries were okay.  Our server, Hannah was a doll. We had a large group and she was super friendly and patient. The ambience was super chill and welcoming."}
{"text":"Came due to the gluten-free menu. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. And our drinks were never empty. And it has a nice vibe. I liked the leftover ropes from when this was a seafood place. 

The jalapeño deviled eggs were amazing and I had such high hopes for the rest of the meal. They were creamy and topped with a pickled jalapeño and they had bacon. To die for. 

Unfortunately, the rest of my meal was not. I opted for the egg Sammy which was egg, grease, and mayo. My mom commented that it looked like a Jack in the Box sandwich -- it did. The side of potatoes looked hopeful, but they were soggy and tasteless. 

The weirdest part was when I asked for hot sauce, they brought me a small cup of cholula instead of the bottle. I did not use the whole cup and I thought it was super wasteful and weird to provide a cup of the sauce instead of just hand over the bottle. 

My husband, the gluten free one, got their gluten free breakfast dish and before we were even finished eating, his stomach was upset. 

I wanted to like it and I would go back just for those deviled eggs, but I would be hesitant to eat anything else."}
{"text":"I just have to say, what a great experience at Famous 48!  Went there yesterday during the big game and we got lucky finding two spots at the bar.  Emily gave the very best service possible, attentive, quick and she had some great recommendations.  They were making a vanilla Manhattan that was delightful, the food is awesome, and it is a fun place to hang out.  Will definitely return and hope Emily is there but it will be great I am sure, regardless.  Way to go crew, you have it all working right!  Tony"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks and loved it.  Service was great.  Great craft beers and large selection of bottled beers too.  Tons of TVs and also a few fire pit couches to relax on."}
{"text":"I actually came across this place on instagram. They show some interesting dishes so we stopped in for lunch. GLAD WE DID! Ordered the fish & chips they were good with a zest of a spicy bite and a nice spin on the tarter sauce, frys were great and the coleslaw was better than most. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Visited Famous 48 for some lunch. My server was Hannah and she was excellent. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and even though they've only been open for less than a month. Good atmosphere and lots of TVs. Food was great and not too pricey. I hope they do well and survive the fickle Scottsdale crowd."}
{"text":"I ordered the Nashville fried chicken sandwich and finished in 15 min . The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside with a bit of kick.The coleslaw was fresh and not drenched in mayonnaise- just the way I like it! The interior didn't change much from when it was the seafood place. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A casual bar spot, with a slight gastropub twist on the food menu. Open patio with plenty of shade.  Cool alterno-rock music playing but not set to nuclear, which I greatly appreciate.  They had a live acoustic performer on the patio which was a nice touch. Server mcKayla was outstanding. The food was average- I had the spicy chicken sandwich, which was decent. We also had vegetarian pizza; if you like Midwest style pizza, it was legit.   The food disappointingly took a while to make it out of the kitchen.  Overall it was an average experience, with a cool laid back casual, hangout kinda vibe, with decent food.  Not something I'd necessarily go out of my way to eat, but I would come back to try more and hang out to have a drink."}
{"text":"this place was phenomenal! Definitely the type of person who's reliant on yelp reviews and won't go to a place with anything less than a 4! Was hesitant to try this place since it was new but it didn't disappoint. The atmosphere was great, love the indoor outdoor vibe, good music, excellent service! Started out with the southwest egg rolls- HIGHLY recommend! Other key notes of the things we ordered were the short rib melt, tender meat that was delicious and the orzo was so tasty! Melt in your mouth, buttery, cheesy... Nom! Definitely would recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"While in town for Padre Spring training we ventured into downtown and landed in 48 and it was a great find! Good service and food. Nice ambience, check it out!"}
{"text":"Went in last Sunday to try and get some lunch and it was the biggest load of unorganized bullshit iv experienced in old town waited in the sun for almost 20 minutes sweating my balls off for a table while there were 8 open tables granted they were still dirty however instead of assisting In help to prepare the table the dumbass hostess just walked around talking to different people only to return and repeated ask how many were in the group and that we'll have a table as soon as one gets cleaned instead of grabbing a fucking towel and wiping it down herself as many hostess throughout the industry would do apparently she must just be better than that so needless to say we left because if this establishment can't even figure out how to seat a group of 4 then I want no part in figuring out how bad the rest of the service is..."}
{"text":"Overpriced, incredibly lackluster. Does not deserve 4 stars on yelp; especially on a strip with so many excellent options for dining. Ordered a large salad with chicken (recommended by the server), which literally came only with chopped lettuce and a few flakes of Parmesan. The managers apologized and brought out a different salad - then charged us extra for premium ingredients we hadn't asked for. Not to mention the server ran the credit card twice, keeping us there for an additional 10 minutes to void the error, etc. Multiple experiences there and they seem to disappoint more every subsequent time. If you're hungry, happen to be walking around old town, and see the \"F48\" sign, keep walking to any one of the many great places around it."}
{"text":"Oh where to start ...... the morning started off well and delightful and then we had the Famous 48 introduction to the day and they decided they should change that.

We get seated quickly , which was a great way to start, and then it went downhill as fast as an Olympic skier. Once sat, we just sat there for @10 min, and to get service we had to ask a waitress walking by if we could get a server. She apologized and took our orders. We knew something was amiss when I asked for a mimosa and she countered with \"we have bottomless Mimosa's for $20 and every refill is 1 cent\" As my friend said, \"I'm not great with math but that doesn't sound right\" if it's bottomless why do you have to pay for refills 

We get our food in not the quickest of time but whatever it's Sunday brunch. The problem is when the food came. It was cold. Like, it was legit cold, as if it had been sitting for 10-15min. When I said something they brought me a new one with half the salmon as the first plate. To be honest I think they took the salmon off the first plate and put it on the second. It took less than 5 min for the second plate. I asked if they could just microwave it and they said they didn't have one. When I told the manager the plate was cold his response was the salmon is suppose to be cold. Yes, but the famous 48 version of a Benedict is suppose to be warm. Mind you, we are in the desert, and I get served cold food.

The waitress asked if I wanted another mimosa and I said no. My friend asked for a second screw driver and it never came.

What did come was the bill and low and behold I get charged twice for my meal. Nothing Better than not having a server, getting a my meal cold, not getting our drinks , and having a bloated bill.  My other friend said, \" it's amazing all the staff is running around but where are they going?\"

The aesthetics look great and promising but if they do not get better service this place will not last."}
{"text":"I am gluten free and they make an amazing gluten free pizza. Superb sauce and ample toppings. Also had the kale Brussels salad which was great. Nice open air seating."}
{"text":"I like this place. So, why only three stars you ask? Because it is very middle of the road for Old Town Scottsdale.
 It has nice interior, but nothing special for the area. This food is good, but nothing stands out. They have a nice rotating beer selection, but only a dozen on tap.
The several times I have been there, it has never been busy, but never dead. It is owned by the same restaurants on either side. So, if Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers is overflow busy during a game day, this is a nice option. The waitstaff has always been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Service is terrible.  We were seated on the patio, took way to long for server to come to our table. Too many other options in the area to wait for servers to acknowledge a table."}
