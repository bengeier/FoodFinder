{"text":"Went to Peoria on April 15 for the food truck fest. For $11 I was expecting more from this place. Pizza was undercooked. It was just a soggy crust with tomato sauce, some cheese and a couple of basil leaves. Wished it was cooked longer and tasted like it came out of a wood fired oven and not a microwave. Maybe it wasn't cooked long enough and/or it was cooked at too low a temperature. Maybe this was just a fluke but I'm not sure I'd try it again. I could do this at home and cook it on a pizza stone so it's not so doughy.

Update: I've changed the number of stars because of this establishment's responsiveness to my concerns."}
{"text":"Seriously good pizza. We've been to a lot of different wood fired pizza places and this one is our favorite. The dough and sauce are what make it unique. Their toppings are fresh. My favorite is the pepperoni, black olive, and pepperoncini pizza. Freakin good!"}
{"text":"This pizza is the absolute best. Every time we visit the food trucks this is my preferred choice. My wife and I are obsessed with this pizza and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Tried their pizza at pizza festival and loved this pizza. We will now stalk them around the valley."}
