{"text":"Fries=stale, fish=flavorless. The breading is like progresso breadcrumbs. It has no flavor whatsoever. Fish was over cooked, shrimp was bland. Everything was bland. The tartar sauce was good thankfully. It's the only thing that helped it go down. The fries were so old and so was the oil everything was cooked in. When we pulled up to order we were greeted with \"what do you want\" Definitely will not be going back here."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and love everything I try. The cod is breaded fried to a perfect golden brown. I really love the chew factor and the flavor is good. Mushrooms are fresh and hand picked to fry up to perfection. Never had better."}
{"text":"This review is for food and price only;
As far as I am concern, they are the best fish and chip in town. Best fried cod fillet, best fried shimp. Other items are equally tasty, But my favorite is the fried cod.

Order the food to go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, everything is fried but that's what this place does, great sauces as well"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating there and I LOVE IT!! Love their customer service and their prices are pretty decent too. I ordered an E1. It with Fries, fish and a drink. The chef came out and talked to us and let us tried some fried zucchini, fried mushroom and fries fish. 

I have to say the ZUCCHINI are AMAZING! I've never had it fried before, but it taste really really good! Same for the mushroom. My mouth was gnna explode.  Love it! So Glad that I decided to stop by. 

Please do try the place first! Comments may be bad, but wait until you go in and have a look at it for yourself. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome cod. Zucchini is awesome too. It's a good fish and chips place. It hits the spot, when your in the mood for deep fried fish. I agree with all the positive reviews. I know a lot of people who love their catfish, but I've haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat. I got the sampler and I was stuffed, 1pc Cod, 1 Gigantic Shrimp, 1 Fried Zuc, 1 Mushroom, 1 Onion Ring, and Fries.

Everything was fried nicely, nothing greasy or over cooked, or rubbery. The tartar sauce is good as indicated by others and taste was good as it should be.

What I get a kick from are the folks that discuss the \"Decor\" of this place, listen up folks!

1) Look at the neighborhood your in
2) Did you really expect the lobby of the Biltmore behind the door?
3) Its a fish shack \"SHACK\" being the identifier
4) If you want the catch of the day fresh from the Pacific go elsewhere

All-in-all its a decent place to pick-up some fried fish and other goodies. Check it out if your in the area for a quick fix. Its not the best I've had in the valley, but its 2nd on my list of Fish Shacks."}
{"text":"Went to Brad's for dinner last night, Friday, June 17, 2016 and it has gone out of business.  Sign on the door and a realty sign up in front.  Loved this place, best fish around and cheap!  Another local restaurant gone."}
{"text":"I\"m not quite sure to what to say about Brad's.  Years ago, I had gone there for dinner with a friend.  He used to own a restaurant that specialized in southern food and said it was pretty good.  Let that tell you something about the food here.

Tonight I hobbled in wearing both shoes-the first day since my accident.  I was tired and just wanted a different  type of  dinner.  Don't go to Brad's for ambiance.  It isn't there.  It does have something I do like.  Their are two LARGE signs that say children must be seated.  It wasn't busy while I was there but it would be just fine if they do enforce those signs.  (God bless those of you have rug rats but when I am eating, I enjoy a bit of peace and quiet).  It is fairly clean and the employees were friendly enough.  You order your food at the front and they bring it to you.   

I think I can safely say this restaurant specializes in fried foods, especially fish.  I rarely eat fried foods but decided to pig out and have the sampler which includes-fried-a big mushroom, zucchini, cod, onion ring. and fries.  They give you containers of two sauces and ketchup to go with it.  As I rarely eat fried foods, I can't really tell you it was particularly good nor particularly bad.  There was a lot of it.  I  liked the mushroom.   If I drank alcohol I think it would be really good with a beer?  Can't tell you if you can get beer there as I would have no reason to ask.  I can tell you they have good lemonade.

Don't go if you want something light on your stomach.  Don't go to Brad's if you want to impress someone with your culinary tastes.  But if you want fried and plenty of it, that they do have.  They do have things that aren't fried. It has been there for quite some time so it must have a following.  It has drive thru."}
{"text":"We have been going to Brads for over 15 years. It really has not changed much. 

The interior is blah.
The staff is strange yet nice.
The food is ok to good. 

Everything is breaded and fried but the breading is good. The cod fillet was meaty and good. 

 It was just too much grease after the rings and fish. 

It was 27 for 4 of us...not too bad."}
{"text":"Amazing fish very fresh. Everything is great and taste delicious. Price is good to for a fresh and tasty fish. Come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Jumbo shrimp are bigger than red lobster"}
{"text":"Brads is cheap and the fish and sides are all frozen pre-breaded. I pop thru the drive thru every now and then because its cheap and easy and on my way home.

The catfish is OK. it's thin and flat? Never saw a flat catfish before. Not a lot of flavor. This is normal for Brad's trust my ex used to get the fish and fried zucchini all the time. I do like their tarter sauce it is tasty. 

It's weird if you go in they have all of these display cases to sell you trinkets from Asia. But looks a little like a cafeteria. They have everything fried you can think of. Fish, shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings, fries you get the idea. 

If you want great catfish go to Honey bears on central Thursdays or Fridays only."}
{"text":"Oh boy. 

I've been on a big fish and chips kick lately. 

We rolled through the drive thru on Saturday night. 

The food is cheap....and rubbery...and stale....if fish and chips could have a stale taste, this place takes the win. 

I did like their dipping sauce, it was garlicy...I do like mine sweet, but it was a nice change. 

And I know its deep fried,but damn...the little napkin they put in the bottom of your to go box was all translucent from soaking up the oil. 

As the hubs put it...this place is good if you are really good and drunk, otherwise, pass."}
{"text":"My husband, my mother inlaw and I went here today. Man do I have to say THEY HAVE THE BEST CATFISH I'VE HAD IN A LOOOOOONG TIME! It was absolutely. Amazing!! The owner was friendly and very respectful!  I can't beleive I didnt hear about this place before! Me and My family will defiantly be back! If you like sea food and want the kind that momma or pop use to make this is the place!! Absolutely all n all great place I am very happy that I heard about it!"}
{"text":"Love their food! fish is a bit on the small side but still tasty. Zucchini is a must try along with the shrimp. Their cocktail sauce is different but yummy!"}
{"text":"Yuck!  I came here with a friend who had heard that it was a good spot for fish and chips.  I can tell you that my experience here was less than savory.  The decor of the restaurant is run down and the staff is substandard.  The menu is filled with lots of different items, all of which are very inexpensive.  I ordered the fish and chips and the fish lacked flavor except for the horrible taste of old fryer oil that really was in need of a change.  Even the soda didn't taste right.  The hot sauce bottles on the table looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in years and were disgusting.  Lastly, they have signs posted that the restrooms are out of order, but they really aren't. The lady behind the counter told me that they posted that to keep the homeless people out.  I won't be back to this place - it is amazing to me that they are still in business. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I still remember when I was a kid me my brother my family and my sister and my grandma and my mom, we would always go there when we lived on Northern and 23rd Avenue. The lady there was always so sweet and she's like a like a second family to us she always walking us I was about eight years old when we first one there are like seven really young, I just it broke my heart cuz I saw that it said it close and it was one of my favorite restaurants and Arizona I never cared for a Pete's Fish and Chips I was always team Brad's fish and chips growing up. I just want to say this place is amazing we're all my friends and family to this place, and it felt special because not a lot of people knew what this place was or where it was so it definitely was there I was growing up and it's sad to say it's not there anymore will Brad's thank you for all the loving and times and memories we had there love you Brad's fish and chips you always be in my heart thank you for the good times love you."}
{"text":"Good food good price. I don't like tarter sauce and tried there's I wanted to drink that stuff. This place made me feel like rubbing my nose against the carpet and do a happy dance like my puppy"}
