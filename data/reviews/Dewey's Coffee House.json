{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop. Friendly and fast service, great coffee and food, and a real neighborhood feel. And the free wifi is FAST! (compared to the free wifi at major chains)"}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out or get work done. Reminds me of some coffee houses back in Chicago. Ample seating, cozy couches. I have had several of their coffee and chai drinks and I have never had a complaint. I also have tried their quiche - have them warm it up for you and it is quite tasty. I do have to say though, I LOVE their sugar cookie! The staff is always friendly and helpful. I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe this place hasn't been there my whole life. Whenever I'm home, this is my choice coffee shop. The staff is friendly, the coffee is delicious and mostly fair trade, and the food is good (not to mention the amazing popcorn around the corner).  Great atmosphere and great coffee, the kind of place I can spend the entire chilly Cleveland winter's day."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Cleveland to go and just hang out.  Laid back atmosphere, friendly people work there."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife while visiting from out of town. Place was busy, but not crazy busy, at about 945. We split a bagel sandwich and ordered drinks. Bagel sandwich took 25 minutes, never got the second drink after waiting 30 minutes and had to leave to make it to an appointment. Coffee and bagel that we did have we're good, but the management needs to hire a third person for the busy times."}
{"text":"Nice coffee, ice cream and popcorn shop in Shaker Square!  It's within walking distance to family that I visit when visiting home...so I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I give Dewey's a low rating for quite a variety of reasons.  I have been a frequent customer of Dewey's for close to 7 years now and I use to enjoy coming when I first discovered it. They have free wi-fi, really good chai (hot or cold), scrumptious bagels and of course, they have ice cream!!!  However, over the years, I have not enjoyed the service I receive from the baristas. This does not apply to all of them but to a large majority. There are three baristas that this does not apply to, the young man who wears a TMNT hat, the young woman who has a child and the red-head with the tats! Shout out to you all!!!!  The rest of the baristas lack customer service skills or just general respect. They seem afraid to look patrons in the eyes and scared of certain patrons. It's to the point that I only frequent when absolutely necessary. Otherwise, I take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"A coffee shop with espresso and pour over. Hot tea from tea bags. Interior connection to popcorn shop. Ice cream.  Iced tea rating: 4/5 stars. Well-brewed English breakfast tea. Not bitter, complex flavor. $2.25 per 20 oz. No glasses to stay. Herbal iced tea available, but no other true tea iced tea options."}
{"text":"I drink black coffee, and so can't stand going a place that has bad coffee. Dewey's has great coffee! The baristas are knowledgeable about the coffees, and atmosphere is great. Excellent place to enjoy a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Love Dewey's coffee!! Lots of interesting drink choices and very reasonably priced. Also just great atmosphere, lots of different seating options so you can relax and read, catch up with friends, or get work done. I only got coffee but will definitely be back to try some of their food."}
{"text":"Nice place - happy they serve locally-brewed coffee! Sometimes the line is a little long but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Went to check events on the website and the latest they had posted was for November. Guess they don't care much about keeping folk up to date about events.  Went to their Facebook page to see in there was any information about events, etc... there, nope.  Checked out another place instead.  Guess they don't care about communicating what's going on."}
{"text":"Location, location, location. Basically a decent place but could use some sprucing up. OK, a lot of sprucing up. Espresso drinks are average to good.  Needs:  A good cleaning and redecorating  More seating Outdoor tables in the summer (are there any at all?) Sell the WSJ on weekends"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the area. A frequent meeting place with friends and colleagues. My mother comes here almost every morning when she goes walking with her ladies. We even made a point of taking a friend here when she was visiting  from France.  The coffee is affordable, good quality, and fair trade, and there are other delicious drink options as well. There are many different syrup flavors for adding some excitement to your coffee, hot chocolate, or soda, or even for mixing into together to make your own new flavored sodas (a favorite of mine is lavender french vanilla).  The food choices are also pretty great, if you're not feeling particularly thirsty. The baked goods are delicious, and there are fruits and sandwiches on the healthier side. The popcorn and ice cream go fantastically with the atmosphere of the place, which is friendly and cheery with warm colors and great customer service. The color themes are warm and homey, red and soft sienna with some olive and blue accents. Wonderful little coffee shop, I highly recommend it for those looking for a place to meet with friends, get some work done, or just relax by yourself in the afternoon."}
{"text":"My fav local coffee shop . Its great for meetings and the familiar local buisness that knows your name and what drink you want. But what is most impressive is that they give our free ice cream to the community in April. One has to look hard to find for a local spot to give Free ice cream or anything to the community for which it serves. Me and sasha [the lahsapoo] are thankful and forever a dewys patron. Its not a place for a full meal. Coffee and tea drinks. Popcorn. Soup and light fare. If u go for that you wont b disappointed."}
{"text":"The other day I went to get ice cream and I was just eating and eating it then I saw in my mouth I was almost about to swallow a long brown piece of hair then I went yesterday and there was lint from someone's clothes it was nasty"}
{"text":"Great coffee joint. Very convenient to where I live."}
{"text":"Great ambience, lovely baristas, and awesome cappuccinos (be sure to ask for the 8oz cappuccino for the right proportions). I only wish they had more choices for the kind of espresso beans they use. But it's a lovely coffee shop.  P.S - delicious Bialy's bagels served fresh every day!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to get to Dewey's. I don't live in Cleveland anymore but whenever I go back for work or play I can't resist a visit. Why? The atmosphere is just perfect - a classic coffee house, that is friendly, cozy and they serve great coffee and eats. The service has always been excellent and I couldn't think of anything to complain about. We love Dewey's!!!"}
{"text":"The coffee house is fantastic, but this review is for the ice cream/popcorn joint attached to the coffee house . . . Best ice cream in the Greater Cleveland area!  My personal favorites are the prescription strength chocolate (most chocolate-y ice cream you will EVER have) and the raspberry truffle.  A pint of ice cream is $5ish and is worth every single penny.  You can combine multiple flavors in one pint."}
{"text":"I just wanna give a big ol' rowdy round of applause to the homies at Dewy's. Thanks for keeping me caffeinated as I run around Shaker Square. Thanks guys and gals. Stay groovy."}
{"text":"Cute shop and ok coffee. Got the fiesta chicken soup which was deeelicous! Thick n tasty. Cookie was kind of bland. Friendly and helpful baristas. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and really like the vibe.  The staff has been great.  The coffee is strong and hot.  They have a good selection of coffee options without going crazy.  Some of their other options like mocha are fantastic.    The interior is very comfortable and quant.  The prices are reasonable ... just.    I have not been in while the popcorn shop is open but will try to make it back"}
{"text":"Dewey's is the quintessential neighborhood coffee shop. Personal, friendly service, well trained baristas, house made sweets, soups and sandwiches are standard plus house made popcorn and very good ice cream. Often they have live music on the weekends, art you can buy on the walls and outdoor seating in the warmer months. Come alone or bring a friend or the family."}
{"text":"A nice, warm and homely place to work and get things done while enjoying wonderful coffee, fresh popcorn and ice-cream. There are basic baked goodies to complement the coffee. There's a couple of sandwich shops nearby so food isn't always a problem, although would be nice to have more options in house.  Wonderful large windows with a nice view of shaker outside adds to the charm. They have local musicians play live on Fridays which is wonderful as well. Free public parking at the back in the common parking lot is another plus. To summarize, a nice place to spend a quiet and productive day."}
{"text":"Before dropping my car off at Larchmere Imports I decided to java up and head to Dewey's.  Very cute interior...comfy couches, fireplace, ample seating (with high backs on the chairs which rocks), and a funky cool vibe.  My latte delivered on taste so I was happy--bold yet smooth.  The barista even brought my drink out to me and the place was packed.  Nice gesture.  The *only* thing that bugs is parking.  But then again, welcome to Shaker Square, right?  Dewey's has a sign outside that says free parking in the back.  I didn't find said parking.  All I could find was a \"loading only\" zone that would have towed my car between 8am and 4pm.  Hmm...but anyway, this is a great coffee destination."}
{"text":"I live in Seattle so it's hard to give Dewey's a five star review when those coffee houses are the standard. But Dewey's is a breath of fresh air (with a hint of popcorn) in the city of Cleveland. A nice place to hang out with decent coffee, a pleasant atmosphere, and a cool neighborhood. I visit Dewey's every year when I visit my old city, and always enjoy the drink, food, and experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An excellent coffee house with a very unque atmosphere, definitely not your average Starbucks/Caribou atmosphere. The decor is warm and friendly, comfortable seating with leather chairs and loungers. There is also cozy fireplace corner and free wireless internet, which is great for students. The baked goods are high in calories but extremely tasty! Lastly, Dewey's sells quality coffee and menu encompasses everything from your average latte to hot chocolate to a number of special drinks such as caramel creme breve and stuporball, so tasty! If you're in luck, you may catch a certain barista who makes great latte art to complete your coffee experience."}
{"text":"So, want great coffee AND about 30 flavors of Popcorn, AND ice cream? Want a place with a family-friendly atmosphere that feels like a cross between an old soda fountain and your living room?  Want to find a place with nice staff, good atmosphere and a place to write your novel, short story, or just write a blog page about, I dunno, NICE COFFEE HOUSES?   Than Dewey's in Shaker is your place.   They are a multi-tasking, tasty spot just off of the square that has a passel of great foods and nice folks. Parking, as always in the square, is a bit dicey, as they don't have their own private lot, but after short jog, this place is the pot of...coffee at the end of the rainbow.   So, for a cup of ice cream, a cup of coffee...or a cup of...popcorn, Deweys has just the cup for YOU:)"}
{"text":"Dewey's is one of my favorite places to go, period.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The ice cream is great, I've only had the strawberry because that's my favorite but they also have more elaborate flavors if you like chocolate-blah-blah-swirl types of ice cream.  The milkshakes are equally as good.   Other than that, I've had their affogato, which is espresso over a scoop of ice cream.  This is traditionally served in a small cup with one scoop of ice cream, but the one I ordered from Dewey's was served in a tall white cup and the barista said \"I put more ice cream in there than usual, I hope thats ok\" of course it was! I got much more espresso and ice cream than I was expecting for a reasonable price.    Their Arnold Palmer is on the sour side, but I'd order it again.  The italian sodas are good and you can always tell the barista if you dont like it.  No matter what I order, the barista is always like \"let me know if it's too this or too that!\".  My usual order is a caramel iced coffee and I like to to sit outside. The square has a nice vibe, especially if you like people watching!  In the evenings on fridays or saturdays, they have live performers.  If you were expecting peace and quiet, you may not like this (but i always enjoy them).  They have a diverse group of people who perform.  I've seen indie, bluegrass, rock, etc once there was even a girl singing all parody songs.    As far as food, I've only had their quiche.  I believe it has swiss cheese, artichokes, bacon,and onions.  They warm it for you or you can take it with you cold (its a little fridge thing).  I love it and I always stop in and get it if I'm in the square around breakfast."}
{"text":"Not the absolutely best atmosphere as far as coffee shops go, but the cozy fireplace makes up for it!  Very good coffee, too."}
{"text":"Love the coffee & ice cream  Nice classical music playing   Great community of people"}
{"text":"I come here frequently to work or have meetings with colleagues. The ancho hot chocolate is delicious!! Their soup selection is pretty tasty and they usually have pretty good vegetarian options. I love stopping by in the summertime to get a small scoop of ice cream too... I love the peanut butter pretzel crunch. Mm.   The sandwiches are overpriced and not that good. The coffee is ok, but not the best in Cleveland.  For the most part, the atmosphere is friendly and there's a very 'local' vibe. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it gets drafty inside."}
{"text":"I have now visited Dewey's over 20 times and the one common theme I see here is inconsistency. My order is rather simple. A non-fat iced mocha, and on occasion I'll have a warm one. This drink is made at nearly all coffee shops across the states.   At Dewey's, I've had a couple amazing ones, but then I've had horrible tasting ones and some that I don't even taste any espresso nor do I actually believe I received any espresso especially when I don't see them actually putting a shot in and they claim they did.   In addition, I'm always charged a different price when I order the exact same drink and same size.   Overall, if you're in the area and want coffee, Dewey's isn't bad. I will still come here on occasion, but the outcome is never consistent."}
{"text":"It's a quaint coffee house! The fresh popcorn aroma mixed with fresh brewed coffee creates a carnival for the olfactory system. :)"}
{"text":"Dewey's is a little gem in Shaker Square!  Great coffee, cool baristas and their innovation in bringing local musical talent just adds to the charm.  I also love they insist on patrons being civil by sticking to their guns about the cell phone etiquette!! BRAVO Dewey's"}
{"text":"Great coffee, nice staff, GOOD POPCORN!!! I love to sit outside at Shaker Square in front of the coffee shop on Sunday afternoon after church with the fam. Sooooo relaxing :)"}
{"text":"What a great little spot. Perfect coffee and good snacks. I posted up here for a day of work and the Internet was great too. Friendly staff and all around great atmosphere. Will be back if needed and in the area."}
{"text":"This place is right on Shaker Square. I stopped by for a coffee and breakfast wrap because I had about one half hour to kill. The gentlemen who served me was friendly and fast. He was in constant motion cleaning up even when no customers were waiting for service. A good experience except for the old couches which were a bit uncomfortable. Looks like a great gathering place for the locals!"}
{"text":"Not too much extra to add, I usually wind up coming here for something to drink on Saturday when the Farmer's market is going on since I'm not in the Shaker Square area any other times of the week.  Since I'm not much of a coffee drinker, I usually get the spiced hot chocolate (can't remember the name, Phoenix, maybe??) and it is top notch.  A regular little coffee shop that is pretty well-appointed and comfortable and in a great spot right on Shaker Square.  Haven't tried any of their sandwiches yet, but I'm sure I will sometime in the summer....."}
{"text":"Dewey's is a quaint place with the atmosphere of the ideal small town coffee shop.  In fact it feels like a college coffee shop for grown ups and families.  As for their offerings, I can only speak to a few things.  Their tea selection could use some expanding.  They do have steamers, coffee and espresso.  I've had a very enjoyable vanilla soy milk steamer but no coffee or espresso.  I've not had their popcorn, pastries or light meals.  They hold onto their sorbet too long.  The bottom of the barrel sorbet gets crystallized and gummy making it rather unpleasant."}
{"text":"The quality of the espresso drinks is head and shoulders above the Starbucks, Caribou and Arabica chains, but the new Phoenix location is giving Dewey's a run for their money. The location can't be beat and you couldn't ask for a better cafe atmosphere.  This is truly a place where you can spend a few hours...easily!  This is a real coffeehouse.  It's authentic.  It's local.  It's clean.  It's cozy.  The service is great.  It's delicious.  The espresso drinks aren't on par with artisinal coffee houses like Gimme! (Ithaca) and Intelligentsia (Chicago), but they are good."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere in general.  Came here to rest one day, and was pleased. In addition, the free Wi-Fi is clutch. There are usually two or three blends of coffee, in terms of variety. I have also tried their sandwiches, which were quite good as well, and they offered the option of having them grilled. I am a fan of this place."}
{"text":"I agree with the other review, this coffee house indeed reminds me of the fictional coffee place, Central Perk, of \"Friends\" sitcom fame: quirky, bohemian and care-free. I recall they too have evening music and poetry events. That workday morning, we ordered our lattes, sat by the fireplace, appreciated the classic jazz playing in the background and people-watched a diverse crowd come in to enjoy a good cup of Joe.  I'd say this is like Starbucks \"plus a little more\". Located in Shaker Square, this  twin establishment shares space with a popcorn/ice cream shop on it's other half. Shaker Square itself is a great refreshing throwback to a time when town squares were beautiful and meant something.  I was about to bust out a vocal rendition of \"smelly cat\" but the better part of me exercised some restraint."}
{"text":"This cafe is a nice addition to the Shaker Square environment. It shares space with the popcorn store next door, so there is a bigger seating area than it appears when you first walk in.  They serve Phoenix Coffee, although in my opinion, not as well as the Phoenix stores nearby do. There is free wifi and the baristas are friendly.  My biggest complaint is the limited hours. They close fairly early during the week (as does much of Shaker Square, it seems) so I don't have a lot of incentive to come over to Dewey's unless I'm around for something else."}
{"text":"Very frustrated.  Came in to do some work while enjoying beverage and. sandwich or something other than breakfast. Wasted time and trip. Slim pickings for their refrigerated case. I must now go to Starbucks.  Estimate production better"}
{"text":"A fine place for coffee and such.   The dark chocolate ice cream is most excellent.  The atmosphere is what you'd hope for in a coffee shop.  Baristas are friendly.  I wish they stayed open longer - especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Remember when there was an Arabica on Shaker Square?  This place has a lot of that draw - it's friendly, warm and unique.  You won't think you've wandered into the local Starbucks.  There is a nice mix of folks and it's a great place to get a drink or some ice cream and spend a few minutes or a few hours.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  I'm a fan of their Chai (with soy milk) and they have a nice assortment of snacks to try - from bagels to snack bars to candy."}
{"text":"Good place to pop in, grab a coffee, and hang with friends. A little pricey for pastries and sandwiches, but the atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot - warm, friendly, and finally with decent wi-fi (it used to go out all the time).  For me, this is second best to Lucky cafe.  Good:  * Decent sandwich and soup selections, hardboiled organic eggs from Ohio farm-raised chickens, peanut cookies * Homemade kettle corn * A warm fireplace, great for those cold Ohio days, and outdoor seating for the summertime  Bad:  * Food selection isn't as broad as it is some other lunch places, but I'd say they make up for it with the popcorn * When the lunch and dinner crowds come in, the place smells like oil, which permeates my clothes and hair.  This is because the sandwiches get grilled in the same room, and there's no fan - this is a major downside for me.   Just as an idle note, there are a million signs up here that request, nay, demand, that people not talk on their cell phones when ordering at the counter.  Is this a huge problem on the East side...??"}
{"text":"Great delicious sammiches, coffee, and treats.  Every time ive come here I have tried something different. Today being my 3rd visit I went with a turkey bagel sandwich thingy and a mocha w/ hazelnut.  Each time I have been here the staff has been helpful and nice to interact with. The seating is very comfortable (in comparison to some other coffee shops I have been to).  Plus, PLUS, attached is a popcorn/ice cream shop? Nice 8)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Dewey's.  My favorite thing to order here is the scoop of ice cream with an espresso shot poured on top.  Hard to find this anywhere else as a single menu item.  I give Deweys 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed by the coffee initially, but the mochas and hot chocolate are superb.  It's a good place to hang out, too, with comfortable chairs and free wifi.  They're one of the gems in the suffering (and now decidedly mixed, charmingness-wise) Shaker Square.  I hope they continue to stick around, unlike [any of the previous Shaker Square cafes, take your pick]."}
{"text":"This place sort of reminds me of the browns, they never have their act together.  Some Sunday's or days they simply won't open.  Other days they only take cash..."}
{"text":"Dewey's Coffee & the adjacent Popcorn Shop, located in the NE corner of Shaker Square has become a \"gathering house\" of sorts as their slogan appropriately suggests. A prime location for all things on the Square. Whether for a caffeinated jump-start to your day or a for night-cap glass of vino*, I begin or end my visit to Shaker Square at this location often.   Dewey's resides in a very appropriate antique looking storefront. The interior is cozy and boasts plenty of window seats overlooking the bustling square; for seclusion, sit in the corner nook with couches and a fireplace. For a more minglesome approach, sit on the patio to take it all in.   Dewey's offers typical coffee-house fare, including fair-trade coffee, teas, Bialy's bagels, fresh baked goods as well as sandwiches, soups and salads.  Opened since 2005, you wouldn't be able to tell. Dewey's has the sense of history and nostalgia of a tried and true gathering locale. It's a timeless location.  * Alcoholic libations are welcome on premises and poured for a nominal fee."}
{"text":"Come here every time I come home!  Atmosphere- laid back, comfortable & eclectic  Decor - same Coffee - not an expert but I've never been disappointed   Bake goods -  Popcorn - I don't leave town without it"}
{"text":"Super friendly, courteous service and patrons. For specialty coffee, their prices are very reasonable, cheap even. They have PLENTY of flavors to choose from if frilly, sweet coffee is your thing and also lemonade and smoothies for non-coffee drinkers. The food items are a little pricy for what you get but nothing outrageous. There is plenty of indoor seating as well as a couple outdoor tables. They also sell specialty ice cream (by the scoop and pint) and specialty popcorn which makes it a really nice place to get a snack."}
{"text":"Dewey's Coffee house reminds me of a mix of Central Perk and a coffee house in Stars Hallow. If you didn't get my friends and Gilmore Girls references I'm basically saying that it's amazing!   Customer service was awesome! It basically deserved 5 stars on it's own. Service with a smile was something I thought was lost but nope it's alive and well in Dewey.  I got a paradise smoothie which was delicious and a chicken bacon sandwich that they kindly heated up for me was also good. I could go on and because there's also yummy popcorn and ice cream. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place really gets 3.5 from me. I love the coffee here. Ordered a cappuccino. The prices are really good also I have to say. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because it's too much. It doesn't have that coffee house vibe to it. It feels like a restaurant. I wanted to come here to have a business meeting and it was way too loud. So I had to reschedule. Overall a great place. Will return, but I think I will get my coffee to go next time."}
{"text":"Dropped in for coffee... disappointed coffee was lukewarm and the blend could not have been more watery... Baked good was average  Picky coffee drinkers may want to set their expectations accordingly.  Ambiance is great but they should up their game.. mediocrity is not an acceptable trait for a small coffee house"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop with a genuinely diverse crowd and an overall good vibe.  Service is almost always good, baked treats are fantastic, and so are the small number of sandwich options.  Oh yeah, the coffee is good too!  Good seating options inside and out encourage you to hang out.  But if you're grabbing something to go in the morning, there are dedicated quick parking spots for you out front too.  I'm glad to see Dewey's still going, and I hope it continues to serve Shaker Square so well for years to come."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee, lots of options and they serve Bialy's Bagels, which is the best!"}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop hands down. Great staff. Everyone feels welcome. They are efficient and go out of their way to make sure you're taken care of. Food is great and sometimes they'll mix in a sandwich made from ingredients in the farmer's market that happens every weekend. Dewey and his team have built a warm, fun atmosphere with a great selection of drinks and food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good coffee in a cozy shop. I especially like the fireplace. Works for me!"}
{"text":"Happened in and sat down as there was live music, which wasn't bad - 2 guys with guitars doing oldies. After ordering coffee I realized it's also a popcorn shop. Really? At least it's open to the shop next door. So I wasn't too surprised to get a luke warm mocha from a barista who asked 3 times what my order was.  To give some credit - he attempted a rosette on top. A few months more practice needed maybe. It does offer some good window seats for people watching and the atmosphere was friendly."}
{"text":"I popped into this coffee shop in lieu of freezing my toes off and I found it to be cozy and welcoming! It wasn't super crowded, the prices are reasonable and the coffee was good.   When I go back, I'd like to try some of their popcorn. I think it'd be a nice place to set myself up one afternoon to get some work done!   P.S. - If you're a Gilmore Girls fan, the Luke's sign they have up on the wall is totally photo-op worthy!"}
{"text":"Very bright and colorful place! Baristas were kind of slow to greet and help me but the food was good! Personally loved the sugar cookie and they sell in house made popcorn too from Campbell's! They close pretty early, so be sure to get there in time!"}
{"text":"I love LOVE local coffee shops and Dewey's on the square is in such a cute little area! Very cool atmosphere and it shares space with a popcorn place too! There is plenty of seating inside as well as on the patio.   I ordered a mocha with a special blend powder they have of cinnamon and white chocolate along with a slice of banana bread. The bread was so good y'all and full of walnuts. The drink was also tasty although the first drink handed to me was incorrect. In an odd turn of events I was also shorted $3 in change but the cashier did give me the rest back and apologized for the error.   My friend ordered a sandwich and somehow the order was lost and we had to wait longer than anticipated for it to be made and unfortunately the egg was still a bit cold. Although the person before us was served a burnt bagel so it could've been worse.   I went back and forth on between three and four stars and settled on three as it's more of a 3.5. Unfortunately I can't ignore the service issues we experienced even though the staff which tilted me to three rather than 4."}
{"text":"Staff is ok...but needs better training on how to pull proper espresso shots. They are not that into making good espresso at times like other baristas Love the popcorn!"}
{"text":"I've started trying Deweys different blends of coffee with their syrup flavoring and they are excellent. I'm gonna also say their cookies are the bomb tks for the quick service as well Kudos Deweys."}
{"text":"I walked in a was greeted with a great blend of scents. A blend of popcorn and coffee. Friendly staff, fast service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I grew up in and around the Shaker Square area and feels that Dewey's captures perfectly the vibe I've always associated with the Square, laid back yet classy.  Add to the atmosphere real coffee, tea, popcorn (popped in a real popcorn popper) and ice cream Dewey's is a great sweet retreat!"}
{"text":"Good place to do some work or studying, but it's not a place I highly recommend. Good to check out though, if you're into exploring different coffee shops or cafes."}
{"text":"Dewey's has been one of my favorite Shaker Square establishments for years. I'm always really impressed by the variety of people there at any given time. Young, middle aged, old, black, white, middle eastern, asian... I've seen everyone there! I've never been disappointed with any drinks or food that I've ordered. I really love going here in the summer and sitting outside on the square. The staff has always been very friendly, not in the hipster-love-everyone kind of way that I see other places- this is just a real coffee shop, in a real neighborhood, for real people."}
{"text":"Super nice place to do work and read, or just read, if you consider reading your work. I consider reading my work, for now. Delicious zuchinni bread. Also good: bagels, blueberry muffins, cookies, bananas, teas. Love getting teas here since I no longer drink coffee. The tuna sandwiches are the best heated up! Nice employees. Outstanding ice cream flavors, e.g. black raspberry, which is chocolate and raspberry, and their chocolate blackout, mocha almond fudge, mint chocolate chip, and their watermelon sorbet. Popcorn also good. Any hot tea you can order iced. Almond milk always available. Art on the walls fantastic and they change it. Yeah, Dewey's is nice, so I'm giving them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I so badly want to go back. Friendly people work here and it's a nice, quiet atmosphere. Their chai tea latte is also really good."}
{"text":"I adore Dewey's! The staff is friendly and helpful, insightful and great at customizing drinks. I adored the atmosphere and the food was fantastic!"}
