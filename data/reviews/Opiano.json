{"text":"Nice place... big portions, im asian tourist and they have good taste of asian. Recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! They have a very friendly staff and comfy atmosphere to chill out. The Korean food they serve is cheap, legit and tastes just like homemade. I recommend bibimbap and hoedoepbap especially."}
{"text":"This places closes at 8 pm not 7 pm as indicated in Yelp.

A good option if you are looking for something quick and reasonably priced. Food was clean and delicious. Nice for take out or sit down in a food court type of setting."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Had their kimbap and got food poisoning. 
I'm guessing they did poorly in their ingredient management during the hot weathers. 
Really disappointed in their negligence."}
{"text":"It's convenient, fast, the ambiance of a student coffee shop. The crowd is young. The staff is efficient and polite. However, the food is pretty awful. It's McDonald's of Korean and Japanese. Weathered salmon and rotten ginger were not cool. Nor recommended."}
{"text":"I liked this place! It's super close to the downtown mcgill campus so it's very convenient to grab some decent Korean food. It was fast, reasonably priced and filled my craving for food from home."}
{"text":"This little hidden Korean fast food in downtown has the best pork bone soup. If you are not big fan of a soup meal, they also have this combo called Dosirak which comes with choice of meat (bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken) accompanied with rice,salad, sushi rolls, tempura at a very decent price. They also have this shaved ice dessert so finely shaved that it tastes creamy. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, and convenient. U don't have to pay for tips cos u need to serve urself. Close to McGill and easy to find to have lunch. Iove the bone soup so much!"}
{"text":"Located in the basement of a shopping complex across the street of of McGill, Opiano is tucked away in the corner, hidden just enough that I would have had a hard time stumbling upon it had we not originally set out to eat there. 

We went on a Thursday night at 6:00; it was moderately busy but not too crowded. I ordered a bibimbap, which was honestly pretty average. My friend got the tteokbokki with extra noodles - spicy but pretty good. Other friend ordered the bento box, which had huge portions. 

However, the bingsoo seriously redeemed their rating. The shaved ice was honestly amazing! I've eaten at painnamou many times, so I was glad to hear that they had moved to opiano instead of closing. If it were just the bingsoo, I'd give it a 5/5!"}
{"text":"Opiano is a great place to get quality Korean and other food for decent prices. This place is a gem in a sea of mediocrity."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and was I surprised?! The concept was a mix of food court style and a sit down restaurant. You serve yourself. You order first and then sit down. When they call your name, you pick up your food and eat. I had their bulgogi and it was so good! I like my bulgogi with a sweeter Korean BBQ sauce and Opiano really showed me what good bulgogi was. The plate that I got included the bulgogi with rice on the side and a small bowl of miso soup. It was $9/$10 which was not at all expensive because they gave you a lot of food. For dessert I split a red bean bingsoo (Korean shaved ice) with my friend. It was really good. I actually like it a lot better than Painnamou (a Korean shaved ice place that close at the beginning of Summer 2016). The bingsoo ice was quite flavourful and the red bean was not overly sweetened. I will definitely come here again!!! They also offer a lot of other things on their menu like pork bone soup, kim bap, etc!!"}
{"text":"Mon frère m'a parlé du mango bingsoo, qui est un dessert à la mangue avec de la glace concassée: très original comme plat. J'adore la mangue, alors j'ai adoré le plat. Il y a aussi un ingrédient qui ressemble à du \"rice cake\" ou du motchi qui donne une texture amusante. Je crois que c'est avec du lait condensé, car c'est quand même sucré. À essayer!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the bingsoo and not their meals. It was good, but not great. It wasn't shaved as flaky as i wanted it to be and the syrup they put just makes the flakes all mushed. Not my fave place for bingsoo."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, and I have to say, my four-star rating is based on an average of all the dishes I've tried.

Starting with the ramyun, it is nothing more than instant noodles with a few extra vegetables, so it only deserves 2.5 stars.

The dosirak pictured below is a 3.5 stars, the good side is that you get a lot of food so it is very filling, but unfortunately as with most other korean food it is really bland ( I had to add quite a bit of salt to the fried chicken)

Finally, the seafood sandwich is a solid 4.5 stars, has really nice lobster and (imitation) crab, comes with a lot of fries and salad, and the salad dressing is amazing. Unfortunately, they keep bumping up the prices on the sandwiches, so it might no longer be a good deal.

No wifi :("}
{"text":"Good ambience and nice cashier! The highlight was the bingsoo which is shave ice .it was really good , not too sweet, very tasty. But the bento bulgogi and the spicy chicken were not as good as the bingsoo, it had just the plain taste to it, not bad but not good, kind of boring taste, and the meat was not soft neither, I will be back to try some other things and hopefully it will be better than this time!"}
{"text":"Low prices.
Very gentle staff.
The food is good and tasty, every serving is big.
I tried their BBQ sandwich, is big enough and comes with fries and salad.
The only problem is that the aroma of BBQ wasn't very present, it tasted more like a plain beef sandwich.
The club sandwich is huge and it come with fries and salad too. 
In conclusion big portions for less money. A good deal if you want to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I'm quite the fan of Opiano. My sister's Korean friend recommended this place, so we knew we had to come here. The service here was pretty fast and good, it's a self-service so there weren't a lot of interaction apart from the cashier. The cashier was really nice and friendly, he showed us the difference in sizes super quickly between small and regular bingsoos. Must I say, their red bean bingsoo was PHENOMENAL, I'm definitely going back for more! My mother and sister also ordered some food - a sundubu jjigae and some tteok bokki. They were both quite good, but I'd say the tteok bokki was quite average. I'd still say the bingsoo was the highlight of the experience in Opiano though. It's worth a visit just for that. I'm so down to try other flavours on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp. I had the dosirak and my girlfriend had the bibimbap. Both excellent choices. And they were good"}
{"text":"Great find.  Located on the ground floor of an office building.  Ordered bulgogi sandwich, a bowl of ramen, and the spicy pork rice plate.  The sandwich and rice plate were better than we expected.  The ramen was very good as well.  Cool, laid back environment.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I go to this place at least 2-3 times per week. I would say this is the best place to have a decent meal around McGill. Everything from the price to the quality to the atmosphere is perfect. There is no tip since there are so servers, but everything else is more like a restaurant than a fast food place. The dishes come in nice bowls and plates on a tray. 

My favourites are the Dosirak (lunch box) and the pork bone soup. If I'm not too hungry, I'll go with the kimbap, the midi special or a salad (their salad sauce is the best I've ever had). For the Dosirak and hoedeopbap, you get a 10% coupon every time you buy one, and you can accumulate 10 of them and get one free if you go often enough (I've already gotten 3 free ones...). 

They used to also include a chocolate in the napkin which was nice but they don't anymore. I've asked and they said it was because a lot of people don't eat it and they go to waste. They told me I can still ask for them, which I do and they actually gave me a couple :) 

They are changing their menus now to include bingsoo, can't wait to see what that's like!"}
{"text":"The staff here is so sweet and the food is filling and reasonably price. Would come back again"}
{"text":"Since I discovered Opiano earlier this month, I've been there at least 6 times. 
Sadly, today is their last day before their 3 weeks-long summer vacation. 

I tried their bulgogi and spicy chicken Dosirak (combo box). Each box includes a bowl of miso soup, a salad, a good portion of rice, two pieces of vegetable tempura, 5 pieces of sushi and the main dish of choice. That's a lot of food!! Portions are always generous, and the bulgogi is one of the best I've had in town. We also tried one of their sushi dishes. It came as 6 rather large pieces - it was good, but not as satisfying as the dosirak. But it's great to share with friends if you want to try different dishes!

Now on to the bingsoo. I'm seriously addicted to it. No kidding, I think about it everyday and wouldn't mind eating it every morning and every night. We even came up with a chant for it! 

\"Shaved ice! It's so nice!
 Shaved ice! Every night!\"

We tried pretty much all flavors at this point: matcha, mango, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, red beans, rice cake. The matcha is still my ultimate favorite, but the mango is close behind. If you never had Opiano's shaved ice, today's your chance!!

I'm going there tonight for dinner, but I don't know what I will do for the next 3 weeks. I guess I'll go hide in a corner and *cry*"}
{"text":"Very tasty Korean food in a self serve setting. You order at the counter then they'll call out the number of your order. I tried the mochi and chocolate bingsoo, the pork bone soup and the pork katsu bento. The quality is good. I only wish they serve some banchans with the meal."}
{"text":"Super delicious 
Recommended by a colleague, the sushi is good, the bibibamp was super delicious, i ordered the spicy pork bibibamp. The portions are sufficient! 

The best is the bingsoo, on a hot day it's super refreshing. I got the mango bingsoo.

The vibe of the place is very dark but it looks very inviting and traditional. 

Would DEFINITELY go back!"}
{"text":"Little Korean resto tucked in a high rise complex with nice lunch menu options.  Food is made quick and the lunch boxes are very filling."}
{"text":"The food was okay, and a bit pricey.
the tteokboki's sauce was a bit too liquid and wasn't flavourful enough. 
The portions are really generous though, and they give rebate coupons for dosirak! :D
The bulgogi and crispy chicken are okay. The tempuras are good. They are a fast food, yet they price their dishes like restaurants, so a bit overpriced in my opinion. But I'll still come when I am craving for something korean since its so close to Mcgill"}
{"text":"Simply love this place! Been there few times and it never disappointed me. We ordered the dosirak spicy pork and a plate of rice cakes. The meat is well seasonned.  I've also tried their shaved ice for the first time and it is different from the Tawainese shaved ice. They are both delicious in their own way! Really refreshing. Comforting food.
They are located near metro Peel. It takes a few minutes walk to get over there. Really convenient. Always lots of people since is in downtown and it is near 2 universities.

If you haven't been there already, give it a try:)"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork bone soup because of a friend's recommendation. The soup was super good. The meat felt off the bone and the meat was well-seasoned. For 12.46$ tax included, you can beat that price. Lots of students come to eat. I would like to try the beef bento next time."}
{"text":"This place was one of my go to places while at McGill. They offer a large selection of korean, sushi and western dishes (get the korean dishes!!). My favourites are hands down the dosirak (which are bento boxes containing a spring salad with an amazing dressing, 5 pieces of sushi that have nothing special, two pieces of tempura squash, rice and a very generous portion of the meat of your choice) and the pork bone soup (super flavourful broth made out of pork bones that are not the easiest to eat). 

The prices are very fair and the portions beyond generous."}
{"text":"This place gives me such nostalgia vibes from Toronto (Scarbs, markham)!!! Everything I'd expect from a korean resto. Got the bulgogi dosirak, with my only complaint being the rice was one large glob. Probably added too much water in the cooker, so I won't hold it against them. The tempura sauce also tasted like nothing, so yeah, too much water added. I expected a sweet flavour. Anyhow, great portions, great food and a comfortable place to have a quick lunch. 
Found this place through yelp (thanks guys!) cause I pass by this place after work and never noticed it! Will be back to try other items.

Also, they play classical music, wrap a chocolate with your chopsticks and give you a 10% off coupon. Very cute."}
{"text":"This restaurant is like a food court, the pork bone soup with cabbage is not spicy enough for me, i think the pickle cabbage is not enough. But the pork bone is really good. Their quantity of the food is enough."}
{"text":"Very good shaved ice! 

Wish they would have included a greater variety of toppings though, and it's overpriced given the quality of service and the fact that it's essentially just water."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service. I tried two dishes. The beef bibimbap was OK, the pork ramen was disappointing: the broth seemed to have been made with industrial powder - or at least I found some at the bottom of my bowl when I was done eating. Apart from that OK prices, and nice location."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Great value too - a lot for $14. The bulgogi is good and not too salty or saucey. This time I got the crispy chicken and it is also really good! Everything tastes fresh and light. Decently fast service too. Would come again!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for decently priced, filling and good Korean meal this is your place! You don't feel obligated to tip much since it's a food court type of restaurant and the food comes out fast.

I had their bento and pork bone soup. I personally love their pork bone soup because it's very close to the authentic Korean dish! Bento is really good if you want to try different kinds of food in smaller portions.

I would definitely recommend for a casual dinner with good food!"}
{"text":"I believe this place is the only place in Montreal that serve bingsoo! They close pretty early so if you're passing by and it's open, grab a bingsoo because they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, great portions for the price that you pay for the meals. Highly recommend the Dosirak plate with the crispy chicken."}
{"text":"Yum so good! What a sweet little surprise hidden in the basement of this commercial building next to McGill on Sherbrooke. It's clean and bright with big comfy chairs and while the menu offers office building eats like coffee and danishes and club sandwiches, it's also got a Korean menu that's killer. I ordered the lunch box with spicy pork, it comes with salad, a couple sushi, a couple tempura vegetables, miso soup, all with fresh ingredients and delicately flavoured all for like $11! 

The amazing Arun brought me here since she's working nearby, she has become a regular at Opiano because of the happy-making vegetarian options, including some really nice plump dumplings. Friendly helpful service, super quick - if you're doing a 1hr business lunch you will be fine. Highly recommended in general. Thanks to local yelpers for helping me find magic like this!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for lunch around McGill. Also one of the best Korean restaurants in downtown. Love their pork bone soup and spicy pork. The staff are super nice. It's also very convenient for take out."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have lunch/dinner near McGill. Prices are reasonable and food is decent too. The pork bone soup was very tasty. The bento box's portion size is kid of small and you might want to order something else to be full. 
The steamed dumplings and rolls were tasteless though."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I only discovered this place today! It was under my nose all this time! I had the pork bone soup which is hearty, a tad spicy and full of flavour. Meat was tender, falling right off the bone as it should be. Perfect for a quick lunch, the food the place has is authentic, delicious and makes one miss T.o just a little bit less."}
{"text":"Nice for a quick lunch, their bento boxes are really filling but their ramen isn't too great. The tuna kimbap and bingsoo are a must! Service is always great."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for lunch and dinner! The food is very tasty, the staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the vegetarian rolls while my friend got a tofu bibimbap and we both agreed it was absolutely delicious! They have a wide selection to choose from and even if you are not big on asian food (which I can't possibly imagine, but hey, everybody's different) you could find something that would suit your taste. 

The seatings are comfortable and it is a great place to hang out with friends as the noise level is never too high even at the busiest hours and you can actually hear and be heard! It is a very intimate and relaxing spot! However, las time I checked they didn't have wifi (or you'd have to ask them for a password, not sure about that), so it's probably a better spot to read or focus on some work that doesn't involve the world wide web. But that's ok, put the smartphone down after taking a picture of the (always well presented) food, you can post that damn picture later! (the #latergram hashtag is there for a reason, people, learn to use it)"}
{"text":"This place is so boss and all the ppl there are super friendly. Its a little bit hidden but if you're a McGill student you should def know about this place. I go here frequently and honestly ALL their menu items are pretty good. My favorites are definitely their box meals (usually bulgolgi or chicken katsu), their pork bone soup and kimbaps. They also have a breakfast special if you go before 11! Prices are very reasonable as well, def recommend. Especially for students (super close to bronfman) looking for a quick yet GOOD meal in between classes."}
{"text":"Opiano is the perfect lunch spot. 

Situated in the Le Cartier building, the restaurant has really great comfortable seating and even at the busiest hours you're able to find a spot to squeeze into. 

They make the food to order so it's fresh and pretty quick too!

Their menu is extensive from club sandwiches to sushi to ramen to bibimbap and all of it is just great. My personal favourite is their Vegetable Ramen and you can ask them to top it with vegetable tempura which is just amazing. Their ramen is the Korean style spicy ramen and really just good stuff. 

They also play the nicest music - good classical music that's soothing and makes it a great place to have lunch with company because you can actually talk!

Would strongly recommend Opiano - it's a great lunch spot and you can come here and have something completely different every day of the week!"}
{"text":"La place à aller si t'aimes la cuisine coréenne et t'es proche de McGill. Le resto est caché dans un centre d'achat au coin de rue Sherbrooke et Peel. 

Très bonne bouffe et super bon rapport qualité-prix! Leur bento box coûte environ 13$ et t'as une soupe+viande+du riz+tempura+sushi+salade. Imbattable.

Leurs bingsoo à base du lait (glace râpée) sont tellement bons. Ça me fait penser à une marque de crème glacée en Chine qui n'existe plus maintenant. Des beaux souvenirs d'enfance!"}
{"text":"We ordered the the Sundubu jjigae and the pork bone soup. The pork bone soup is probably the best I've tasted around Montreal. The portions are huge and the broth is rich and savory. I would rate the soup 6/5 if I could! However, the sundubu jjigae fell short in flavour. The soup was watery, overly sweet, and not spicy at all. For $11.99, you can get a much better sundubu jjigae elsewhere."}
{"text":"Opiano is an excellent choice for students like me. Along with its good food, generous portions and relaxing environment, its serving speed is relatively fast among its peers. 

The price is quite reasonable. Having been here for more than 10 times, I assume a lunch for one person should cost around 9-13$ on average.

Overall, this restaurant deserves a five star as a semi-fast-food restaurant/cafe, considering its food quality, serving speed and convenient location. However, it does lack formality if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"It is Yelp that has lead me to this Korean café, as I would never have noticed it otherwise: it is located in the basement of a building called Le Cartier, at the corner of Sherbrooke and Peel. While the idea of a café in a basement may not sound that appealing, it is completely worth hiding from the sun for a little while. The place looks nice and simple, and there is plenty of seating space. Although the menu has a wide range of options that include sandwiches, sushi and Korean specialties, I have stuck with the dosirak so far. This delicious \"lunch box\" option averages $12 plus tax, and has everything I could possibly want in one: miso soup, rice, salad, a few sushi and tempura, along with a choice of meat. (The little piece of chococolate that they include with the meal is a nice touch as well.) The ordering process itself is quick and easy: order and pay at the front, take a seat while you wait for your number to be called, pick up your food, stare in disbelief at how big your portion is, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Being a Korean native, I can't help being skeptical of Asian food, oh yes, especially of Korean food. But Opiano has been my favorite Korean restaurant by far.

This is a good place for a reasonably priced, casual Korean (or Asian meals such as sushi) meal. Even though the low price (usually $9-13 per meal, non-obligation for the tip as well!) is the great reason to visit this place, I personally think the low price was highlighted so well so the food taste and good quality of ingredients were not featured enough. Taste is as great and authentic as ones you could eat in Korea. I also liked the food were not overwhelmingly spicy, as many current Korean restaurants currently were. 

If you are searching for a fancy, more sophisticated Asian cuisine, this place is not the perfect one. It will be packed with people, almost you'd feel like a food court. This place is for an easy and casual meal.

Generally, bento (Dosirak, or box) menu are all good that you can try little of many things. When ordering bento menu, you can ask a discount coupon for the box menu for your next visit. 

The dessert menu- Bingsu (shaved ice with all kinds of sweets) is worth to try, and the portion is large. even small would feed two enough if you are eating as a dessert after a meal."}
{"text":"Opiano is a cute little sushi bar in Le Cartier. The place itself is pretty spacious and very clean. There were several options on the menu. It gets pretty busy around lunch so I would suggest going right before noon. The food was pretty good as well, but I ordered kappa rolls and rice so it's pretty hard to get that wrong. Overall, I would recommend Opiano because it's good food that is very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, a little hard to find. Competitive price. Really nice dishes. Try the pork bone soup you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Maybe its a personal taste thing, but I was not amazed by this place. I want for the basic Korean food, bibimbap. I must admit they did have a nice twist with the sea weed but a bit pricey and overall it wasn't that good and I dont think I will come here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!

You would never expect such a good korean restaurant in the basement of an apartment building but looks can be decieving. I'm korean so I personally know from eating lots of korean food that this is really how homemade korean food tastes like. It's not super greasy nor is it over spiced/salted like they do in many restaurants. I usually take their crispy chicken or spicy chicken dosirak and THEY'RE SO FILLING for just 10-13 bucks! The owners are super generous as well!

The place might not look as such, but it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Ramyun was absolute rip off (~10$ after taxes). It was literally a pack of instant noodles (powdered mix seasoning) with the addition of a couple stripes of chicken, brocoli (??) and spring onions -- probably worth 2.30$ (after taxes hehe) honestly. 

I've been there twice, I also had the pork bone soup. The pork bone was immense, but the meat has been mostly shredded so there wasn't much to eat. The soup was spicy but lacked in depth of flavour. At this point, I think it's clear that they only cook with powered mix and pastes instead of real ingredients... 

As for their best-seller, the dosirak, the bugolgi beef was dry and flavourless. 

If it weren't the closest 'asian' restaurant around McGill, I wouldn't know why people bother going there. Might be korean/asian fever xD"}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled to have been able to try this place out! My last experience with sushi was very unpleasant. This place has restored my faith lol! I tried the lunch special. It came with a miso soup and a side of seaweed salad. It was fresh. It was tasty and it was BIG!!! I can easily find myself sharing this one order with another person. I got there five minutes after lunch hours so technically I wouldn't even be able to get the lunch special but they were kind enough to make it for me! Thanks guys! Super nice and friendly service!!!"}
