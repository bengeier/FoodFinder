{"text":"My family and I stumbled onto this restaurant by accident. We were looking for something to eat and this place appeared on the iPhone's map. (yay iPhone!) Since hubby loves Mexican cuisine, we just had to try it out. Boy are we ever glad we did. We each sampled a different dish and liked every one of them. I had the chicken with the Mole and I loved it, just spicy enough but not overwhelming.  The chicken asado (sp?) was also excellent. The tacos were equally delicious. I also can't get enough of their salsa verde. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place when they were a tiny little restaurant with 3-4 tables and a take-out section....boy how times have changed.Now that they own the entire corner of the plaza they have upsized their prices..don't get me wrong..this is the closest thing to REAL Mexican you will find without actually going to mexico. the food is fantastic!!! if u dont mind spending $13-$15 dollars...it just dissapointing to me becuase we would get the same dishes for $7-$8...I hate when places do that...but I understand that their costs go up.All in all I will go back and I have nothing but GREAT reviews for them! I always tell ppl to get mexican food there!!"}
{"text":"Woodbridge is, of course, known as an Italian bedroom community and it's not unexpected to find some great Italian restaurants. However, a good Mexican-run Mexican restaurant? SÃ¬!  This reasonably sized establishment is just off of Steeles, midway between Islington and Highway 27. As is often the case with excellent Chinese restaurants, this entirely decent Mex chow joint resides in an easily ignored strip mall. I probably would have never known about the place if a coworker hadn't stopped in out of curiosity and recommended it to me the next day.  My companion and I both had the tacos. You get 4 soft tacos done up Mexican style: a nice small flour tortilla wrapping meat and onions. The pork tacos were to die for. The nicely seasoned pork was tender and just melted in my mouth. My friend ordered the beef tacos and in an effort to maintain her girlish figure she dumped half her meal on my plate. So I got to sample the beef tacos. Compared to the pork, the beef was lacking flavor. Go for the pork. Oh man. That's good eatin'.  Each entree comes with your choice of rice, salad, and re-fried beans. Pick two. The rice was decent enough. I found the re-friend beans a bit watery. I don't know if that was the local style. I prefer a bit thicker and zestier re-fried beans.  The waiter quickly \"chips\" your table with complimentary fresh nachos and a delicious mild green salsa. The basket was refilled without charge. I always appreciate a Mexican restaurant that doesn't nickle and dime you that way.  Prices were quite reasonable. $12 per entree. I didn't notice an a la carte take out menu but it would be nice to stop in, grab 4 or 12 of the tacos, and go.  Bottom line: Great, great pork tacos. Go for the salad over the re-fried beans."}
