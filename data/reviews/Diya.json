{"text":"This was a great find, as there is mostly fast food joints in the area.
We only went for entr√©es like Samosas,  soup and Naan. 
The food is FRESH!
The Samosas were delicious. You can tell it was just made. The garlic Naan actually has real garlic instead of the usual oily garlic paste you find at other restaurants. We have been to many Indian restaurants and even India. We approve!
We will be back for sure!"}

You will not be disappointed - classy place - great service - good food at a reasonable price.

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I just had dinner at Diya with my boyfriend. The food was good but it was pricey. It has small portions and is definitely fine dining. If you are looking for an inexpensive night of Indian food with large portions, this is not the place."}
{"text":"To be honest, the food was okay but not for the price that I paid for it. The service (or lack there of) was terrible! I would not have minded to pay a lot of money for exceptional service and decent/mediocre food, but this place did not have good service and the food was not exceptional. Their food was not bad, but it was not to die for, it would never be the kind of food I would crave for. The service was really bad though. When I first walked in, the employee looked up at the opening door but did not acknowledge my presence, did not greet me and did not direct me to a table. I randomly chose a table and seated myself, and proceeded to wait 5 minutes before bringing menus. The waiter just plopped the menus down on the table and quickly scurried off before I could ask any questions about the menu. After choosing what I wanted, I had to wait about 15 minutes before getting his attention to take my order. The only reason I COULD get his attention was by standing up and waving at him for awhile before noticing me. I have the waiter my order and immediately asked him to bring me water. As he hasn't done so yet. The food was served to me after a reasonable amount of time. The waiter seemed to hide behind the counter and truly seemed to do anything to avoid acknowledging and making eye contact to any of the customers. I would not want to come back to this restaurant until they fix the customer service problem. Otherwise, I would consider coming back to the restaurant for a more fancy night out. 

Also, the parking lot for this restaurant and the rest of the building that houses other businesses is ver small, tight and cramped  it may or may not be difficult for larger car to park, exit a parking or pass through the parking lot if the parking lot already had several cars parked in it."}
{"text":"I think this place is new here in HoMa, because I never heard of it before.
But I'm so happy I found out about its existence, because we finally have some great Indian food here and on top of that: They deliver!

We ordered:
Soupe Dahl
Samosa aux legume
Jal'Frezi (agneau)
Poulet a la mangue
Bindi Bhajee
Shahi Paneer
Naan & Riz Pilau

Everything was tasty, but the mango chicken, dahl soup and okra (bindi bhajee) were my personal favourites, oh and the naan, the naan was super duper tasty too.

I hope they stay this amazing, we really needed a place like this. 
They're not super cheap, but the food was worth it imho.
I will order from this place again in the future, for sure."}
{"text":"I just came back from Diya with a group of my friends and let me tell you the food was full of flavor and spice just like back home as I am East Indian. The staff treated us like royalty and honestly we had no complaints about this classy Indian resto what so ever. I highly recommend anyone to try the food here compared to all other Indian joints in MTL this one rocks!!!"}
