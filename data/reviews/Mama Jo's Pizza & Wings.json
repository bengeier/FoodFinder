{"text":"I picked this because it was the highest rated pizza place in the area.  I read the yelp reviews.  I ordered the pizza (a pepperoni and a white). I still regret it.

Disclaimer: I am from New York, and very picky with pizza, though I am fine eating from the national chains since they are usually cheap, and really not all that bad.  However, in over 20 years in Cleveland I have decided that Ohio simply does not make good pizza.  (So, yes, I am a bit of a snob, so you can take this with a grain of salt.)

Some reviews here talk about the pizza being fresh, homemade style, and not as greasy.  Those are all true.  The cheese is also pretty good.

But this is not, in reality, pizza.  My wife and I discussed this and have independently determined that this is the worst crust we have ever had at a restaurant pizza, hands down.  And it is clearly worse than most good frozen pizza.  

We have been trying to figure out what was wrong and the only conclusion I can make is that they do not use yeast in their crust.  It tastes like a biscuit rather than a bread.  Now, granted, there are elite New York pizzas that do not add yeast to the dough, but they still rise with ambient yeast.  This is absolutely, 100%, NOT New York pizza.  This crust was thick, dry, crumbly, and difficult to eat.  It tasted like when my mom used to try to make \"quick pizza dough\" years ago from some premade mix like jiffy or bisquick.  

The sauces (both red and white) were bland, lacking both flavor and salt.  Because we only got pepperoni, I cannot comment on the other toppings.  I also did not order the deep dish, though I cannot imagine trying to eat and EVEN thicker or drier crust.

So I am certain that I will never order pizza from here again.  I literally cannot think of another pizza place that would be any worse."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got a large 4 meat pizza just  a few hrs from here and very disappointed...the dough was completely raw even the ingredients weren't cook but yet the bottom of the pizza was cooked...Other then that the lady who answered the phone was very rude and nasty and when we went there to pick up our pie all she was doing was cursing and complaining...Not going back. Doesn't even deserve a star!!!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago, and hadn't had a good deep dish since I last visited over a decade ago.  A friend of mine and my bf recommended Mama Jo's just for their regular pizza, so when we saw they had a \"Chicago High Rise\" we decided to give it a try, on the menu it claimed to be a modified version of the classic deep dish, and let's be honest, most deep dishes outside of Chicago are terrible, so my hopes weren't too high.   

As soon as I walked in to pick up the pizza, I was met with the most amazing smell of home made pizza, you know the smell, not the cookie cutter greasy cheese smell of most chains, the cashier was a 20 something Italian guy who was very friendly, and the woman behind the scenes working in the kitchen seemed to be an older Italian lady, perhaps Mama Jo? :p

When we got home and opened the box, I noticed the differences right away, but the pizza looked so fresh, I gave it a try anyway, WOW, it was delicious, ample toppings without being too much, flavorful chunky tomato marinara, and the classic almost crusty bread like crust that us Chicagoans know means good deep dish pizza.  

Not sure how their other pizzas stack up, but I will definitely be back for the Chicago High Rise!"}
{"text":"Awful. Used to come here all the time and loved it. Not sure what happened but our pizza sucked."}
{"text":"Got a 4444 meat pizza. Nothing to brag about.  I would have paid for a bowl of the sausage they use and nothing else.  The crust,  usually my favorite part,  was like a wet cracker. The pizza is the only reason they're getting 3 stars and not 1. 
The wings, ohhhhh the wings..... I got an order of a dozen mild.  They're sad.  Like a kid that lost his puppy sad.  They look,  and taste,  like they put some black pepper and red hot on them.  As if that's not bad enough,  all the wings didn't even have flavor on them.  Chewy chicken isn't good.  
In short, if you drank a 12 pack,  and maybe smoked a little herbs, this is the place for you.  If you have any sense of taste,  go to McDonald's.  You'd get a better meal there.  
Maybe the pasta and sandwiches are great.  I'll never know.  Hope that helps."}
{"text":"Barely ok pizza. Ordered a Chicago style and a thin crust. Not sure this qualified as 'Chicago' style pizza.  Very bready, not much filling, and the cheese is pretty low end. Plus the crust is sweet. Pie was very light when I picked it up, so that was a clear indication. Avoid. 
Thin crust is about the same; sweet bready crust, low end cheese, and just marginal.  I would not go here ever again."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here . Great service. Another reason to stop and visit."}
{"text":"Since moving to Ohio, we've always been looking for either NY or Chicago style pizza and it's very hard to find. So we were interesting in trying the deep dish pizza here especially after reading some good reviews.

Well the pizza here was disappointing. It's not terribly deep, and I don't think they even cook it in a deep pan, it seems just to be a thick crust with extra toppings. When we got it home, we took a bite or two, then realized it was not cooked all the way through. The dough was still raw!

We popped it in the oven for about 45 minutes and then it was finally ready and was actually not bad.  However if I had wanted to cook my pizza at home, I'd just buy the ingredients myself and save some time and a lot of money.

I guess we could have taken it back to the store, but that would have taken more time, and I'm not sure it would have done any good given the apathetic nature of the employees at this establishment.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious calzone order from  Mama Jo's. Have tried calzones from many places in the area and making them myself. Hands down the best calzones around."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Meatballs are killer... Pizza is very tasty. Don't listen to the bad reviews!"}
{"text":"Ordered the eggplant parmigiana sandwich and can't get it out of my head! Perfectly seasoned and fried with just the right amount of sauce and ooey gooey cheese. Not at all messy. Very generous portion for the price; half would have filled me up but I couldn't stop eating!"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would. I honestly do not know why that is not an option. 

Anyhow. I have been ordering from here for the last 6+ months. 

The food... Salad anyway i great. Pasta is below sub par and I cant really speak much of anything else as I haven't really tried it. 

Anyhow. Here is my review. If you liked to be treated like absolute crap by the \"person\" that answers the phone and takes the order then by all means order all the time. I however have had ENOUGH of being treated like shit. 

It doesn't matter what day, time of day, or how nice you are to her on the phone she is beyond RUDE and has an enormous attitude! Shes snappy, short and just plain shitty. EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAVE CALLED. 

Yesterday (Thursday) was the last straw. I tried for 40 minutes (as they are suppose to open at 10am) to place a large lunch order for my office. FINALLY at 10:40am (after 4 calls) she \"Rose\" answers the phone... of course with her usual rudeness... and immediately puts me on hold. She then comes back on the line, I ask for delivery, she puts me on hold  AGAIN, comes back on the line and says the earliest delivery is going to be 12:15-12:30. I said that is unacceptable, I have been trying to call and place an order for 11:30am delivery for 45 minutes now. She gets even worse with her crap and says well were busy that is the earliest. 

She was (and always is) EXTREMELY rude and unapologetic for any inconvenience. I ask who the manager is, of course SHES the manager, I ask who the owner is.. she says \"Chris\" I asked to speak with them, she states their not there, I ask when they will be and she said she doesn't know, its not a usual time when he/she comes in... another-words she doesn't want me talking to the owner. Which is absolutely fine, but I,nor the people in my office be ordering from there again, and will no longer be having them cater any of our holiday parties again in the future. 

There is absolutely NO excuse for this type of behavior. Im all for one local business supporting another, but I draw the line when the other business has clueless, rude and ignorant employees that treat their customers like shit."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!  The pizza is delicious (I ordered the deluxe).  I live very close and am disappointed in myself for waiting so long to discover how good the pizza is!  No turning back now!  Looking forward to trying the Chicago Deep Dish."}
{"text":"My boss ordered pizza here for a work party. It was decent. I guess I would say typical Cleveland \"hillbilly\" style. I would much rather have Mama Jo's than Donato's. Those are really the only options in Solon, OH; the worst city ever."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed!  I ordered a deep dish style pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions and black olives and was shocked at what I received.  It was basically a regular pizza (with a RIDICULOUS amount of black olives)covered in a layer of dough with cheese on top.  It was not deep.  It was nowhere near balanced in terms of the ingredients, we had to HUNT for any traces of sausage and mushroom, and it lacked sauce?!?!?

It was presented in a pie box, not a regular pizza box, so I thought it would be really special. When I got home and saw what it was I was just upset.  It was a complete waste of $20.

This seems like the place to go to for their $5 lunch special.  I will not return for dinner or entertainment needs.  Buyer beware!"}
