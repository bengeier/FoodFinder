{"text":"First time here, service is good but kitchen and menu options are terrible - let me explain:  it's a Saturday night at 9pm and the kitchen has made the decision that they are only offering fried items because they are too busy to cook the rest of the menu items.  The only menu items they will let you order are nachos, fries, wings, and the non-angus burger. Their manu has 33 items, but you can only order 4 of them. This is on the main bar/restaurant night of the week at prime time... Their management should be fired, unless their goal is to fail in 6mths after opening.
I'm kind of sad, because I wanted another good pub in the area :-("}
{"text":"I will start by saying , that to my knowledge this establishment was open a week before I posted this review.  Hopefully this is growing pains and can be resolved .

When we first came to the restaurant , we were seated and service seemed to be fine.  We waited 10-15 minutes , finally got waters and our waitress came to take our orders. It took another 20 minutes for us to get our beers and another 10 minutes from that to get our food. Furthermore, it seems that the waitress that we had , decided to cater the other side of the restaurant and did not check up on us at all. It was up to the bartender to give us waters and help us guide with our meal. Finally , when we asked for our bill . I kindly asked the bar tender for our bill, 25 minutes later , no bill. Finally having been fed up I asked a waitress that worked on the other side for us to get our bills. She got our original waitress , who then lost our bills and asked us what we ordered again, this process took another 10 minutes. We were in the restaurant for close to 3 hours. Not out of our own accord but because we spent an hour and a half trying to get the servers and waitresses to do their jobs.

My Opinion: The food isn't good enough to get away with such lousy service. I am always supportive of new restaurants in Scarborough, especially in a heavily traffic area such as this. Maybe its growing pains, maybe its just terrible service. Avoid on a friday night , unless you know for a fact that you will be the only one in the restaurant to get your waitresses attention.

Mediocre -sub par food , Terrible Service= 1 star , maybe even half a star."}
{"text":"The Leafs are headed to the playoffs, the Raptors are the first seed in the East, and... we're headed to Kingsmen! This new establishment appeared on my radar, seeing it everytime I passed by on McCowan. Once I finally had a free night, I headed here with the girlfriend to see what it was about.

It was a Friday night with both the Jays and Raptors playing, but there were still quite a few tables open. The very first thing we noticed was the great interior. The place is packed with TVs! No matter where you sit, you'll have at least 20 TVs in your peripheral vision. And these aren't cheap TVs either; you could see the games clearly on each hi-def screen. If that wasn't enough, there's a huge screen about 8 feet high behind the bar. You will definitely not miss the action here. 

The menu consisted of what you'd expect from a sports bar or pub, but with a twist. There seems to be a lot of Indian influence, with mutton, butter chicken, and \"Mumbai\" wings. We just went with classic sports bar orders; buffalo wings and fish and chips. 

The food came much faster than expected, to our delight. Flavourwise, it was quite average. I definitely want to come back to try some of the more adventurous options, like the curry goat or mutton, as it didn't feel right just ordering the usual suspects. 

Overall I have to give Kingsmen a 4/5. The food was average but the environment was way beyond what I expect from a Scarborough sports bar. With playoffs coming soon, this is definitely a great place to catch the games!"}
{"text":"So for food we ordered the chicken wings, mutton poutine, and crab cakes. The chicken wings were a little burnt at the bottom (but still good) the crab cakes we not very good but the mutton poutine was fantastic. We had given the crab cakes back with half of one eaten and asked it to be taken off the bill. Our waiter told us we couldn't  take it off the bill (she gave us 3 free shots instead). We also got a Long Island iced tea and there was barely any alcohol in it (they could have been running low it was a busy night). Basically the food was good and the service was okay. They need to update their menu to include more appetizer foods, it seems to be an interesting mix between a sports bar and a fine dining restaurant. It would have got 5 stars if the service was better. Ultimately it's a new restaurant and they are still getting their act together so I will definitely go back in a few months."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to its opening since I saw its renovation.  It will be a good addition to the area indeed.

The interior decor is nice, comfortable and trendy.  The chairs are very comfortable.  There are lots of TVs from super big to smaller sizes.  I can imagine how pack this place will be on a game's night.

The waitresses are young and very friendly.  I hope the good customer service can be kept up with.

I went there with 3 other colleagues during lunch hour on a Friday.  We were seated right away though the place was already a bit busy.  We were served with water and our order for a beer right away.  Our waitress came back to take our food order when we are ready.  Everything went nice and smooth.  However, we were there waiting for over 30 minutes and we ended up requesting a take out for all our food.  Our waitress kept coming to apologize before we were about to ask for our food.  She explained that all lunch orders were backed up due to the under-staff issue in the kitchen.  The other waitress also came to apologize since they did not expect the place to be as busy.  

We weren't angry at all, just a little bit disappointed we weren't able to eat our food there.  The food is actually not bad at all.  Their continuous apologies and their offer for a complimentary voucher for each of us compensated all.

I hope they are able to improve this situation fast.  I'm also looking forward to see a more extensive food and drink menu.  I will be back once I received my voucher and I will update my review:)"}
{"text":"Went with a friend to try this place out, ordered a steak was told it would be 7 oz but it looked like 4 oz my friends angus burger was bigger than my steak. I had to ask for the crab cake that comes with the meal and the service took so long. It took over 30 mins for our meals to come out. The waitress was nice and polite. This place needs help though can you send a message to Jon Taffer because this bar needs to be rescued already!"}
{"text":"First time here food was good,staff courteous and friendly. Lots of tv's everywhere great place to watch sports. Bright and cheery"}
{"text":"This was, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst dining experience I've ever had ... and we didn't even eat anything. 

I've never been to a restaurant where literally no one was eating. Everyone around my girlfriend and I was sitting there waiting for food, and looked absolutely miserable doing so. The couple next to us waited 50 minutes for butter chicken, and sent it right back. A man two seats down waited an hour for calamari, and just left. 

We eventually got our drinks after 15 minutes. My girlfriend took one sip of her Caesar and began choking because it was so sour and disgusting. 

The only redeeming quality about this place is that there's a lot of televisions. That's basically it. The server put her notepad in front of me so I could read the drink list myself, which was a first for me.

We got one menu between us, and it was filthy. Meatball was spelled wrong numerous times, which says something right there.

I've literally created a Yelp account just to warn potential patrons about this place. Steer clear. You couldn't pay me to return. Maybe it was an off night, but first impressions matter. You can find so much better in the nearby area, that there's little incentive to try this place.

Never again."}
{"text":"Horrible.

We ordered the Kingsman platter. It costs 29 bucks for it. We didn't get the onion rings and the jalapeno poppers that were included. We had to ask for it. Our server apologized and got us the remainder of the platter. 

The onions rings were fine. But the Poppers... the middle was frozen. For 29.99 they gave a shitload of battered Cauliflower which is nothing in terms of food costs.

Our server advised that the cook was making a fresh batch of poppers... let's see if they're frozen or burned to crisps. Time will tell

***Update***

The poppers were pipping hot! 

The manager took 50 percent off the platter.

The only reason they got 1 star is because of our servers patience to make up for the lackluster kitchen performance.


Other than that the decor is really dark.. not sure if it's a going for a club vibe or a sportsbar feel"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I've been to. My reasoning is as follows, the female hostess we had lacked personality. She didn't make an effort to chat or ever pretend to be charismatic. The menu was a piece of paper, with little to no option. Also there was NO drink menu, however their bar was full of alcoholic beverages. As for the food I order a poutine which cost me upwards of $10. I expected a decent size, to which my mistake I got a handful of fries with shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Another key factor in my low ratings was the cleanliness and maintenance. The female washroom was not tidy, the floor trailed in toilet paper. Likewise all the stalls except for one had no toilet paper, which means that if more than one person(coincidentally it did for me) needed to go yo the washroom you'd have to wait your turn for the one stall. Although this establishment was horrible they did have two pros, the first being the great decor on the inside. This trendy decor was accompanied by a lot of Drake music, which is never a bad thing in my perspective. Therefore music being the second best thing going for this restaurant. My friend and I were also greeted by a man, very friendly and energetic not sure if he was a customer as well, or someone who worked there but he definitely added a great inviting vibe before we entered. As it stands right now I would certainly not recommend it to anyone or return. Unfortunately this restaurant did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"A nice pub to watch lots of sports at. There are tv's all around the walls of the pub. The food is decent but not special. A small limited menu. Really accommodating for big groups and a live DJ on Thursday nights (the night we went). 

Wouldn't go for the food or drinks really, but a decent place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Mutton poutine was excellent. Only order it if you can handle spice. The Kingsmen stout was the perfect pairing. Moving forward, I can only hope they clear the beer lines regularly. Other establishments in the area don't do this and as a result, their draught beer suffers.

Dinner prices are very reasonable - perhaps this is to drive traffic through the door? Was seated at a the bar so service was excellent. Would not hesitate to come back."}
