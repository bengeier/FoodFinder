{"text":"This place has been here maybe a year now at least? I was meaning to try it for ages and my loss for waiting so long. The food is fantastic and the staff are, too. Whether it's the sandwiches, pidezzas (Turkish pizza made with pastry type bread filled with cheese and your choice of meat, etc.), desserts, hot or cold drinks and coffees, it's all beyond good. Their meat is Halal for anyone observing. The ice cream on the dessert menu is as good as some of the Woodbridge specialty caf√©s with way nicer staff. I love this place."}
{"text":"I've passed by a million times and wondered about this place. I finally took the plunge and tried it and I have to say WOW! 

The decor is very nice. It's a cute little spot. The staff is super friendly and personable. I ordered the chicken doner wrap combo. The potato wedges were crispy and had great flavour! 

The doner though...omg! I don't know what that sauce is but it's delicious! The meat was tender and flavourful! So very impressed can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice Turkish food. I tried Iskander Kabob. It was great. Nice courteous staff. Will visit again."}
