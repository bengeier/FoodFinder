{"text":"I had this pizza a while ago and was not satisfied at all. But WOW was this great. So glad we have it another shot. New ownership or new recipes but the customer service was great. Delivery could have been a little quicker but we loved the pizza and wings! Great job. See you next week."}
{"text":"Late night. Group of guys from out of town were hungry. Wanted wings. Happened upon Pizza Bomonti. Best wings I have ever eaten. You go Pizza Bomonti."}
{"text":"Ordered this pizza on new years eve since Luigis was closed. To be honest, I didn't have the highest expectations, but this was some solid pizza. Fluffy crust, a nice sauce, your standard order in. Certainly nothing exceptional, but definitely a good choice for when you just really want some pizza."}
{"text":"Online ordering is available but a little clunky. Also, the delivery person didn't know I had already paid online. The pizza is pretty good. I also got breadsticks, which are okay, but not worth what they charge for them. Delivered in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This pizza joint probably has some of the worst service. Pizza delivery takes forever. On top of that the orders I've placed in the past were very frequently screwed up. I often ordered their taco pizza, which I used to love. I would always order it without onions, and the pizza would almost always come with onions on it. Recently when this occurred, we called back and complained and they granted us a \"free\" pizza the next time we ordered. Today we tried ordering our free pizza and they told us they had no records of us being titled to a free pizza. Not only that but our pizza once came with a hair in it. Called to complain and they hung up on us. A few times we called to order pizza and no one answered the phone. And finally on one other separate occasion, my boyfriend accidentally gave them an extra $20 tip in top of the 10$ tip we originally planned on giving the delivery driver. Called to try and see if they could understand the mistake and they confirmed that one of their drivers did in fact receive a very nice tip, and of course the money was gone and that there was no possibility of refunding the money back to us. 

Their plain cheese pizza isn't that good, and their jalape√±o poppers are terribly soggy. The cheese fries always come prepared differently. Sometimes we get a cold cheese sauce on the side, or melted on top? Either way I will no longer be ordering from this establishment again, after time and time again of bad service and rude staff, I've had enough. I definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite take out food in the Bellevue area by far. The service has always been friendly, efficient, and on point. 

I am a big fan of the wraps, with a side of seasoned fries, for just $7.99. My favorite is the turkey club. I even asked once if they had a veggie wrap ( just some grilled veggies in a wrap) and he said that they did not BUT he could come up with one. AND HE DID! He seemed happy to do it, he did not up charge me, and most of all it was delicious. 

When I get delivery the service is just as efficient and just as friendly. The people here must really love their jobs and it shows. Every time  I have been told \" oh it should be about 30-40 minutes for delivery\" it will arrive within 20, no joke. I do live about a mile down the road but this is still the only place I have never had to question \" did the guy get lost??\" 

Please check out this shop ASAP!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect out of this little carry-out in Bellevue. The owner is friendly and energetic and was excited to explain his menu to my group. It was lunch time, and we were just visitors to the area. He was patient with us as we explored our options and answered all of our questions. Once we ordered, the same gentlemen that took our order quickly produced it all by himself. It was very efficient for a one-man-show and the portions and quality was worthy of the two $$ price point!"}
{"text":"I just moved into my apartment while on an extended stay here in Pittsburgh (now scheduled for 10 months).

I ordered a pizza to be delivered - google maps states the location is 6 miles away which should not be a big deal but I am quickly learning Pitt freeways are more like \"hot wheel\" track.

Unfortunately my delivery driver got lost and my food was much later.    The food order was correct but my drinks and some other items I requested did not make it.

I recommend if you are going to eat at the location.

About the food:    There pizza seems to be very similar to Papa Johns in every fashion.   Not much to say here - it was pretty good but not anything special.

Price - The price was $12 for the pie.

Service - My driver was young and lost - so I am not going to be too hard.    The order being wrong was an issue becuase there is not much you can do to fix it when you have it delivered.

Overall - give it a try and come to your own conclusion but be wary if you order for delivery.

Good Luck :-)"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's the hole-in-the-wall pizza joints that are the best. Pizza Bomonti is one of them. I placed an order for 3 pizzas for a client meeting. While they were baking I had a nice conversation with the owner. He is from Milan, Italy and we talked about the difference between America's version of Italian food and food in Italy. I've had pizza in Italy (which is a huge step above our pizza in America) and I could tell the owner tries to deliver that freshness and authenticity in his business (as best as he can with America's processed food). He also provides great customer service, as he killed a huge bee that flew in the restaurant and chased me. I will be back to this location and I highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"After my favorite pizza place closed, I was on the hunt to find a new one. I am pleased to say pizza bomanti is now in the running for my new favorite local pizza shop!"}
{"text":"I like Bomonti's (you're welcome, yinzers) a lot better now that I've discovered they have decent chicken strips, pretty good fries -- no Mandy's, but pretty good -- and an awesome sampler platter. The fried zucchini is thin longwise strips rather than planks, as it should be. Mozzarella sticks are battered rather than coated in breadcrumbs (ick) with gross oregano. Reminds me of the good old days of Italian Oven.

I should also add that I find their pepperoni pizza edible. I've decided I like their crust more than I originally thought I did, though it's nothing to write home about. The sauce isn't overwhelming even when you don't request light sauce. The pizza has a good amount of cheese; enough to make a thick layer but not so much that it's a puddle of grease. Lots of pepperoni, which keeps me happy.

Sadly, their hoagies are pretty meh. The bread seems underbaked and therefore lacks flavor and texture and gets soggy very quickly. The philly steak is edible, but the meat isn't really browned so the flavor is underdeveloped. Lots of grilled onions kind of makes up for that, though. I had a taco hoagie once and didn't love it.

Delivery is quick (even during the Steelers season opener)."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch with my girlfriend this past Saturday.  We decided to order two extra large cheese pizzas for pickup and were told that they would be ready in 15 minutes.  20 Minutes later we arrived at the store and our pizzas were ready.  I think that the whole transaction took maybe 2 minutes as the cashier was efficient.

Whenever we got home and took out the pizza the first thing that I noticed was the large amount of cheese on the pizza.  It was more than you get at most places and had a decent enough taste to it.  I personally thought that it covered up the taste of the sauce but I would rather have more cheese than sauce any day.  My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed the crust and while I agree that it was pretty good, I think that it could have been even better if it was a bit crispier.  With all of that being said I still think that Pizza Bomanti makes a great pizza as cheese can go a long way in covering other things up.

The bottom line for me is that I would deifnitely head back here for pizza again in the near future.  This is one of the better local pizza shops close to me and is the place to go to if you want a lot of cheese."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten gyros from here a few times and they have always been good. We also have always picked them up in store.

  The other day we decided to order from here for delivery.  The girl on the phone was very flat and sounded like she was in a bad mood.  We ordered 2 gyros, 2 orders of fries,  and a medium Hawaiian pizza. I've never had their pizza before but we decided to try something new.  They said on the phone the order would take about 45 minutes. 

About 30 minutes later we got a phone call from the delivery driver to confirm our address. I explained to the guy on the phone that our house is kind of hard to find.  We have a long driveway and our house isn't visible from the road.  The driver didn't speak good English but he said he understood and would be here soon.  He then called back 4 more times because he couldn't find the house.  Instead of listening to us give him directions he was saying he was by a white house with a fountain.  We have neither.   We eventually were able to get  him to the entrance to our driveway.  I saw him pull up and told him he was at our driveway. He then said \"well are you coming out then? \" my husband had to throw clothes on real quick and walk to the end of our driveway to get the food.  The delivery guy should have brought it to the door..  

Now that we finally have our food I was excited to eat it! I opened the pizza box and was instantly disappointed in what I saw.  The pizza looked like it fell off the seat in the car or something. All of the cheese and topping were all slid over to one side.  It was a mess.  I had to take a spatula and try to shift it back into place. This pizza also had a ridiculous amount of cheese on it.  So much cheese it no longer had lines from where it had been sliced.  It was pretty much 90%  cheese and 10% everything else.  It actually made the pizza limp and soggy.  We ate one slice a piece and threw the rest out. It was disgusting.  Luckily we had ordered the gyros.  They were delicious as usual and will be the one and only reason this review got 2 stars. I will never get delivery or pizza from here again."}
{"text":"This is a good taste place but can be much better if the crust of pizza can be fresh."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new pizza place. Per the reviews this place was suppose to be good. Will we order a Steak Calazone and a Cheese Calazone. The steak everything in it was raw, the dough was completely soggy, and I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. The Cheese one was just as soggy and when I took a taste it left a nasty taste in my mouth. It also tasted like plastic. We called to complain and all the man said was he was sorry. $21.38 thrown in the garbage. I will never recommend this place to my family or friends. Stay way from Pizza Bomonti. I would have given it a negative star if I could."}
{"text":"This is a good pizza.  The secret is or has been to special request extra sauce.  Their sauce is really good"}
