{"text":"My enthusiasm for this place must be measured against the fact that this is Mexican food in Ohio, so even though it's pretty good, it's not pretty good by the standards of people who grew up in the Southwest or Texas, or even any place around the country with a sizeable Latino population.
 
On the positive side, most of the staff appears to be from some country south of the border, which is more than one can say for many Mexican places in these parts.

The menu is pretty extensive and the prices are darn reasonable.  Even their margaritas aren't too expensive.  They also have an outdoor patio for those who wish to \"comer al aire.\"

All in all, the service is pretty good, the food tastes the way you expect it too, and the menu offers a lot of options, including a section for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I loved Mexican food but this wasn't that good. I came here because of the great reviews it had. I guess, it depends on what your taste in food is. The service was great, but its not enough to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, nice servers, drinks are always excellent. That ladies restroom could use some updates and fresh paint.. but all in all it's our go to spot when we want to sit at the bar and eat some Mexican food. Love the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Food is real good but the service leaves much to be desired. We sat and waited for the servers to fight over who would wait on us for 15 min. Seemed like no one did. We had the Suzy Special lunch. When the food was delivered, the server had a hot mitt on and had the mitt in my rice. Gross. They were also out of the cole slaw that goes with the chips. As we ate our food we overheard the very unprofessional servers calling other guests bitch.  Wow. And this all happened on guest appreciation day. Well at least the food was hot and tasty. No wonder they have a hiring servers sign up. They could use some new ones."}
{"text":"DO NOT waste your time or money going to this place!!! I usually go to this restaurant frequently,but my last two visits were horrible. The margaritas aren't the same they taste watered down and the prices have gone up.Dont ask to see management because Lalo acts as if you are bothering him, after he takes 10 minutes to come out to your table. I notice the change of management and I didnt have these problems when Armando was there.The servers are always nice and attentive.This restaurant has gone down and I will not be going back with my co-worker or family. I would be embarrassed to recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant with authentic food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have lunch with my dog. They have a dog friendly patio that was great. the employees we very acomodating and very good service. I had the Chori Polo which was delicious. I also got a beef soft taco to share with my dog, Dunkin. He loved it and so did I."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food goes, in the grand scheme of things, the food at Los Gallos is pretty terrible, but this is Cleveland, so Los Gallos is about as good as it gets.  I've been here a handful of times; each time, the food has been somewhat dry.  The service is also very, very slow, but also very friendly.  Prices are very reasonable, and the menu is quite extensive.  The parking lot is woefully small."}
{"text":"We went for lunch, only a few people and a medium group were in the place. We were seated right away, was given menus and asked for drink orders.  All this without a smile, then the group left and the staff proceeds to talk about them negatively.  The staff all 4 went and dove on the table for the tip.  One of the staff kept staring at me and my husband, so I smiled and he turned away.  This place makes you feel so uncomfortable.  I really can't tell you a
bout the food because we asked for to go boxes and left.  No customer service.  I will never return and advise all of my friends not to visit here."}
{"text":"I roll up in here solo for lunch sometimes.  It's pretty standard middle of the road mexi but I dig the interior decor and the staff is nice.  Good salsa and the slaw is random but tasty.  Being there makes me want to slam 5 dos equis and some tequila but I just go back to work instead."}
{"text":"Why am I giving this four stars when the service was unacceptable? Because the food was so stellar amazing. Plus, even though the server made maybe four mistakes (not briging me my refried beans, not bringing my husband his tamales, bringing me a diet coke when I wanted regular, bringing my sister in law flour tortillas when she ordered corn and never brining more chips as promised)...he was very nice in a genuine way which made you not angry. And he was one of two servers on a busy Sunday. He explained most Sunday a.m. shifts are rather slow and the place was jam-packed. The flautas (beef and chicken) were the best flautas I've had, with the beef having more flavor than the chicken. The veggie fajitas came with a surprising medley of fresh vegetables that could never be consumed in a single sitting. There were five of us dining, and with the exception of our vegetarian friend, everyone cleaned their plates, and loved their food----we just may never know about the tamales (which never came...in fact we decided to just pay for them out of sympathy and grattitude for the swamped but kind server). While three had sodas and one had beer our check still only came to 40.00 which is pretty amazing for five very full people."}
{"text":"We have been dinning at Los Gallos for over a year now. The food and service has always been good until tonight. There was a new waitress who clearly was learning the ropes. Unfortunately the manager on duty was absolutely no help. She was behind in checking out tables and never once on the four times the manager walked past our table did he take the check up for her. I saw the manager look at the  check  every time he walked past the table. There are too many other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer far superior service. This will be the last time we visit until this manager is relieved of his duties."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Attentive staff and good food.  Who can ask for anything more.  Nice to see the restaurant full in the middle of week."}
{"text":"Couldn't find anything positive to write about this restaurant. The service and food were equally disappointing. The cleanliness also left room for significant improvement. Easily the worst Mexican restaurant we have eaten at."}
{"text":"This place was a suggestion from the car salesman that hooked us up with my lovely Mazda 2 (what up, John!). We actually didn't get around to coming here for a couple of months, but, wow, was it surprising.

We were 2 of maybe 6 people in the whole place and everyone was seated in an empty section, so it seemed like you were in your own little corner of the restaurant. The whole place, with the low decorated ceilings and dark interior, reminded me of my great aunt and uncle's basement. That was where the annual holiday party was held and decked out with an authentic suit of armor that scared the crap out of the kids. Not to say this restaurant was scary, but it was very basement-y and heavily decorated like theirs so often was for the holidays. 

The service was typical of most mexican joints: you have no idea who your server exactly is, because the whole thing is such a wonderful team effort. Everyone seemed to stay on the same page, despite playing monkey in the middle with us. 

The food was all delicious and I actually ate almost all of what I got, which was probably a sign of our busy day, but it wasn't just filler--it was tasty! I must say, though, I can't say much for anything in hindsight, except for the slaw. THAT SLAW. The salsa and coleslaw were my favorite parts. Uniquely sweet and delicious (it could have come from one of those gigantic store bought tubs, I honestly don't care), the slaw was strange and satisfying. I normally don't like coleslaw, but throw some chips into the mix and I'll take care of it! 

Everything is cheap and you get great portions, too!"}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about writing this review.  It's because our server was a space cadet.  In her defense, she seemed like a high schooler muddling her way through a summer job.  In my defense, I brought my family and met friends at a restaurant expecting a professionally managed experience.  What we received was a comically confusing evening that could have been so much better. 

The food was rather good.  10 of us had a variety of beef, chicken and vegetarian meals, and the kids were welcome in the restaurant.   

The server's lack of experience and general state of confusion was the problem.  My friends and I had no trouble keeping everything straight and orderly so there was no real harm done, but it definitely colored our experience.

Based on the food alone, the restaurant would probably be worth a return trip.  It was tasty and reasonably priced.  But I\"m just not sure if I will."}
{"text":"Was on my way to the post office and notice this restaurant sitting on the corner or broadway. I thought to myself as long as I've been in Ohio I still haven't tried any Mexican restaurants. I'm from California so you can imagine my love for Mexican food. After leaving the post office I stopped by as it was now or never for me (I rarely get out). The second I stepped in I knew this was a special place. I was surprised by the amount of people inside. It seemed like this was the place to be on a Wednesday afternoon. I was seated by a waiter a very kind gentleman who was very attentive and gave me plenty of time to order. They had there lunch special going on for $4.99 so my waiter suggested I get the beef burrito lunch combo without the beef because I initially wanted a bean and cheese burrito but he suggested it would be cheaper that way. Chips and salsa with a side of coleslaw was served and although a strange combo it was quite delicious. I enjoyed the appetizer and my meal was served promptly. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because my food was not hot it was warm not cold but I like my food to taste like it was just made. It was good nonetheless but next time I hope my meal is a little warmer. My favorite part of the meal was the soft tortilla and beans. If the beans were warmer they would have killed the show. Overall I had a lovely experience and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food = 4
Price = 4
Experience = 4

Most Mexican places are all the same... this place is better than most.  Great service and super affordable lunches.  Buena comida."}
{"text":"Again, this place never disappoints. I don't know too many other places that serve a fishbowl-sized 1800 margarita for $6.50 AT LUNCHTIME.  Yep, bring back the liquid lunch. See my previous reviews on the food. Solid choice every time.  Hiccup."}
{"text":"Yessss!!! This place is amazing!! I came here after the Pagan festival not expecting much but I was very impressed. This is actual AUTHENTIC mexican. The rice and beans were so so good! The entrees are huge and cheap! I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Love this place great food nice people, once me and my friends were eating chips and we were talking about spicy dip, the manger went in the back and got his own homemade dip and gave some to us! Love this place"}
{"text":"Located at the busiest intersection of downtown Bedford, this gem serves amazing tex-mex style food with a smile. The first time I went the wings were \"blah\", but as of late, they've been consistently amazing. The taco salad is humongous, and the seafood dishes are all to die for. This place is amazing and affordable. Also they make great drinks!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Mexican place in the area, Los Gallos is definitely a step above all the other casual Mexican restaurants with the usual, boring menus. I've never had a bad meal there and the menu is pretty huge. Great margaritas and though weird, you'll love the coleslaw that comes with the chips and salsa. The El Chuby Duby and Chili Verde are my favorites, but you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"So, you pass a place for years and you just never think about...

I'd been driving by the location for Los Gallos for ages, just not thinking about it, until the other day when my wife suggested that we stop off.

I'm glad we did. Los Gallos is a very small place, located at a corner off of Broadway in Bedford, right near the railroad tracks. It's parking lot is wicked-small, just like the place, but when you get inside...there's the food:)

We got served really well, and even the chips and salsa, both made on site, were a pleasure to eat (we actually got a take away box...just for the chips.) 

I got a chicken taco salad, my wife got a combo with the BEST mole' sauce I have ever tasted. My salad was so good that I ate it right into oblivion:) 

Service was good, and the place has a dark, intimate atmosphere. I've heard some other folks had service problems; not us. Hell, my wife actually tipped THE CHEF that day because the food was so impressive. 

Again, the place is a little time-worn, but that experience translates into good food and a nice place to take someone and have quiet dinner. 

So, Los Gallos gets a thumbs up from us; if you're stopping through Bedford, and see their red brick building on the corner, stop in for a meal, I think you'll find that it's worth it:)"}
{"text":"The value of the service and food has gone down TREMENDOUSLY here. The manager is a rude asshole. If they screw up your order they do not care and expect you to pay anyway because you ordered it. They will not and do not attempt to even somewhat make the customer happy. I will NEVER return here again. If I give you my hard earned money I expect for my meal to be right. I only gave them one star because I had no choice."}
{"text":"If your looking for good Mexican food this is the place. Huge portions good atmosphere.. Wait staff is friendly & very helpful. They don't hold back on the drinks.. You won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"The free chips, salsa, and slaw are pretty good. Chips came out warm and the waiter even refreshed our chips halfway through with more warm chips. OK yes the food is pretty bland,  the salsa helps spice it up a bit. For the amount of food and the price, I'd sayits a pretty good value."}
{"text":"Service not good.   Lot of workers,  unfriendly,  don't make eye contact.   Act like they don't give a crap.  Food so so."}
{"text":"Good serving sizes, good service, food is run of the mill texmex. The carnitas was flavorful, chicken was cooked in a tomato sauce with onions. Service was good. Gummy worm margarita was fun, but bottled flavor mix it wasn't a great tasting drink. 
I gave them a 4 star for what it is, a local place with well priced food."}
{"text":"The best Mexican quesadilla I have ever had. It was overflowing with steak and chicken and bacon and peppers. Just phenomenal. I ate it in three different times because it was so big and good. The ensalada is refreshing with the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I love Mexi and have enjoyed authentic Mexican food all of my life...so it is not easy to please me.  
Nice staff, but rather impatient. The bartender was our server and all he had time to say was \"all food is good\".  He forgot our water several times, did not bring extra chips and salsa until having asked three times and the food took a while longer than I anticipated. 

I must say that once the food arrived, it was definitely worth the price in volume and taste.  So that makes the 3-star rating.  It would be a four except for the fact that they have signs that say the best Margarita in town...NOT...no alcohol at all.
A person who likes a nice beverage with their enchiladas , fajitas or tacos...just order a beer.  Can't mess that up!

Lastly, the chips and salsa are pretty decent. Not great, but decent.  They actually serve a creamy Cole slaw as well with the chips and salsa.  I think it is made with cream cheese... tasty, just a little odd."}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco de Mayo. It was really crowded but they were able to seat us promptly. I ordered a frozen margarita which was really really good! They really know how to make alcoholic drinks. For dinner i shared the Fiesta de Tacos. Best tacos hands down. Very authentic with lots of fresh seasonings. I loved the fresh cilantro, sauteed onions  and spicy salsa on the side! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice, clean, and appropriately-decorated Mexican restaurant on the main street in Bedford, Ohio. There is a good outside seating area, for nice-weather days. I ordered the $5.99 lunch special- Chili Relleno, Beef Taco, Refried Beans, and Rice, with Chips & Salsa & Coleslaw appetizer. All of it was delicious. RJT"}
{"text":"Fantastic little dive. Cole slaw as well as salsa to dip your chips with. (Trust me...its awesome) 

Indulge on the Quesadilla Guapachosa for lunch. Special on Wednesday makes it only $5."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, love the food but really getting tired of cranky waitresses. I come here 4 to 6 times per month but really am considering changing Friday night dinner joint because I feel I'm not welcome. And since when doesn't restaurant allow substitutions? I was told since I was not getting cheese or sour cream on my Danny special, if I wanted guacamole, it was an extra 4 bucks. 5 stars because I love this place bit still considering finding a place where the customer comes first."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here very frequently. It is very convenient. The service is always on point, fast and friendly. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is quaint."}
{"text":"Now I know most \"mexican\" restaurants are for the most part the same. Only thing I can say is that I really enjoyed my food. It really was so good that I will go out of my way just to have it again. I know this seems very vague but just go and order something. If you don't like it maybe only there vegetarian items are good....lol"}
{"text":"Decent food, though it's odd that coleslaw is served in a Mexican restaurant with the salsa. The enchiladas were dry, but other entrees have been good. Margaritas are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Under New Management. 

Walked in, first two waitresses looked miserable. No hello, no nothing. Didn't even speak to us. About to walk out and our \"actual\" waitress came up and was very pleasant. Didn't catch her name but she saved the day. 

Menu is all new. Wife got usual steak burrito, didn't change, she was happy. 

I ordered the barbecue pork burrito. Very subtle barbecue flavor, excellent pork and OVER STUFFED. I'm a big guy, got 2+ meals out of it. 

We will be back and ask for our same waitress. 

Note to Management: dump your dead weight waitresses. They will ruin your business. You have to know who they are."}
{"text":"Okay the knuckedraggers I work with decided here would be the place to slake our appetites as it is close and no-one had any better ideas. So....
Not bad!!!!
Yeah it's Cle and real or authentic might be a bit unattainable but it was at least tasty and the portions are very good as is pricing...
My one co-worker is lactose intolerant and asked for no cheese on anything and his came out with cheese so he was pretty bummed;  there was the issue about forgotten food and eating utensils prolly cause our server didn't speak any or much english...
But other than that...
YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Riquisimo and great service!! The atmosphere is nice and welcoming. Food is delicious people are friendly"}
{"text":"Last night, I found myself (slightly) out of town... and cheating on my usual Mexican restaurant. The worst part? It was soooo good, I'm not even sorry.

I didn't expect much when my husband and I pulled up. It looks like your typical, casual Mexican restaurant -- nothing fancy.

But we were wowed by so many little things that added up throughout dinner:
- Our server had such a great attitude, very friendly and helpful without being overbearing. Really cheered up my night!
- Delicious salsa. Nothing is worse than free, unlimited chips with crap salsa.
- Our meals were great, best chori pollo I've ever had. The chicken was juicy, high-quality white meat... not the flattened, rubbery breast you often get. And the chorizo was out of this world, great flavor with a bit of a kick! The rice was also flavorful... not dry like a lot of places, or tasting like it came out of a microwavable packet.
- When we went to leave, the server came by and bagged up our chips and queso to take home. A nice touch, usually if you pay extra for guac or queso and don't finish it, it goes to waste.
- We left to very friendly goodbyes from multiple staff members, I felt like I was leaving my family's house!

We will absolutely eat here again, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food. Just had the mushroom quesadilla and it was amazing. They have a decent vegetarian menu and the salsa is excellent. The restaurant also serves coleslaw with the salsa, which is interesting.

Mid-week coupons are usually available if you don't mind going on a weeknight. Parking is a bit odd, but nothing that should put you off from coming along. 

All-in-all, a good experience, and a reliable place to eat. We come fairly regularly."}
{"text":"One of my tops for authentic Mexican!  The fajitas are always great and great portion; definitely enough to share with two people!  The mariachi band plays on Fridays and they are awesome!  Parking sometimes a pain to get to."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on the way to Cleveland. My family was craving Mexican food, and I had a hard time finding a good Mexican Restaurant. This place left us satisfied! I ordered the dinner combination; for just $9.99 you get to choose three entree items that come with rice and beans. Also complimentary chips, salsa, and here's a unique one...cole slaw! 

I ordered a shredded beef tamale, shredded chicken tamale, and beef enchilada. I asked for no cheese when I ordered the enchilada, and everything but that had cheese, so I just scraped it off. The chips were really addicting, but the salsa tasted like the one from a jar. I LOVED the tamale-not too many places back home sell tamales so I had to try Los Gallos'. I wasn't too sure what was in the enchilada; it was like a chili-saucy consistency and I didn't see any meat. The shredded chicken taco was yummy, and I wolfed down the rice and beans. The black beans had a pico de gallo on top with tomatoes, corn, and carrots which was delicious. 

I was so full afterward; the portions are huge for the price you pay. Awesome deal! We were seated right away, service was prompt, but it took a bit to get the check."}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight and had a pretty good time. First off I absolutely loved the decor. All the rooster and hens were fabulous! I'm a crazy chicken lady so it totally appealed to me. The waitress was very friendly although service may have been a tad slow. The place is under new management so maybe they are still getting the hang of things? 

The food was pretty good. Chips and salsa was yummy and we were surprised to see Cole slaw to dip the chips in. Not really my thing but it might appeal to some. The salsa is different from any other place I've ate at. Pretty good tasting. Could be spicier though. My kids enjoyed their meals and my husband ate his pretty quick so my guess is he enjoyed it too! Parking lot is small but the location is pretty convenient. We will be back."}
{"text":"$5.99 lunch specials are very filling. Fast service, friendly staff, cozy atmosphere.

We wanted something quick but didn't want to compromise quality and this turned out to be perfect. It was nice and warm as soon as we stepped in. 

Lunch specials are different combinations of quesadillas, beef tacos, burritos, enchiladas.  Chips and salsa were very delicious."}
{"text":"Food terrible. I had bean burritos they were full of poop colored beans with at least a quart of watery   Cheese flavored sauce over them just terrible, rice dry and not seasoned, salad with corn salsa also no seasoning, the chips were stale, not warm, salsa just tomatoe sauce with no seasoning. The worst Mexican food I ever had I am not Mexican but I would put this place to shame cooking much better than them! Don't go it's a total waste of money. Service is slow also and there were only 3 tables with 2 people each in the dining room with 2 American waitresses, I didn't see any Mexican ppl so is not Authentic, maybe they were hiding in the back."}
{"text":"¡Qué sorpresa! We found ourselves rarely in this area and needed a bite for lunch. In truth, we stopped by Los Gallos because it was close. But it ended up being such a surprise!

I love Mexican food and I've struggled to find a suburban restaurant as good as some of the city ones. Gosh, I'm so glad the Yelp app led us here! I had the Carne Asada, which is a go-to dish for me. I was hesitant because it can be hit-or-miss, but it was excellent at Los Gallos. The steak was seasoned perfectly. Our food came out in less than 10 minutes, was in a HUGE portion, and very inexpensive. The complimentary salsa, which usually I don't care for much anywhere, was spicy and satisfying.

I was too nervous to practice my Spanish with our server (can anyone tell me if I got the first line of this review correct?) but he was super friendly and a total delight on a dreary day. It seemed like a lot of the staff were friends or perhaps family. Great meal, great service, and a great vibe with fun art scattered throughout. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here for father's day lunch and have been many times in the past.  The food is always very good.  Their chips and salsa are good (the salsa can use a bit more heat, but they have several hot sauces on the table) and they give a coleslaw with the salsa.  It's weird, but when you mix it with the salsa it really works.  They have a bunch of vegetarian options and the mushroom quesadilla was my favorite on the combination platter I ordered.  When I ate seafood, I loved the shrimp tacos and the shrimp burrito.  They were excellent.  Everyone at the table really enjoyed their food.  My dad's portion was bigger than him and he ate the whole thing.  My step-mom is the only one who didn't like her food, but she ordered a burger, so her opinion is invalid.  Probably the best Mexican restaurant on the east side."}
{"text":"Good food, but TERRIBLE service. The hostess rolled her eyes after she sat us and than got an attitude when I asked her about the beer selection, which she barely knew. The server did not know the menu and acted annoyed when we placed our orders. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"the service at this place is awful .. too slow & our waitress did not pay attention to what we said at all .. she came back to the table at least 3x to verify our drink order (there were 4 people .. so not a huge party) & then after taking our food order 3 of the 4 dishes came out & she said the 4th was soon to follow .. nearly 40 minutes + a half dozen reminders later that 4th dish hit the table .. so 3 of us had nearly cold food (since it was rude to eat b/4 the 4th person was served) & 1 person had hot food but it was full of grease & nearly inedible .. the what appear to be home made taco shells are really tasty .. other than that 4th plate where they arrived in a pool of grease .. not a fan of the cole slaw served w/the chips but others at the table seemed to enjoy it"}
{"text":"Once upon a time this was my favorite mexican restaurant.  As time has past the food has declined.  They make really good margaritas, frozen and on the rocks, but there food could be better. Friendly staff make the experience a 3 star instead of 2."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local Mexican restaurants. To be fair, having lived in California and Texas, Cleveland is not quite at those standards but Los Gallos has a lot of good food in plentiful portions, promptly served in a cheerful setting.  They've recently changed from Norteno music to rock en espanol, which is a good move in my book. Chips with salsa are complimentary, as well as coleslaw (oddly). The iced tea has an off taste, so not a fan of that, but they have Jarritos and a variety of margaritas to choose from. The seafood and chicken dishes are quite good.  The Ed burrito is one of my favorites with carnitas. It's huge with tender chunks of pork, and it's accompanied by their delectable sweet potato fries. I always have enough leftovers for another meal or two with this! They have a huge menu (but sadly no soups), so there's always a lot from which to choose."}
{"text":"I seriously can't believe I'm writing this on here because over the past two years this was a decent Mexican restaurant for all of us to visit!  The first time we came here two years ago we were amazed at the food, astonished at the low prices and the service was excellent but after our last few visits I don't know what happened?  Did they change staff all at once?  It was a letdown with our last few visits with the last time being a complete disappointment!  This is a shame because a small group of us have always enjoyed the flavored sodas and scenery to start with along with the amazing prices to the quality and quantity of the food.  The last few visits though, it was like a completely different restaurant.  It was terrible.  As we continued to eat at Los Gallos, the last two meals we had were not like our earlier meals/visits.  This last one in particular.  We arrived just before lunchtime in some circles (around 11 - 11:30am).  So we were planning on the lunch specials.  Well, we were seated and didn't even get menus, chips and salsa until after 5 minutes of sitting there!  While looking over the menu, we noticed the chips were stale.  When the waitress came by we told her and she didn't say much of anything except she took the bowl and returned a few minutes later with chips that were warm, salty and stale.  Fine, it wasn't important.  We ordered drinks.  My friend ordered coffee and I wanted water with lemon.  Drinks were okay and then we ordered our food.  It took 35 minutes for two lunch specials and our waitress NEVER came by in that time to check on us or anything because she was TOO BUSY talking to the guys at the bar!  Our food arrived from the same waitress.  We both asked her for refills.  Thank God, my friend had water too because with her Coffee getting cold and I finished my water, we shared her water.  Our waitress never came back with our drinks!!  She was still talking with the guys at the bar! Why was she working tables and the bar??  I had to chase/wave her down as she kept walking past us and I said to her, in a calm, normal volume, \"Excuse me, but can I get water and she would like more coffee.\"  She just looked away from us and said, \"Yes, I'm working on it.\".  I still felt the need to ask another server after that moment to make sure we had drinks coming.  Oh, they came.  I just wanted a simple water with lemon.  I received a glass of water with little to no ice.  My friend received watered down, luke warm coffee.  This drink fiasco made it difficult to enjoy our meals.  They were cold now or getting cold to the point where we had to take them home.  My friend was so disgusted and turned off by their food she did not take hers home and never wanted to return here saying, \"Last time, this IS the last time.\"  I agreed.  I took my food home to go.  When the check arrived she did not deserve any tip but I gave something just to be nice. Our total bill was just under $24 and I rounded it up to $25 with a note on the receipt saying, \"We felt we were ignored, we will not be back.\"  I am giving TWO stars because in the beginning this place so close to us where we had some memorable times and conversations with our meals.  Thanks for the better memories Los Gallos but we CANNOT return to your restaurant with service like our last visit.

UPDATE:  UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!
After a few months of driving by and seeing a sign, \"Under New Management\" a couple of us decided to give this another try.  I'm glad we did.  MUCH improved but this was just ONE visit after several disappointing visits from awhile back.  Right away we were greeted by two hostess/servers.  Environment hasn't changed but it wasn't unpleasant for a Mexican restaurant.  You expect the colorful and desert like theme and that's what they have.  After being seated we were given deliciously warm chips with both salsa AND coleslaw!  This impressed me right away!  Furthermore, the food has improved to LARGE portions for an extremely reasonable price!  The lunch specials between 11 am and 3 pm I believe are an amazing value at just $5-6 for several choices they list. Overall, the food is worth the price.   This place is worth a try again.  Also, upon leaving, I don't know if this was meant to be or just happened because they were hanging up memorabilia on the entrance/exit door windows.  As soon as we were leaving the 4-5 employees saw we were leaving, stopped putting memorabilia and signs on the windows and lined up with their backs against the wall and facing us basically giving an exit we wouldn't forget as each of them all said wonderful things upon leaving, \"Bye\", \"Thank you for coming\", \"Please come again!\", \"Thank you for stopping by, hope you enjoyed it!\".  I can honestly say, I never had an exit that I could remember like this.  Well, maybe way back when Chi Chi's was still around but I was a kid then and I just TOTALLY dated myself."}
{"text":"Went here for a second visit this past week. Awesome margarita, was a good special at$3.50 and the good was amazing again. Service was a little \"eh\" but she wasn't around much so we enjoyed our dinner plenty."}
{"text":"I sat inside my car, staring at the tired building, paralyzed by the pressure of my decision to enter what was currently a 3.5 star rated Mexican restaurant, or move on to more proven pastures. (This is the last meal I'm going to eat until dinner!) A friend texted me the encouragement I needed to walk through the glass door below the large cock (gallo) atop the building.

Immediately, I was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable atmosphere, appropriately dim lighting, spacious seating, and quality furnishings. It was sort of like Hannibal Lecter leading you down to his basement, only to find that, \"oh it's actually REALLY nice and comfortable in here.\"

I was quickly seated and served perfectly acceptable chips and salsa, while I waited for my fajitas to arrive. I will break it down by component:
-homemade tortillas were better than acceptable.
-The peppers and onions were sizzling on the plate when it was brought to me, and were appropriately carmelized. This is KEY to get fajitas. Nothing ruins a fajita more than peppers and onions that are undercooked. This was executed PERFECTLY.
-The Chicken was good enough. My preference is for a breast to be grilled, rest a moment, and then sliced into strips. Here, they cut into strips and then cook it. While it allowed for more seasoning on the outside of each bite of chicken, which I enjoyed, this method does dry out the chicken a little more. While it was a touch dry, it was still quite tasty and I finished every bit of it.
-the other sides were pretty standard with the exception of the Guacamole. The Gauc was absolutely exceptional! They are Guac Docs! I'm sure posted on their back wall, they have a PHD in avocado sciences hanging somewhere, but I didn't go verify.

Overall, highly recommend. Giving 4 stars but when the bill came, and I saw I only owed 11.90, I almost gave it 5 stars for the value. For 11.90 they had no business providing me with such an enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Better customer service from the staff is needed. I always spend money at this neighborhood restaurant but recently had the manager make a smart remark to me because I wanted back my money on a take out order that was over cooked. Get the attitudes in check and provide better customer service."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I'm originally from Las Vegas and have been searching for 3 years for a good Mexican food place and I finally found it!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food we have experienced on the southeastside. Excellent value, great portions, and wonderful food quality and taste. They also have some of the best drink and food specials, as well as mariachi band nights. I technically give a 4.5 star because service can be just average sometimes. However the food is quick and excellent which will make up for the more straight forward service."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best Mexican cuisine. The atmosphere was very fun. My sister and I hiked to   Bridle Falls and to Tinker Creek Great Falls. We decided to get some lunch before we headed home to Canton. We stumbled on Los Gallos and we are happy we did!"}
{"text":"This a great little place with great prices. They have the best burgers in the world. The people are super nice and make you feel at home."}
{"text":"The food was slightly above average for an inexpensive Mexican restaurant. I had chicken enchiladas with a red sauce that tasted slightly like mole -- wonderful. The ambiance was festive, clean and attractive, although the music playing over the speaker system was a tad loud. Our service was attentive and friendly. I wouldn't say this is a destination restaurant (a la Mi Pueblo at University Circle), but it's a good place to dine if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Damn I had a good dinner here. Carne asada. Service was outstanding. Definitely will be back."}
