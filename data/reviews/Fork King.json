{"text":"The food is only surpassed by the service. The chef puts his heart and soul into every morsel of food that touches each plate and delivers straight to the table if possible. No matter the menu, everything I have ever ordered has been amazing. I crave this food!!! Henderson's hidden gem."}
{"text":"I am really glad Gary is open again. Yeah it used to be Pho King Phonomenal  I cant wait to get my Pho Noodles.  I see you have burgers now.  That is great."}
{"text":"There are very very few places that offer creative food at a super reasonable price.  You can go for the traditional and get amazing Pho.  Or you can ask the cook and get something totally out there.  Either way, I've only had great experiences."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something delicious, different and reasonably priced...this is the spot. We've been here a couple of times now and have loved everything we've tried. It's a little difficult to find, but the directions on Yelp will get you there. Get away from the everyday food chains taking over everything and help support a local business with great food. We just moved to the henderson area and this is one of the best places we've found. I will eat here at least every other week for the foreseeable future. Check it out....I doubt you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything I've tried here is delicious. I also love that the owner is very proud of his business and culinary creations. Can't wait to see what else comes out of this kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is back open, it used to be Pho King Phoenomenal, but now it is Fork King. When it was closed for repairs, etc. I seriously could cry because I missed the pho bo soooo much. The new menu is still amazing, and doesn't disappoint and the green kimchi is heaven with the chicken fried rice. The \"monkey balls\" in the pho were a hit with my niece and nephew and they couldn't get enough. I do miss the ginger lemonade sooo much, but they still have the Thai tea which is also amazing. I miss their old hours, I'm hoping eventually they will be open at night during the week days so I can get off from a long day of work and get some bomb food!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable fresh and fun fusion food.  Food is always delicious and staff is super friendly.  Just a couple visits and you'll feel like family.  The owner is always welcoming and greating you with a smile.  He has a true passion for what he does, and it shows in his cuisine.  Don't miss out on this gem in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  It's a small place but the food is awesome, and the staff is great.   Try thia pho for a soup or any of the sandwiches for deliciousness."}
