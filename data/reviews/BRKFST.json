{"text":"Horrible service. Severely understaffed. The food was good, but for the amount of people that were here, it was far too slow. We ordered bottomless mimosas and it took almost 20 minutes to get another one. Nice location but would not recommend."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst breakfast experience I have ever had in Scottsdale or maybe ever.  I went in with a group of friends this last Sunday.    We were excited to check out this new place having all been big fans of American Junkie in years past.  When we first walked up we were very impressed with the new remodel job.  The place looks awesome.  However, that was basically the only good part of the experience.  We were seated promptly, but when we arrived there were probably only 20 people in the entire place.  The place was well staffed though with about 10 employees within sight.  When the waiter took our drink order we ordered bloody mary's and waters.  It took 15 minutes for the waiter to bring over the bloody mary's.  This was when they had 4 employees just standing around the bar doing nothing.    He then took our food order and this was the last time we saw our waiter until it was time to ask for our check.  The food came out after about 30 mins.  Again a very long time when you consider the place was not busy at all.  When the food came out they forgot my order.  I wish I could have told our waiter but he never came back to ask how everything was.  I had to flag down a bus boy to go check on it for me.  He came back in a few minutes and told me it would be right out.  Obviously they had forgotten to make it.  When it finally did come out my over easy eggs were sitting in a puddle of water.  At any other restaurant I would have sent it back, but I didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes so I just cut my losses and ate around them.  The waiter finally came back over after about a 45 minute absence.  I asked him to split our checks so we could leave.  This took about another 15 minutes.  He must have never worked at a restaurant before.  I normally always tip 20%+, but this was the first time I can remember only tipping a waiter 10%.  All in all it took about an hour and a half to get 1 drink and a simple breakfast.  We will not be coming back.  The place looks cool but that is where the good experience ends.  The bass pumping techno music on a Sunday morning at 10 am didn't provide for a great vibe either.  Lastly, you would think that a brand new restaurant's owner/manager would be walking around and asking customers for their feedback on a grand opening like this, but he/she was nowhere to be seen."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing! A nice introduction to Hawaiian infused foods.  I had the Loco Moco and loved it."}
{"text":"Keep on driving.  The food is overpriced and not very good. I had the French toast- it said 2 slices on the menu- but it was 1 slice cut in half.  I am a female and it didn't fill me up, it sure wouldn't fill a guy up.  Its like they are trying too hard to be nice here.  They are a breakfast place and nightclub? I think they should pick one and work on it.  I give it 3 months before it closes, its that bad:("}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The bacon waffles were the best! It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet. Also make sure to try the Portuguese sausage. It has a nice touch of spice. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"$15 bottomless mimosas, well worth your money after 3 of them! Service is quick and friendly and my food was piping hot when it came out! Everything has great flavor to it and the recipes are really unique. Perfect cure for what you may have been doing there the night before ;)"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. There are three tables because it's early and our potatoes came out cold. How is that possible? Bacon waffle lacked flavor.The restaurant is nice and like the colors and booths but food sub par."}
{"text":"Came in on fathers day 8 am,We never had to wait for a mimosa refill, was there before the last one was empty. Omelette was really tasty, hubbies chicken and waffles were decent, macaroni salad could be creamier like at ono. Husband got a free breakfast for fathers day as well. All in all good experience and will be back. Only negative was the server had a hair tie on her wrist that had hair clinging to it that could have dropped into the food. (It didn't). But could have."}
{"text":"We tried to get brunch today around Noon (on a Sunday) and walked in and a server walking by said \"we'll be right with you\".  A few min. went by a few more servers walked by, I guess they don't have hostesses and finally someone asked if we'd been helped and found us a table (they weren't busy).  We sat down, no one came to take a drink order, after a while the guy who sat us came back and said he guessed he'd get us drinks too.  He dropped off our bottomless mimosas and left.  We sat for a good 10min. and no one stopped by.  We asked a server walking by if he could find us a server, we see him go talk to 3-4 other servers, looked like no one knew whose table we were.  By now 20min. of sitting there looking at their very limited choice menu that is WAY over priced for a breakfast joint ($10 for ONE egg?) We had finished our first mimosas that were supposed to be bottomless and still no server.  We left some cash on the table and walked out.  Come on people, who cares whose table it is, SOMEONE take it.  Terrible service, menu looked horrible, guess we'll never know if their one egg for $10 is worth it?!  Almost forgot, they sat 4 of us with one menu.  A second came a few min. later and we finally had 4 menus after probably 5min. of sitting down."}
{"text":"Gave the place a try with my girlfriend and was very unimpressed with their service and food. Our waitress didn't even greet us for a full ten minutes and seemed pre occupied despite the restaurant being not too busy. We received our food late and my girl friends omelette was mixed up with someone elses  in the kitchen. I ordered the bacon waffle which wasn't anything special and for the price was not worth the value. The atmosphere is fun, however, and I could definitely see this being a sunday funday spot in the future. Even though our server wasnt that great, there was another server that was super helpful and sweet and was there to answer any questions we had ( great job girl with the short brown hair, tattoos, and glasses! You are awesome) this place definitely has some kinks to work out."}
{"text":"30 min wait on 2 sandwiches and salad. I don't think so. No one should wait this long at any place, specially if they are not busy.  After opening our take out ,we were shocked to find that the sandwiches were very simple and not very flavorful.  The salads were very, very basic.  I don't understand why they had me wait so long."}
{"text":"My first Loco Moco experience. My hawaii bros been telling me about it. Definitely not like anything I have eaten for breakfast. It was like breakfast, lunch and dinner all wrapped into one...In very good way! My girl had the bacon waffles, and I of course had some of hers. Really tasty! I'm not a bacon person but you can taste equal amounts of both waffle and the bacon! Great reggae music playing....turn it up tho!! That PK sound system can take it....great experience!!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience here and I'll definitely be back for breakfast. Came in on a Sunday around 1pm with my dad. Walking in no one really showed us any attention so after a while we just sat ourselves and had to find someone to clean the table off but after that little slip up the service was really good from that point on. Anywho, we had Hank who was awesome, our food was delicious and glasses were refilled any time the drinks got low. I had the eggs Benedict and my dad the bacon waffles. The food was delicious, was plated in an extremely presentable and classy way and was very filling. I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Took place of the old American Junkie. The remodel looks great, and has a whole new feel. We came with a very large group (10+), staff was VERY accommodating and friendly. Our waiter went above and beyond to ensure everyone at the table was well taken care of. As for the food - it was decent, but nothing spectacular, and portions a bit small for the price. I got the Juevos Ranchers, and my boyfriend had the sliders. Again, good, but nothing to rave about. There are better breakfast spots in town, for sure. Would I go back? Probably. Would I rush back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. For one, the food was good. I love fusion food and I'm especially glad to see a new place serve loco moco. I liked how open and bright the place is and how nice the servers were. My only concerns were for the blasting club music that doesn't really match my idea of a relaxing morning breakfast, the college boys getting drunk so early in the table next to me, and the piece of hair we found in the mac salad. Since they're just starting out I don't want to be too harsh, but Id like to go back again in a few months to see if it gets any better. To end in a good note, if  Im ever craving loco moco and Im in the Scottsdale area again, I'd definitely go here."}
{"text":"First, I want to just say how dissatisfied I was with this experience... The food was subpar and WAY over priced. TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!  I don't know if it was the horrific customer service, the watered down mimosas, or severly lacking food portions that made me feel jipped, but me and my family will never return to this place again.   Avoid at all cost, This dive won't be in business much longer I can guarantee that."}
{"text":"The fact that it doesn't open until 9am is rather telling.  This place appears to cater to hung over clubbers that hustle this part of Scottsdale.  Not necessarily my scene but still a decent breakfast.  I did fall victim to the Bacon Waffle which at $13 is basically the $6 waffle with about 1 piece of bacon crumbled up and mixed into the batter."}
{"text":"I was here today for breakfast and wasn't that impressed.  I liked the location and the front patio is pretty nice.  The overhead air curtain for the roll-up door to the patio made a lot of noise and I hope they get that serviced.  The server was very nice and brought us water right away.  Unfortunately they didn't have the Cartel iced coffee working yet.  I do like that they refill your orange juice.  I ordered the scrambled eggs and short stack of pancakes.  The pancakes where not light and fluffy but rather flat and doughy.  The manager said they are still working out the recipe so I hope they improve soon.  I'm amused at the current five star reviews for BRKFST which I assume are from friends  and family.  There are a ton of breakfast places in old town and there is definitely room for improvement at BRKFST."}
{"text":"WORST TACO TUESDAY EVERY! Took almost a hour to get one taco and then it came out cold. Drinks where empty 90% of the time. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I went with some high hopes and wasn't entirely disappointed. I met some friends for lunch on a Thursday. They weren't busy which was great because we didn't have to wait for a table. I had seen in the menu online that bottomless mimosas were available and I loved that the deal was offered on a weekday.  I was disappointed however to see that the mimosas were cut with soda water when I saw the pitcher being made at the bar. I obviously wouldn't expect any high end champagne in bottomless mimosas, but I would expect the recipe of champagne and OJ.  The positives? The menu! None of us were disappointed. I got the breakfast sliders and they were tasty. I really liked the side of potatoes with bell pepper and onion. It was nice that everything was still crispy...the veggies were cooked to mush like other places can make them. The highlight of the meal was the royal scramble. That's a tasty fried rice dish you can have for breakfast. I tried a bite of it when my friend ordered it...pretty sure that will be what I get if I go back."}
{"text":"I was visiting my son over the weekend and we had breakfast here. It was a first for all of us. My son got the waffles and chicken, daughter in law got the french toast and I got the eggs Benedict. I wish the music was a little softer, but the good food and excellent service made up for that."}
{"text":"For June's Breakfast Club UYE we went to check out BRKFST in Scottsdale. It's a newer place that is opened late and offers more than breakfast.  I liked the vibe and the feel of the restaurant, it was a tucked away from major streets and parking is limited.   After checking out the menu I went with the BRKFST Sliders, it was King Hawaiian rolls with Portuguese sausage, cheddar cheese and scrambled egg with a side of potatoes.  I also order some macaroni salad.   The sliders were good, after hitting them with some hot sauce & salt & pepper they were great! The potatoes were perfect, the only let down was the macaroni salad but I think it was me, because BRKFST is an Hawaiian themed place I just figured the macaroni salad would be more on the sweet side, but it wasn't, it was like mom's macaroni salad.  Service was great, food was good, glad to have given BRKFST a try!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews unless it helps the next customer. The first time I came here I waited in an empty dinner for 44 mins for a parfait and my friends breakfast didn't even come out! When told she forgot to put it in and if he was still hungry?... Um yes. So she put in the order again and we waited another 45 minutes. (The only reason we hung around that long was because we both had a ton of friends there meeting up to leave, they also had been there waiting on simple drinks.) I had to get up to get everything. Just terrible service all the way around. I get a groupon and decide to use it weeks later.. I call in a salad and a small pizza at 4:30pm go to pick it up, wasn't ready till 5:40pm!!!!! And it's a ghost town in there!!! No reason what so ever food should take this long!!!! I hate ordering anything from there. My mimosa tasted like shit. Hot watered down oj and  old beer. They make Denny's look and feel five star. Yea go for the DjS but be warned on ordering. The other bartender has a nasty attitude if you don't tip her more than 20% for doing absolutely nothing! Place is a joke"}
{"text":"Had a groupon deal so thought we'd try this place out for breakfast on a saturday morning. I don't think I would go again or even pay full price, considering all of the amazing breakfast and brunch spots old town offers and how mediocre the food was. Maybe I'll try it for lunch one day? I ordered an omelette with potatoes and husband had the bacon waffles. The waffles were pretty good but they were meh, just waffles, you didn't taste the bacon in them. Potato side was like rubber, I didn't even eat them. We also ordered a side of bacon and that was probably the only part of the meal I actually liked. It's pretty hard to mess up bacon. I was underwhelmed. Just walk a few blocks to all of the other true breakfast spots in old town."}
{"text":"The spam musubi is delicious and very affordable. Probably my favorite dish besides the sliders. Coffee was delicious and strong! I really enjoy this place, no matter what time of day/night. Check out happy hour here too, you will love it."}
{"text":"EEK! Such a waste of good location and space. Tried out this new place for brunch. It was nearly empty (yay for us...no wait). We opted to be seated outside. All the tables and seats were filthy. i can see if they just opened for the day that they may not have gotten to them but really? And they didnt offer to clean them off before seating us, we had to request them to clean them after we were already sat. The menu is very minimal. Food was just OK. They are open until 1am (or maybe later) which is odd for a place called \"Breakfast\" The inside is HUGE, 2 bars, and 2 outdoor patios. I wish them luck and hope they get a chance to refine their business."}
{"text":"Tried brkfst for the first time and I was not impressed. The location is great as is the appearance of the restaurant however I was not impressed with the taste of my food. I have rancheros and it was very blah. There was no taste to it what's so every. I was also not impressed with the menu as it was very limited. Our waitress was great so no complaints about service just the food. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Group of 4. Great and prompt service as always.  Tried the Bacon Waffle amazing! So is their coconut vodka water!!  Must come and try your self!"}
{"text":"Slow service but nice ambience. Come here with time in your hands. Very nice attitude.... And reasonably good food."}
{"text":"Very slow, yet over staffed.  No defined manager keeping the place in order.  Has that club vibe with the house/bass pumping music playing.   Is it breakfast or a night club?  Tried the Korean chicken & (bacon) waffle.  (They sprinkle cilantro on the chicken for any haters).  Wasn't bad but at $16 a plate no thanks. I'll go to Lolo's.  Might stop back for a drink but I'll skip breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"I tried BRKFST because I got a Groupon. I'd read the mixed reviews. I have to compliment them on being a surprisingly good find. I didn't get the Korean chicken as I had planned but settled with eggs, bacon and potatoes with a waffle side. The food came out quick and hot and was good. Great, attentive service as well. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Slow service. We waited for our waiter to take order and to bring check for about 10-12 min each. Food was very bland. They are trying to change these things. The new GM/consultant was very nice. We will return in a month or so and see if things have gotten better"}
{"text":"Good secluded location.  The food was a little mediocre for my taste.  There was absolutely nothing special about it.  It's like plain ol house breakfast that anyone can make at home.  For what it is, it is pretty pricy.  Nonetheless, waiter was nice and the restaurant was nice and roomy."}
{"text":"The first impression I get from this place is kind of blank and very simple. The menu is interesting enough and gives plenty of \"healthy\" options. Noticing the somewhat Hawaiian influence, I was intrigued. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian French toast with the Portuguese sausage, plus one over easy egg. I ordered the eggs Benedict which came with a side of roasted potatoes. Everything was very well prepared and delicious besides that single over easy egg... Which was cooked well over hard and rubbery. He sent the egg back requesting over easy, and was brought back yet again, rubbery and over cooked. He ate a piece to not make a fuss, but didn't finish it since at this point, our other food was already eaten. It was puzzling to me how one egg could be messed up twice, but my Benedict was perfect? Portions are adequate to small but flavorful. The Portuguese sausage is very unique and surprising!  The service was not great. Pretty slow and unmotivated but there were only 4 other tables so, again, it was puzzling. I like the unique flavors but there are several gaps in the service. I'd like to think that I'll be back, hopefully."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to come here with the Breakfast Club UYE. This new breakfast place in the old American Junkie space has transformed into a light and welcoming restaurant. The food was a little expensive and the menu was, at times, inaccurate (I ordered the loco moco (points for having this!) which said it came with two eggs and two beef patties, but only came with one of each... now, I would only want one of each, but it should be served as stated on the menu). The loco moco was really flavorful, and, I'll admit, I ate the whole thing. The husband had the pancakes, which were large, but a bit dense... not bad, but not great. They did come with a bowl of fruit though, which was a huge plus. I would definitely come back (though I did hear they were closed until Aug 1st for some reason?)."}
{"text":"So basically I love this place. I'm a HUGE breakfast lover and this place is awesome. Great food, great drinks, awesome location, staff is on point! Must try!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing. I've had authentic Hawaiian food in Hawaii before and this place does it right! Spot on! I had the LocoMoco, it was delicious. I'll definitely be back to have it again. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu as well.  Staff and atmosphere were great. Really enjoyed this spot!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Their biscuits and gravy is so good, probably the best I've had. The service is absolutely horrible though. We witnessed at least three groups walk in and stand at the door for a solid 5 minutes, and then leave because they weren't even looked at. It took over two hours for us to order, get drinks and breakfast and get our check. Even as I'm writing this we're still here waiting for the waiter to bring us our bill. It's a little ridiculous...."}
