{"text":"Great price for the serving sizes!  I only wish that they used real maple syrup instead of the cheap fake stuff. There's no point in ordering waffles or pancakes when the maple syrup ruins it."}
{"text":"We checked this restaurant out on a Friday afternoon! Not too busy and very attentive service.  Our meals were quick to order and fresh!  We loved the quaint atmosphere and friendly staff. You get your money's worth and lots of choices to choose from. Definitely worth checking out if your looking for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Just went to Flips for the first time this week and I was VERY impressed!!  Lots of flexibility in the menu and in choosing exactly what YOU want to eat.  High quality, generous servings, tasty food.  Love the fresh fruit option!    It's a busy, crowded place.  That can make some people grumpy.  But you can just use it as an opportunity to be friendly and get to know the people at the next table.  Which is what we did!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Brampton. The food is good and portions are massive. It's always cooked perfectly.  Because it's so yummy but also affordable it gets insanely busy on weekends and the seating can be a bit cramped. But the food never takes long to arrive and it's a nice place to actually spark up a conversation with other diners. Clean,  friendly staff. Cash only."}
{"text":"Huge portions! We ordered the lite breakfast with grilled tomatoes and scrambled eggs, and they brought us free blueberry pancakes on top of it all! Great service, friendly staff and excellent value! FYI cash only, but they have an ATM on site."}
{"text":"This place serves your regular breakfast food, with a side of really bad attitude.  I've been twice and def won't go again after my most recent experience.  First the good - the food. Big portions, nice home fries, amazing soft Belgian waffle. Price wise it is just ok and not a steal of a deal.  The bad - in this day and age, they only take cash. So if you don't know you'll be forced to use their ATM machine which charges a $2 fee plus ur own bank's fees; ridiculous. Why don't they offer free debit/interac like the rest of the world??? Just cheap unnecessary cost saving measures. Also the restaurant is very small, seating is cramped so you will almost surely wait to be seated and then be sitting elbow to elbow with strangers.  The UGLY - the day I went there was a manager onsite named Chris. I had ordered one of their specials that came with eggs one meat home fries and a belgian waffle. First I asked to split my meat eg half bacon, half sausage. They said no. I was miffed but ok whatever I went with sausage. Then I asked for my waffle to be made & brought out later, after I was done eating my savoury stuff (so it would be fresh and not get cold sitting on my plate). The waitress informed me that per Chris they could not do this. Could not? Or WOULD not? SO confused, I asked then spoke to their manager Chris who very rudely informed me that they refused to hold my waffle order til later (ie could have but would not) bcuz they were \"too busy\" and refused to heat up my waffle if it did get cold after they brought it out the same time as my savory food. When I voiced my dissatisfaction with Chris' answer he then suggested I just order my savoury food first then place a second separate order for the waffle by itself, which would have cost me almost double the price of the breakfast special!! I pointed this out to Chris and he refused to give me the breakfast special pricing and instead told me I didnt have to eat there. I was soooo shocked! I said you're right Chris, I don't and I left immediately. Never again!!!  Just bad customer service for NO apparent reason."}
{"text":"I tried going there weekends. It's pretty busy. I have picked up and the food was pretty good , the portions good size and pricing ok. The only major problem is I called to make an order and they hung up on me. I called again and they hung up again. Not the first time this has happened here. I assumed they either knew me or had made so much money they couldn't care about mine. I decided to give one of the other restaurants in the area a chance to accept my money and they did so I guess it was good cash. I have not been back since Maybe there's no tips in pick ups so nobody cares about you. I would rate it higher but if you're good ,you're good all the time."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in Brampton. The price is steeper than some breakfast ($11-$13 max) places but the amount of food you get is ridiculous. I've been to other breakfast places in Brampton and the price is just as high but the portions are small. The amount of food you will receive at this place is incredible for the price and the quality of food is even better. Would definitely recommend trying out the eggs benedict as it is the best I've ever tried along with the campfire skillet. Everything is quality here and definitely worth the wait when it's busy."}
{"text":"Great and cheap place to eat. You need to have the grilled cheese and bacon sandwich."}
{"text":"It's like one of those old school family breakfast bars; the place is quite crowded during the weekends, and getting a decent table probably may be a challenge. Apart from these small upsets, the food is quite a delicacy. The bacon, the sausage, the eggs .. Yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Good quality and quantity! The size the pancakes are larger than my hand! Fresh fruits and a offer of free waffles to taste. Thank you"}
{"text":"Huge portions and a great spot for some tasty breakfast fare. Place is small with limited seating so it can be a little cramped. Prices aren't cheap but it's worth it for the amount of food you get.... will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday with my daughter. As it was a Tuesday and we didn't get there til 10:30ish there was no line up, we were sat straight away.  It was still busy though with tables not empty for more than a few minutes.  Service was good and our food came out quickly.  Enormous portions.  I ordered the 'build your own' and had 2 eggs, bacon, home fries and grilled tomato. There was a pile of potato and about 6 rashers of bacon, plus the tomato was sliced and grilled right through, not cut in half and just warm.  I loved it! My daughter had 2 eggs, sausage, pancake and toast.  The pancake was light and fluffy and the sausages were delicious. We paid $32 plus a tip so it's not a cheap breakfast but it's so worth the money that we will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often, but I hadn't been in ages until last week. We got in and were told that we had to order first before we took a table. I REPEAT, THAT WE WERE TOLD NOT TO TAKE A TABLE UNTIL AFTER WE HAD ORDERED. I was fine with this because this is the procedure at Stoney's in Oakville so I'm used to it and I saw there was a 4-top that we could grab. So we're ordering and another party walks in and grabs the 4-top. Nobody stops them and tells them to go order first. So they took the table and sent one person up to order.   We got juices and teas, etc and had no place to put them down. Also, my friend had her 5-year old with her so this was massively inconvenient. One of the servers came over to us and said, \"Oh, you don't have a table yet?\" We said we didn't and that the available 4 top had been taken. She said, \"Oh. We'll just hold off on firing your order until you find a table.\" We stood around, with juices and hot teas in our hands, waiting around for a table for over a half hour.   Finally, a table became available and, to add insult to injury, I don't think anyone remembered to fire our order because it took forever for us to get our food.  Would not come here again. If you have more than two people in your dining party, don't bother. There's no organization or control over the new table system here. One of the worst breakfast dining experiences of my life."}
{"text":"The minute I walked in, I didn't know I had to place an order before sitting. Didn't realize also that the tea and coffee station was self serve. Maybe because I was so distracted by how small and crowded it was during the time that I went.   I ordered the Country Harvest; bacon, eggs, pancake, and sausage. Nothing out of the ordinary.   Staff were busy running around but cashier was friendly.   I don't think I'd rate it my top five. I would still pick Friends Cafe for breakfast over any other restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe me being from America I'm used to a certain standard and all but in my opinion the food here is just basic and not all that.   I ordered the strawberry French toast breakfast and the French toast was completely flavorless; maybe in Canada it's not tradition to use vanilla, cinnamon  or nutmeg in the French toast batter; but that's just the flavor combo I'm used to. The sausage was bland & if you order scrambled eggs they don't crack fresh eggs and scramble them; they use the powdered of liquid mix and scramble them.   As far as service is concerned the ladies at the counter are sweet and patient, the food was served promptly, the presentation of the food was nice and the restaurant in itself was clean but food-wise I wasn't impressed at all by the food especially for the price."}
{"text":"Friday morning I found myself making the trek out to one Yelp GTA's remaining towns that I hadn't ventured too yet, Brampton, to meet up with an old friend for some early morning breakfast at Flips. Yes, we met at flips on friday for a friday flip. Love how that rolls off the tongue (I think there is a commercial in there somewhere)  Not at all hard to find it's located directly across the street from the busy hustle and bustle of Walmart which might explain the Friday morning out the door line up (seriously I've never seen a line up for breakfast on a weekday - thank goodness we arrived early and beat the rush). The reputation of this spot is unreal.... I'm surprised there isn't way more review (come on Brampton get on this)  Flips is a tiny spot (maybe 20-25 tightly packed tables) but is a Decent spot.... I really do love these tiny greasy spoons, as Dave M mentions, no flash, no pizazz just breakfast.  My only note was I found that with how busy they are there was a lack in attention to details by the wait staff and the kitchen. I found they didn't pay attention to orders, my friend ordered a glass of water with his coffee and it never came until we made mention of it a second and third time, and i ordered my omelet cooked lightly (I'm picky about the omelets being cooked brown) and it was cooked brown/well done.  That being said, once I removed the darker parts the Canadian Omelet's (bacon, mushroom, cheddar cheese and tomato) taste was great though and the size to price ratio was awesome. The omelet's portion was huge (CFL football size) and pricing was average ...not too expensive  I decided that since this spot is called Flips I best order something flippable and ordered a single chocolate chip pancake...awesome!!! It was like 2 pancakes on top of one another, cooked perfectly on both sides with no crusty side (you know what Im talking about with one side of the pancake almost always being crispier). Perfect flip FLIPS!  When I'm in B-town again I'll be sure to stop in for some more breakfast, I give this spot a 3.5 star with the added note that I'll be back MANY times.  Gotta love them greasy spoons!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is mediocre, and atmosphere is... Cramped.   I love a good breakfast on the weekend, it's almost a staple to the weekend. Breakfast sausage is delicious, the bacon is cooked to perfection, potatoes are a bit over seasoned for my taste. I like my eggs over easy and they were perfect.  Where Flips lost their two stars with me is the atmosphere of the restaurant.. I like going out to eat with my family or friends, not perfect strangers. If you're only a table of two you can guarantee you will end up sharing a table with two other strangers.   Also, if you have a child in stroller, car seat or high chair, it's very cramped with only a tiny walk way between. If this was in a bigger location it would be the perfect breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Excellent food with consistent service. I've never seen the place empty and for good reason, this greasy spoon diner is a Brampton breakfast/brunch hotspot. From the eggs to the pancakes, they've got it down. My only complaints are they don't take debit and overcharge for orange juice. But overall, whether you're visiting Brampton, or you're living here and haven't had Flips, make plans to eat here."}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast place you can ever go to. Forget all those other ones that exist in chains upon chains of restaurants. Flips will give you the best quality and quantity for the price you pay. Their plates are HUGE and totally worth the 40 minute wait at times! Just a fair warning though, CASH only (when I was there last time a few months ago)"}
{"text":"Best go-to breakfast joint in Brampton. Perfect for weekends when you're too lazy to make bfast and really hungry. Good size portions and reasonably priced. If you're late there may be a few mins wait. Note that they take cash only... so pick some up on your way there."}
{"text":"Homestyle Breakfast for supercheap. If your ever in the area and want a generous serving of food go to FLIPs. Its really small and you may have to wait but boy is it worth it. Everything on my plate was fresh and cooked perfectly. Typical breakfast dinner. Make your life easier bring cash for payment."}
{"text":"Located so conveniently close to where I live, oh how I love Flips!  The inside is so relaxing, no flash whatsoever, and is perfect for just taking a seat in the corner and relaxing with your breakfast. The servers are also always very cheerful, and really seem to enjoy themselves.  As for the food itself, I love it. I don't think I've ever ordered a single thing off of the menu that was lacking. Delicious brekkie goodness! I especially love their pancakes and waffles.  It should be noted that it IS a tad pricey. If I'm there alone, I'm generally looking at spending ~20$, which is quite a bit for 1 person's breakfast. I happen to think it's worth it because the food is great, but I can see how someone might object to it.   The only other complaint I have (which is one I'm sure many have) is that it closes so early. If this place decided to make the jump to 24 hour breakfast joint, I'd be first in line to take advantage of post-5pm pancasm!"}
{"text":"Flips is a regular stop for us. I love the food, prices, and service. They have all manner of breakfast specials ranging from \"light fare\" to \"meat salad\", and even lunch and dinner items. I usually get the bacon and eggs with rye toast, and my husband usually gets the Campfire Skillet (the aforementioned \"meat salad\").  I pondered a 5-star review because I'm a big fan, but there are a few annoyances:  It gets crowded fast, and seating is a little too intimate. It's a strangers-right-on-top-of-each-other thing. I might not mind how busy Flips gets if there were a good place to wait, but there's no place to queue other than the very small spot in front of the door. Often we go somewhere else if we sleep late on a weekend because we know it will be difficult to get a seat without awkwardly waiting around the entrance.  Flips, I beg of you: add an addition!"}
{"text":"Hey this is our go-to place for breakfast on the weekend. It is busy so you will have to wait a bit. The food is fresh, the portions are big, and the service quick. We enjoy breaking our fast at Flips. The prices are reasonable, and the coffee is good. Ask for the potatoes to be well done they are really good when they are crispy. I don't know where they get their bacon, but the slices are thick and salty and wonderful. If only they had farmer sausages... Anyway, the pancakes are great too."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in some time, but feel I should add my 2 cents and 2 stars to this Brampton staple.  To keep it brief, the food is okay - but nothing special, and too salty and greasy. I would say in and of itself it deserves a 3 star rating, but with the prices being too high, I'd say the lack of value brings it down to a 2.  Rant: Flips, being one of few places specializing in breakfast in Brampton epitomizes how badly this town needs a good one. They're always packed out so there's clearly demand. I swear, if someone had money to invest in a place and connections to a good chef they would make an absolute killing. One can dream..."}
{"text":"I was looking for to eating here for quite some time.  The place has a really nice old country style inn feel and the staff are friendly.  There is always a line up and it always looks like it is worth the wait.  We waited for about 15 minutes for a table and our expectations were extremely high.  The portions and plates are HUGE so make sure you come here hungover and super super hungry to get your moneys worth.  I ordered they usual eggs, bacon, french toast, and home fries.  Everything looked okay until I realized that everything tasted like salt.  There was salt in everything and it was hard to eat.  The french toast was horrible and it tasted like bread dipped in a really bad egg.  The eggs tasted like powdered eggs and were extremely hard to eat.  Overall, I left flips disappointed and will not go back.  Maybe they were having an \"off\" day or maybe my expectations were too high.... regardless... Flips was an utter fail for food."}
{"text":"This place totally redeemed itself and has become a regular option for my friends and I. My only issue is that the cooks need to pour more batter into the iron for the waffles or mix it thicker as it leads to waffles that are crispy on the outside, but not much in the middle."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. I was very surprised with the quality and service. Big portions and very reasonably priced. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Flips is like a cornerstone of Brampton, as in, on the 7th day, God created the Flips.   Flips is a tiny place with maybe 20 tables, always a line up and nary a bad choice on the menu. For $10.95, you can get 2 eggs, toast, home fries, bacon and a chocolate chip pancake. Like, for reals. Everyone I knew in highschool worked here at one time or another.   The staff are all under 16, for sure, and super cheerful 'cause they're not jaded work-force drones yet. If you hire over 18, that's what you get. See? Deductive reasoning.   But anyway, they offer substitutes like egg whites, various kinds of toast and healthier sides, like grilled tomatoes, etc.   The only annoying things are this;   1) The lineup and the fact that there is approximately 1 sq. ft. for people to wait in.   2) No debit or credit. They have an ATM which costs your first born to withdraw money, though. So, cool.   3) The service is slow, because every one who works there is busy being cheerful.   Love Flips! I hope it stays open forever."}
{"text":"If you seek an American Breakfast place with bacon, sausages, fair price and no BS then you got to come here... U order and pay first and find yourself a seat. Servers are nice and fast. Food could take a little time or not depending on how busy the place is. Coffee (pretty decent) once ordered comes with free refills. The home fries were crisp and well seasoned. Just an FYI , drive a tad bit further then where the GPS tells u it's located and u will come across the big \"FLIPS\" written across their roof."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my breakfast here at Flips, large portions and great tasting food. Two issues I did have was getting any kind of service after you've sat down is hard due to there being no waiter or waitress service. I needed more hot water for my tea and there was no one to be found. Second issue is the price, it's not cheap here at all, in my opinion breakfast should not be this expensive especially since you're not paying for table service or decor(its a small basic restaurant). I'll definitely be back but only when I feel like spending that type of money."}
{"text":"I came here once with a friend of mine for breakfast. The food came out promptly and the servers took our dishes away very wuickly. The staff are very kind and know how to take care of their customers. Despite the fact that this is a cash only establishment, there is an ATM located inside of the store in case you forget.  The meal however, was great nonetheless. I ordered 3 eggs, toast, sausages and homestyle potatoes or fries. Everything was delicious. Just keep in mind that they do not use glasses, so if you ask for orange juice or such, they will come out with a bottle of your beverage.  Overall, really nice place if youre in the area."}
{"text":"I am huge on breakfast, and this place does not disappoint! The portions are massive, so much that you could split one breakfast between two people. Not only are the potions huge, they're delicious. The eggs are always perfectly cooked and the toast isn't too buttery! The only downside is the price. Between my boyfriend and I, we ended up spending $40. Although when my best friend and I went we only spent $20 because we shared a meal.   I think this place could improve with the option of smaller portions and cheaper prices. Besides this, I highly recommend this spot!  THIS SPOT IS CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"The fact that my boyfriend and I go here almost every weekend for breakfast/brunch says it all.  Portions are massive, cost is cheap, and options are limitless. They have a variety of breakfasts available (pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs, sausage, yogurt, etc., etc.), so you'll likely find something for everyone! Their side dishes are great, too. You can pick from pancakes, bacon, eggs, fruit, grilled tomatoes, and many more.  I always get the \"Breakfast My Way\" with 4 sides (around $9) containing 1 massive/thick strawberry pancake, 2 sides of fresh fruit, and 1 side of home fries. Fills me right up. My boyfriend usually get a dish containing bacon, sausages, eggs, toast, and fruit.  What keeps this place from 5 stars: - it's tiny & packed. You're basically going to sit elbow-to-elbow to the people at the next table. Hope they don't smell too badly of B.O. - there's always a wait if you go after 10am. And no space to wait. You'll pretty much be trying to find 1 available squared-foot to stand in, often knocking the elbows of the poor people trying to eat breaky. Expect a 15-min wait minimum. - a couple times, my boyfriend's bacon has come out burnt, and he's had to send it back. - they do not understand the concept of over-medium eggs (my boyfriend's preference), so he has just started ordering scrambled. - they are super busy, and the servers sometimes forget if you ask for something (ie. a refill of water, maple syrup, or hot sauce)  But the quality and quantity of the food is well worth it! Which is why we'll be a repeat customer until they day they close down!  **THEY DO NOT ACCEPT DEBIT/CREDIT** But there is an ATM machine inside, if you don't mind the service charge. Last time I was there, I saw a sign in the window saying \"debit/credit coming soon\", so this may change in the near future!"}
{"text":"Big line up on NYE morning (as I should have expected on the last day of the year!) at Flips. As others have mentioned, the seating is pretty tight so expect to get to know your neighbours as we did that day ;)  Food is decent, portions are redonkulous (the plates are almost bigger than the tiny tables), value is great. I just wish their coffee was a bit better, but I suppose you get what you pay for!   Flips is a solid breakfast option in Brampton IMO."}
{"text":"Amazing food.. Especially the chocolate chip pancakes and home fries.. It's a small family run restaurant so the food isn't like most fast food places..  It's pretty small inside so usually a longer wait especially on weekends..  They only take cash remember that.."}
{"text":"Great quality breakfast food and believe it or not amazing burgers. This was THE breakfast place before they all started cropping up all over the place. Where they lost me years ago though was when they stopped poaching the eggs for their eggs benedict. Why? I could imagine no earthly reason why a place essentially specializing in eggs chose to no longer prepare them poached."}
{"text":"You need to be all day  I love the bacon and I personally think they need combos for takeout  Great coffee and a newspaper"}
{"text":"I had bad experience at Sunset Grill. Just at the greeting so I came here. Service was amazing. Several options under $10 and refill free tea and coffee!! Thanks for the amazing service ordering Brittany! Great attitude and service makes a difference. Maybe cause she was younger. The older lady at Sunset may need to retire ?"}
{"text":"Good breakfast food but way too expensive for what it is, and for this reason I most likely won't be returning.  Would rather go to Stacy Lee's and get the same food, bigger portions, and for less overall money than this.  I think that plate of food you'll see in the pictures costs something like $14 before tax (2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, 2 pieces of bacon and fried potato hashbrowns)..  And the $3.50 orange juice you order is a small 355ml plastic minute maid bottle.  When breakfast for one person costs $20, something isn't right..  Closes by 4pm."}
{"text":"3.5  Flips is THE breakfast joint in Brampton.  However, I wish there were more, as wait times and lines here can get long.  This is not especially great when you're starving and waiting for your first meal of the day.  Hungry Sam is not a pleasant Sam.  I've been here many times and have tried a few things.  As you've noticed from the pictures, portions are HUGE.  They serve everything on I swear what are turkey serving dishes.  So you do get your moneys worth here.  Prices aren't extreme either.  Pancakes are plentiful and fluffy.  I usually get the plain and blueberry ones.  Yes, they are yummy.  On my most recent visit, I wanted a little bit of everything.  So I decided to do the \"build your own breakfast\".  My friend also did the same thing.  I got the three items and he got the four items.  I got one pancake, bacon and the fruit.  My friend got the sausages, eggs, home fries and fruit.  They say it's like 3 pieces of bacon but when you actually get it, it's 6 or 7.  See my picture.  That's A LOT of bacon.  I'm not one to waste bacon, that's a no no, but I literally could not eat all the pieces.  I do enjoy their fruit selection.  Much better than Cora's.  The oranges and strawberries are ripe and refreshing.  I like how they don't serve and fill up on unripe melon, like other places.  Home fries are so delicious here.  Plentiful and flavouful!  Service is usually ok.  They have lot of workers on hand.  Although there are waits, turn around times are usually fast.  The waitresses are always quick to clean up a table.  I will likely return as my friends do enjoy it here.  I don't mind it at all.  I just hate having to wait."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Saturday breakfast as I always see this place very full. When I walked in, I realized that they were a serve yourself kind of joint. You ordered at the front, took a number and then they would bring the food to you. The ladies at the front were lovely, we got our orders in, grabbed some coffee with our mugs and then we took a seat. For two people, our breakfast cost about $30. I felt that was a touch expensive for what we received. However the portions were large. I wished the items had more flavour. This restaurant reminded me of a diner. The food was okay. The eggs were cooked well, my bacon was soggy (I usually prefer a crust on the outer edge) and the fruit medley was a nice touch. I wished that the sausages and bacon had more flavour instead of just being salty. My finance's steak was very thin and there was lots of cheese. Overall, this place is a lovely local joint. A place where the community gathers and that was lovely to see. Food wise, if you are looking for a greasy spoon with large portions -- this place is for you."}
{"text":"I've wanted to like this place, it's so popular.. but I just can't.  First the good, centrally located, clean, great homefries, and the portions are huge (really huge).  And I don't like anything else about it.  Don't bother going on a weekend, or a holiday as you won't get a seat.  You're on your own to get a table, the wait staff do nothing to prioritize or help.  And the service is slooooow (was slow).  Now they don't have table service and you order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table.  The food is fine.  Not spectacular, not good, just fine.  Nothing wrong with it by nothing especially great.    I love Eggs Benedict, and they have a wide range on their menu.. BUT Want a poached egg?  No.  Want hollandaise that doesn't come out of package?  No.  Want to pay with cash?  No.  Want to pay $50 for a breakfast for two (see picture)?  Oh yes, you can do that.    I really don't get what all the fuss is about.  Go to Giggling Tomatoes and get a cheap breakfast and get great value for your money.  They don't have hollandaise or poached eggs either but you'll pay under $20 for a ridiculous amount of food for two, and get a seat with no issues."}
{"text":"Full fledged American Breakfast! Pretty darn good and fantastic prices. Quite in demand, so you may have to wait to get a seat, it's worth it. Pay for the food and find a spot. It is a tiny location. The portion sizes are huge! Service was decent. Great coffee free refills including an extra on to take home if needed! Overall good place when you need a old fashioned American Breakfast fix. eggs, bacon, sausage the works."}
{"text":"Garbage service!  Place wasn't even packed when we went in Sunday morning. We stood at the front for a bit until I asked if it's self seating but the employee said no and they would clear off one of the available tables.  A few were clean. We continued standing there waiting while some of the employees hung out at the counter without acknowledging us or seating us....got fed up after 10-15 minutes without being acknowledged and left for good! Lesson learned: avoid Flips due to lack of training & customer service skills plus to make my own breakfast from now on (or Denny's)."}
{"text":"I'm at Flips once if not twice a week, because the food is awesome. The portions are huge, and the pricing is very reasonable. I usually have the breakfast, either bacon and eggs or the light breakfast. The price is amazing for both, and sometimes you even get a free pancake! Love it there :-)"}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTED. I've frequented this popular brunch place for years and they recently changed their order system. I recently dined with my boyfriend and his mom. You come in and line up to place an order like in a fast food chain because they have digital cash registers already. Then they give you an order number. Our breakfast came out to a total of about $50. Then they leave it to you to find your own table in such a small and crowded restaurant, which means if the place is full and you decided to dine in, you're going to have to wait till someone leaves (in our case, it wasn't busy anymore). The place wasn't even busy but there were so many dirty tables. We had to ask a cashier to clean our table for us. We had to wait 35 MINUTES for our food because the cooks were not used to the amount of fast orders coming their way. On top of that, your hot beverages and bread spreads are all self- serve now. The place just wanted fast customer turnover and totally neglected quality customer service. By the time we left, there were familiesdining in, scrambling for a free table. The whole experience was just very disappointing. This will be my last visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"The portions are a good size. Service is good not great. I recommend the my 4, it's basically a create your own breakfast. It's a small place with cozy tables very close to each other. Lots of parking. Only accepted cash when I was there and the home fries were not the ones I was expecting."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service today. We found a hair in our food and they didn't seem to care. No discount no apology nothing. We as a family come here often and finding a hair in our breakfast was the most disgusting thing. None of the chefs wear hair nets to protect themselves. We will not be back to this restaurant again"}
{"text":"We moved to Brampton from Mississauga about a year ago and wanted to start to find the gems of our new hometown. We are loyal diners at Bobby's and Stoney's in Oakville.   Flips is a breakfast and lunch restaurant in Brampton. From reading the reviews it's pretty accurate and it was votes as the top breakfast joint in Brampton by inbrampton.com  I decided to try this place for two reasons. The inbrampton.com review and the fact that they actively respond to reviews on Yelp. This shows me that they truly care about their brand.   Review   I love this place. It's clean, organized, excellent friendly service, great food and a great price point.   I had two nice surprises upon coming here: ONE-the coffee is awesome. They have four types of coffee and they are not your typical diner coffee, they are more upscale and have a great rich full body. TWO-they have non pork breakfasts (ground beef patties and steak) for those who want something different.   Service: quick, friendly and attentive. Again their menu is not all over the place so they know their stuff and they get it right. The cooks just keep cranking out the food and they've got this down to a science.   Value: excellent value and great portions. I couldn't finish the bread or the home fries.   Coffee: incredible. This was the surprise that for me makes this place unique. An egg is an egg, how can you mess that up (I've been to places that have) but the coffee is worth the price.   Cleanliness: spotless and that means more to me than price.   Size:  it's a medium size restaurant. Think cozy, comfy diner. Judging from my visit on a Friday morning, we had a line up 3 minutes after opening,  the weekends would be crazy. So be ready for a wait.   Will come again: absolutely and will bring friends.   Suggestions: can you look into adding turkey bacon as one of the sides?  Thank you and continued success.

{"text":"Superb place for brunch.  Went here for breakfast and I was surprised with the portions that is given to you.  I ordered an omelette and it was half the size of the plate and the plates they use are huge.  Must go back for breakfast or for lunch."}
{"text":"Been here twice already. The BEST breakfast spots i've ever been too. Food is AMAZING as well, its cheap! Just hope they can open up for bigger space as it is quite small in there. Def. will tell everyone about this place"}
{"text":"Don't come here often, but when I do, it's such a treat because I get to splurge.   Calories don't mean a thing here... The portions are massive! The food is great. Reminds me of a home cooked breakfast. It's not big extravagant, but I enjoy coming in here once and a while. Seating is tight, so I would not recommend for large groups.   Value =10/10, generous portions.  Food is always cooked perfectly. Hot and fresh.   Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Something has changed with this place.  It used to have a large menu selection and that's been shrunk.    Eggs Benedict has turned into something horrible.  It appears to made from mayonnaise, just awful.   Lots of new staff but they're all very eager andask questions to help with providing good service."}
{"text":"This used to be one if my favourite breakfast joints, but my wife was never a fan. I convinced her to go back after about a year of heading somewhere closer to home and boy things have really gone in the wrong direction.   They do accept debit now, which is good, but the food prices seem way jacked up. Expect $20 per person. The servings are huge, so maybe the way to go is to split a dish. My big complaint is how tiny the prices are on the wall menu. It's almost seems deliberate to make you not realize what the sticker shock is going to be.  They also got rid of table service. Table service was slow before so not horrible? Unfortunately I was recovering from a back injury so the serve yourself option wasn't awesome.   I had the eggs benedict and they unfortunately don't have poached eggs. Sunny side up was ok. LOTS of hollandaise sauce, but it seems like prepared package to me. Was not all that tasty. The home fries are great here and nice fruit.   My wife had some kind of skillet which was basically just all meat. Not bad, but it could of used some veg or something else to balance it.  If I came back I'd probably stick with the pancakes, which I've enjoyed in the past.   Pretty sure he aggressive owner is going to write a bashing \"this is a conspiracy\" response to this. Never a good sign.  I'd probably suggest trying another breakfast location in town. It's pros are the portion size, but holy crap it's expensive."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super popular on the weekends for good reason. I came in at 2pm (an hour before it closes) and it wasn't as bad. We managed to get a spot quickly and order. Their portions are huge for the price. You can get a light breakfast for $6 and a very large meal for $12-14. It's cash only though but they have an ATM inside.  The home fries and the sausages were really good. The sausages were a bit on the salty side but it balances out with everything else. I don't know what the guy below was talking about when he mentions everything was salty -- the eggs were bland and you salt it yourself.  It's kinda far but I'm willing to make the trek!"}
