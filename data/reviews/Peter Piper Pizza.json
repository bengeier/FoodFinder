{"text":"Food was just okay, no employees were monitoring the games or rides, kids were climbing on and spinning on a ride that was broken and a teenage girl ran into my 4 yr old while running around in a circle to spin the broken ride, by this time I was extrememly angry and dragged a manager out to tape it up with caution signs, we will not go back."}
{"text":"Perhaps I will edit this later, attending a party in the party room, arrived promptly at 2, no party hostess to be found - 11 kindergarteners are amusing themselves playing tag, at Peter Piper, this could have been done at the park or anywhere else.  It's 2:16 and still nothing, kids are literally banging the walls. Parents of the birthday child have been apologizing profusely for the tardiness and mom specifically said to mention the no show hostess in this review."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, really bad for Peter Piper.   Our food took forever to arrive, and yet it wasn't all ready to be served with only half the order available. This was despite the lengthy wait and our buzzer going off to alert that our order was ready. No sufficient explanation or apology was given when the issue was brought up. The staff does not go above and beyond, or really even meet the standard expectations.  So all you're left with now is game machines for your kids, except those don't entirely work. Some had tokens jammed to render them inoperable, others simply didn't operate correctly.   Very unfortunate family experience that won't be repeated."}
{"text":"My husband is peter piper pizza #1 fan, and I must say I have gotten to love it to. Today I placed a care your order and was pleasantly  surprised that the phone only ringed once and one picked up so super friendly with a great attitude. Once I got there I proceeded to pay the girl in front was very helpful and with a good attitude. I asked for a cup of water and the manager asked if I was waiting for a Carry out and he gave an actual drink cup. I thought that was very nice. I'm happy to see that people take pride in serving well with a great attitude. After being in many fast food places and stores people really have bad attitudes and are not helpful I was happy to be treated well. And not to forget the food it was delicious as always."}

{"text":"My family came to this Peter Piper location to eat and for the Grandchildren to play on Sunday, 09/24/17.  The food was good but the gaming machines???  Are they being properly maintained???  While my grandchildren were in the play room there was a kid on the Whacker machine and the head of the hammer came off and struck my wife in the head.  The manager did not seem too concerned and my daughter made the young lady write up an incident report over what had happened.  If my wife had not been standing where she was it would have been me or my TWO YEAR OLD granddaughter whom I was helping to play a game that would have been struck.  Now today my wife has been dizzy with terrible headaches all day long.  Just be careful if you take your children there to play."}
{"text":"Fun place for the kids, but had to ask for a clean glass  i was greasey when she handed it to me the girl went in that back and came out 3 mins later, beer tasted fun pretty sure I got a dirty glass"}
{"text":"5 stars- mind you this is Peter Piper Pizza. The same pizza for like 30 years. This rating is for the service.  Saturday I held an impromptu birthday party (group of 8 adults, 1 crazy kid and 3 infants) as my litte adhd turned 2.  I showed up at 3:15pm on a Saturday, the noon birthday rush was gone and the tables were in the process of being cleaned. I asked a young girl if I could grab up a group of 3 tables that had yet to be cleaned. She wasn't a huffy \"oh you're such a pain\" employee, she was pleasant and helpful. The employee said no problem, and  as I started to clean the tables she came over and started cleaning them for me. She pulled chairs and wiped them too. She gave me a napkin dispenser and shakers of cheese and peppers. She took my cake to their fridge and then asked if I needed anything else.   Thank you PPP, give that girl a raise."}
{"text":"I have to say, that this peter piper has come a long way with their facility, it was clean and the staff was very friendly. One girl actually stood out, I think her name was Mariah, she was all over the place. I'm a supervisor at a fast food chain and I wish I had an employee with that kind of energy and smile. Great job peter piper!  2 thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"I've been here many times for lunch and birthday parties.  The best deal at this place is the lunch buffet.  They have a decent variety of pizza along with breadsticks, cheesy bread (my favorite), salad, and dessert pizza.  I usually eat too much since it's a buffet, but it's a good deal for the price.  The normal pizza prices are a bit high for the quality, but with a coupon it's not bad.  Kids of course love this place due to the many games and chance to win tickets and ultimately candy and trinkets.  Most of the games are one or two tokens so .25 to. 50 each.  This place is big and their birthday packages are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Came early on Saturday thought it was gonna be packed glad to see it wasn't , customer service was excellent . lady at counter went above and beyond to serve us. Food was all great we had salad wings and pizza when she messed up pizza she offered us extra one was so glad that she acknowledge mistake and was willing to make it a great experience will deffinatly come back."}
{"text":"I had chance to try the lunch buffet this last week.  The staff is extremely friendly and is willing to help you in any way. The selection is great and you can request any type of pizza you would like to have on the buffet.  I will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"food was on par with our low expectations, but there's no control of the children whatsoever. running around, screaming, and general obnoxious behavior is expected, BUT at no point should the staff allow kids to wrestle and bump into other customers. Furthermore, if the parents AND the staff can't control the goings on, they should at least keep the parents from assaulting one another-long story short, we will not be returning"}
{"text":"Usually when you attempt to order something, it's not a best practice to hang up on the customer abruptly. Though I could be wrong, kids these days.  I attempted to order a pizza the other night around 9:15 pm, admittedly I thought they closed at 11pm.  I called and the call taker, Molly, answered in the usual Peter Piper Pizza fashion. I asked to setup a take out order and....*CLICK*  My assumption was it was too close to close, after I checked the time and saw they closed at 10, but couldn't reach anyone after to verify.  So it would be 5 stars because I'm a fan of PPP and always have, 1 star for the staff just not saying \"Hey we are closing, sorry we can't take any orders!\" instead of ignoring customers.  Closer nearby options to consider for those who like good service include Barro's and NYPD in the San Tan Village/ Williamsfield area."}
{"text":"Peter piper pizza is usually great at the one on the side of town I live in but today I was getting my the air conditioning on my car fixed around the corner from this one so I decided instead of my 4 year old daughter and I waiting there let's just go to get some pizza and you can play games. Well when I got there it was fine, not too crowed it's was around 11:20 so my daughter and I got the buffet with a couple of drinks. She got 1 slice and I got 2 slices. By the time we were 4 bites into our food...... The line was almost outside the restaurant and the line to get pizza was 40+ people. Long story short, my daughter and i never got to get any more pizza and she couldn't play any games. My car was ready at 12:30 and I was still there attempting to make a good situation out of that craphole, it was packed to the rim with people. And when I spoke to the manager Dan I think his name was. He told me, \"well you didn't have to get the buffet you could've just bought a pizza then you wouldn't have had to worry about that\" I would NEVER go back there. And I'm going to let all my family friends and coworkers know about that place and their horrible manager."}
{"text":"Malik the cashier very nice polite and shows alot of respect something you dont see anymore. Thank you malik for making my visit a nice and enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Alexis has this worst customer service and attitude. Will not be going back. I will travel to not have to be treated so rudely."}
{"text":"My daughter loves Peter Piper Pizza! The food is very good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because there aren't enough games.The games are often not working so you lose tokens (money) you also have to get a lot of tickets in order to get a cheap little price. Still fun for little ones though."}
{"text":"Went here for a 4th bday party. When we came in to reserve space they reserved a table for us but did not once mention that we could get a party package with a host. When we got there they wouldn't give us birthday plates or forks or cups. We had to pay for each kid separately instead of a whole group and management didn't seem to care. Everyone who worked there seemed miserable."}
{"text":"We have only had pleasant experiences here.  The place is kept very clean.  The pizza is pretty decent, too.  We usually go for the lunch buffet so for the price it is not bad at all.  I love the play area for kids who aren't really old enough for games.  My kids have a blast here and the people who work here have always been very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok.  Wings weren't what I expected. Food took a while to order and trainee should have an experienced worker next to them to ensure speedy service."}
{"text":"They have Fox News on all the large TVs. I find this inappropriate. PP should have kid shows and sports, not bias news stations. Pizza is okay for fast food and employees are decent. Those poor ticket counter workers!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this location. It's the only one I like to come too. The service is amazing and the pizza is great. Every time I go Lucy gives exceptional service. I would highly recommend this location.  Ask for Lucy!"}
{"text":"Josele is the best manager ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very good food, awesome customer service..."}
{"text":"This location is the worst.  For the millionth time, I showed up to get my pizza - only for them to tell me that they made the wrong pizza AGAIN.  Every time I come here they get my order wrong.  The manager doesn't seem to know what to do with herself and never offered any compensation like a discount or coupon.  She didn't even ask if I wanted the wrong pizza that they cooked.  They are unorganized, incompetent, and unprepared to properly manage something as simple as a phone order.  They are even more ill-equipped to know how to manage a situation in which they made the wrong order AGAIN.  They should teach their managers how to manage and their employees how to accurately read an order.  What a poor example of service.  I will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"I LOVE PPP. buuuut this location was horrible. Granted it was the buffet but they had DIRTY plates and the set up was weird. You have to get back in the regular line to get seconds. Still love PPP but NOT this location."}
{"text":"Very clean, well lit, and helpful staff (manager Willie, specifically). Pizza was actually very good, and always at least 6-7 to pick from on buffet, and 3 types of salad"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!!!  It is a small location with a small variety of games.  Each game is two coins which is too much if you ask me. The bathrooms are old and gross. If you just want good pizza, this is the place, just use the restroom before you leave your house."}
{"text":"Why is it that every time I go during buffet hours 11-2 they have the best service and soft pizza ? But when I go during other hours the service is not so good, they took a few minutes for the employee to take our order when we were the only ones in line. Nonetheless we ordered wings which were yummy but when we got the pizza it was hard and burnt around the crust, cmon the employee knows what they are serving to us the costumers why are u serving us hard burnt pizza ? This happend not once but twice in different occasions.  I will just stick to going during buffet hours.....I love going to this location but they should at least acknowledge  to serve us softer pizza. Like seriously I know they would not enjoy eating hard burnt pizza!"}
{"text":"I mean it has good pizza I love the ceaser salad.I enjoyed."}
{"text":"This location is probably the best one when it comes to pizza crust...I like my PPP with a crispity, crunchity crust...This is where you get it."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! We dine in and carry out, also a fun place to have Parties!! Its nice and clean the games are great for the kids, and the food is so good!! Employees are awesome, so nice and know their menu well and help out with the best deals! Highly recommend for a evening with the kids or a nice fun time with all family and friends. They also have flatscreens on with ESPN on for sport,news...go there you'll have a good time, food is great:)"}
{"text":"Great PPP. All the employees are so nice and friendly. Came in for lunch buffet with my daughter and husband. Great pizza and fun family environment!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and salad were very good. I've never been to this location before so I was surprised that it was just a giant room. The restaurant was clean and the service was good. I will be going back to this PPP for more work pizza parties!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat a lot of mediocre pizza then the buffet is for you. And if you want to drink more than two beers don't bother.  I won't be back. Yuck!"}
{"text":"The manager at this location, Maria, is wonderful! As someone who works in a client service industry, as a business manager for luxury retail, I am beyond impressed with Maria. I stop by for pizza on my way home from work a couple times a month, and she is consistently going above and beyond to make sure I have the best experience possible. She will go far in life, and I hope PPP knows how valuable of an employee she is!!!  =)"}
{"text":"I had my son birthday party here and overall it was good service. We got there on time and then the host went over the process. I was informed that after the hour and a half time frame I did not have to leave but I had to close my tab. I was still waiting on more people to come so pizza wouldn't get cold so I order about 15 minutes after time I booked my party and did not get my pizzas for about 45 minutes I was told that they had other people ordering so it was in order but if I only have an hour and a half and it's takes almost 1 hour to get the pizza then we have almost no time left. I order more stuff while still waiting on my 1st order. Waiting for food takes a very long time. The hostess was very kind but did not have much time for us I was nice because I could tell she was busy she had another party and still do other stuff. I had to search for her everytime I needed something so I spend a lot of time trying to get things and looking for the host. I think maybe if they know they have more then 1 party that day they should schedule another person. She was kind though so it made it better.  The play area is really small and they don't have much for smaller children.  Also, they have this thing where birthday child gets to make their own pizza but I never got mine I was informed about it in beginning but looking for host and trying to get the pizzas that I did order just took too long so I just said forget it.  Overall because the hostess was kind, the kids did have fun, and it is a reasonable price I give it 4 stars. They could personalize the parties more and maybe have a host that only has 1 party and is dedicated to just you and your party AND maybe not wait too long on the pizza and mean we do have a time frame."}
{"text":"My bf, his family and I come here like once a month spending like at least 100 dollars and thats probably just on the food. Their prizes aren't all that great but its a great place to party with good food and beer. And the games are good enough to keep all the kids occupied. The place is very nosy but well it is a place full of kids it would be weird if it was quiet XD   So far we have ordered the salad, wings, bread sticks, pizza, cookies, and ice cream and have not regretted it... I would comment on the beer but I have never tasted it cause I don't drink but it looks like they give a pretty big amount.  The restrooms have a couple of stalls and quite clean... for a kids play area that is...  Customer services is very professional and right to the point o.o well they are probably tired and have to keep moving around from taking orders to cleaning so XD u tend to lose that perkiness after a while with the smiles smiles... but they are polite ^^"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this location of Peter Piper Pizza. I have been coming here regularly for many years. The pizza is great and the managers and staff are extremely friendly. We have only had one negative incident with an employee...the employee was very busy and stressed and snapped at my children while they were getting their prizes. I went and talked with the manager, and she immediately apologized and went and talked to the employee. I understand that it is normal for people to have bad days and I explained that to the manager. The manager was so great with dealing with the employee and had her take a break. This experience will definitely not stop us from going there again."}
{"text":"We went to try out the lunch buffet today, the place is open & casual. They have a variety of pizza, even though we requested  a supreme pizza right off the bat and it was good, so was the pepperoni & bacon pizza. Was disappointed they do not include hot wings on the buffet. They had two kinds of dessert pizza there, cinnamon & cherry which was delicious. Salads were pre-made & pastas were okay. The price of $6.49 is reasonable, plus we got the10% military discount. Cannot complain much except Roundtable has much better pizza on their buffet."}
{"text":"If someone wants confirmation for a party that they scheduled on line, why is your restraunt so unwilling to confirm weather or not you receive the request?"}
{"text":"Very clean and nice but disappointed how small the game area was. Definitely not your normal average size peter piper."}
{"text":"Greasy, loud, busy and lots of kids. A place this lady would avoid like the plague BUT this lady is a mom so glad that despite all of this the service is great, staff kind to kids (many stars for that alone. God bless you)and price is right. My kids enjoy it here & with school fundraiser nights held at this place this means they are also community orientated. Not to mention lots of room so I can hide out in a booth. ;)"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here weekly until they got a new manager. I watched as the new \"manager\" wiped his nose using his thumb and wrist while taking my order then proceeded to go start helping with orders without washing his hands. I was thoroughly disgusted and can't eat here anymore."}
{"text":"I recently had my son's B day party here. The food is good, the establishment is clean. The game room could be bigger. When they set your time slot for the party time they mean you only have that hour and 3o mins. If you go over they will bump you off to another table if they are packed on party space. This bothered me because not everyone showed up on time for our party. At least at Chuck E Cheese they have enough space so you don't have to be embarrassed by that! I ordered additional pizza's and I asked  if they could just start off by bringing 3 of them out naturally so that all 5 or 6 pizzas dont A) Get Cold  & B)  Don't take up a lot of table area. Well I was told they have to bring all the pizzas out at the same time... that policy should be changed for parties. Then when I first arrived the set up was nice but we had 10 kids and I believe I stated in the reservation 18 adults. I had two tables only reserved...one table had 10 kid's and 2 adults...keep in mind we had cake and presents too. Luckily I brought this to the hosts attention and she let us use the 3rd table next to us. The host was a young polite woman but I had to ask for additional plates originally only the kids had plates from the original set up, I also had to ask for utensils and napkins. I'm just used to the other establishments I've had kiddie parties at having these out and ready or readily available where I didn't have to ask. I know they just opened so just consider the suggestions overall not a horrible experience but definitely some  things to work on. I probably won't be back mainly because of the game room size and lack of party space I don't want to feel rushed or have to feel embarrassed because we might go over our allowed time. Other moms at the party noticed the following as well."}
{"text":"This location has an excellant manager, Janet. I was blown away by the service I recieved because a) it was a special order and b) it was to be picked up 2.5 hours BEFORE they were open. She and her staff were already in perfect uniform and  in high spirits. She had a happy smile on, and was so cheerful! I will go here more often with my son, even though I wish they had the gates like Chuck E Cheese. She made me think that if she is in such a genuinely good mood, her staff is probably top notch. A good work environment makes it easier to do you job well. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience ever had at my first time of this location. Was never greeted by staff. Messy arcade place with trash scattered all over. Bad prize amounts as jackpots seem impossible to win. Rather take another Peter Piper Pizza somewhere else other than this."}
{"text":"Lost a long time customer! Wanted to eat a \"take out\" special at the restaurant last night. Was told I could have my pizza but could not have my 2 liter bottle of soda until I was ready to leave the restaurant. What?! I paid for it! I was told that \"people try to refill their soda.\" Ok...but how is that any different than someone getting a \"water\" cup and filling it with soda or buying only one soda and sharing with others since it can be refilled multiple times? I have personally witnessed this happen at this exact location on more occasions than I could possible count.  Regardless, I would have been happy to sit at a table close to the staff to be watched (which is ridiculous in and of itself) to ensure that I did not attempt to refill my soda. I was just trying to save a little money because we were already spending over $30 for 2 large one-topping pizzas, one 2-liter of soda, cheesy bread, and tokens. While we enjoy this pizza, it's far from gourmet (as reviewed by others) and for that reason I have an issue spending $40+ dollars to eat there.  The sad thing is we come here so much (seriously...probably on a weekly basis) that they know us. Oh well...so much for customer loyalty. We know this store is independently owned and would prefer that our business support an individual owner, but unfortunately we will be transferring our business to the Mesa Riverview or North Scottsdale corporate stores. I should note, too, that the previous week we ordered a very similar \"deal\" at a competitor's location (not a Peter Piper) and they had no problem with us enjoying our meal in the restaurant - 2 liter and all!"}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza is one of my favorite pizza places to go since I was a kid. Love that I can bring my kids here to enjoy family fun. On the other side of town for a football tournament our team came to celebrate our boy's accomplishments with about 3/4 of team family. Positive: staff was friendly and the atmosphere was jumping. Weekend visit so of course it was busy but the staff got our orders fast and we wait for our food pizza and wings. Pizza came first which kids devoured. Negavtive: Wings came nearly 20 min later when pizza was gone. Not only did we have to wait 20 min for our wings, but it came with hair.  Took the wings back to the manager who said \"sorry\" and quickly handed me back cash. I understand the stress that comes with a crazy rush, but to just mumble the word \"sorry\" and stuff cash into my hands just seemed like a dismissal.  My kids were happy with their experience, but I was a little bothered by the brush off my the \"manager\"."}
{"text":"Wife loves the pizza here so we visit this place pretty frequent, more than I'd like to lol. But the last few times the service has been horrible. Several times I've had to ask for stuff they forget like cups or dressing. And they always seem like I'm asking them a favor. You'd think the manager would be all over it but he's probably the worst one there his name is Denise or something close to it. Never acknowledges people or even speaks.  Today's little adventure was a burnt pizza which were to much in a rush to take back and lack luster service once again. Any worse and I'll have to drive to the one off of bell or I see Pizza Hut is opening near by.  So slowly becoming less of a fan"}
{"text":"We took our grandchildren to this location today and ordered wings. When we received our order there were two wing tips included as part of the 10. I thought maybe it was a mistake but when I took it back I was told that that is normal. I don't know what part of the bone we were expected to eat. We were really disappointed in the way we were treated and do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Hey just want to say thanks to mark the general manager. I had my sons birthday party last weekend and he was great help. Had us taken care of all the way even though there was like 7 other parties going on at the same time. The staff was great and helpful working really hard to keep things clean. I think sometimes we focus too much and the out side appearance but I was able to see these guys were working hard and still made themselves available to anything I needed and made it easy to have an awesome time with my family and friends to celebrate my sons 3rd birthday so just wanted to say thank you."}
{"text":"It's a fun place for my kids to play while mom and dad enjoy some yugiho dualing... yes we are nerds but it's a great gathering place for our team and we love their food. There staff is full of kids so It's not exactly the best service but we love Bernie and Stephanie . All the times we have visited these two young ladies have made the best impression and are professional when it comes to their jobs."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Took my 2 year old which was very hungry and wanted PPP. It was buffet time but there was very long line so we ordered pizza, bread sticks and wings. We got our bread and wings and wanted for our pizza. 50 minutes later we went to ask how much longer on our pizza? Cashier came out and said manager said to go ahead and eat (cold, old) buffet pizza while they make ours. I was so upset and the manager didn't even come out to apologize and the manager that did come out to give me my money was ride and nasty. Will meet go back!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter requested PPP for dinner as her birthday choice, but by the end of the stay she, as well as the rest of our children, were disappointed and upset about the game area and the \"unfairness\" of the games. We purchased package 3 with came with two pizzas and 80 tokens. While we were fairly happy with the pizzas and the service time, the game center was very disappointing. Those 80 tokens were divided up between 5 children giving each of them 16 tokens. However, by the time they were done they were not able to enjoy 16 tokens worth of games as the machines ate at least half of each child's supply without producing a game. Then the game they were permitted to play didn't pay out the tickets as stated on the games, so they were even cheated out of the tickets after losing tokens. We will not be returning to this location, and honestly, most likely not returning to any PPP in the future. It is a sad day when young children feel cheated at a place like this."}
{"text":"The pizza was not as good as other stores for sure! We love to go and eat and then work it off challenging each other to basketball and now they just have a single game. Boooo."}
{"text":"Spent over $16 for a buffet lunch and expected the pizza to be hot and ready to eat.  What I found was that I had to sort through over 15 dirty plates with food still on them sitting on the counter that I was expected to use for my food, pizza that appeared grease soaked and had been sitting for an extremely long time, and very little selection of pizza available.  After trying to eat a piece of the older pizza I waited for over 15 minutes for a (as in one) new pizza to be put up on the counter.  The pepperoni pizza had a small hint of cinnamon flavor probably due to not cleaning the pans well enough and was nasty.  I decided at this point I would give up on the food.    Besides the food being poor the guests that were here were even worse.  I understand that Peter Piper Pizza does not have control over its patrons but I will not be visiting this establishment again.  In trying to eat my pizza I had one person listening to some terrible rap music on his phone so loud the entire side of the establishment had to listen with him.  Whats worse is he didnt even purchase anything, he simply entered, sat, and listened to his phone.  I also felt like I was trapped between a gang territory dispute with one guy having his pants around his knees holding his shirt up in an attempt to flash his giant metal belt buckle to another group of thugs.  Its sad to see that a place I used to take my kids frequently has got this bad and I also can see why I travel the extra distance to go to a cleaner and safer location.  All in all I am very dissatisfied with my experience and will think again when deciding where to spend money for food."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! Horrible sewer smell as soon as you enter the restaurant.  Do not come here do not schedule a birthday party for one of your kids at this location. Absolutely disgusting the carpet was filthy and all stained up and the tile floor is just as bad. Men's restroom smells of urine. I did not have anything to eat because I did not want to get food poisoning. The smell is so strong that you cannot smell the pizza baking.  We came here for a birthday party for one of my sons friends. The kids seem to be oblivious to the smell they are happy eating pizza and playing games but it is very uncomfortable being here as an adult. If I planned a peter piper birthday party for one of my children it would not be at this location (43rd Ave & Glendale)."}
{"text":"Poor Poor Service. Starting Off With The Cashier Katelin She Had The Worst Attitude Someone Like Her Should Not Be Working In A Customer Service Place. Second The Pizza We Ordered Was Crap Besides Being The WRONG Order It Looked Raw And Unfortunately The Second One That Was Made Wasn't Better. Third Our Wings Were Warm On The Outside And Cold In The Inside! DISGUSTING. I've Never Had A Problem Here But This Experience Is Disappointing. That Night Crew Needs To Go Back To Training."}
{"text":"For the child in me, pure nirvana!  For the parent in me, reminiscing joy!  We took part in the pizza and token fest for a playday!  Our hungry group tried the Family Fall special, large 1 topping pizza, bread-stix and 40 tokens. We added drinks and 100 more token, glad we did!  The pizza was average, not bad, but not gourmet. Of course if I wanted gourmet, we wouldn't be here with video games. The bread-stix were surprisingly good. They didn't stand a chance among the parents and kids!  What can I say about the games!  Another reviewer said they created a zen-like trance, I agree! Our kids scream and run and totally enjoy themselves. That's the real rating for an establishment like this, right?  If your kids enjoy it and you can leave smiling, it was a good night!"}
{"text":"Cardboard! It's been awhile since I've been back to good ol Peter Piper but I can tell you that not much has changed.  Yes the kids love it and I can understand why.  But the pizza still years later still tastes like oven baked cardboard I'm sad to say.  I would give 1 star but its not like its supposed to be expensive gourmet."}
{"text":"By far the best Peter Piper in AZ. I've been to just about all them with my son. You get the best quality service and pizza here. The management is friendly and their crew is very helpful. Nothing better than coming to a place as a family and having such an awesome time!"}
{"text":"This is more of a pizza joint for people who have young kids. They have kid games and it gets pretty noisy in here. The pizza is not too bad . If I was craving pizza, this place would not be high on my list but, it was an 'interesting' experience nonetheless. I suppose If I had kids or I was a kid I would probably enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Awful service and poor game selection. This Peter piper was virtually empty but still took a good 30 minutes to get our pizza when there was five employees doing nothing. Also there wasn't air hockey! The games they did have were awful and a lot of them were out of service. On the bright side the pizza was very good."}
{"text":"It kills me to do it, but I have to downgrade my review.  Over the last 2.5 years this location has declined terribly. Every time we've been in over the last year this location has been FILTHY. With food and grime smeared on every surface. We have no intentions of ever returning, even for our school's annual fundraiser night.  We'll go to the location on Dobson instead."}
{"text":"Food...pretty good pizza. Food tastes fresh, weekday buffet is a pretty good deal. Nothing to complain about here.  Ambiance....ummm it's definitely for kids but the place is always clean, including the restrooms.  Staff....always friendly and helpful.  Verdict.....definitely take the kids here"}
{"text":"Just ate dinner here tonight. Seeing them do the school fundraiser was so cute. The pizza sauce compares to no other. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Ate pizza and played video games at Peter Piper Pizza with my lil bro Saturday afternoon as part of a larger pizza party, and we had a blast. No, the pizza ain't great, kind of tastes like a greasy sponge, but the kids don't notice - and really that's why you're there anyway. I say greasy sponge, but you know I had at least three or four slices. Even bad pizza is good pizza.  This location definitely felt a little cleaner than some of the others around the valley.  The game selection was decent, though still doesn't compare to an actual arcade - they had Star Wars Trilogy, Area 51, a boxing simulation, air hockey, at least three different sets of racing games that two people can play together, a bunch of the ones where you just drop your token in and that's it (aim for the back of the dump truck, aim for the railroad bridge, etc) - some of which are actually a little addicting. And Skee Ball, of course. God, I don't know what it is that makes Skee Ball so addictive - my lil bro and me, we must have dropped tokens into that game for over an hour. He walked away with hundreds of tickets, which he redeemed for cool stuff - a slinky, and some playing cards. Oh, and vampire teeth. Can't go to Peter Piper Pizza and leave without redeeming your tickets for vampire teeth."}
{"text":"The hubby & I came here randomly on Sunday afternoon for some pizza & games. We placed an order for a large \"werx\" pizza, breadsticks, 2 drinks & $20 worth of tokens. Total was around $43 for everything. About 15 mins. later our food was ready. The pizza was tasty & piled high w/toppings. The breadsticks were yummy w/lots of garlic & butter. Even though we don't have kids we had a good time playing games. The \"motion\" game was so lame for 4 tokens, but I could def. see why kids would love it. We won about 570 tickets & got some candy w/them. Probably less than $5 worth, but hey it was fun!"}
{"text":"i have been coming to this location for a long time..they are always nice and if theres a problem they fix it right away.."}
{"text":"Super place. Very clean. Wayne and his staff are terrific with the age range of children and adults they have to put up with.  There were 2 school buses there when we arrived, thought twice about going in, but we promised my grandchild, so we went in for the lunch buffet and fun time. To the left of the game area, there is a large section, that is where the children were from the school buses. Very well organized, off to the side and the children were well behaved.  The buffet was excellent, except the Cesar salad was in big demand, I like the idea that they were making it fresh, but there was a long wait before it was refilled, and it happened several times.  For as big as that place is, it is spotless. Bathrooms and all!  Super PPP!"}
{"text":"This place use to be good but idk if it's because there's different people working but the past couple of times it was horrible they kept getting the pizza wrong and put way too much cheese on the pizza I keep thinking it will get better but it's not. very dissatisfied with they their effort worst Peter piper by far"}
{"text":"ppp is great for kids and for you idk...  Why, because it has more taste than cici's and more options on toppings and for the kids a bigger play area and choice on games!  Plus when u order a large for the family or a special it usually comes with 20 something tokens.  Oh, one more thing, when u pass by cici's windows the children look sad and angry because u didn't take em to ppp."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Tried to pick up our order that we phoned in.  Waited in the carry out line and cashier kept taking other people's orders that were eating in.  After 5 minutes we cut in and asked if we were in the right line,  as we were being ignored. She said she would be right with us.  She proceeded to ring the next 3 people up in line when I asked again if we could be helped.  She called someone to the front who proceeded to take new orders.  5 more minutes passed and I flag down another employee working behind the counter to let them know of the service and to cancel our order that has been sitting on top of the oven for the past 15 minutes.  The only thing given was a quick I'm sorry.  There are a lot of pizza places in town.  I just ordered from Dominos.  Should have done that in the first place."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and had a ton of fun!!! The lunch buffet was awesome and you definitely can't beat the prices. Esteban who was working on the ticket machines, they were being funny, was AWESOME! I couldn't get the machine to cooperate and he went ahead and counted all the tickets for me. We were tired and wanted to get home. I wanna say his name was Davis, but Davis was not such a peach. I went to the counter asking him to count them since the machine wouldn't take them and he had the nastiest look on his face. Asked Esteban if they really weren't working. Are you kidding me! Esteban left the machines and did it for us. Even though he was busy trying to fix them. Took less than a minute to count them and get our prizes.  Thanks Esteban!"}
{"text":"I came into Peter Piper Pizza with a friend and ordered a pizza at around 9:20pm. Only to wait 25 minutes for my pizza. By that time it was closer to 9:50 and we were barely half way done with our pizza when an employee started cleaning around us. The issue with that was he was playing loud, rap music on a portable speaker attached to his hip. At 9:54 pm an employee got on the over head speaker and announced that \"Peter Piper will be closing in 10 minutes\". After the over head speech, he then turned up the lobby music to an unnecessary volume. Getting the hint to \"get out\" my friend and I left."}
{"text":"I went on a saturday with my family.. ALL the tables were in use and when i asked if i can sit in one they said no because another party was going to start in 1 hour. Anyways upon getting my pizza it was cold and looked like it was sitting there for some time. The pizza cheese was also firm and cold not warm and melting as they usually are..... So disapointed and i will not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter for the buffet with her friends and while some of her friends were waiting for there parents one of the workers with a black Peter piper shirt walked up to them and gave them attitude threaten to kick them out because I had them Try a price of the cinnamon pizza. So disrespectful. Never again will I go there. Never will I tell anyone to go there. So rude!"}
{"text":"Definitely improved with their customer service! Love bringing my kiddos here, so it helps that they super helpful and great with keeping the customers happy!"}
{"text":"The rudest staff. Brittani (staff member) made my daughter cry. I have been to Peter Piper numerous times and will never come to this location again. Terrible staff."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this Peter Piper Pizza. Take your money elsewhere. My family and I visited this Peter Piper Pizza for a birthday party. After my son spent all of his tokens and won tickets my husband took him to the counter to redeem a prize. The employee working the prize counter threw the candy my son selected at him, with the candy hitting him in the chest and then falling on the ground. We spoke to the manger about this and she replied \"I'm sorry, I'll talk to him.\" She was short and uninterested. In the midst of the chaos you find at these places it would at least be nice if the employees were not disgruntled. Total disrespect to my child."}
{"text":"Worst pizza in the universe, but to be fair, the kids love it here so maybe I'm one whose got it all wrong."}
{"text":"It's close to home and the pizza is ok. That's the only thing that keeps us coming back. Also, switching from Rod's ranch to Ken's was a terrible idea."}
{"text":"The pizza and. Wings really aren't bad. However they want to give you the same amount of ranch for 20 wings as they do for 10. Then they charge you $1.07 for another small portion. I understand they can't hand out ranch to every person that asks for it. But when your paying $15 for wings should you really pay another $1 when it should have come with it to begin with. On top of that the restrooms here are discussing. We won't be back."}
{"text":"What a cool place. Pizza was great. Service was great. Arcade was great, worth the money. Shout-out to Bernadette, Hali, and the Batman Arcade Game. I've been coming to this place for years!!! I highly recommend this place for a good pizza and kid-friendly environment. It's fun for the whole family! ;-)"}
{"text":"I love Peter Piper, and the pizza is always good, but this time the pizza was hardly warm. The cheese wasn't thoroughly melted and even the pans were cold. The breadsticks weren't warm either. Pretty bummed since I chose this for my birthday dinner."}
{"text":"They have the filthiest restrooms  I have ever seen. The cashier also proceeded to give me an Ice cream cone after picking her eye. Gross place. I returned the pizza in fear of getting food poisoning."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing at our Autism Walk meeting."}
{"text":"Coming from The Bronx, New York, I have had some of the best pizza on the planet,  and without a doubt the pizza, salads, etc at PPP,  are equal to, if not superior to anything I have had in New York."}
{"text":"My wife and I always come here. Last week there was a misunderstanding with my order and instead of the staff getting pissed the manager came to the register, explained the problem and comped our whole meal! She had outstanding customer service.  Wish I would have got her name. Great place."}
{"text":"I swear the \"four assed monkey\" from South Park is in charge of this place.  When you have customers in front of you waiting on a pizza that's been sitting, here's a hint, HANG UP THE PHONE AND DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WAITING TO GET THEIR FOOD!  We were there on the evening of May 7, 2012 around 8pm. First when we walked in there were two other customers sitting in the line, waiting for someone to come to the counter and give them their food. That took ten minutes. Then, before the idiot behind the counter could tend to us, she wandered off for another five minutes. When she finally got back, she took a phone call while running our card so we could get out of there. This took a total of 20 minutes. That's madness.  The pizza isn't good enough to justify our wait. Won't be going back. PPP should FIRE EVERYONE WHO WORKS HERE and start over. Bunch of half witted no whits."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. Place is nice and clean and service is kind and friendly . Much better than any chuckie joint."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for kids parties. The pizza is fine, obviously it's not wonderful or anything. The game area seems really small. Maybe I'm just older now but I feel like they should have more games...it feels a bit crammed. I'm sure there are better Peter Piper Pizzas out there so if you don't mind driving further you'll probably get more for your money."}
{"text":"Best pizza n crust in arizona mmmm good delicious n fun place and enviroment great vibes n fun for the kids and adults"}
{"text":"Great for a quick cheap lunch. This review is for those who need something decent in a hurry for lunch at a very reasonable price. Had a 2 for 1 buffet coupon but after this experience, I would gladly come back with no coupon. Place was recently remodeled and is clean. About 8 nice and tasty pizza buffet choices, breadsticks were delicious, and there was even a dessert pizza. What prompted me to write this was the 3 salad varieties offered with the buffet. All 3 were delicious and relatively healthy.  I noticed they also serve beer and wings (not on the buffet, of course) for those who enjoy that type of food as well. I cannot rate the place for bringing kids, but for adults just wanting something decent and a good value, Peter Piper's is a fine choice. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fun games and good food what more can you ask for? Lunch Buffett was good, lots of different kinds of pizza and 3 salad options."}
{"text":"Order by phone told me my pizza we'll be ready in 20 mins. When I get there I pay and they tell me it's gonna be another 5 mins that my pizza is about to come out . 5 mins later they come and tell me my pizza was given out to other ppl beacuse of something have to do with the tickets and now I gotta wait another 20 mins!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Peter Piper in around a year or more. On my day off I had a sudden craving for breadsticks around lunch time. After looking around at prices, I settled on this place. They have an incredible deal for 24 breadsticks for 12 dollars. Other Peter Piper locations I called in my area were charging 15. But here is the real the kicker....UNLIMITED marinara sauce! Other places will charge as much as two dollars per cup of sauce. And their sauce tastes amazing as well, with the perfect tiny hint of spiciness.   The main reason I'm writing this review though is the manager working at the time, Desiree. She was the kindest manager I've ever met at a pizza joint. She actually compelled me to make an account and write this review. So if your ever in the mood for breadsticks and excellent service, make sure you give this location a try. I walked away with 24 delicious, garlicky, warm breadsticks and 11 cups of heavenly marinara sauce for just 12 dollars."}
{"text":"This location is by far the best peter pipers I've gone to. Their customer service was spot on and so friendly. Will defiantly recommend this location in the future!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot to go to the employees are friendly and so helpful I recommend coming to this place"}
{"text":"Peter piper pizza now a days has become very expensive and I have noticed that this location suffers from the classic turn style oven that made this pizza chain famous in the beginning.  This location has a very cheap conveyor belt type oven and this seems to change the flavor of the finished product (as well as the lack of corn meal on the bottom of the crust that I love so much ). On the plus side they do have a fast fryer machine that cooks wings to perfection :) maybe it has been just the few times I have been here but it seems that the establishment could be cleaner. I know that this is a huge undertaking with dirty kids hands constantly touching stuff. Lastly. The staff has always been friendly and courteous while ordering and dining in.  I want to rate this location higher but with the pizza oven pushing out pizza like it does I will not return.  Maybe only for a small order of perfect wings :)"}
{"text":"I love PPP and enjoy coming here with my family. I love their Pizza and wings!! I have never had any issues with the cashiers they are all great!  But the Manager MEGAN LEOS has a horrible attitude and horrible customer service... She got my order wrong and while I was nice about it and was willing to take the order wrong she gave me an attitude saying that she had repeated the order to me and I had told her it was right which I am sure I didn't. Another very nice guy offered to remake the Pizza and even gave me a free drink. I don't understand how she became manager when she is so Rude!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great! I just finished cleaning their kitchen, bathrooms, and front lobby area tile! It looks great if I may say. Go check them out the food tastes really good. They make their dough from scratch every day! Smells good in their facility too."}
{"text":"The people here were very nice.  They have a great deal of patients for working around so many children in a small place.  There are tons of games fun for all ages.  I have a 7 and 4 year old and we all three had fun.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the customer service at this location.  The food and prices are also great.  WAY BETTER than C. Cheese."}
{"text":"This place is pathetic. Way too small, and with John's and Gameworks to compete with now, why would anyone bother with such a weak attempt at competing?   The game room is tiny, the prizes are terrible, there are no rides... If the old PPP on decatur couldn't survive, there is no way this one can."}
{"text":"Great place to go for the whole family. Remodeled so its new and clean!! And they have wifi!!  I think I show \"Chucky Cheese\" eating there today..lol..or not????"}
{"text":"Same good food. Buffet's a bit pricey. Good selection of games. Big location. NO PLAY STRUCTURE. Big bummer for us."}
{"text":"Same food. Decent games. Many games were temporarily busted - out of tickets or whatever, which wouldn't be a big deal IF THE STAFF ACTUALLY HELPED. They acted like every customer was a nuisance, like they were too busy to do anything for anyone. Our wings seemed like they'd been sitting. My daughter said the play structure was dirty inside, so much so that she wouldn't go back in, and that says A LOT, coming from my slide junkie."}
{"text":"OMG there making the pizzas with there bare hands. So if your a germ-a-phob don't come here. No gloves. I do like the fact it's not busy every time I come in."}
{"text":"just got a Peter Piper Pizza for the 1st time in awhile.  I don't know what happened but the crust IS NOT the same.  TOO BAD.  won't ever go back again.  i grew up in the Valley and I have never had a PPP like this.  the cheese is different, the crust is different.  WHY WHY WHY??? the wings are SORRY."}
{"text":"Like any PPP you're not going for gourmet food, so I'll start by saying the pizza and other food was good when compared to Domino's, Chucky Cheese, Pizza hut, etc. Had a pitcher of beer it was cold and two frosty glasses. For a kids' night out it can't be beat and this Carefree Highway location was clean, good courteous service. Others I've been to had clueless high school kids running the place, but this location is definitely much better. Four instead of five stars because at least 3 arcade machines were out of order and it was pretty packed on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Ordered pick up. Stood in pickup line/carry out line ignored over 10 mins. Then asked to wait additional time because order wasn't ready. From time called to order medium pizza 45mins wait. Reason I called in earlier. Pizza place was empty. Poor management"}
{"text":"Please take the chicken wings off the menu, it's insulting to chickens! I'm not a fan of PP's pizza, but my daughter's volleyball end of the season party is being held there, so trying to make the best of a bad situation, I decided to try the chicken wings. HUGE MISTAKE! $10 for 10 wings is bad enough, but then they add insult to injury by serving the smallest wings I've ever seen. I don't write many reviews, but I'm trying to warn the masses, DO NOT ORDER THE WINGS!"}
{"text":"OK I know that nobody goes to PPP for the good food... but I was dragged here for a kid's party. Worst pizza EVER, worse even than Sardella's. Tomato sauce like battery acid. Tasteless cheese and not much of it. Cardboard dough. Domino's or Papa John's is a step up from this. I can't believe I liked this crap when I was a kid. It's not inexpensive, either. These places must make a killing between the shit wages, the shit pizza, and the prices that are comparable to what you'd pay for a pizza worth eating.  On the bright side, PPP performs a valuable public service by keeping the hyperactive rugrats contained in a place where they belong, so that they don't disturb the adults at places that serve pizza that's actually worth eating."}
{"text":"First I was over charged (resolved when I went back up and talked to the manager), then the token machine ate my dollar bill (resolved by the Prize Counter Girl). We ordered some boneless chicken wings and a chicken wings kids meal.  Our wings came out at about 50 minutes after asking about it twice.  Then after about another 10 minutes I had to go to the pickup counter and stand there while they made my kids wings which took a total about 4 minutes.  Not going back."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Place is very clean, hence the 2 stars.  The gaming area had all faulty machines.  Some of them don't work at all and the others either suck your tokens or spit less tickets. Overall so disappointed that I'm writing this review while I'm still sitting here.  No value for money."}
{"text":"great experiance.  staff had planned games for our group.  did bingo and a scavenger hunt.  the staff was great and the kids really enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Great establishment! I've been going to this parlor for years! Year after year they always take great care of me! The pizza, the beer, the entertainment, you just can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Went in for the buffet. And had to wait a little too long for a special order. And one of the managers there took it upon herself to make sure that I received my special order at our table. She was very apologetic. I would highly recommend coming here. I hope they appreciate her work and great customer service. More employees should be like her. Thank u so much desire. We sure will be coming back to this location props to u !"}
{"text":"It is a little smaller than other locations but my boys always have a blast there.  In my experience its never really all that crowded either but I can see how it could because of its size.  It's Peter Piper Pizza, what else is there to say...."}
{"text":"Kiddie zone: not my usual scene!  We decided on this spot for our nieces weeknight family celebration.  She loves pizza and games so we thought why not?  Met up & just got a pizza and played some kiddie \"beer\" pong, skee ball, and the game where you trap a light in the arches to win the jackpot tickets.  They also have a game where you sit on a toilet and squirt water at  \"dirty feet\".  We did enjoy these games even as adults.  The kids here were a wide age range starting at barely walking to grown adults duking it out with a mini basketball.  Even though we were here on a Wednesday this spot was poppin.  The crowd was friendly even neighboring parties with sweet family members saying hi. One little girl did bump and make my baby niece fall when she was at the entrance to the slide.  The pepperoni pizza was slightly better than frozen... The \"hand tossed\" crust must have been tossed at the factory because it was obviously not made on the premises by an italian man.  The soda fountain had coke zero which went nicely with the pizza.  Super clean and stocked bathrooms.  I deducted 1 star due to there being a dried tomato chunk in the jar on Parmesan.  Gross!"}
{"text":"Children's party going on at 11AM on a Wednesday. Booths were almost all missing or moved to the back area. One section blocked off and empty and all the other tables with cups etc on them. Got ignored for two minutes at the register and left. Have eaten here a number of times before and been satisfied. Don't know what the deal was but it was a waste of our lunch hour going there."}
{"text":"The most horrible peter piper iv'e ever been too. Most of all the tables were reserved and the ones that weren't were completely dirty and when I asked one of the employees to clean the table he never showed. So we we're forced to wipe it down ourselves. The soda station was full of trash every where. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"My family loves to come here for family fun days. It is newly remodeled and with lots of TVs with sports and cartoons. Every time we go it is very clean. The atmosphere is very friendly and the pizza is good too. They have tons of new games and they were all in working order."}
{"text":"The pizza is terrible, and the employees aren't nice at all. My pizza was raw and all of the toppings slipped off"}
{"text":"This was my place is like a small version of Chucky Cheese without all the craziness. The pizza we made was delicious. However, the pizza that we got to go from the buffet was just ok. I think with the pizza we made was better because we used more cheese & meat. The buffet, which also had cheese, bread & pasta, was ok but very cheap."}
{"text":"Veggie pizza is the best. And not just by peter piper pizza standards. I really think its good in general for cheap pizza.  Most of the games are only 1 token, some are 2 or more. Fun place and great for kids. Really big seating area food for parties, families, groups, sync. Some booth seating around the perimeter of the dining area. My brother broke his whoopie cushion that he had just exchanged for tickets. The employee didn't hesitate to replace it. That was nice."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and breadsticks over the phone. The order wasn't repeated back to me so I had assumed it was fine. Arrived at the store and was told it was a thin crust. I told her(the manager) that it should be a regular crust. I was told that it was put down as a think crust. She did offer to remake the pizza, however it would have been a \"12 minute\" wait. Anyone who has had this happen before knows that it's not an accurate time. Anyways, I was on with that until she rang the order up. She didn't attempt to give me a discount or anything. The order was inputted wrong, I have to wait longer, and still pay full price? No thanks! I will not visit this Peter Piper Pizza any longer and will be sure to let everyone know about this horrible experience."}
{"text":"Pizza was blah, crust was kinda like cardboard and that was normal crust.   Kids ate it, I guess that's all that matters.    What made me mad more than anything, 6 TV's by the games all playing something different for a variety and some young worker comes and changes all them to Sports!!!!    NOT everyone wants to watch Sports.   ALL 6 TV's all same channel???   Guess it didn't matter that people were watching what was on there before you changed it!!  ***UPDATE*** Don't bother passing this on to the manager ..... I spoke to the manager as we left he said that it was requested for the sports, they might have requested for sports but on ALL 10 - 12 TVs????"}
{"text":"Worst Peter Piper I have ever visited. They gave us the wrong order and when I tried to tell them, the manager was extremely rude. The pizza was disgusting. One side had more sauce than the other. Some people where trying to get in a fight. Definitely not family friendly."}
{"text":"When I was a boy, I dreamed a dream. I wanted a place to sit in peace, enjoy good food, and have a great time. For years I searched for a place that satisfied this need. I went to pizza place after pizza place but the food was not good enough or the games were broken and  lame or too messy and dirty and the staff didn't seem to care. Until I found the Peter Piper on mcClintock and Baseline. This place has pizza that is actually good and quick, staff that actually care and check on you, and they have the Terminator game! I love the Terminator game! Now, I find every excuse I can think of just so that I can go here and enjoy pizza, wings, the Terminator, and a nice pitcher of beer. I recommend this location to anyone who enjoys pizza/arcade combo restaurants. Kudos to their chef."}

{"text":"We have gone here for a while .. And each time we get rude service and attitude from managers when we do have a complaint... Now we had gotten a personal pizza and a garlic cheese bread... As we are eating I taste something and lift up the cheese. And the entire pizza was cooked halfway thru. The cheese was so thick that under it was pure dough. Not cooked. Not even the slightest. .. Like me some peter piper when I do get a good one but all in all this location is very unsatisfying...."}
{"text":"The pizza was much better than I expected but not on par with Italian or mom n pop pizza joints.  Beats Pizza Hut and Domino's for sure.    They don't have the game selection of Dave & Busters but they have skee ball and that suits me just fine.  I don't have kids so this isn't a place I'd come to a lot but it seems like a good place for a night out with the family if you have one.  Enjoy a pie and let your kids have a good time."}
{"text":"Great place! Exceptional customer service. Particularly Marouico (forgive my spelling). He takes much pride in his work and is very patient at the prize counter. Thank you Mariciuo."}
{"text":"5 stars for a kid's pizza place you say?  Yes, and I will tell you why.  This Peter Piper Pizza location is the best I have been to.  Clean, friendly staff, and great pizza (really!  try the Chicago Classic - yum!).  A good place for both adults and kids to hang out.  They have beer and wine; it's an inexpensive happy hour for the ol' folks!  The gameroom guy treated my children like gold, fixing a broken game promptly & even bumping up their ticket count a bit so my daughter could get a coveted 500 ticket prize.  Management ensured we had a reserved table for the last birthday party we held for 20+ people, and the staff promptly served the pizzas directly to our table (normally you get a buzzer to pick up your own).  You can tell that the staff at this location takes pride in their work and serving the customer.  My family and I are loyal fans!"}
{"text":"Best Peter Piper around.  Pizza is good.  Facilities are clean.  Lots of games.  Perfect for kids' birthday parties."}
{"text":"I do not understand the ratings the other people are giving because they are great every time we go. We went again tonight and our pizzas were delicious, all 6 Kids had a blast! Everyone was so friendly! And we go here 2 or three times a month.  We have gone at buffet time, dinner time, early and late, consistently good! If I went 100 times and 1 time I go and things aren't perfect why would I write a bad review if I wasn't fair enough to write when it was good? I have noticed people only want to complain, but not compliment, if you have a problem they are happy to fix it.  Come on people be fair."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10:30 pm.  Shows they close at 11:00pm!!  A cashier told me that his manager gave him that they are no longer taking orders.  Will not recommend to friend they may show up during open hours but they decided to close!"}
{"text":"GReat service great management--pizza hey its peter piper mac and cheese is a good addition."}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday place was jammed packed. Nice selection of kids games and entertainment. The works pizza is delicious. Great with pitcher of suds and viewing sports on the many tvs available. I will continue to visit this location"}
{"text":"The service at this PPP is TERRRRRRRIIIIBBBBLLLLEEEEE!!!!!!!!! I wish I was kidding about how bad the service here sucks. I have been here 3 times for pick up. Each time I am waiting in line for 15 min or more and there is usually just 1 person in front of me. As the line gets sooo long they finally have a manager help. The first experience...I asked for my pizza well done and it was so soggy, the cheese barley looked cook. But of course I didn't realize it until I got home. Second time, waited 20 min in line and the pizza was good...I made sure to look before I left...the third and last time I'll be coming here I waited 20 min in line, the employees didn't even apologize and really don't care about people. She just handed me my pizza, didn't even open it for me to look at and she walked back to the register! Geeeezzz these people need to learn customer service skills. And this place is filthy. It's in an older part of town and every time I come it's dirty. That's why I always order out. I will stick to my usual PPP on 99th and McDowell because they have their s*** together."}
{"text":"Went here with fam and the son of a bitch manager (short, brown hair female) left our pizza sitting on the counter getting cold, then they never made the second one we ordered, been sitting here for an hour and 10 mins and food barely got to the table. She gave us 20 tokens for over an hour wait. Wtf is 20 tokens????"}
{"text":"Came in today for a school fundraiser with my daughter and her cousins. The staff was amazing and very polite. They had staff participating in the cha cha with the kids and playing hot potatoe with them. All very involved and helpful. Good job and definitely had a good time!"}
{"text":"Ordered an XL and L pizza 20 minutes before showing up to pick up pizza once there paid and still waited 20 minutes for my food to be ready after told over the phone it would be ready in 15 minutes. This place is very unreliable."}
{"text":"For an \"El Cheapo,\" it was excellent! Much better than Cici's.  The staff was friendly, courteous and accommodating.  The restaurant was very clean. So was the restroom.   Pizza was hot, fresh and tasty. Caesar salad was very good with a creamy dressing and FRESH croutons. The rotini pasta with spinach, mushrooms with an alfredo sauce was superb! And i don't like alfredo!   Kudos to Pied Piper Pizza for a refreshing experience!"}
{"text":"The staff here are awesome! Very helpful and always cleaning! Management is also great, very helpful, and when we had a problem, compensated us and was pleased to help, with a comforting attitude! Manager Britney, whom I spoke with today, was so very sweet and accommodating.  Pizza's are so yummy now,.. the Pan Pizza is our favorite!!  Love bringing nieces to play and eat,... And my husband and I dine in and take-out when aren't even with us! We even play games, watch the Dbacks games on tv!!  Better than any of the other Peter Pipers we've been to!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is not so great, but they do have good games for the kids and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this location many times, then go and pick up. It is usually just coming out of the oven when we get there. If it is out, it is in the warming oven. This time it was up front under a heat lamp and not hot at all. For $18.00 for 1 pizza with pepperoni, I was NOT happy. It is a very mediocre pizza anyway!No apology or offer to discount or anything! I WILL NOT go back here again!"}
{"text":"Took my grandkids to this location today for the lunch buffet and games NEVER again will I ever take them to this location. First the pizza was dry and over cooked and there were high school age boys in the game area using the F word very loudly and actually running little kids over! I spoke to the manager she said Sorry and asked them to calm down, of course it did not help and they continued. I had to take my 6 and 3 year old grandkids out of there to protect them from being ran over and subject to the F word. My grandson wanted his birthday party there (25) people but after spending 40 today and having to leave early I think I will choose a different location for the party..."}
{"text":"Don't read too much in to these 1, 2, and 3 star reviews. They're mainly complaining about the service. The employees for this restaurant is made up of mainly teenagers and young adults. The service is hit or miss which is about what you would expect. It is what it is. I give it 4 stars because you have to judge it for what it is.    Peter pipers is a pizza restaurant geared more towards kids. Do you hate going to chucky cheese? I do too. Lol. Go to Peter piper. I've been 3 times already for no occasion really and I'm going again today for my sons birthday. The pizza in my opinion is amazing. I love it. I've never really had any issues with the service. I really like this place. So if you want a good pizza then go to Peter pipers."}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza is about what you would expect for a place like this and definitely more geared towards kids. The pizza is nothing special and when I have gone I have encountered outrageous lines. It's not a place I would go to for the food, but basically only to entertain somebody who likes playing simple arcade games."}
{"text":"The manager openly cursed in front of a 9yr old's birthday party family members. He was a jerk and was basically shoving the family out of the tables, not giving us any time to even find a new table.  He was a total ass. And the cashier was a complete bitch. Her attitude was disgusting. Definitely gonna head to a different place next birthday party."}
{"text":"I guess I should have known better but I gave Peter piper another try, it's been quite awhile since I've been here but the mailed coupons had me try another pizza. bad idea. Tried a large NY 3 cheese pizza and the crust tasted like cardboard and the worst pizza I've had in years, seriously I've had better frozen pizza's so I should have just gone to oreganos and paid $25 for a pizza that is edible. I Know this place is for kids but I can't believe they still serve this garbage and think it's ok, kids have taste buds too, HORRIBLE is my message for anyone reading this"}
{"text":"Just got back from Peter piper both of my kids got a single personal size pizza and there were only 3 other customers in the restaurant. It took 30 minutes for 2 personal size kids pizza. Really? And then I asked one staff the machine it took m sons coins she said ok I'll get someone out here. Ten minutes later a person comes out I said the same thing the machine took my sons coins. So they go to get another person. Well a third person comes out and I tell them I'm not waiting anymore I'm mad someone fix the machine it ate my sons coins. Very poor service I won't come here again, I had my youngest sons birthday here before never again,"}
{"text":"We normally like going to this location. The food is pretty good and the staff are friendly. My complaint is the game selection has gone way down,the  jackpots are low, and the prizes are alot higher ticketed priced. Sad to see this happen because you almost feel ripped off to even spend the money on the games. Even my kids mentioned about some of there favorite games are gone and how little they where able to win... I hope it improves or we'll need to find a new location.. :/ If you are just going for the food, it's great. :) 4 stars for food and 2 for games and prizes."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I loved the old Peter Peter Pizza growing up. I used to look forward to anyone having a birthday party there because that meant Good Pizza and a day of fun. I was excited when I found out they were coming back. I was expecting them to be just as good as Dave & Busters and John's Incredible pizza Place. Well it wasn't. The food tasted just like chuckecheese food (I hate chuckecheese food. I guess same company same food!) And the play area was ridiculously small. I was really disappointed. I guess me and my kids well just go back to Dave & Busters and John's Incredible Pizza. I'm giving it 2 and a half stars because the staff were all really friendly and nice and my kids had a good time but they did say they would rather go to John's and Dave & Busters better. I'm hoping for this place to get a lot better."}
{"text":"This place is super busy and the staff is wonderful. love playing a few of the games. One of the games Quick Drop was not functioning properly. when you push the button it was either dropping to many balls or to few. So on this visit this was frustrating. Staff were so busy I could not even find a free  a staff member to inform them. that is why I am leaving  this review in hope someone will read it and repair the game. I love peter piper!!"}
{"text":"Great activity for kids. It's clean, spacious and safe."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed paid almost 10.00 for a mini piece of pizza and left over salad !! I work across the street had 1/2 lunch was craving pizza so o ended going to peter piper pizza this was my second time the first time I took my family we celebrated my son birthday everything was great that's back in January 2017 today everything change to the work service and riff off ! I was also planning to speak to the manager for a party of 30 people for my 6 year upcoming birthday this month but he did not even had the time to supply me with a fork for my bit of a salad what would of they done on a birthday of 30 kids! So my lunch got ruin in my son birthday party plans as well I guess back to chuck cheese.."}
{"text":"We just had a birthday party for my daughter at this location. It was so bad! If I could have given zero stars, I would have. The party host was always no where to be found. One time we where looking for her and she was washing the windows..???!! We had to do pretty much everything for ourselves. It was the biggest waste of money for a birthday party!!! No one cared. Every time we asked for our host, no one knew where she was or told us to talk to someone else. I was ready to talk to the manager but I didn't want a scene in front of the kids! Will not do that again! I had guests helping to serve the other party guests, it was so bad!"}
{"text":"Having spent some of my childhood in Texas, Peter Piper Pizza was one of my family's go to places on Sundays and I have nothing but great memories from this chain even when I go back to Texas to visit I stop by and grab a pizza.   I was beyond excited when I found out they had opened up not one but two Peter Piper Pizzas in Vegas, so I took advantage that my nephew and niece came into town and took them to the Eastern location so share some of my childhood memories but unfortunately this location failed short of that.   The pizza was good and just as I remembered but the downside was that the \"arcade/play area\" was really small with just a handful of arcade games. A few of the games where out of order which made the selection even less, my nephew got bored after a few minutes. We had to use up the tokens and just played every game until we ran out. Overall a bit disappointed that this location has such a small play area compared to other pizza places nearby. Would stop by for pizza but not of anything else for me here."}
{"text":"Pizza taste like cardboard and games are horrible. The prizes are just crappy as they get."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb . The games are great and the pizza is better than any of the rest."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor with my kids at the Peter Piper Pizza on Ray and 48th in Phx. The pizza is above average and arrives quickly.  What I really like about this place is the service.  The employees are very cordial and enthusiastic.  I have watched them interact with all types of people and I am amazed at their level of friendliness. As you see from my reviews I don't care if I am spending 5 bucks or $500, I put a tremendous value on customer service.  How hard is it to just be a decent person? Well many places could take a lesson from Peter Piper!"}
{"text":"I love going there with my daughter. We always have tons of fun and they have some decent prizes as well. The food is good but last time I ordered some wings and they were cold. Overall a great place to take the kiddos."}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE SERVICE now. This location has been a staple for our family since 1993 and after my experience tonight we will NEVER GO BACK again.  I ordered and paid online for a take out order. After standing there while the manager was busy comping another customer and flirting with the male customers she then tells me I need to pay for my order again. I show her my email showing I had already paid for the order and she ceases to tell me that I need to show her my bank account showing that the payment was processed. EXCUSE ME!!!! Don't think I need to show anyone my bank account activity. Needless to say she had absolutely no interest in making this right and was still busy with the male customers.  Canceled my order, made her provide me with confirmation that the order was canceled....and walked out and went to Streets of New York instead.  If there was an option for 0 stars that's what my rating would be!"}
{"text":"I have been here before a long time ago and it seemed fine, but came a couple times lately and it has gone down hill... tried to have a good lunch with my boyfriend and son. We asked to purchase the Buffett and we were a little late and that's fine I just didn't notice the time.. instead of telling us nicely the guy at the register just plainly looked at us and said ITS OVER... just staring at us... I'm like ok sorry.. so we continued to order and this guy wouldn't let me even finish my damn sentence and just said \"that's it?\" So plain and rude.. we had a coupon and he just slid it under the stack of buzzers and didn't scan it.. we mentioned it he didn't say anything and just got it back and scanned it. His name is David and happened to be a manager.. surprising... also there are 30 plus tables all trashed and no one in sight cleaning them up.. just a crappy experience with an employee that's seems to not care about his attitude..."}
{"text":"I come from Texas and understand the concept pizza place for kids to enjoy. Chuck E Cheese was our go to place in Houston. Now we are in AZ and this was the closest, same type of establishment, where we live. NEVER AGAIN! Sorry but the game room was way too small, no games for ages under 4-5 yo and it took 55 minutes for one large pizza to be ready.   I do not expect this to be in any way or form good pizza. I had higher hopes though looking at the set up in the prep area. We ordered the regular 3 Cheese with pepperoni on thin crust. There was way too much sauce which made the crust soft and soggy and I will not even mention the grease....(oh sorry. I just did).  Now again I do not expect much from this type of establishment so I gave it one star just for the layout of dinning area compared to gaming area. Thanks but not again."}
{"text":"No officer I am here for the pizza I swear. I am writing a review for Peter Piper Pizza?!? Have I lost my mind? Perhaps but that has nothing to do with it. We got coupons at work to entice us to try their new All You Can Eat Lunch Buffet. I took the free one. I won't turn down free food. None of my coworkers were willing to come with me. I think this place has got a bad rap for screaming kids and bad pizza. It was lunch time so there were not any kids. Well maybe 3 kids. There were a few other adults there for the buffet which runs Mon - Fri 11am to 2pm. It is normally $5.50 per person but I had the free coupon. Now the place was nice enough. Clean. Not too many video games. Just win ticket games. All kids want to do is win tickets to get crap that is shoved in the back of the closet after the first day but they just have to have it right then. They did have skeeball, air hockey and Pac Man. So that is at least something. The selection on the buffet line was not to extensive. Three different salads and about 8 to 10 different pizzas with bread sticks and cinnamon dessert pizza. But the pizza was not too bad. It wasn't good either but better than some other chain delivery places. The dessert pizza was pretty good too. When I went back a second time for a few more slices they had a few pies that were fresh out of the oven and they were a little better. Pretty good piping hot out of the oven. Would I go back again and pay $5? Possibly. For all you can eat for $5 plus $2 for a drink it wasn't bad. Plus they had Coke Zero so extra points for that. Would any of my coworkers go with me? No. Too much of a reputation for bad pizza and screaming kids. They wouldn't believe me when I said it wasn't that bad. Would it be my first choice? Probably not but I might just come back at some point. It is not the best pizza ever but it was better than I thought it would be. Better than some. It was quick and easy and I was back at work in plenty of time. For $5 I might go again at some point when I am craving all you can eat pizza. Give it a try. Don't just dismiss it based on face value and preconceived notions. If you don't like it you are only out $5."}
{"text":"After watching the girl worker make my hot wings and pouring it in the tray, one wing falls out and she handles the wing with her hand with no glove, and when I told her what she did she stood there and said she did not and wing was there after I can clearly standing where she is being watched. The manager tried to give me credit for the issue after I asked for a refund. He said he cannot give refund because they can get in trouble. He than states he has to call his GM to get approved when I told him there is no signs or anything on receipts states no refund. All of this happened after I received all 6 pizzas and wings came last with a horrible cross contamination."}
{"text":"Decided to try the lunch buffet for the first time. Not very impressed. The rotation was neglected. Then on two different occasions when I was getting food. My pizza was covered in cinnamon. About the only bit of satisfaction was that the lady behind the register gave me free beer. Wich ultimately guarantee's a return trip."}
{"text":"Haven't been in ages and so excited for the buffet, salad, breadsticks, pizza...yay. well got sauce for breadsticks it was cold, bummer. The pizza was also cold, seemed old. No pepperoni? Good amount of people at buffet and not enough food. Pizza people skipped over wanting fresh stuff!! They needed to be more prepared getting stuff out. Was bummed the dessert pizza I wanted was gone fast....pretty much bummed by visit."}
{"text":"My first time here and walking in I can tell its small. The dinning area is huge but the game center is small. I think they should expand the game center. Definitely been to a better Peter Piper Pizza location. The service is not that bad but the wait is long."}
{"text":"Chicago Pizza is the best. Good food at good prices. Ordering pizza for the family won't break the bank here. Cashiers don't show too much enthusiasm, but it's to be expected with the high volume of business they do. I still find their pizzas good. I always order to go,  and the wait time is average, considering they're making your pizza fresh."}
{"text":"This review will be simple and easy This place sucks Take to long for pizza to be made kids were hungry and to top it off for grown folks your only allowed 3 pitchers of beer I will never go back there again"}
{"text":"Our first time here , good customer service, great atmosphere, food was good. Kids had fun playing all the games . Great time with my family ."}
{"text":"Great place for the kids to hang out, eat some cheap pizza and play some games."}
{"text":"Took the kids to dinner here. Very close to home. Food is good. The kids play area is small enough to keep an eye on your kids but not have to be right there with them. Very clean considering there is kids running around. They have beer and play sports on the televisions to keep the adults entertained. Maggie is the manager and she is awesome. Very friendly and personable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their pizza! I have tried locations in Tempe, Goodyear, and east Phoenix. This location for the buffet is the best in terms of service and keeping the buffet bar replenished with food."}
{"text":"THESE JERKS ARE WASTEFUL AND RUDE!!! The manager said I couldn't have a bag or a box to take to my dog. He wanted me to buy a ranch packet to sell me a bag!!! It was seriously the crust scraps. I am not desperate or poor, I just paid for 6 people to eat buffet and I want to take a cheap treat to my dog. Now is that so wrong??? I do a lot of business with GG&D next door so I'm in here often and now with that kind of disrespect from a manager, you can say good buy to my business. I know my contribution isn't a lot but knowing they are so rude and don't have decent customer service that's enough for me to take my cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"We occasionally go here for playdates!  We just recently celebrated our son's birthday! Sara our party hostess was fantastic she made sure that our party ran smooth ,my son enjoyed making his own pizza !  It was a great fun at a reasonable price !! Thanks guys you all rock"}
{"text":"Attention all PPP haters.. The pizza is not cardboard, the service isn't slow, and you are the fool for spending $40 on tokens to win a 5¢ tootsie roll. My friend Daniel (a true Italian and pizza expert) and I had our first pie we had back in the 90's and PPP has retained the \"best pizza ever\" title for the last 25 years. Who does that without performance enhancing ingredients? Without Russian collusion? Without David Blaine slight of hand. It's better when hot but what isn't right? Except for ice cream. And bobsledding. To liven up your dining experience, try unscrewing the crushed red pepper shaker on someone and video their response. Don't worry, it won't ruin the taste of the pizza. Nothing can, not even your unsophisticated reviews."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday party and the staff was rude, the bathrooms were so smelly you can smell them from the dining room, and out of the 20 games maybe 5 worked right and didn't take the coins."}
{"text":"I just moved here about a week ago and was really looking forward to some great pizza. We used a buy one, get one free lunch coupon. The cashier was friendly and the pizza was as delicious as I remember from living in Texas. However, the buffet options were very limited. The salad bar had two or three different salads, all premixed and looked like they were drenched in dressing so I passed. The dining area was clean but the overall look of the restaurant can use some updating. The arcade area was dirty and there were many kids acting uncontrollably, screaming and getting on top of the rides while I'm trying to put my daughter in it. With Peter Piper Pizza being an Arizona-based chain, I expected more buffet options and a nicer establishment; the ones in Texas were waaay better! I plan on trying a different location next time so hopefully it's better."}
{"text":"Staff is always nice, very attentive and try to keep up with the chaos of the kids making a mess. However I've been to the lunch buffet a few times and I have noticed that they aren't prepared for the amount of customers at this time; meaning pizzas options are very very limited, and there is always a long wait for new ones. Maybe setting up a few more trays will help resolve this issue."}
{"text":"We had my daughters birthday here and we were lucky enough to have Skyler as our party host. He was the sweetest and made sure we were taken care of  all of the food came out fast and it was all delicious!! We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This location is always busy !! The good thing they have employees always cleaning table... however they take plates when you are still eating !! Make sure to tell the employee that you are not finished with your food!!"}
{"text":"Kids love Peter Piper for the games and the pizza. Adults go to make kids happy. Not much else to it. The pizza is just ok."}
{"text":"Obviously only come here for the children. Staff has no clue the concept of customer service for bad food and over priced games. Much nicer location just blocks away on Ray rd- head there."}
{"text":"Had the best service by the cashier. She even cut our pizza in smaller slices for the kids without us asking. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Pizza crust was like burnt cardboard, barely any pizza sauce on top of the crust. The only half decent item was the garlic bread, which was soft and had some flavor. The pastas were a flavorless and watery disaster... they get you in with the $7 lunch buffet price and add a $3 drink to get you. I regret spending my money here."}
{"text":"Took my son there at 7pm.  The sprite was out, so was both lemonades pizza was ok still took over 40 minutes and there was less than 10 other people there in the while place! Pizza Barely any cheese dirty tables left everywhere for the whole time I was there.. Poor management is all..."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful birthday party for my son here. Our hostess, Autumn was AMAZING.  I've had a lot of bday parties at kids places over the years and this was one of my favorites.  The atmosphere is less chaotic, the kids as well as the adults had a great time.  Autumn was very attentive and kept the flow going nicely.  Pizza was tasty, fresh potato chips were delicious. Thank you so much Peter Piper and Autumn."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service! Great place to take the kids.They remodeled the entire store. All updates make the restaurant look fresh and open. They also have new games added. Two separate areas for parties. I love it!"}
{"text":"The people here are wonderful! They helped host our party for Make-a-Wish and were so generous and kind. They were attentive to our needs and helped make it a very wonderful, positive experience for the wish kiddo and their family."}
{"text":"Nice place to take the kiddos.  Not a whole lot of stuff to play with but it's relatively affordable compared to a Chuc E. Cheese's.  I've been to 2 PP locations and I definitely like this one more.  Feels cleaner.  Friendly staff (the other location's staff was good, too).  Overall experience here was probably better just 'cuz we came here on a Monday afternoon when there's not a whole lot of people.  Great place to let your kids exert some energy!  Pizza's not bad either!"}
{"text":"This place has very poor quality testing pizza at a high price. You can go to Barro's pizza get the best pizza and wings for the same price and even eat more at Barro's! Not worth my family's visit of 4 members. The games section is tiny, my kids went through it fast and then got bored. The sitting section is huge but the buffet bar is also tiny. Such a bad distribution of space for what is suppose to be a fun and nice place for the entire family! We were so disappointed to have spent $50 here. After having visited many other peter piper locations, I can honestly say that we most likely got the worst peter piper ever right here in Laveen. The only good thing is that it is new."}
{"text":"Came in to pick up my phone order this afternoon, Manny was very nice and polite. Great customer service and ot was very clean!"}
{"text":"Francisco is the manager at this location! He is super awesome, nice and really talkative. He makes myself and family feel like if we were family! Thanks for the best Pizza  ever and good customer service and of course clean place! Thanks"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was really great, esp for the price. Huge fan of their ceasar salad. Could use more games though. Chuck e cheese is better if you're looking for games."}
{"text":"First time to a PPP so I don't know how it stacks up to other PPPs.  I like the pizza better here than, say, Chuck E. Cheese's but there's not as much to do as far games go.  My toddler enjoyed the games though but the play area just seemed really small.  Other than that, the place seemed OK.  Lots of dining space."}
{"text":"LUNCH BUFFET REVIEW:: After dropping 50 bucks on a buffet in Laughlin the last couple of days, man it feels good to be back home.   $6.50 for a buffet at lunch folks.  Yeah it is just pizza and salad.  But 6.50, like I said, damn it feels good to be back home.  Went today to celebrate my birthday.   Took Carlos sr and the little one.   Had Hawaiian pizza, pepperoni, jalapeno, sausage.  Veggie, mushroom and desert pizza  Man they had it all covered.  And if want something a little different, just ask them to put that topping mix on it and I am sure they will make one like that and put it out. They are cool like that.  Workers have always been very nice.  And seriously folks the pizza isn't half bad.  I say it tastes a lot better than Chuck E Cheese.  But don't expect top level quality.   I would say this is about the best you gonna get for a kids place.    And like I said at the top of the review.  After dropping the cash I did in Laughlin on Harrah's buffet, this place seemed like a steal today.  We played a few games, I do wish they had more games for only 1 token.  Everything is 2 tokens and up.    Anyway.  Go for the food and fill your belly up for CHEAP....        Take care."}
{"text":"OK went back to PPP for the lunch buffet right at 11am today.  The star deductions today are for the inconsistency...If you read this asap, please check the calibration on your ovens!  All thin crust pizzas that came out today were very over cooked.  They're usually perfect, but today just not good.  Other pizza sometimes had perfect crust, and others were way under or over cooked.  I hate to gripe as it's an incredible value for $7.  I've just always been a fan of PPP's crust since high school over 30 years ago.  Check those ovens guys, and seriously get those thin crust pies corrected.."}
{"text":"Great place love the pasta and salad pizza is fresh and hot. Great price for the buffet"}
{"text":"Best peter piper pizza. Service is always great as well as the pizza. I have gone to other peter piper pizza's but this one always guarantees me a fresh, warm pizza."}
{"text":"This place just sucks ordered my wings had some ones hair on um that ask for new ones and get looked @ like a you have three eyes manager does not know what customers service is"}
{"text":"The past 3-4 times they have gotten our carry out order wrong. Always have to wait an extra 20min so they can get it right. Last time I am ordering from this location, service is too slow. Only giving 2 stars because the pizza is good."}
{"text":"We arranged for our daughter to have her birthday party here last week, and they were absolutely great!  We were assigned a party \"helper' and she was always available to get more food, drinks, or whatever else we needed.  We hadn't received as many RSVPs as we thought we would, so they were willing to reduce the charges (they charge per party guest).  My daughter and her guests (and her parents) all enjoyed the food, games and prizes.  It's a nice environment, the food was good.  My only little bit of criticism would be that the game area is a little small compared to other similar establishments that I've been to.  But the service was good, and it didn't take too long for us to get any of our food or drinks.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent location for kids gatherings. There are a wide variety of kid games, the location is spacious, and more than everything the venue is clean. I wouldn't count on the taste since the pizza tastes like cardboard at kid pizzarias but that's okay! As long as the kids are happy you should be fine, and I think you can accomplish that at PPP."}
{"text":"Took the kids here,  they had a blast it cost us about 50 bucks for, wings, four drinks a large pizza and tokens to last four kids  three hours, I think it's worth the money and the pizza was great!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed this place is still in business. The quality of their pizza is worse than most frozen pizzas, for about 2-3 times the price. Even if you came here for arcades, you'd be horribly disappointed. The gaming selection is very poor and the whole vibe of this place was just sad -- like a hospice care facility for pizza -- where flavor and fun go to die."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Peter Piper in years, we went for the lunch buffet, it was amazingly yummy and it just tastes the same as when I was a kid. I feel as though the sauce, cheese and bread ratio are perfect. It's obviously a family place along with games and such. I wish they had these in SoCal! I visit every time I'm visit Phoenix"}
{"text":"I may be one of very few who actually LOVES PPP's pizza. I don't know what it is, but it is really good. I think it's the sauce, and partially the cardboard-like crust. This location is really big. We usually get take out, but the last time I came with a friend on a day off and we had a blast! We were the only people there (well it was a Tuesday at like 2pm) and we had beer and wine an probably spent 60 bucks on game tokens and went to town like we were 5 again. The staff was very friendly considering we probably seemed a bit ridiculous! We had an awesome pizza (I always get cheese, but the toppings others get usually look pretty good). We won a ton of tickets and got all kinds of crap we will never use and gave most of it away!  I have to say, I never knew getting a good buzz and blowing a ton of money on random (some half working) games could be such a blast! Clean restaurant and bathrooms and they were even washing germs off the games with spray."}
{"text":"The customer service is great. Very clean and maintained well. Fast service. The staff always goes above and beyond to satisfy me and guests which is greatly appreciated. The food is always fresh and tasty, of course!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great for the kids and always clean. I can always tell when a restaurant has great management. Our kids never wait for a ticket attendant. This makes the experience for the parent enjoyable."}
{"text":"Thank you peter piper pizza for making my daughters birthday amazing. When we arrived there was 2 tables already set up for us. We had our own hostess that was amazing and so helpful. The food was great. I give this peter piper 5 stars. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have to rate a 5 star for brunch.  I can get and adult for $5.99 with coupon and includes a drink as well as a child for 4.99 from 3 and above to 10.  You have 3 choices of salad, 5-7 types of pizza, breadsticks, marinara, cheesy bread and two types of desserts!  It's also nice because my kids can play, the adults can enjoy the TV, free wifi and a beer  if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Came in for a T-Ball registration event. They also had another fundraiser and ice cream eating contest. We decided to stay for some pizza and games, they have a deal pizza and tokens $25. Place was very busy. Ordered pizza, went and played some game while we waited, you get a buzzer to let you know when the pizza it ready. Game area was filled with kids, it was clean,and I did like that the attendants were watching over. Pizza was up pretty fast.  The pizza was hot and looked good a little skimpy on the toppings. Pizza was tasty. Played some more games, cashed tickets in, and got prizes. The ticket counter was broken, so the line was pretty long to cash in.  Eating area, game area and bathrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"I had to go here to sign the kiddo up for baseball. Before we went, he told me that he didn't like Peter Piper. Whatever, kid, I know better than to believe that EXTREMELY large pile of bologna! You're 5 and your life revolves around playing, napping, and eating snacks, and playing some more!!!!!  Ahh to be a kid again!  Anyways, while we were there I figured why not eat? We got a pizza and he got a free pizza (from school). With our pizza we took the survey on the receipt and got 10 free tokens. BOOYA! Well, booya for about 2 minutes - 10 tokens are blown away enough just to wet the appetite of a 5yr old.  Needless to say, he didn't eat his pizza. He was too flabbergasted to even know what he was doing. In fact, if I had to guess his vision was something akin to someone taking Estacy. I mean... flashing lights, kids running around like they are on cocaine, and most importantly... he wanted to spend MY money.  I kid you not, I'm turning into my mother every day. I never understood why my mom said no to me having fun. Well, it is because the particular type of fun I wanted her to invest in was EXPENSIVE. I mean, $20 for tokens will get you about 15 tickets which will get you a $0.05 Tootsie Roll from the prize department.  I'll tell you what, kid, you sit there and enjoy your pizza and be thankful that you arent still sitting in the car waiting on me... the sheer act of letting you into such an establishment is a gift itself. Since you want to play video games... and eat candy... how about this... how about we roll over to Sam's Club and get a 5lb bag of candy... and you can go home and play whatever game you want on whatever console you want (spoiled kid has access to a XBOX360, a PS3, a Wii, and a computer - I had 5 Nintendos TWO YEARS AFTER the Super Nintendo came out because nobody wanted the NES system anymore!).  But of course today that isn't cool. He wants to have fun. I lost - mom bought him more tokens. *sigh* I guess I'm the bad guy again.  On a serious note the pizza wasn't bad (and the kid claims that PP Pizza is the best now, again, whatever) but the tables were filthy. I guess I kind of expected that though."}
{"text":"I love this peter piper because the pizza is always good and i never wait long after ordering"}
{"text":"Went to this location during the week to see if service would be any better then my recent experience at a different location.   It was a Wednesday and it surprisingly was busy. I waited a few minutes in line and it gave us enough time to look over the menu. I ended up ordering the pizza and wings combo and a regular drink for $25.   The cashier was friendly and from what we could see there were three employees working the kitchen area. One female employee wearing a black shirt, one male employee in red, and the cashier was wearing green.   We sat down in the booth right in front of the soda machines, and we could also easily see right into the kitchen and see the oven where the pizzas were coming out of.   We waited about 15 minutes, and our pizza and wings finally came out. Our pizza was great and the boneless wings were also very good!!   As we sat there and ate though, we saw a lot of things that went on in that kitchen...  One: the employee adding the toppings to the pizzas never put gloves on. Two: They went for an ice cream run and were drinking their shakes in the kitchen while prepping other patrons food...  And three:  Two pizzas were coming out of the oven at the same time. One of the pizzas on the right side fell off the conveyer belt and fell onto the ground. (Toppings side up) the girl in the black was doing other stuff so she wasn't paying attention.   She finally came around to the oven and quickly stopped the second pizza from falling. She looked around real quick, picked up the the pizza from the ground and... wait for it.... SHE PUT IT ON A PAN FOR THE CUSTOMER TO EAT.. GROSS!    We were shocked that she did this. The pizza was clearly on the floor and she still picked it up and served it like that. Smh. She knew what she did was wrong because she looked around to see if she was being watched before she served it..   Ugh so one star it is. My food was good but did my pizza get dropped as well?..."}
{"text":"We had a great time, wish they had more games!.  The staff was friendly and things seemed to be clean.  I think this place is geared towards older kids but still fun!"}
{"text":"I think all of you are so funny lol I've been going to this location for a very long time since I was a kid and this location is my favorite unlike other locations that are dirty and kids spilling everything.  I've always been treated well and with respect. My pizza is always on time and they are nice."}
{"text":"Sorry Peter Piper!  Your PIZZA is outdated and made up of processed ingredients.  This is my first and last time ordering.  I ordered 15.99 Large 1 topping w/ wings + 1 2 liter Soda.  The wings were ok, but that wasn't the main focus, it was the pizza which has no flavor and is bulky."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here tonight...2XL. One with peperronni and the other cheese. I placed it online and was specific on how I wanted the pizza. The peperronni was to be well done and the cheese was supposed to be lite sauce. So the peperronni was correct; however, the cheese was incorrect. I let the guy know at the counter that it was wrong. I didn't order 2 peperronni pizzas. He got his manager Tiffany. She looked at the ticket and this was her reasoning...\"when you don't add a meat to your order most customers mean they want peperronni\". I said excuse me? So because I don't add a meat to my order you just assume I want a meat? She again repeats herself about assuming I wanted a meat! She was repeating herself as if I didn't understand her! I kept explaining to her if I don't add a meat then that means I just want cheese! I asked her to just reimburse me for the cheese since my daughter eats cheese pizza and I'll just pick them off. She said we'll remake it. No...I'm not gonna wait longer so my food gets colder. So she got a different manager and this one was much more helpful. She agreed that what Tiffany said made no sense! She was nice enough to reimburse me the entire order. I was willing to pay for the correct one. I don't think I'll order at this location again all because of the manager Tiffany's  reasoning!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for the lunch buffet.  For production pizza I enjoy this pizza the most over Pappa Johns, Domino's, and Pizza Hut.  Price is fair for what you get.    Only thing that troubles me is that I have seen people walk right in, go to the dining room area and then procede to the buffet line to help themselves without paying for anything.  There really does not seem to be any type of system established to prevent this type of thing.  I mentioned it to one of the managers one time but he seemed like he didn't care about it much.  His attitude was rather concerning.  Other then that  I am pleased with this place."}
{"text":"We always have a good experience here. The pizza is great, and it always clean. The shift manager Selena, is amazing. She always has a smile, and laugh ready. It looks like the other employees enjoy working with her. I would recommend this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"There are deals a-plenty at the Peter Piper Pizza during the lunch hour on weekdays at this location.  While traveling through the Grand Canyon State, and checking out the Ice Den, practice home of the Phoenix Coyotes (nee Winnipeg Jets), I stumbled upon this hidden gem in the desert.  This is well-kept and clean pizza place.  And the deal for all you can eat pizza, salad, and cinnamon twist, with drink cost less than $7.  There is a bar here, and had the Blue Moon on Tap.  Folks, for all of your nostalgic needs, there is PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) on tap, too.  Jarrod, the restaurant manager, served us promptly and efficiently.  The pizza was not bad, as it hit the spot after watching the Coyotes practice.  Beer is served cold, with an orange garnish, well-cut and placed on top of the foam of the beer.  That's cool if it is cut right.  Surprising, all of the games worked and was surprised that the selection of prizes were pretty good.  Lighting was sufficient and there are ample tables and booths available.  It was too cold to dine al fresco that day.  At this location, there was a steady stream for lunch as there are businesses close by the restaurant.  This is a place that is great for kids.  Even if I don't have any young tykes running around, this deal is hard to beat.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's Peter Piper food. You don't come for healthy food (although they have salads,) but even as busy as this place was on a Saturday night...the \"service\" was amazing. The table attendants assisted us finding an open table and then promptly cleaned it for us.  The manager \"Jacob\" helped us pick out the right package deals to feed all of us at a reasonable cost.  The food was really good and the 8 kids had a blast. Sure, it was packed and from the outside you might think it was a zoo inside...but that's reasonable on a Saturday early evening. This isn't a couples \"date night\" venue.  You gotta love kids...and lots of them!! :)"}
{"text":"The worse pizza I've ever had.  Tasted like tomato paste on cardboard.   The frozen pizzas you get from the grocery are better than these.  Very limited selection of pizzas for the brunch.    Add to that the bad parents and their screaming children and it was a lunch I never want to think about again.   Parking was terrible, only a tiny lot for patrons."}
{"text":"Food was good but the place needs some help! We went there tonight and the place was torn up. So many games were not working and broken, parts missing. There was trash and stains everywhere!! I know it is a child's place but come on you all can clean!!"}
{"text":"PPP has some pretty good pizza and I always come back just for that! The pizza especially when it's just coming out of the oven is sooo good! You have to eat it HOT.   We had dinner on Saturday evening and there were a few parties going on. Nothing to crazy. There was no one in line so we were helped right away.     We ordered two large one topping pizzas for $21.99, one chicken ceaser salad, (chicken not included) three drinks, and one order of medium chicken wings.   We got a strange vibe from the cashier and she barely even said a word. She just stared at us. She didn't greet us or didn't even say thank you. She probably hates her job.   We didn't wait too long for our food. We did walk back to ask for some ranch though and we stood there for 5min (along with some other people) for an employee to finally walk over and help us... I know you saw us... The coke also tasted funky and when we told one of the employees about it they just said ok.   I remember the game area was once alot bigger. The game area is now sooo small and there isn't to many game machines to play from.   The food was good! The customer service could definitely be better.."}
{"text":"Grade F HORRIBLE. My kid accidentally put in a coin worth 100 because no one told us about the special coin. They wouldn't refund nor would they get another one. Both lady managers were non empathetic and on their phone almost 60% the time. Always had a good experience at these places but today was the worst ever. The whole staff seems so miserable and doesn't take their jobs seriously. Go to another location. Managers are worst then the workers. I hate this place so badly right now. If they weren't fundraising my kid's school, I would have gone BALLISTIC!"}
{"text":"If that's true then explain why the texture was not the same and the flavor was so bad that we each tried a slice and left the rest."}
{"text":"Filthiest Peter Piper I've been to in AZ.  I've been to Metro, Arrowhead, 91st & Peoria, and several others and this one is terrible in comparison.  The trashes were overflowing on the floor.  The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting with broken urinals, filthy tile, dirty floors.    The games were broken and old.  The prize attendant couldn't count and was allowing people to cut in front of others.  The food wasn't even made well.  I would avoid having your child's party at this location.  There are too many other Peter Pipers in the valley than to waste your child's bday here."}
{"text":"Chuck E. Cheese clone. I spent over 200 dollars at this place and all I can get was a tootsie pop!!  I hat this place...  I give it a 1 outta 10 would give it a 0 if I could since this place is horrible."}
{"text":"So no one is going to confuse this place for fine dining, but I gotta say- it gets the job done. Old School pizza that is really good when it's piping hot out of the oven. It's not the best a day later, so keep in mind to get it while it's hot, and then maybe tip your 40, because it's over Johnny."}
{"text":"If you're on a limited lunch break this is not a good place to come.  They seem to have a real hard time keeping food on the buffet. Very limited pizza selection on the buffet.  Seem to be very short staffed as well only two people running around the kitchen trying to keep up with the demand."}
{"text":"Place is huge so you can enjoy your meal without a hassle to find a table. Game room is a little small, but was enough for our quivk lunch. They have several t.v.'s on with all different channels which is nice because you can find something to your liking. My order was incorrect when I received it, but the manager Stacy did above and beyond to fix it without hesitation! Customer service here is what It's all about!"}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't cooked all the way through and the sauce tastes generic. Very pricey pizza for what we got. The place is real gimmicky. Most of their kids games take 2 or more tokens so you don't get to play a lot."}
{"text":"I went to 3 Peter Piper Pizza parties last weekend (lots of bday parties this month) and this was by far the nicest one.  The staff was most helpful.  Everything we asked for we were given by our party hostess.    The food was made fresh to order and the toppings were as expected.  The place was very busy but remarkably clean in the dining, game room, and bathrooms.    The games were in good working order and current.  The kids had a really good time.  I would have another party here and recommend it to others.  It is better than the Metro PP I went to and blows the one on Baseline out of the water."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst PPP I have EVER been to.  Showed up around 6.  There was no one at the front at all.  If I would have timed the amount of time it took them to Greet me I would sill be waiting.  Once they did come to the front no one wanted to help.  We ordered two personal pan pizzas for our kids.  25 minutes later.  NO PIZZA!!!   Went tot he front two ask them what was going on, and you guessed it, no one there to answer any questions. They were not busy at all so it made 0 sense as to why no one was available.  Worst experience of my life. The kids were miserable and hungry.  They seriously need to do something with management."}
{"text":"It's a mixture of Cici's pizza and Chucky cheese if they had an ugly baby. I was not impressed and very disappointed in the choices available. Salads came pre-made overloaded with dressing and a higher calorie count them the desert. Their pizza was less than impressive little Caesars even makes a better pizza for five dollars. Normally when you pay for an all you can eat buffet you take more than one plate here I didn't even want what I put on the only place I got- most likely won't return kids did enjoy the games and prizes"}
{"text":"We haven't been to this one for over a year.  Have had birthday parties at other locations and had a great time.  We chose this one as convenience to all.  WE WILL NEVER RETURN. The place was filthy.  Crap all over the floor.  Four booths and a long table were not cleaned during the hour and 1/2 we were there.  We cleaned our own. Glad we brought handwipes  Had to ask twice for an ice machine fill.  Women's rest room was cluttered with trash and TP.  Only roll left was on the floor. Trash runneth over.  Men's was the same.  Hand towels would not fit in trash, so on the floor they went.  Grossest was the bloody bandage stuffed into the seat cover holder.Way beyond understaffed.  Sunday PM 4:00.  And besides that the pizza was not that good.  There is a much better one three miles North at Baseline/McClintock."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location all summer because they have a kid's club activity every Tuesday.  The staff does an amazing job of keeping the chaos down, the pizza is always good and even with big groups of kids they still recognize my family and take time to visit and make sure everything is going smoothly with our lunch."}
{"text":"While I appreciate the craftsmanship of places like Humble Pie and Parlor, I've been coming back to Peter Piper for over 30 years. I think the blend of cheese on the New York Three Cheese pizza is excellent. I'll get the grandkids a large pepperoni, and I'll savor the Three Cheese for myself.  I prefer the 7th and Osborn PPP because they still have the old-school rotating oven, which I think produces a better pizza than the newer chain-drive ovens that pull the pizza through the oven with no human intervention. I like watching the pizza makers slide the oven door down and pop down the bubbles in the crust as the pizza cooks. Just like Chef Bianco!  When my wife got the sex ed talk from her mom, she was told that \"sex was something you have to do to be married.\" She has no use for Peter Piper, and tells me that \"Peter Piper is something she has to do to be married.\" Well, tit for tat: I have to go to her grandniece's awful birthday parties in Anthem, so she gets to dine at Peter Piper from time to time.  I'm docking it one star because of their crappy selection of cheap beer."}
{"text":"Read the reviews that are not \"recommended\" down below, I wish that I would have. What everyone is saying about the management is 100% correct. I visited this location today on my lunch break today around 1pm, it was my first time in. I got to the cash register and the cashier (who to my surprise ended up being the manger) Katelin Demmon hands down had most rude customer service I have ever received. There was no one behind me but she kept rushing me, I replied politely asking her if I could please look at the minute for just a moment. She let out a deep sigh, and immediately walked away. I waited about 3 minutes for her to come back, when she did I over head her speaking negatively about the customers to another employee under her breath. I asked her a question about a item on the menu. She didn't answer and had an horrible attitude, she even rolled her eyes. I'm extremely disappointed, I would never return to this location. I would not recommend this location to families or anyone who likes being treated with respect. I will be reaching out to the GM Steven Ring to discuss his employees horrible customer service and rude behaviors. On a side note the food was good :)."}
{"text":"This Peter Piper has recently been remodeled. The whole back area that use to be filled with games is replaced with more tables and chairs. My kids were so disappointed. They got rid of most of their games and this location now has one of the smallest game areas. We will not be returning to this location. It is also under new management and it's all a bunch of kids running the place and the service was a disaster. Pizza orders were mixed up, the buzzer was deactivated before we even got our pizza. The AC did not seem to be working well, it was pretty hot in there. We love PPP but this location is now awful. I do not recommend this location at all. We now go to the one on Ray Rd and 48thst...so much better"}
{"text":"A lot of the games were out, they didn't have many games that were playable for my children. It took 7 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me when I stood up to complain about another game not working that took my coin. Not a really great environment to be in, they seemed short staffed but, they had reservations at majority of tables."}
{"text":"So I drove by here on my way home from work and remembered this place as a kid in Vegas.  I noticed they had a $4.99 buffet so thought why not try it.  Food:  Well you get what you pay for.  Pizza tasted somewhat cardboard like.  To be fair this may have been due to it setting out for the buffet.  The breadsticks were okay but also somewhat store bought.  They did have an amazing cinnamon dessert pizza.  I would say this made up for the pizza itself.  They had salads however it looked like the dressing was already mixed in which I can't say I have ever seen at a buffet of any sort.  Once again I am aware this is a place for kids and it was only 4.99.  Environment:  Meant for kids obviously.  Arcade for fun, but TVs with ESPN for the adults that are there.  It is what you'd expect.    Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if I am feeling really nostalgic I might try it again one lunch.  $4.99 is hard to beat."}
{"text":"So I'm in the store at 2115 on a Sunday, planning to have my customary Pizza Experience. I order an XL to go and a beer while I'm waiting. \"I'm sorry, Sir,\" sez he, \"we can't sell alcohol within an hour of closing.\"  What, now? You're open for another 45 minutes, and in AZ you could legally serve beer for another 4 hours and 45 minutes.  Whiskey tango foxtrot?! I actually thought I had heard it all. New Mexico has a curious law (or maybe it was just the policy of that PPP store) - they wouldn't serve you a beer unless you ate food with it. Sure, I'll take some breadsticks while I'm waiting for the EXTRA LARGE PIZZA I already ordered. This at least makes a little sense, but I digress.  Shakin' my head, PP (and MQ, respectfully). One more demerit."}
{"text":"On 2/14/14 we went to this location to have a kid friendly Valentines night.  Our night was completely ruined after waiting for over an hour for our food (still left without eating) and being verbally assaulted by the GM Darius Steen who felt it necessary to scream at my fiancee \"what do you think this is?  this is not fast food, its pizza.\"  A little much being it is pizza and should take maybe 20minutes.  While checking on our food, which had not even been started after an hour, apparantly this irritated Darius further who decided he needed to also scream across the kitchen from the pizza making station, \"Ive been working here 15years and probably make more money than you.\"  Totally rude and not professional to anyone, especially to someone who is a customer.  We also contacted Peter Pipers main office regarding this incident and behavior to never get a response.  Apparantly this company condones this kind of disgusting behavior.  Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Resturaunt is dirty.  Salad had brown lettuce.  Pizza was made well but cut horribly and uneven.  Environment is not good overall.  Sad because this used to be our favorite location."}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at fired pie, I came here and was pleasantly surprised. The young man that helped me was very nice and I'm glad I came here."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. Great place to take the kids to play. It's always clean the staff is always nice and I feel comfortable. Check out the buffet it's great."}
{"text":"I ordered Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza, Pepperoni & Beef, Pepperoni Pizza and Ham Pineapple pizza. The pizzas are very delicious I come with my family on special occasions like birthdays, graduations, promotions etc."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give 0 stars I would. This place was completely filthy!!!! First off we waited 15 minutes in line just to place our order, and there were only 3 people ahead of us. Then we went to sit down and a staff member told us we had to move because it was reserved (no signs saying so). And it wouldn't have been a big deal except there weren't many other places to sit because the empty tables were all filthy and unbussed. This wasn't the only dirty part, the beverage station, the restrooms the floor were all disgusting. The floor by the oven was covered in food particles and pizza pans were directly on the floor (health code violation!!). We got our food and boxed it up and left. This place needs some serious corporate attention! We will definitely stick to the location on Hayden moving forward, that location is exponentially better."}
{"text":"This PPP location is consistently good. It's always very clean and well maintained. Staff is good, not always the friendliest but get the job done. I had my daughters birthday party here and everything was fantastic. They help you plan everything and it's totally stress free. Pizza is also very consistent and good."}
{"text":"Great son and mother date! I originally wanted to take my freshmen son to Modern Round, but I would prefer him going through the Saturday gun training program before booking a shooting lounge. Instead, we decided to go to the Peter Piper Pizza's near our home, We purchased a drink and 100 tokens for $20. My son and I decided not to get pizza because we were still full from lunch. \"Mom, if you are feeling peckish, feel free to get something to eat.\" What a great kid! Oh, I am supposed to be reviewing the restaurant, not my son. Back to Peter Piper's Pizza.   We were bummed that they didn't have \"Fruit Ninja\" at this location. This is our favorite game that we play together at the Metro Parkway locale. We started with Alien Armegeddon and ended with Alien Armegeddon. In between, we spent half of our coins harpooning sharks for tickets that we redeemed later for a couple of sheriff badges (my son chose the prizes), and lots of candy. He got the gold badge and gave me the silver one. I guess he was the Elite gamer. We also played \"Fire Ball\" or skee ball, but it was finicky. We were refunded 3 tokens because one machine didn't give us balls and the other didn't give us tickets. Bummer! We spent the last 45 minutes and 46 tokens saving the earth from Alien Armegeddon. It was incredibly intense, but it was awesome playing cooperatively. While playing on story mode, on our last chapter, we had to replay 4 times because the alien kept defeating us. On the fifth try, we succeeded. Yay, we can all sleep well tonight because we saved the world from xenotrophs with our machine guns, shot guns, sniper rifles, grenades and flame throwers. Next time, we will fight against machines in \"The Terminator.\" We'll, be back."}
{"text":"Fundraiser for Phoenix Coding Academy. Thank you Peter Piper Pizza for hosting a fundraiser for the Robotics Club. The hostess was warm and friendly. We did not wait too long for our pizza. PPP's pizza is consistently tasty. The staff forgot to ask me if I was a part of the fundraiser, but they were kind enough to give credit to the Robotics Club when I asked. It is a smaller PPP than other ones we've been to. They did not have Fruit Ninja which is our favorite, but the staff was friendly, and we had fun."}
{"text":"The food at this location is on point like the old school Peter piper pizza .... really good atmosphere price was decent but unfortunately the gaming area was really small with limited games ..."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for the great value for years. We live equally in between the scottsdale locations, but we always pick this one for the customer service. Tim, is so friendly and eager to assist my family. HE remembers my orders from months ago and we really appreciate his efforts. The rest of the staff is also gracious and even previous staff were always friendly and if we had a lunch buffet request would try to accommodate us. The food is consistent and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My name is Ariane and I'm very upset with a manager at your Tolleson location named JENNIFER. Long story short, I was kicked out of this location for having my SERVICE ANIMAL accompany me. She said because he had no vest, he had to leave or we both had to leave. I explained to JENNIFER that by law, service dogs are not required to wear a vest and what she is doing is illegal. To which she responded \"I know our policy, so I don't care\" I was given permission by her to keep the dog as long as he was under the table, to which I complied. While peacefully eating my pizza, JENNIFER called the POLICE on me to have them escort me out for being \"disorderly and disturbing the peace. Not once did I raise my voice, not once did I become hostile or even use a tone. I simply explained why I could not \"just leave him outside\" as JENNIFER stated. I was escorted out by two officers for having my SERVICE ANIMAL with me.  My friends all had to end our night out due to us all riding together and everyone had to leave all because my SERVICE ANIMAL was with me. They did not get to finish their pitcher of beer and everyone had to take the pizza home to which it was by then cold. She ruined our peaceful night out. What Peter Piper did was ILLEGAL and I'm planning on filing a lawsuit against you if something is not done to correct this issue. If Peter Piper treats people with disabilities like this, then I will no longer be your customer.  Feel free to check your cameras as I was harassed and false accusations were made to the POLICE DEPARTMENT. So, I also plan on filing a lawsuit against that as well."}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet because I do like their pizza. I was disappointed because they didnt keep up on the cheese bread. As soon as they made some, it was gone. Then it was at least 15 minutes before they brought more"}
{"text":"Carry out is a nightmare. First of all, you have to wait in the same line as the customers eating in. And with one register open? Your pizza is just sitting under a heat lamp an you can't do a thing about it but wait till the 5-6 people in line go throughout their ordering. This has happened to me more than once and it is very irritating."}
{"text":"Had My daughter's birthday party yesterday. The associate assigned to us was Paige and had everything ready for us.  Throughout the event she checked on us and made sure our tables were clear and always asked of we needed anything.  The kids were very entertained and enjoyed their pizza.  Paige did an excellent job and made our day much better."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way home from work. Food was excellent. We ordered the pizza and boneless wings deal. My only complaint was I needed a to go box so I went to the counter to ask for one. I stood there for almost 5 minutes for someone to help me. I could see all the workers in the back but got no attention. It wasn't busy yet but someone needs to attend to the counter. Not good customer service."}
{"text":"This place was insane.  Kids all over the place screaming, falling down, throwing food.  I've never seen such chaos.  We came for the pizza with no children- called for take out.  We were put on hold for 10 minutes.  By the time we arrived, the girl finally took us off hold to take our order.  We paid and waited.  They told us it would take 10 minutes.  We checked on our pizza around 20 minutes.  They said it was almost done.  At 30 minutes, they handed us a pizza that had been sitting on the counter the entire time.  It was cold and hard.  They told us they would give us another pizza for our troubles (we had ordered to go and had people at home waiting on us.)  Bad service, chaotic environment.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great staff great enviroment. My familys first trip to Arizona this past weekend. We had 3 hours to kill before our event started and found Peter Piper's. Immedialty we were greeted amd helped. Staff provided above and beyond to ensure me and my family had the best experience. Pizza was amazing. Shout out to Rudy he was the best and to managment they were amazing will be going back when we visit AZ again."}
{"text":"We orders a large werx to and a large half pepperoni and half Hawaiian with olives... omg! So damn Good! They showed out tonight!"}
{"text":"went with the family and placed my order. 2 pizzas and 20 wings. it wasn't that busy, after 30 minutes passed they called us up to only give us 1 pizza. they apologized and said the wings and the other pizza were not done yet. so we waited another 30 min and after they never callrd us, i went back and they forgot about our order a second time.   horrible service.   wings were cold and we still waiting for the second pizza.   go to another peter piper, management needs to pay attention or they need to be trained better. feels like they're practicing with the clients. maybe this is like one of those training centers for their employees."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken wings along with our pizza, I guess that gal up front didn't know that there fryer wasn't working... needless to say didn't get the wings... oh well.  The kids had fun, except for that one game that took our coins and didn't deliver the opportunity to play... did get a refund... will not be visiting this location anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Cardboard crust?  CHECK.  Sugary pizza sauce?  CHECK.  Screaming kids everywhere?  CHECK.  I give Peter Piper Pizza 5 stars because I was once a screaming kid.  My parents would bring me here for my birthday and I would bounce with excitement.  I ate the pizza and seriously thought to myself, \"It doesn't get any better than this.\"  My mom stacked the quarters on the table and I played midget skee-ball until I felt like I tore my rotator cuff.  The incessant dingdingdinging of the games grated my parents, but put me into a zen-like trance.  Sort of like old women at a casino.  Peter Piper Pizza was the stuff dreams were made of.  Now, I think it sucks.  But I'll be damned if I don't take my future kids there when I want them to stop bugging me for an hour.  Come and find me in a few years.  I'll be at the table, a stack of quarters in front of me and a big pitcher of beer in my hand."}
{"text":"I have a huge issue with this place we reserved tables for my step daughters birthday and we get there no big problem then I notice that the reservation said 2 pm to 330 pm which I called ahead of time like 2 weeks ago and said I need to reserve tables at 2 pm  to 4 pm I know its a half an hour but I put on the invitation 2 to 4 so most of the parents showed up around 4 to 430 which I could not help that but I was upset at the fact the manager tried to argue with me when I was never told they only do it for an hour in a half which is bull cause no one party can go for an hour an a half and have everything done in that amount of time. He said he would help us out but he was not so nice. He kept on telling me that they say that over the phone when I know they did not tell me that over the phone otherwise I would of figure something else out. Customer service stinks and it was not the cleanest. I will not go back to that location again,"}
{"text":"This place sucks! They give you only 1 hour and half to celebrate a kids party and than quick to kick you and your family out, for the next party. They have the WORST customer service, I would NOT  recommend this place for kid parties! Pizza was not all that great, sogy at the bottom of the crust! I will never return to this place AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and ordered breadsticks and a medium pepperoni. The breadsticks were very good! The pizza was a bit undercooked, but this location is new and they have time to fix this.  Love that there's free wifi and outlets!! Staff was friendly and everything was clean. Happy to finally have a Peter Piper in Laveen!"}
{"text":"I was eating at peter piper pizza with my family and I stepped on the carpet and got a glass in my foot no Bueno"}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be going back if I can help it.  I work with children and I wanted to pull my hair out at this place.  About 100 kids running around falling against each other.  No thank you!   Maybe it's my fault for going during dinner time on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I took a group of kids during our winter break to Peter Piper for a tour, pizza and games.  We arrived an hour before the restaurant opened so we were able to take a tour of their kitchen.  I'm not sure if the kids really thought this was interesting or not, at least the younger ones weren't so enthusiastic.  The older kids had a lot of great questions about the refrigerators, freezers and the pizza oven.  All of the kids LOVED the microphone.  Our host, Miguel was great with kids!  For this field trip each child received a small personal pizza and 10 tokens.  This was a great field trip that we will definitely take again in the future."}
{"text":"When I walked in was not even greeted after a few minute this young man that worked there came up and I asked him do I just sit down since I've never been there before he said yes I go to the buffet he's like you need to pay. And that's why I asked him, paid sat down and I was highly surprised to see everything pork and one cheese pizza and I don't eat pork. It's kinda sad they can't make one with chicken or ground beef and when asking the lady that worked there what was on the pizza, she said sausage not pork or beef just sausage. Lol no thanks even if I got to eat here free I would not. I'd rather do cicis  where they have non pork options. Or buy my own pizza 6.49 for just salad and one cheese pizza is not worth it."}
{"text":"OMG. Stay away. Far away. Incompetent employees. The cashier had no idea what day it was let alone operate a register. Had to repeat the order several times and she still couldn't get it right. Long story short, the manager and I use that term loosely, Bernadette was worse than the cashier. When I asked where my salad was after waiting 20 mins., she said, oh, I haven't made it yet. I have a million other things to do first. Really....you don't  have time to wait on your customer. Told her I wanted a complete refund. She refunds me for the salad only. What does COMPLETE mean. She was out of her element and the owner needs to hire more mature individuals instead of these giggling school girls."}
{"text":"Great place for fast lunch!!! The buffet is always stocked here! Keep it up! Easy to get in and out of."}
{"text":"I had my worst experience last night at this Peter Piper Pizza! Had walked in and waited about 5 minutes for someone to show up at the register, which I was okay with at first, I ordered a medium pan pepperoni pizza and 10 bone in wings, also went into the gaming area where about 7 machines didn't even work, so it became even more limited, then went to get the pizza which wasn't bad other then the fact it barely had pepperoni, and the wings looked and tasted like a week old, celery sticks tasted old and were soft not even crunchy, the worst part was that the floor was such a mess there was a hand full of people eating and lots of employees just standing around. I was in disgust last night. I might tell others not to come here ever, all I want is a refund for last night."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet. Always hit or miss. A lot had to do with the employees and people there. Sometimes the pizza is amazing and something I just eat a lot of salad. Bathroom didn't have napkins or toilet paper. A couple machines took my money and didn't turn on. Told someone and was told they would eventually get to it. Nothing happened. Overall ehhh but it's always a gamble anyways."}
{"text":"Well.. what started out as a fun evening with the kids turned into tears and frustration. They fell very behind with orders. After we had our pizza in the kids got to play their games we ordered a dessert pizza to end out of our night. It took them 45 minutes to get the first one out and when we got it it was raw. They told us they would get us one out in 8 minutes and it took another 20. My to-go order took an hour and 20 minutes. By then the kids were stir crazy and getting in trouble. They did give us some tokens near the end."}
{"text":"We normally love coming here with kids but this place has gone DOWN! It's so incredibly dirty there!! Trash everywhere and majority of the games were all broken or stole our tickets & only gave 1-2 tickets! The pizza was average this time around, seemed a little under cooked.   The prize gal was wonderful there and very nice to the kids. CLEAN UP THE TRASH!!"}
{"text":"Ordering dinner for my kids and the cashier gave my food to the wrong person and you want $15 hour (are you crazy).  This place is dirty and the staff needs training on customer service. Now I see why I hate coming here."}
{"text":"This PPP sucks!!!! Placed on hold 15 mins (the drive) to order a carry out pizza. When arrived establishment was empty for these employees to simply not be able to place phone orders. Either hire more employees or hire someone with better customer service skills. Shame."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a bad review but honestly this was Worst experience ever i took my family here none of the staff knew what they were doing not even the manager i order breadsticks with my pizza my pizza was ready after 20-30 mins and my breadsticks were ready right when i was leaving... remind you i was there for a little over an hour. i didn't even grab them off the counter that how upset i was. I won't be returning to this peter piper. Hopefully you read this review and take action on this location"}
{"text":"The pizza is good; especially the deep dish. The service was quick and friendly. The game room is small. Most of the machines take two tokens or one. Not too expensive. However, several of the machines don't give out the accurate amount of tickets. At least half of the machines I played on gave me less tickets than I actually won. Also, the employees coordinated a game of musical chairs. They let some tall, older teenagers in on the game. My nieces who are five and seven were almost crushed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Peter Piper. I am from California and it immediately reminded me of a Shakey's pizza.  The cashiers name was Apple and she was really friendly and helpful.   My friend and I ordered the regular boneless mild buffalo wings and a regular cheese pizza.The wings weren't that good enough for us to want to get it again but they where okay. The pizza took a while and there wasn't really that many people there. The games give you a chance to burn of some of your waiting time.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Service here is alright, it has definitely gotten better. The pizza is always so great though!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so you don't come here for amazing pizza.  And if you're over 12, you don't come here for the games and prizes.   But when you're feeling pizza, that's not a Hot-and-Ready or one that'll cost you almost $25, you come here.   I admit, I have fond memories of coming to Peter Piper as a kid. I loved it! Over the years, I've been here a handful of times and it's always just as I remembered.  Loud. Full of screaming kids. Tired parents who brought their kids here to shut them up.  Some people say their pizza crust taste like cardboard. But I disagree. My wife, mom and sis came here the other day just because we were in the mood for some cheap food but something we haven't had in awhile.   We come here and order our food. It was graduation night or something because I saw a lot of kids dressed in what looked like prom dresses with balloons at their table that said \"Congrats\"! Probabaly 8th graders.   Anyway, those large parties were the reason our two pizzas took almost 40 minutes to be made.   We got them. They tasted just as you would expect them to. Definitely not amazing. But not bad either.  It tasted like, well, it tasted like...childhood."}
{"text":"2nd of 3 kids birthday parties this weekend.  What a marathon.  Token games are fun though, feels like Vegas for 5 year olds."}
{"text":"Just went for there Buffet.. I think everyone had the same idea today place was packed.. Anyways... Has to wait 10 min in line to get pizza and was only able to 4 slices for 3 of us.. Once i got through i had th then go back in line and tey to get more.. At around 145 pm (buffet ends at 2) the manager told his employee not to send out anymore pizza.. What.. With a line of people waiting i couldn't believe what i was hereing.. Well they made a few more and that was it.. I was able to get 3 slices of dessert pizza and that was it.. Need to have a better system for buffet especially on a Holiday when you know it will be busy.. Maybe more employees or have a better system of making pizza.. Maybe use both ovens instead of one for starters.. If you need any other ideas let me know....."}
{"text":"This is my second bad experience here! I only come because it is close to my house. I was coming from the target on 24th st and Baseline and called in an order for pickup. I was put on hold for about 20-25 minutes. I was on hold so long that I made it to the restaurant and was still on hold. They apologized and gave me 10% off. I asked for extra cheese on my pepperoni pizza and there was no extra cheese!! Very poor service, I would rate it 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Pizza is always fresh and crispy and made on the spot. Always enjoy my time here and get the kid in me out when I head over to the video games after munching down.   Good place, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet only to find little black hairs on all of our plates! Mind you, everyone with me had blonde long hair so there was not chance of it being any of our own. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I been coming here since they opened and my son loves playing the games and some pizza, it's clean in there most of the workers are friendly but the manager Davison or David is not friendly or seem to be a people person, walks around doing nothing while lines get long, rude to customers when they come let him know they did not get their order back right, does not greet anyone at all. The way he comes off as if he doesn't want to be at work so why even work there."}
{"text":"My son liked this place. It's a smaller, less crowded version of Chuck E. Cheese. They had a great family deal with pizza, drinks and tokens for $20. You definitely can't beat that. I ended up buying more tokens but they had affordable token packages. Customer service was also good. This is a good place to take the kids on the weekends and you don't have to worry about breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to come on a Saturday night but I'm so impressed with the service and how clean it is. We got our food in a very reasonable time and the customer service was excellent! I will be coming back to this location most definitely."}
{"text":"Ok if you like a place to take the kids to have a party or play games this is the place for you.  Not as great as a chucky cheese but big enough to host a party of kids.  The pizza was mediocre at best.  And really the salad came in a pre portioned bowl like fast food.  Quite a disappointment really.  First time there and probably the last unless we take kids with us.  It was edible and proably up to par for children but just not that great reaslly"}
{"text":"Bad service manager is rude no cherry dessert pizza taking bffet down before it's even over!?!"}
{"text":"This location has gone way down hill. We came here for the lunch buffet and the staff was unable to keep with the demand for pizza. Beyond the lack of pizza was the fact that the pizza that was out on the buffet was not good.  We've had a few questionable experiences and probably won't be back at this point. Plenty of other pizza options in this area so I would skip this place."}
{"text":"People think I'm crazy when I say PPP is my favorite pizza. No lie... I love this place! Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Great place to have a party. Been coming here for a while. They have lots of room and chairs and tables.   They also have games. It's like a Chuck E. Cheese but different name and different pizza taste.   The pizzas are good & so are the wings.   You get more tokens at the register then the machine.   They got some deals in store & online."}
{"text":"We frequent this location quite often since we live in the area and are always very pleased with the service and pizza! And let's be honest, who doesn't love playing games while having pizza. On our last visit we encountered an issue, which was strange as this location has never caused any grief on other visits. That said, the manager took the time to reach out to me personally and went above and beyond to make things right. That alone is worth the review, as this location and organization as a whole definitely takes customer satisfaction seriously. I can't say enough about the manager (Lucy) that took care of  things. She's an asset to the organization."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place is back!!! Peter Piper over Chuck E Cheese any day ! Why? Because the food is a thousand times better I can actually enjoy a piece of pizza while my kids play..... there isn't as many games as Chuck E. Cheese but the food being better just makes it better! Perfect location for us as well as all the Chuck E. Cheese are in the out skirts not one central."}
{"text":"The old PPP was better and that is not saying much.  The pizza was at least properly cooked, but staff was too lazy to even take it to my table.  Which is fine, but do not call me over to come get it and hand me hot pizza pan with nothing to properly hold it but two paper plates to grip it.  The game room was just sad almost every game took two tokens or more to play and the gifts were rediculously pricey when you usually get 8 tickets per 2 tokens.  Come on this is the best they can do when they have competition like John's Incredible Pizza and Chucky Cheese to go against.  Might as well close shop now.  I do not even know why they came back to Las Vegas.  Oh and if you go there for just the pizza, burn your taste buds!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I are regular customers here whenever we have any kiddo's occasional celebration. They have many games and a huge slide for the kids to play. I also love the pineapple pizza and bread-sticks. Remember to buy coins at the cashier counter for a better deal."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I've been to one another PPP and it was huge! This location was surprisingly small, I wonder what made them decide that since it's near a big city. But oh well, we went around 8 and there was single groups so wasn't crowded. Except for these two children that kept running around, jumping on benches and even nudged my mother in law. Control your children!  The food was good. We got breadsticks and was delish. But the marinara sauce tasted different, I think like spaghetti sauce. It was odd. We also got the spicy buffalo wings and man was it hot! Well for me anyway. We ordered two medium \"The Werx\" thinking it was small and had little slices, it actually had 10 slices and bigger than we thought. Again, that sauce was odd on the pizza.  The other problem was the prices, man was it expensive.  We're visiting from New Mexico so I wouldn't return to this location just because the prices and they're marinara sauce."}
{"text":"Went here with our baseball team and everyone got sick. Do you know how hard it is for people to watch their kids play games when they have to crap their pants every 15 min???  The restaurant itself is pretty messy not kept up throughout the day.."}
{"text":"We went here two days in a row while family was in town. The manager here is very friendly, we liked him a lot. The facility is clean (aside from people that don't clear their tables themselves like you're supposed to). We will definitely be frequenting!"}
{"text":"Super yummy buffet for Jacobson elementary's early release eat out event.  Kids had a blast, while adults got to sit back and enjoy pizza, salad, breadsticks and dessert for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party about two weeks ago. It was very clean and the kids that were there looked to be having a good time. I do wish there was more games at this location and more things towards toddlers but I can understand it being a bit smaller then other Peter Pipers I seen.  Pizza was really good and the token packages are a good value."}
{"text":"I thought my husband was nuts wanting to go to a kids pizza place since we don't have kids. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad. There's seating away from the little humans/game area. The thin crust pizza was much better than expected. He thought the garlic cheese bread wasn't bad. It was thick and doughy. I can't comment in that since I'm not a doughy bread or garlic lover. Price was reasonable and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"So sad to see this place that I loved so much as a kid turn into what it is now... First off the atmosphere just has a boring blah feeling to it. It's very plain and boring. Second off, the most IMPORTANT thing is what the heck happened to their pizza! Where did the ovens go?????? Now they have conveyor type belts spitting out this nasty pizzas! Omg. What a huge disappointment. Very very sad. Glad I have my childhood memories and experiences to grasp on to. Because I'd rather pay their prices for some real pizza! Some good pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since they open years ago. Always good and always clean. I never had there lunch buffet because we always order to go and get the special with pepperoni and 2 liters of Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"Games are fun and pizza is pretty good. People are nice. But the machines tend to eat your coins and be out of tickets a lot."}
{"text":"worse service and pizza paid for i order here every week my kids love the pizza i called to place order and always stated i i order online i would get my pizza faster not the case i ordered online tongiht still waited and got half a pizza with no sauce or toppings.. horrible service since there remodel.. i will not visit this location again I called to talk to a manager and was on hold for 25 minutes to get disconnected. I will call back"}
{"text":"This, like similar places, is a crazy-kid free-for-all.  It's dirty and has a gross smell inside. And it's lacking the child safety wristbands to ensure that child A in fact leaves with Adult A (so many of these places now have some degree of safety in place with so many kids running everywhere).  As far as kids' entertainment goes, Peter Piper Locations are a bit small and rundown compared to other options that offer WAY more for similar or only slightly more money.  These options include Makutu's Island, Amazing Jake's, Dave and Buster's, and GameWorks.  Honestly, Peter Piper's is scuzzy and I'm not sure how it survives.  I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because - despite my reviews - my kids still want to come here so they can trade 2000 tickets for fake vampire teeth."}
{"text":"After eating in this place on 10/12/17 my children and I got sick immediately with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Aa of 10/27/17 we finally found out we got parasites  called Cryptosporidium. This comes from contaminated feces. We were all just fine until going to Peter Piper Pizza. So basically someone there has parasites and isn't washing their hands at all or properly and got it on the food. I lost my job due to missing work in training because of how sick we got.   I told them 10/30/17  I was reporting this to the County Health  Dept. The DM of Peter Piper, named  Mark let me know it wouldn't matter because all of the ingredients  from that day were gone!  So Peter Piper Pizza  is handing out parasites and no one seems to care!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat pizza! I can eat here everyday it is so good lol. The staff is very friendly and they have even donated meals to a few causes my family and I worked on so we really appreciate the staff here. Toniann and I believe her name is Kristen are the best managers there and always so helpful. If you have never eaten here you have no idea what your missing and now I am craving some pizza so I think I will be heading over there tonight so tootles for now."}
{"text":"Ok normally this place is on point for me. It's usually one of my favorite locations for the best Peter Piper Pizza but I was disappointed this time. I went in and had dinner with the bestie and decided I wanted to take a personal size pizza home with me for the next day. What can I say I am a Peter Piper Pizza addict :). Well I took my pizza out the next day to eat it and I was beyond irritated. The jerk who cooked my pizza burned it and didn't bother to tell me. It was so bitter and nasty. I seriously hope someone get some new training on the oven.   Updated Star Rating & Review    Update: Things here have improved greatly. I have been back a few times and have had NO issues. The food has been great and service was wonderful. Still my favorite location even though it's a drive. Thank You Mark"}
{"text":"I would not even give this a start if i could do that  This place was crap when my children where younger and it is still CRAP the food is ok for the price you pay but the employees really don't really care about anything no pride in a job anymore just making a buck  They have a really nice \"not sure if she is a manager or nit\" but she has light red hair she is nce and kind  BATHROOMS for women's at least are awful the somewhat walls that devide the stalls are hanging from the screws in the walls all doors dont lock right if even at all only one soap dispencer has soap and get it while you can  Really all \"PETER PIPERS\" cars about is having a place to take the money from parents who are hopping for a some what kinds of fun place for their children .... I do remember my child's  first party at a piter piper price was nice for a single mom  but now it is just a cheap pizza place Costco's is better and if you are going to spend 24.00 on a large pizza and one order  of bread sticks better go try #RedDevil they are the best around   That places remembers your blood type it is so amazing Red Devil"}
{"text":"Love the customer service! Ana was awesome! Came here aug 2 2017. She should be acknowledged for her great work."}
{"text":"This is the best chain/commercial pizza place in town. Pizza Hut, Dominoes,Papa Johns cannot hold a pizza flipper to this place. However, this location is small and does not have very many games to choose from. But that's not why I come here the pizza is good and the ranch is super good as well."}
{"text":"We set up a VIP package for our sons 2nd birthday online.  When we got there no party was set up. They said we only ordered tables  So they scrambled to put together a\"VIP\" party which it was not .  So we went to Peter Piper Pizza the next day to talk to the manager about our not so VIP party. And our experience with her is why I'm writing this review.  Brandi the manager was very apologetic about our party and offered to make it up to us with another little party for our immediate family on them.  That was very nice of her and we feel much better about our bad experience.  She was great in rectifying the situation.  Thank you Brandi"}
{"text":"The pizza is way too runny. Definitely not enough cheese.   The wifi is also horrible. Why advertise free WiFi if it's unsable?"}
{"text":"Nicely remodeled, good pizza, and clean facility. No complaints at all.  There's always a good time with the games also. We will return to ppp anytime we can and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"New cashier at this location was awesome she gave really good customer service and made sure my pizza was exact the way I want it. Forgot her name but her name tag said Hollywood CA"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Peter Piper and have enjoyed this facility for years. Surprised I haven't YELP'd it before now but I guess it just never struck me to do so.   Great games that are always working. Easy for the littler ones to get tickets for the toys that you could buy in the dollar store but end up spending $20 to get...but I digress.   Pizza is addictive. I CRAVE the California Veggie which is my favorite and although it doesn't always fit in my diet plans, I do try to have it about once a month.  I've also had the wings, salads, and even the soft serve ice cream. All is very good.  I've been to birthday parties here, held meetings here, and even had fundraisers here all with lots of success. This Peter Piper is very good to the community as well offering plenty of donations and opportunities to reward kids in schools.    The staff here is friendly and nice. The management is helpful and eager to please.  All around 5 star location."}
{"text":"I've been eating Peter Piper Pizza since my childhood and I love the sauce and crispy crust. It's nothing gourmet but it's tasty, satisfying, and inexpensive so I like to get carryout from here. The process of getting it is the big hurdle. No matter what time you call, you're likely to be put on hold (usually you never come off hold, I've waited up to 10 minutes before giving up), the CSR will be distracted most of the time and confused the rest. Going into the store will involve waiting for large groups of families deciding between various combinations of pizza and usually someone jumping ahead of you to ask for something random like an extra cup. If you've ordered online, there's a 90% chance that there's been some miscommunication between the ordering system and the employees-- most commonly I've been asked if I wanted cheese on my pizza. If you make it through all of this, they at least usually manage to get your order right and your food will be good. There's just no attention paid to training or customer service. These places are (under)staffed by teenagers who don't care and the managers aren't much better.   This location is crowded, loud, and messy but that's to be expected of a chain that specializes in entertaining families. What I don't expect is consistently subpar customer service."}
{"text":"Just got off the phone with Megan Leos who was very defensive, rude, and disrespectful to me. I wanted their special of the 2 XL pizzas which come with one topping each. I wanted 1 pizza with just cheese and the other with the 2 toppings. Megan stated that she would have to charge me for the other topping. She explained that one topping counts with extra cheese. I told her I didn't want extra cheese. She said well that cheese counts as a topping. I think she is confused. I explained that I do this all the time when ordering pizza here and that she has record of that. She then began to argue with me and talked over me. I simply told her that her employees honor this all the time for me and she is the first to tell me  no. I asked for her district supervisors number and she gave me a sigh and snotty attitude while giving it to me. I called Tammy immediately. For those with problems with this supervisor please contact Tammy at 480-609-6471.. Save yourself the headache and go with a responsibly priced pizza at Pizza Hut. Awaiting a response. Will not be coming back after 4 years of coming here."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's fine.  It is birthday party hell all the time.  But I'm not a fan of kids parties and unsupervised children running my kid over."}
{"text":"I'm probably never ever going back to this place. While it's enticing to come here and play in their arcade, it's crawling with unattended, screaming, bratty, little children.   Large space to host a party/fundraisers but not well maintained. My family had to switch to three different tables because the first two were I wiped and had crumbs/sauce stains.   They had a large selection of soda choices (coke products) as well as multiple beers on tap. Parm cheese, chili peppers, Sriracha sauces readily available on their counter along with a fully stocked utensil bin.   As for entertainment, there are multiple TVs on their wall (half playing sports and the other half cartoons). The staff  hosts games like musical chairs for the kinds every so often and gives them coins as prices.   As for the food, it's pretty ordinary. I ordered the Chicago style pizza ... while I'm not sure what Chicago pizza is like, the pizza we ate tasted like something I could have gotten from that $5 ready pizza place except I paid $15 for it. Not recommended. It was bland and I probably could have made one better.   It's really disappointing that this place isn't as good as I hoped it would be. Huge place and pretty blah. You're better off going to Cicis. At least there you can have buffet style for more choices."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and they have an employee in front of me wiping tables down with his pants below his rear end. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Not the same Peter Piper Pizza I grew up on. Ordered pickup for extra cheese extra pep and I didn't even get regular cheese. There was no one one in the place or in the parking lot, it's 10pm they don't close till 11. I'm like cool. It's like the workers took absolute no pride in making a pizza that someone else paid for. Total half ass, more like quarter ass job.. The job they did does surely reflect real poorly on the attitude taken on by the employees. Very disappointed, I will make sure not to order one here ever again and notify corporate."}
{"text":"The customer service is top notch  We took my son out for his birthday and they gave him a balloon made him feel special  The pizza is so yummy for a kids place  The manager Anissa is so pleasant and asked how everything was we couldn't be more pleased We are regulars for the lunch buffet even without the kids it's a very good deal"}
{"text":"Burnt cheese over seasoned with salt super salty too much sauce salad dressing no good 25$ pizza and salad inedible I would like my money back but less hassle to never go back there"}
{"text":"We had to ask the staff  to cook the pizza more because some of the dough was uncooked. Not many costumers here at the moment and the place is really messy.  Tables need to be cleaned and the floors swept. I really enjoy peter piper pizza, but I really don't like this location."}
{"text":"Pizza was good as usual. It tasted like we expected it to. I wish I can keep this review simple and short, but Yelp is forcing me to write more, and so I am."}
{"text":"I love coming to Peter Piper Pizza at lunch time.  I love their salads.  The pizza is great too.  The people who work there (baseline and mcclintock) are always very friendly.  Reasonable cost for what you get."}
{"text":"Super Boring & Lame! 1st off they have like 15 games to play thats it, the wait for the pizza was literally over 30 minutes and there was like no one there. 2nd, why tf are there games 2 tokens? And the best ones weren't working. Most def will not be back unless I want to pick up a pizza, otherwise dont waste your time bringing your kids here..what a snooze fest!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!! No cold glasses with a pitcher of beer. Manager told me they are for people drinking single beers but there was no one using them. Having two IDs isn't good enough for two cups either. My wife was at the table with the kids but still had to come over to get two cups. I just wanted to drink a few beers with my pizza after a long day of work but this place makes everything so difficult!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza would be great... If they only took the time to finish cooking it :/ Walking thru the halls of this place to get to the games area, all you see on the tables are unfinished left overs, at times half-pizzas just right below the crunched-up napkins. So that tells you people don't come here for the pizza.... But they should, because theyq are generous with the toppings & cheese, and in my personal opinion is pretty good. The stars off is because I asked for well-done pizza, but my pizza came out almost white.... With no'done' look at all, and when I reminded them that it needed more cooking they tell me \"that's well-done!\" I didn't laugh because I have a hungry kid waiting on the table and at this point this is not funny. But after the pizza came out later it looked much better and tasted great! So if they only knew... all you need to do is cook your pizza Peter!"}
{"text":"We've been to lots of Peter Piper Pizzas being that we have young kids and this is the Bday party hotspot. The other night we went here after a final t-ball game. Granted it was a Tuesday night and they likely weren't expecting 10 families to stroll in.   However, the food took FOREVER to cook and many of the games did not work. We had one family wait over an hour for their food. We brought a lot of business, but not so much that they couldn't cook a pizza on time"}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza delivers adult comfort food, and fun for the kids all at an affordable price. The pizza wasn't bad at all. Really loving their new recipe. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"A great place to take the kids that will not break you.  With all of the kids and parties going on, the place is always clean and the food comes out pretty fast.  It is not the greatest pizza, but the kids love it and they love you even more for taking them to PPP!"}
{"text":"The pizza is barely palatable.  They have a great price on the lunch buffet though and I really enjoy the Asian Salad (only available every other week)."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and descent price. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all and it was very clean."}
{"text":"Well, we were the only customers here at 10:30pm for a late night craving. Service was prompt and friendly. It was great that the staff made us feel comfortable enough to chillax for the night chompin' on pizza.   My small pepperoni was your typical pizza from Peter Piper. Dough was good with a floury crust and the cheese oozed stringy goodness. It  had an extra later of grease on top - that's the not so good part. It also tasted \"rubbery and chewy\" in its typical fast-pizza fashion.   Not great but not bad either. It's a good fix when you want to pop in and out for cheap late night pizza. Hit the spot and the rest is forgettable. Done deal."}
{"text":"Always great fun to have a party here. Have had more then a few birthdays for my kids here, and every time it's a blast for them. If you want a table on weekends for a party come right when they open, most likely all the long tables will be taken, but I always find that there are enough tables for my party if I come when they open. Pizza is just pizza, but it's the fun that matters."}
{"text":"So I drive by this place a few times a week, and after seeing their cheesy commercials I've decided to give this place a try. I would not recommend their pizza at all. I had the California Pizza which includes your typical pizza veggies, and I have to say...NO FLAVOR at ALL!!! Even with added salt and pepper..no flavor!!! This was the first time coming here after being in AZ for 2 years...and will be my LAST!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, the friendliest employees. This place is really managed well. The lunch buffet is $6!!! What a deal. I'm vegan and the only thing I could eat in the buffet was the mandarin salad. Then the staff offered to make me the veggie harvest pizza... vegan style!!! It was loaded with yummy veggies and the sauce tasted great! They even put the whole pizza in a box for me to take home. Wonderful staff, fun atmosphere, and delicious food! 100% recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered an XL pizza for carry out. Once I got home the pizza was super dry and over cooked. Called back to speak with manager, the general manager George intercepted the call. He was extremely rude and argumentative. He kept trying to explain PPP policy to me. I simply wanted another pizza. By the end of the call I just requested my money back. He continued to be rude and disrespectful. He most definitely does not represent great customer service. I will be calling the corporate office and suggesting he goes back to proper customer service training. I've been a PPP customer most of my life and the jerk made me never want to return..."}
{"text":"My family and I will never go back to this location again.  We went to this Peter Piper this evening for our kids' school PTO fundraiser.  We ordered and found a table while waiting for our pizza.  We waited a while to get our order but we figured they were busy with all the people for the fundraiser.  When we finally got called to pick up our order, they gave us the wrong pizza.  Apparently, they had given our pizza to another customer and had to remake our pizza.  No big deal - stuff happens. The reason for this one star review happened after our meal.  A Peter Piper employee named Charles comes up to our table and accuses  my husband of stealing pizzas.  Huh??? Charles then begins to explain that he reviewed the camera footage and saw my husband taking 2 pizzas and then coming back to take another pizza.  My husband definitely did not steal any pizzas.  IF we were to steal pizza 1) we would not stay in the restaurant to eat it and get caught 2) the stolen pizzas would be on our table - which only had the single pizza that we ordered and 3) we certainly wouldn't be stealing pizzas during our kids' PTO fundraiser. After we explained all this to Charles, he then says, \"Well, if you want to deny it and steal food, that's on you.  Have a nice evening.\" Needless to say, we are beyond angry at how we were treated.  We will definitely be filing a complaint with the General Manager and advising the school's PTO to not hold fundraisers at this location again."}
{"text":"First, a little background.  I'm in my late 40s now, and I have been going to Peter Piper since I was 8.  It has been my favorite pizza, and a lot of good memories are tied up in this company.    The Riverview location has had mixed results for years now.  The product is generally good, but the staff from the management down is not able to get a grip on service that is up and down, but generally rates near the lousy point.  In my review today, I take on a consistent issue and that's with phoning in orders and being left on hold until I just decide to hang up and retry.  This usually means holds of 5 minutes or longer - just to order a pizza.  When I called to talk to a manager about this issue, the manager on duty only proffered excuses (we're shorthanded, we have other people taking calls, etc).  No solutions, only excuses.  When I vented to this about the manager, I got \"I am not trying to make excuses ...\" but no honest apology or solution offered.    Trying to leave a message to corporate on the web site only gave the result \"We're not taking surveys at this time\".  An earlier negative review I left on Google regarding the store on 40th street and Thomas resulted in a corporate response on Google asking me to contact them to make that right.  When I did, I never heard back.  Corporate is completely unresponsive, they do not care about their customers at all.  Brand loyalty is garnered by consistently delivering a fantastic product and service over time.  Peter Piper holds a special place in my heart going back 40 years.  Over the last two years, consistently terrible service runs the risk of destroying the good will the company has built with me.  You guys are failing to deliver on multiple fronts.  Your company's failure is not far behind, unless you turn around and start delivering the product and service you used to, the service that reminds me of Tony's waving me \"Come on over\".  Tony Cavolo is rolling in his grave at what has become of the company he started.  I am not expecting the company to respond to this.  Surprise me!

{"text":"This was our first time at a PPP... I was a bit hesitant to visit this location due to previous reviews.  We had the lunch buffet- garlic bread, 3 different salads and about 6 different pizzas to choose from along with 2 different dessert pizzas. The food was good- pizza, salad and garlic bread. The salads were all pre made and tossed with dressing.  One con is the service.. extremely slow and not customer service oriented at all."}
{"text":"Every time you give them a chance, they always end up ruining it. Horrible customer service and horrible management. Last time ever ordering from Peter piper."}
{"text":"Need more staff, it's Friday. Bull sh*t service called in order at 6, now 6:45 and still not ready. F*cking bullsh*t"}
{"text":"Took our son to another kids birthday party here.  I would have never went if I knew they didn't like people to conceal carry.  Which by the way is not against the law to carry your gun in.  They can have you trespassed which is a misdemeanor.  Games are way over priced.  I was at a competitors a week before.  Playing deal or no deal.  It only cost one token.  Peter piper is 4 tokens.  The exact same game.  We had a large pepperoni.   15.00 dollars very over priced.  I will say the pizza was good for a place that uses sub par ingredients.          To summarize they don't support Second amendment rights, games way over priced, pizza over priced.       Pros it was clean, pizza tasted okay."}
{"text":"Brought my son and his friend here  to hang out. They seemed to love this place. Pizza was ookkk.. nothing special. The staff was very nice . Always cleaning."}
{"text":"I went to the one on s. eastern and I had a great experience. the place is very roomy they have a lot of tables you don't feel cramped like other places the costumer service was outstanding.  The kids had a lot of fun since they have a lot of games  we ordered a large cheese pizza and chicken Alfredo gluten free pizza it was very good I will defenetly go back for my niece's birthday. I highly recommend this place to any one"}
{"text":"This location is the WORST! I love 3p's pizza but I can't stand this location. If you complain about the service to a manger they will tell you flat out that you are wrong!"}
{"text":"This location is the best in the state! The management is super friendly and the staff is hard working!"}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza at this location is legit as it is huge but with all the space you think they would enlarge their gaming area as there was too much seating but maybe they have lots of parties I don't know but this is definitely one of the bigger Peter Piper Pizza's in Phoenix.  We scored a great deal 2 Lg Pizzas and 8 breadsticks for just $19.99 this location also has pizza buffet from like 11AM to 3PM Mon-Fri."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who's idea it was to have 90% dining tables and 10% games but the ratio is definitely off. I was looking forward to this place opening as I loved the old Peter Piper Pizza as a kid and i was definitely let down. The arcade room is the smallest i've seen and the vast dining space was empty on a Saturday night. I didn't even bother trying the pizza because the whole place just felt sad. If you're an adult go to D&B's or GameWorks, if you have kids stick to Chuck E. Cheese's."}
{"text":"Don't know what's in their pizza but it makes it a great one! The only thing I have to complain about is people not watching their children while in there. Kids were running around and toddlers kept going into the kitchen! They should have more strict rules about parents watching their children but would some parents listen???!!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our three year old son's birthday party at this location today and had a great experience. Our party host was Skylynn and she was wonderful about taking care of our requests in a timely fashion. She was also very friendly. My only gripe about my experience is that it would've been nice if tokens had been ready for us when we got there along with cups, as I had several impatient toddlers with my party. All in all, it was a very good experience and we were very happy. We'll come back here, whether or not it's for a party. Very decent price. I just wish they had more coupons!"}
{"text":"So I placed my normal order today, large pizza, 2 orders of breadsticks, cinnamon dessert, and a kids wings for a total of about $35! Here's why I won't go back! my daughter likes bone-in wings and the kids meal is boneless wings. In the past I've asked for the kids meal to be bone-in and it has never been an issue. Mangers have taken care of my request. Today was a different story. I was told that they could not accommodate my request. The reason was that the price for bone in wings was slightly higher. I told the young lady taking my order that I'm willing to pay extra for the bone in wings. She mentioned that she needed the get manger approval. ...please keep in mind that I never had this issue before with this request.. I spoke with the manager and she restated that the cost of 5 bone in wings was higher than 5 boneless wings. She offered to do this, but it will be the last time. Let's see if this really makes business sense; guy would like 5 bone in wings, not 20, just 5! guys total order is over $30 dollars and he's a repeat customer. PPP, it's simple math and not to mention good service. With so many pizza businesses it's very easy to go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Ordered through doordash & after waiting 90 minutes the pizza was TERRIBLE. I normally love peter piper's pizza & was so disappointed to receive what tasted like cold sauce on cardboard."}
{"text":"Only came here because my 2 year old likes to run around and loves pizza. Service was awful, most of the booths were dirty. This particular location also had sheriffs on Fridays and Saturdays for a while due to the stellar guests it attracts from the area. Not sure if that's still the case. Pizza was eh...as what's expected from a place like this. I would rather grab a pizza from somewhere else and take my kid to the park across the street."}
{"text":"Pizza really socked tonight was over cooked very little cheese on it.  Lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out."}
{"text":"So it's 6:15pm on a Tuesday evening and we ordered an x-large works pizza and 2 small drinks, which are refillable. I asked the young man at the counter if we can substitute bacon for ham. He told me yes, then tried to up-charge me for the bacon without mentioning a charge to me. The drinks are literally half the size of any small drink anywhere, about 3 inches tall (child size), yet cost over $2.00 each. Then the pizza comes, barely cooked and the cheese is not even completely melted yet. Barely any toppings, yet cost $18.99. Sardella's and even Little Caesar's taste a hell of a lot better and cost less! The kicker was when we sat down to wait over 1/2 hr for the pizza, the TV SHOW were all in Spanish. I looked around and all 8 tables around me were not Spanish. I asked a young lady employee if all the TV SHOW were in Spanish and she looked insulted and said she could change it for me. I simply said this is America, and I would think that the majority of Tvs would be in English. She said there are a lot of Spanish speaking guests that come there (which is not particularly evident tonight) but that wasn't the point. I have no problem with TVS in Spanish, but it would be nice to have one in English while I wait too long for my crappie, over-priced and undercooked pizza and my childlike  $2+ dollar drink.  Definitely don't recommend THIS particular Peter Piper Pizza, which I used to really love. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Got a large Chicago Pizza to go. It was hot and ready for pickup and was great. Can't wait for my next one."}
{"text":"The staff were very out going and extra friendly and helpful. We placed or should say thought we placed our order on line but forgot to hit submit. When we got there they had no order. The manager(a guy) new right away what happened and took care of us giving us the on line deal and rushed are pizza right in. The pizza was perfect made to order and perfect. The inside and out side was very clean. The game room was also spotless."}
{"text":"place is dirty smells staff are rude. placed a phone order walked in and was shocked by how it looked inside. I walked up to the counter and someone slicing the pizza sneezed and kept cutting pizza. I started to walk off and was asked if I needed something? I said \"No not now. I placed a order but after seeing someone sneezing and cutting pizza I don't want to eat here.\" I was told well you still need to pay for it we made it so you have to buy it! I walked out and a manger called and told me I need to come back and get my pizza or I could never order a pizza from another Peter Piper Pizza again!!! I hung up and they called back I refused to answer the phone."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great service and Delicious food, look no further!! This Peter Piper Pizza is quick and everyone is friendly!! Miguel is awesome! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible salads , certainly not fresh. Pizza was alright but what saved the trip overall was the nice customer service"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars exclusively because I have been other times and it has never been absolutely terrible, as it was on my last visit. If you are going to work at Peter Piper you should at least have an iota of patience when it comes to kids. The girl at the prize counter said out loud as children were waiting to get their prizes \"This job is literally the worst.\" And rolled her eyes as another kid asked for a prize.   Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was good but then we ordered ice cream- tony not only didn't turn the machine back to run but helped everyone else in line before even looking at the machine. Sad to not get ice cream because it was going to be another 5 minutes for the machine to wake up and freeze over again. Ugh. Sad... Plus tons of people that don't seem to be the respectable kind- if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"I will never come to this establishment again! Bringing my family here was supposed to be fun for us but instead it ended up being such a huge embarrassment. We walked in today, the restaurant was busy which I didn't mind I mean it's peter piper so who doesn't want to come here right? We ordered our food and while we were waiting I decided to go to the restroom. The restroom was filthy, toilet paper on the floor 2 of the stalls were over flowing, there was no toilet paper in any of them and there was soap spread on the counters. Now while I realize that some of these things are out of their control we do have to realize that it is their responsibility to keep everything clean in their restrooms. Back to my experience, we waited patiently for our food, when the buzzard thing went off I went to go pick up the pizza and instead of someone handing the pizza to me which was sitting at the edge of the table the gentleman close by simply gave me an attitude and said that's you.. no common courtesy to hand me anything just simply that's you and walked away. I figured no big deal right? So our second buzzard went off for us to go pick up the wings that we had ordered as we go up the lady ignores my son who was trying to grab the wings. The \"manager\" wasn't paying any attention to who was grabbing what and so some idiot grabbed our food instead. The \"manager\" looked at us confused as though it was us who took the wings and were trying to accuse us of trying to get more than what we paid for which was ridiculous.... we walked them over to our table to \"prove\" to them that we didn't steal anything and to have them make a new order for us.... RIDICULOUS!!! We finally had gotten our food and the evening went fine after that but with my experience I will NEVER return! I am disgusted by this place!"}
{"text":"This has been my 5 year old's favorite place to have his birthday (We've had 3 of his parties at this location). We will NEVER have another party here, let alone take him back. Multiple times my guests and I had to go to the manager to get tickets from games either because they wouldn't dispense them or they had run out. Every time the manager acted annoyed - I think his name was Gerry or Gary, I wish I would've paid attention. The cashier took FOREVER to get orders put in and collect payment for them. My mom waited in line behind three people for THIRTY minutes to order pizza, beer and tokens. Then the same cashier had the audacity to come over 15 minutes before our time slot was up and tell me she needed the table right then. We took our time and let my son finish opening his gifts since we had to wait the whole first hour to order our food and then have it come out. I couldn't believe the attitude of the employees or the condition of the games I.e. most 2-player games only worked on one side or in 1-player mode, ticket issues mentioned above, cleanliness, etc. I will be contacting corporate directly regarding our experience considering we've spent an ungodly amount of money there."}
{"text":"Customer service was RIDICULOUS and when trying to order a stuffed crust pizza, something I order almost every time I visit, I was told they don't make that. Like WTF?! I've ordered that several times. When asked to double check with someone else they said \"nope\". Was also told \"they have never made that\". Amazing how nobody knows how to do there job. Sad when a popular franchise is going to shit cuz nobody knows how to do there fucking job or simply don't want to do there job. FIRED PIE IT IS!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and very friendly staff... given the location, I had always assumed this would be a trashier location, but to my pleasant surprise it is one of the nicest, cleanest, and most friendly PPP's I've ever been to. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch when I'm really hungry. My last review mentioned how they never get the toppings right on special order pizzas. That problem has been thankfully corrected. Peter Piper is not the world's greatest pizza but it's certainly passable when you consider that you're paying about $7.40 for all you can eat pizza and all you can drink soft drinks. A great relaxing place to have a fairly inexpensive lunch when you consider a lot of places are approaching the $10 mark. Avoid Tuesday's in the Summer because that's when all the summer camp kids take over.  Now that I'm a regular, the manager (Jarrod) puts my pizza order in when I walk in the door and it's ready in about 8-10 minutes. Excellent customer service, and his staff makes a great pizza with plenty of toppings."}
{"text":"They say good things come in small packages. Well this has to be the smallest Peter Piper that I've been to yet.   What I really like about this place is that they actually have pizzas lined up and ready to eat.  A fair share of Triple P's aren't ready for the 11:30 lunch crowd and hardly have any pizzas available. I chalk that up to poor management. They're usually too busy making pizzas for the carry out crowd instead of the dining room. This place is the exception and seems to be managed correctly.  Another thing that is very cool about this location is that they give you one of those flashing buzzers when your customized pizza is ready to go. So you don't look like an ass when you're cutting in line to get your special order. I hate when I order a pizza and it's half way eaten by the time I get up there.  As far the taste, of course Peter Piper is an average tasting product but it's a cheap lunch. The only thing is that this place can get pretty crowed since it has a relatively small dining room. But they do have plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This place is busy. No ice in ice machine. Employees running around everywhere with no plan of attack. Table next to me has been dirty for 55 minutes. This place is dirty. Here for a birthday party and bathrooms are mess. Spoke with desire and she gave nothing but excuses. Will nit return!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced that this is the smallest Peter Piper in existence. A little cousin of mine had his 11th birthday party here and it was embarrassing. There are like four games and there isn't a ballpit at all.  When we first got there they hadn't even set up for the party yet and we were on time. I asked one of the employees if there was a party schedule for 2pm and she snaps, \"I HAVE NO IDEA\" and gave me the dirtiest look ever. It was so rude. I get that you work at Peter Piper and you're probably upset about that but don't take it out on me.   I tried to play Deal or No Deal with my cousin to just try to have fun and was bombarded by unsupervised Mexican children begging me for tokens and tickets and screaming at me how to play the game. Where were their parents at?   The location in Mesa is much better! It's bigger than a Chuck E Cheese and the staff is way friendlier. Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"We have never had the experience we had this past Sunday. My son was celebrating his sixth birthday party. Now, bear in mind, we have had 5 birthday parties here. This was BY FAR the best experience. Bonnie was more than EXCELLENT. She made it so we had nothing to do but enjoy our day. She even supplied my son with extra tickets and showed us the best machine for winning tickets. She was always right there when we needed it.   The fact that she was amazed at my tip surprised me the most. This is a rising star in the hospitality business. Do whatever it takes to keep her and use her for your party planner."}
{"text":"I would have given NO starts but that was not an option. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! If you do, keep your receipts! I looked at my bank account and I saw the charge that we made when my family and I ate dinner there one night... Then a few charges after that was a charge for $60! I called and spoke to the manager and she had me come in. She gave me back my money but she didn't apologize or explain to me how this could have happened. Someone used my card number there without my permission and I want to know how this happens. She didn't say much at all, not even a smile. She made me feel like it was MY fault, that I did something wrong. No comps for food for being inconvenienced. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  This is such an inconvenience to me because after she gave me my money back I had to go to my bank and change out my debit card - which I got charged a fee for replacing- and now I have to change my information with all the stuff I pay automatically like my mortgage. I will be letting corporate know, they should be aware that this is happening- and apparently I'm not the only one. The manager mentioned that it has happened before...  UPDATE... Although we were inconvenienced, my Husband contacted the General Manager Josele at the Surprise location. He sincerely apologized and comped us a dinner. He also explained to us the problem with the register and that they are working on the issue with their IT department. The staff even personally delivered our food to our table. Thank you Josele for turning this situation around. My kids love Peter Piper and we will be coming back"}
{"text":"My 2nd family and I LOVE Peter Piper. By far our favorite pizza.    It used to be tradition that every Friday we all met up at the Mesa Riverview Peter Piper. It seems after the remodel of that one it was a lot nicer, however it's so insanely busy that we stopped going. This Chandler location is much more desirable. The staff is nice, its clean, and the food is mad quickly. The game area is easy to make your way around because it's not as packed at the other location.  The BEST pizza."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because their pizza is my favorite.  My 2nd family and I used to have a tradition of coming to this location every Friday. Service was always good and they always remembered us well. It was always a little busy and messy from leftover food but we would just request someone come and clean a table for us.  It seems ever since this location was remodel it's gotten out of control. This place is PACKED. It literally is so bad you cannot even walk to refill a drink without being trampled or almost knocking over or stepping on someone's child. It probably has to do a lot with this side of town but the customers are ghetto. I probably would not recommend bringing small children here because they will most likely be trampled or assaulted by another child. There is even a police officer on duty inside. I am going to guess it has a lot to do with people not watching their kids and the potential for someone to easily take someone's child.   Because it is so packed the food is slow, and if you actually find an open table it's most likely still covered in trash. I would suggest saving your night by being ruined by other people's children and visit another location. It's not really possible to enjoy yourself with the amount of people packed in this building."}
{"text":"My very good friend had a birthday party for her son tonight at this location.  The pizza was okay,  a little on the greasy side.  It's the first time in a long time that I had to dab my pizza with a napkin.  Everything else was great.  Chris, the server helping us provided excellent customer service"}
{"text":"The kids get a free personal pizza and 10 tokens for making honor roll.  I think it's really nice that Peter Piper Pizza rewards our kids for good grades.    The pizza's not bad.  The service is great.  Everyone is polite and kind.  I look forward to taking them back when they make honor roll again."}
{"text":"My kids had a great time here. The prices are very reasonable and tons of parking spaces in the lot. This place just opened up not long ago, the staff are very friendly and helpful. I wasn't to keen on the pizza, but the spicey honey bbq chicken wings was delicious  You won't be disappointed and I'll also tell you it's very clean inside."}
{"text":"Yes! I gave Peter Piper Pizza a 5-star! I can't believe that myself.  This story starts back in 1985, this is when I was going to school in Glendale. Being on a very tight budget, I could only afford the Burger King Whopper at 99 cents each and a large pizza from Piper Piper at $4.99. It got be through 2-1/2 years of school! All I could remember was how bad the pizza was. Now fast forward 29 years(wow, am i getting old). Last night we had a great opportunity to meet our foster kids for the first time! Now they could have gone anywhere, heck I was trying to get them to choose a nice restaurant. But it did not work, they wanted Peter Piper Pizza. So all four of us(wife included) went off to Piper Land, I laid down a 40 spot for a Large Pepperoni Pizza, half with Jalapeno's the seven year old likes it spicy like me! Order of hot wings(did I mentioned the 7 yr old likes it spicy like me), 4 drinks, two ice creams, and 40 tokens. Before I even sat down the six year old was out of tokens already?? So luckily the food actually came out fast, we all sat down had a great dinner. Had a chance to ask questions about each other. Then I realized something, their pizza wasn't that bad! I could not believe how good it was! I guess that 29 years of practice actually works. So overall we had an amazing night, brought back memories of our own grown kids when they were young. We will probably have many more visits here, and I don't have a problem with that any longer."}
{"text":"NOPE. Currently dying on the toilet 20 minutes after eating pizza from here. I'd give it ZERO stars if it allowed me to. Unless you want to drain your insides from your rear, don't eat here."}
{"text":"I visited this location for a child's birthday party this past weekend. Although I fully thought it was going to be loud and crazy I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't. The games are way in the back so I suppose if one ventures back to the game area it may be a bit overstimulating. But the birthday party was held at table in the front of the venue, so it wasn't bad at all. The adults were able to carry on conversations without having to yell...a PLUS in my book!   As for the pizza...honestly the California Supreme was FABULOUS. The best veggie pizza I have had here in AZ. I'm not a pizza connoisseur by any means but this was very delicious pizza, piping hop pizza.   They also serve beer and wine here. MGD or Coors Light are the only two beer options; Sutter Home White Zin, Chard and Cab for those who prefer wine. Not the greatest selection of adult beverages but it is a kid's pizza/party joint so one can't expect too terribly much."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party for my son here today (9/24). Our hostess was friendly, and even though our group didn't leave for another 2 hours after it was supposed to end, we were not pressured to leave. The manager was great, and everyone made sure that we were taken care of. All the adults commented on how good the pizza was, and the wings were awesome! When it comes to the parties, the way they are run is great! No minimum number of children, personal sized pizza for the birthday kid, and tokens were flowing! Everyone had a great time!"}
{"text":"They really do have some of the best pizza.. it's the sauce and and the pizza crust.  They usually have deals going on"}
{"text":"The restraunt is very clean. The pizza is always being made fresh. The games are really cool, too bad the game guy spends most of his time in the back. The cashier Alfie is super sweet and really helpful.  When I ordered my cinnamon crunch pizza I asked for extra icing and was annoyed when the guy Jason gave me little to no icing, when I told the manager he seemed annoyed that I brought it up. He was also lazy while helping the kids with the prizes.   Overall experience was good though."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Came for lunch buffet, paid and waited around 15 mins for pizza. There was no pizza at all on the buffet line. They also only have one vegetarian salad to eat, the Mandarin. Very limited. I will acknowledge the employees. They remained friendly and calm knowing the customers were feeling frustrated, since many were on their lunch breaks. 3 stars for the employees and the taste of the pizza. They lost two for the crazy wait and decreasing vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I've been to many PPP across the valley & they are all very similar to me (except for the size & maintenance).  What I like about this location are:  - the employees (very friendly & helpful) - the poor guy behind the prize counter (surprisingly patience w/ the demanding kiddies) - the play structure & video games are clean & well kept - the party hostesses does a great job making your party a success  As for the food, it's pretty much the same as the other ones.  A tip for your next b-day party here: instead of ordering the regular b-day package, do the \"team package\".  ....will save you lots of $$$$  the good: - cheap lunch buffet - free wi-fi - the friendly employees  the bad: - gets crowded on weekends"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here.! Very diverse menu and I don't think I have had a better pizza.  Everyone was super nice and very helpful. They have a huge area for the kids to play. I think we may have my grandsons birthday party here. Good working group of people. Well managed operation!"}
{"text":"Today was my 2nd unpleasant visit. I called to place a phone order the girl that answered put me on hold for 12 minutes I got to the parking lot and was still on hold. I spoke to the manager Cathy she apologized and I offered myself a free pizza which she okayed apperently there was a fundraiser going on so I was placed on hold and forgotten. Free pizza is always good. But I would try and avoid ordering during fundraisers ."}
{"text":"Went here for my son's birthday party and service was great and pizza was amazing as always been a fan of Peter Piper's pizza since I was a kid!"}
{"text":"We came in to have pizza and wings with friends and family. The majority of people come in for the lunch buffet during the week.  On the weekends this place can be very crowded and lines extensive waiting for food. The staff needs to be trained in customer service as a girl threw an order of wings at us and they can't keep orders straight. Soda fountains don't work, there are dirty plates stacked about 20 plates high above all the trash cans, and when you order food the staff does not even offer plates for you to eat off of. When we received our order of wings, they were cold. Customers are even going around and cleaning the tables. This place needs help."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your kids to burn off some energy and get good food at the same time!    The bad thing about this location is that there is limited parking close to the restaurant.  We usually have to park pretty far away because this place is always busy.  I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this location because I have never had any problems.  I have attended birthday parties here and have just gone for regular family nights out.  The service has been great every time.    The last time I went thought there were a lot of games that were out of order.  And whoever put the out of order stickers on the games just stuck them on the game at about adult eye level.  So my 5 year old son didn't notice and put some quarters in anyway and lost some money on them.  It's funny because the stickers look about the exact size of of the coin slots...I think you're supposed to stick them over the coin slot so that people CAN'T accidentally put them money in a broken machine.  Just a thought for next time!"}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza.... Gotta give at least 5 stars for a business that promotes itself as a childrens play haven that serves beer and caters to the Pedophile Peter lunch crew.  I joke... But really, you have to admit that seeing (alone and old) men in here with so many kids is kinda creepy.   It seems that the prices have inflated - 2 tokens for games. Chuck only charges 1 for his games!  Drop it down a dime Peter. Kids always have a blast.  The bathrooms have been clean, how do I know this? My kids don't get sick after eating here. Sure they wash their hands, but does anyone else? A sure way to know is based off if you get sick after eating here.  It's a germ haven! Any place with kids, snot, food, teenage employee's and games.   It's all we really have for kids up here that isn't $$$. We have the Bowling Alley now, but that will cost you way more than 2 tokens!   I took away 2 stars because we had a party here once before - never again!! Also, because it isn't a 5 star kinda place.    Serves it's purpose. Hits the demographic. Pizza is ok, prices $35 for pizza, drinks and tokens for 4. (well 1 mom and 3 kids)"}
{"text":"How I love you for kids birthday parties!! Especially when its not my own kid. Free pizza, ice cream, wings, and sometimes when your really lucky like me beer. That's right free beer!! No Peter Piper does not give away free beer you dunce but if you go to a party here there's a good chance you'll get some for free. Its not Dave & Busters but it doesn't cost an arm and leg to go here either. I have become a pro at the ticket games if you hit me up I might tell you my secret. The staff is always super friendly even when your kid cant make their mind up over what kind of prize they want with all those tickets they just won. Its a great place when its too hot out and you don't want to clean up a giant mess after having a bunch of kids over at your own pool. Have your party here while your kids are young before they out grow this place!   So as I'm writing this I'm thinking of the Wedding Crashers. Now taking applications for a Birthday Crashing partner are you in?? I will supply the child. Lets go!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have come here and discovered that the women's restroom is unkept (stalls out of toilet paper, used paper towels overflowing in the trash receptacle and all over the sink and floor), and many of the games are either out of order or don't provide tickets. These things are a big disappointment because we come to Peter Piper Pizza to enjoy quality time with our daughter.  We may need to consider going to a different location although this one is so close to our house.   On tne other hand, the food is good quality, which is why I gave this location three stars."}
{"text":"Now this review I am writing is NOT about the food, BUT the time it is open, there is about 200 employees who work at midnight to 9 am, this place opens at 11am, the problem with this place is it ONLY caters to afternoon shifts, poor business if you ask me, their loss I guess"}
{"text":"The Kids Love This Place   I like Peter Piper Pizza because my nephew has so much fun.  But, overall the food is average at best and the service leaves something to be desired. Our large  pizza took over 35 minutes, and when I commented on the wait  to our server, she replied \"...and we're not even busy\"  The games all the same style for the most part. However, my nephew walked away with more then 1600 tickets, and he was thrilled.  The pizza is average but we will return simply because $20 buys a filling meal and an additional $20 buys my nephew an hour of fun.   There are a lot better pizza places (like Grimaldi's ) but I really don't go to Peter Piper for great pizza. We go to Peter Piper Pizza for games and fun. When I want a great pizza I head over to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"This was my first time at any Peter Piper. I grew up on the East Coast where the Mouse and his Cheese reign ! Peter Piper is adult friendly which is great. I'll have no problem getting my teen to come along for an outing at Peter Piper.  Environment  The building is located in the front of  a shopping center with plenty of parking. Once inside the decor is very bright and welcoming.  The menus are easy to navigate and explain all the pricing and different packages. They also offer a lunch buffet.  There was plenty of seating.  Throughout two seating areas were tables as well as booths. It's great for dinning alone or meeting up with friends. TVs were up throughout the establishment and featured kid friendly cartoons and sports. They also have free Wi-Fi.  Food  The pizza was similar to hot and ready pizza places. It was good for the price though. The wings were delicious  they were seasoned well and not to crunchy or wet.  Arcade  The arcade was clean and had about 20 games to play. I personally think it caters to kids between 5 and 10 years of age . Older kids may get bored quickly. Toddlers won't have much to do. Most of the games require at least two tokens.  The games take tokens and give out tickets which can be redeemed for prizes.   Customer Service  The staff was AMAZING ! They are very professional and friendly. They were patient and kind with the littles. My kids felt comfortable and really enjoys themselves. We were there for the Summer Craft activities ( which will start again June 2018). For $5 a kid they received 2 slices if pizza a drink, a guided craft and  go with a Pinata. Bree hosted the activities, and she did a great job of including all the kids and making sure they all were happy. She kept everything organized and all the activities moved seamlessly !  All in all we had a great time and will definitely bring our family back for future visits. The food is about average but the overall experience was great !"}
{"text":"Although this location is smaller than most, the staff is always friendly and the food is always good. They also keep the restaurant very clean, even when it is very crowded. They always keep the buffet stocked during hours as well. Parking is sometimes scarce. The bathroom is not as clean as we would have liked though."}
{"text":"If I was a child this would probably be the 10-900000 stars out of 5, but since I actually eat the food and don't play much arcade, it's a 3. The pizza quality is bad and overly salty, salads are probably just as unhealthy as the pizza. I've got to say I'm a sucker for dessert pizza even though some might hate it. Overall it is a fun place, and the people there are very nice and helpful. Good for a family or fun outing."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:48 p.m. Told the food wasn't quite ready yet but it would be about a 7 minute wait. 32 minutes later I finally get my order. This was for a one topping pepperoni pizza with an order of cheesy garlic bread. Several other customers came in ordered and received their pickups before me. Ridiculous. If you're not going to quote accurate times don't quote any times at all. I don't appreciate my time being wasted by your staff"}
{"text":"Stuffed crust pizza. Two tries. First one raw second one so much sauce the toppings slid off. Hand tossed pizza has huge bubbles devoid of cheese sauce or mushrooms. The second try was missing cheese on 75% of pizza. I'll give them credit for trying to make it right but big strike out."}
{"text":"Going to keep it short. Location is fine, lots of parking and near by stores. A very important reason why I am not giving them 4 stars is because their game selection sucks! This place is so big, and only 1/4 of it is games. They literally have about 20 games in total. For food we had 2 pizzas, a few order of wings and pasta. Pizza saved them because it was really good. I could truly say I enjoyed it. Wings were okay, beyond soggy for my taste. Pasta was okay too. Over all this place is alright. I wouldn't come here again unless for some odd reason I am craving their pizza. But one thing I do want to acknowledge is how friendly and amazing the staff was. 5 stars for them!"}
{"text":"So this place is small and the play selection is quite underwhelming. We went here for my six year old's birthday, figured it would be a good place to go to without all the hustle and bustle that you get from going to Chucky E Cheese.  To start off the place is small, by small I mean the gaming area, one of the biggest reasons, in my opinion anyway, to go there is for the kids to play and eat. Not there for the restaurant aspect which took up most of the space in that place.   Just so you are aware each game cost about 2 tokens, there are a few with less and even less that take more tokens.    The food was another disappointing aspect of my trip here. The pizza was mainly sauce and pepperoni. Most of the cheese was missing or slide off. The biggest upset was the way they give you the wings. The menu said you get 10 wings, what it does not tell you is that the 10 wings is only for bone in and then if you get boneless it is weighed to 10oz.  Not sure if this place is suppose to bring you your food or not since I saw both there and it's my first time, I had to go get my own food, but what pissed me off is when I went to get my food they tell me oh it's hot. One of the metal pans used to cook the pizza on has nothing to hold it with and the X-Large pizza had some paper plates to hold a metal disc which is used to cool the pizza."}
{"text":"Very Impressed with this business! Games and rides were actually being cleaned thoroughly and establishment was staffed with happy service. Keep up the Good Work! My family will be back. Thank You again."}
{"text":"On more than one occasion they have left us on hold for more than 15 min and while still on hold we called them on a different phone to talk to the manger to find out what's going on and they hung up the other ling without even picking up. They said that they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"Great place to take kids in the hot summer! Great place for birthday parties!!  The food is okay, but I don't recommend the salads. Just get the pizza, whichever crust you prefer. I like the boneless wings, and there's even beer!!  The games usually are working well, and if there are any issues, the staff is quick to respond if you let them know. It seems like everyone is pretty patient, which I understand can be difficult at a zoo like this!   They offer coupons on receipts, and there are token & food deals.  The prizes are pretty typical, but I haven't brought any children who have complained yet!!  The ac works great too.   For what it is, great job!!  Cleanliness is above satisfactory. Again, this is definitely a difficult task and I applaud the staff."}
{"text":"Is the food good? Absolutely. As far as buffet pizza goes, this is one of the finest around, with a wide variety and freshness abound.  Is the service good? Absolutely. Not.  The manager who rung me up couldn't be more surly. She did not acknowledge me; she merely waved her finger to summon me to the counter. She was very snappy with her speech and was dismissive of any questions that I had. All she wanted to do was take my money and move me on. I did notice she greeted my wife better, and neither of us were acting rude towards the staff. HER manager was notified and they, of course, did nothing. As a result, I will find other, better, restaurants to visit in the future.  You can be good at your food, but if your service sucks, you don't get my dollars. Not sorry."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great lunch buffet great place for kids and adults."}
{"text":"I went to this place Monday afternoon with my friend Ally and her friend Faye.I had a 2 for 1 coupon and decided to try their lunch buffet.It consisted mainly of pizza,bread sticks,2 types of pasta(mac and cheese and spinach fettuccine) and 3 types of salads(caesar's  salad and a couple of others that I forget) and a couple of desert pizzas.It's very bright and clean in here. The pizza was ok,not spectacular but definitely edible and a decent selection of different types..The bread sticks were very good.The pastas were not bad and the salad was adequate.I did enjoy it overall and would be open to returning here but most likely if I had a coupon deal again.I can't really find anything to fault it for but it's not exactly my cup of tea.Readers of my other reviews will know that I am a big fan of regular or Asian buffets and this type of buffet would be alright for a once in a while change of pace buffet but not something that I would tend to do on a regular basis.If you like this type of food,you probably won't be disappointed.Try it and see what you think of it.Enjoy.(beverage is extra cost)."}
{"text":"Visit this location regularly. We've also had 2 birthday parties here as well in the last 3 years. Its reasonably priced, extremely kid friendly/focused and the food is pretty good considering who their primary demographic and clientele are. Our experience with the staff has been great and they have been extremely helpful, accommodating and easy to work with, particularly during the 2 birthday celebrations. I believe you get what you pay for here and the great customer service is simply the cherry on top."}
{"text":"We came here for a family party and had a very poor experience. The staff was rude and screwed up our ordered twice. We had a line standing at the counter to order for 10 minutes and the manager just kept walking by without even acknowledging anyone. I wouldn't recommend anyone come here due to the staff and the staff alone. And then to top it all off they kicked us off our table 15 minutes early so they could have time to set up for the next party. We hadn't even done presents yet!! This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"They had a great buffet for lunch and the crew was well stocked with good fresh pizza"}
{"text":"This was the first time we came here. Pros: Pizza is good Games are fun Service was good Cons: Crowded, very specific crowd, rambunctious kids and non attentive parents, soccer trams, birthdays Games are broken and/or don't give tickets You will spend 30$ to win a few small pieces of candy or hundreds of dollars to win a cheap toy"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Called in an order to go and was ready within five minutes after I arrived. Wish there were more locations in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not nearly as nice as all the other PPPs. Arcade doesn't even have pop-a-shot. What the hell?!!  Good pizza though. Employees didn't look that happy to be there"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. I usually come for the lunch buffet, but get a personal sized pizza other times. This location doesn't have a carrousel or toddler play area like some other locations, but does have tons of games and tvs. They will change the channel for you if you want to watch anything in particular. Free wifi is great too and easy to connect"}
{"text":"I am a big Peter Piper fan!!! Ive always been and always will be. This location is not my fav but its close to home so Im a regular, no seriously Im a regular at least once a week lol The buffet at lunch sucks they serve the worst pizzas I feel like Im always waiting for them to put out a simple pepperoni pizza but nope just another wack invention come on people this is not CiCis.. Then when they do finally put one out everyone takes all the slices. When I go any other time the pizza is great but they do take a long time 45-60 min wait. The customer service here from the staff including management is horrible, no eye contact no thank you. Please I know its not the best place to work but a smile would be nice!"}
{"text":"Compared to other locations in the valley (which were great!) this location is lacking customer service. I'm not sure if they're hiring, but they seemed understaffed. It took a while to be acknowledged, the utensils and cup lids needed to be restocked, and many tables were left messy for the whole time we were there. These were plates from people before us. Some of the food was burnt on the bottom. The salads took a while to come out to be served. Mind you, we went during buffet hours, but at least acknowledge the customers and clean the tables. Not too sure if we'll be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I am from CA and went here with my cousins. I thought the deep dish pizza was great. We had the bacon pizza. I also had a medditeranian salad which was great. I will definitely go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Had a good time like always, and their pizza is still some of my favorite. However, I was there for my son's birthday and a couple of the games that he really enjoys playing were out of order. Plus there were a couple of other games that just ate our tokens.   It was still \"A-OK\" but I have had better trips there. Plus the size of their cups always drive me nuts!"}
{"text":"Overall this is actually one of my top five favorite place to get a pizza, and let the kids go nuts. The only thing is that this particular Peter Piper is always over packed and just doesn't have enough games or play area for the kids.  The other thing that bothered me about this location was the RUSH job they put on us. We were there for one of my son's friends birthday party. They had a couple table reserved, as others had every other table in the place reserved, cramming us all together. The tables were clearly marked with the child's name and the time the tables were reserved for.  With about 15 minutes left for the time they had it reserved for, employees began to come over and begin cleaning up our tables as people were still eating. At the exact time the tables were to no longer be reserved for our group, we were politely asked to leave so the next group could get set up.  Not totally impressed with the packed place and rush job, but the pizza was still good. Take it for what its worth."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  A long black hair in my pizza. When brought to their attention, no apology, only a comment that neither the baker nor the teller had long black hair (so what was being suggested that we grey haired people brought it in?).  Some pizza was not completely cooked."}
{"text":"The manager here is complete garbage. Ive never met someone so toxic as him, human scum. 10/10 would never come here again."}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza is on of my favorite pizza places even though we don't eat here to often which is the reason for my four starts. I personally would give it five stars but my husband wouldn't agree. These are his reasons and I agree, but I believe its totally worth it. They don't deliver which makes it a little inconvenient their prices are pretty high compared to other pizza places that do deliver. Even though they don't have a lot of business they take a little long in making your pizza, but over all its always very good so the wait for me at least is OK sometimes. The pizza buffet is pretty much worth coming for especially since they let you take it as take out for the same price."}
{"text":"I really love this place the staff is really nice there fast on there pizza order.. the pizza is delicious (suggestion) you guys should definitely add a stuffed crust !!!! Altho the gameroom is small we always win tickets and get prizes so its a-ok with me"}
{"text":"How much fun is this place! There were kids everywhere, and candyfacepainting.com got to attend and paint all sizes of kids all night. The pizza was yum, we had the large california vegetarian and there are a lot of people there having fun, playing games winning prizes and they have soft serve ice cream too! 5 star for this fun kids hangout."}
{"text":"Place was clean and not busy at all for a Saturday. Pizza was good compared to chucke e cheese."}
{"text":"Deeply disappointed. I had reserved tables for my sons birthday for September the 2nd at 5. When we showed up the AC was broken. And it was  at minimum 90 degrees inside the building. No one told us anything. I had guest come in from out of state for my sons birthday and I obviously had no time to prepare for us to go anywhere else. When we asked what the deal was they brushed it off like nothing. We spent over 200-300 on food altogether and at no point did they offer to discount for the inconvenience. All of my guest were miserable and it truly put a huge damper on my sons birthday. They didn't even put out fans for any of there customers. I'm sorry we live in Vegas but it's already hot. It was stifling in there. Don't know if we will be back ever. Obviously they care more about making money than being honest with there customers."}
{"text":"I think that when u walk into ANY business the manager and 2 other employees should at least acknowledge your presence. Each of them glanced our way and kept on talking! That made me feel like they didn't need me as a customer. They weren't busy. Then they didn't buzz us when our pizza was ready. We had to come looking for it. Maybe younger, friendlier, more customer orientated employees would be better."}
{"text":"We love this location...it seems for some reason they have the best pizza...my son loves the carousel...so as long as my son is happy I will keep returning"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch Buffett. Was late in the scheduled window. Pizza was old and nasty. Just ordered a salad. Salad was good for the price. Virtually all the tables were filthy. Not a single staff member was minding store. Trash littered the floor everywhere. I can see if you have kids this would be a retreat for parents. But in my opinion there is never a good reason for poor sanitation. Especially around children."}
{"text":"Pizza buffet and games for kiddos...they deliver on that! Not my first choice for pie, but pizza is pizza yum yum."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out, the girl on the phone kept stressing that I have to bring in my coupon or I won't get the discount. Okay, I'll do my part and bring in the coupon.   I live really close so I gave them 30min to cook the pizza before I arrived. I'm here. And my pizza is not ready. And they looked at me like they didn't take my order. Then gave me the old \"oh yeah we have your pizza... it's just the breadsticks we're waiting on.\"   I did my part with the coupon and brought it in. How about you guys do your part and take my order and have the pizza ready?  Two stars because their pizza is always good."}
{"text":"Staff here is fantastic  They really cater to the small ones and make them feel just as important as the adults  I have a hard time keeping a smile on my face with just one little one and the girls here seem to keep a fresh smile with kids all day  A great review just for giving my kid a balloon"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  So every now again I crave Triple P pizza.  I did a carry out order for 2 medium pizzas with 2 toppings.   First, it was $27!  Wtf!  $27 for 2 medium pizzas?  Are they touched by the pizza gods?  Seemed very pricey.   It was going to be 25-30 minutes for the order which seemed long as it is.  But it was a Friday night So I figured they may be swamped.  We got there in 20mins to be safe and my food had already been sitting there.  Got home and sure enough it wasn't even warm.  Pizza was eh at best.   Horrid experience and won't be back."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to this Peter Piper Pizza. The stars that I'm giving are for the poor kid who really tried to help, but was just clueless....  I ordered one \"fresh\" Greens & Grapes salad - that was prepackaged and pulled from the fridge right in front of me, and a personal pizza and boneless wings.... the kid helping us kept trying to give me ranch dressing, and the salad should come with poppyseed. I finally just asked him to switch me to a Caesar salad, and suddenly he found the poppyseed dressing....  he was as helpful as he could be but not one other employee tried to help him or was helpful to us in any way.... in fact, they all kind of looked miserable. A word to the wise: if there are only a few cars in front of a pizza place on a Friday night, that should tell you something. Probably won't return, and I definitely won't recommend this to anyone else."}
{"text":"3 stars because the kids had fun. We went with the VIP party package, because I wanted to sit back and enjoy the party.   We had to find our party planner multiple times, starting with tokens. It took 20 minutes for her to bring them out to the kids from the time we checked in. Guests ranged from ages 5-8 so to placate them we had to spend extra money before using the tokens that came with the package. We ordered our food, half of it never arrived. We made sure it wasn't on the bill. She apologized. I served the pizza, had to again find the planner to bring the cake out because she spent all her time hiding behind the counter and not making sure that the parties going on needed anything. I also bussed the tables for cake and then again for presents.   \"Décor\" is a balloon, plates, napkins. There was no \"build your own pizza\" experience for my daughter and the planner did not bring out the pizza peel until everyone had left and I was cleaning up. So she did not get hers signed by any of her guests :(   My daughter still had fun, but she definitely noticed the missing items as we had her brothers 4th birthday party here the year before and she was looking forward to the build your own pizza.   Our party consisted of 6 kids and parents, so we were not a huge out of control group for anyone to manage. I did leave a 20% tip based on the final cost, despite the fact that I did most of the work.   Very disappointed PPP. Our first experience for my son's party was 5 star and is what brought us back. We probably won't book a hosted party here ever again."}
{"text":"For the most part when we come to this place the service is good and the food is good but this evening the food is mediocre, the trash cans were overflowing, they forgot a pizza,  forgot our drinks and the service was a disaster. Due to Prior experience I would normally not leave a negative review. However, since the manager didn't show an ounce of apology then I think that warrants a poor rating. This was my daughter's birthday party and we were embarrassed to have all of our friends here with the issues that we had."}
{"text":"Huge waste of money. Ordered my daughter the kids meal boneless wings and all it was, was 4 small chicken bites. Then I got a bunch of tokens and most of the games didn't work or took my tokens."}
{"text":"This is our default Piper. We have had several birthdays, nights out and just some play time here through out the years.   Our most recent visit was for a birthday. They handled it perfectly, the kids stayed entertained, the adults stayed cool and the birthday girl had a good time.   The pizza seemed to get better then 10 years ago, the staff was great, and there was plenty of room for everyone."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted right away. Wasn't sure how to order but immediately saw pizza and salad like a buffet style. I was more surprised how clean the place was being opened since last November. You would think a place like this gets run down fast. But that shows management takes good care of the business. The price too caught my attention the most. I paid $6.49 and for my kids 10 and under was $4.59.  Then I bought $10 tokens. This place is a good place to go to when you're on a budget. Eat and play and save= happy spender and mommy!!"}
{"text":"My 7-yr old loves this place, and I admit that I do too, especially the M-F lunch buffet! What a deal and we have fun while eating tons of pizza, salad and desserts (the cinnamon pizza alone is worth the whole trip). I prefer PPP way more over Chuck-e-Cheese."}
{"text":"Ok so I am an city girl living in a desert world, but I'm a pretty nice gal, all things considered, I think... Anyhoo, l I have to say the service at Peter Piper Pizza was one of the most deplorable experiences I have ever experienced, and that is saying alot considering that I have been to Chuckie Cheese (which happens to have the worst pizza ...ever).  The food at Peter Piper Pizza was actually quite tasty, but the service was horrible.     The countergirl was rude, and uninformed.  Her supervisor was just as clueless.    As a mother I am subject to these kid-friendly pizza joints, but the service was so bad it made Chuckie Cheese look like an exclusive Club!"}
{"text":"If you're a parent, you'll probably have to go here at some point.  I have been a few times and the pizza is decent enough and there's a small salad bar. The best thing about this place is that even if you don't have 100 quarters for the games, kids can still be entertained for FREE by playing in the jungle gym thing.  Anyway, my 4 year old likes it for an hour or so.  They even have TVs usually tuned to sports if you just need to let the rug-rat roam free while you catch the 4th quarter."}
{"text":"The pizza is great and the wings are wonderful. The cleanliness is pretty good as well. Besides the fact that it's semi chuck e cheese environment feel due to the arcade area this location is pretty ok in terms of service and the food being real good :)! Only downside is that sometimes the food takes too long to come out when it's not even packed but it's only sometimes! :)"}
{"text":"Placing an order over the phone at this location is a complete joke. You are guaranteed to be placed on hold...which is okay but twice I had to hang up after being on hold over 15 minutes (no, I'm not exaggerating the time) and call them back to complain. Manager Gabby was super nice and said she will address, but this location lost my business. Peace out"}
{"text":"So we all know PPP is not what one would consider  the \"gourmet\" of pizzas, but personally, I think it is yummy!  When you can pay $5 and have some all you can eat pizza, well...that's a win for me.    Foodwise:  Numero Uno:  Large variety of pizzas and toppings and they are constantly refreshing the buffet.    Dos: Pizza is fresh and they honestly do not skimp on the toppings.    Tres:  The place is HUGE and you can always find a place to sit.  They have people coming around and bussing and making sure tables are always open.     I would give it 5 stars for the buffet, but having been to a few other locations, this one seems to fall behind on organizational skills.  First of all, they pre make their salads which leads to soggy and wilted lettuce.  I prefer the salad bar method as they have at other locations for the buffet.  Second:  They do not have pre-filled cups of marinara dipping sauce for the breadsticks readily available.  Then, when you ask for some...it takes a minimum of 2 minutes for them to go and fill a little cup. (not joking) They don't seem all too happy to have to fulfill these requests either...so why not make a crap load ahead of time, knowing you will be getting these requests?  Thirdly:  Their lids for their sodas are hard to find when it is super busy.    I love PPP and am not ashamed!  It's fast and convenient.  Plus...they have Fruit Ninja on a big touch screen!  Good times!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible!! I've been coming here for about 10 years and never been disappointed until tonight. I took my 4 year old cousin here and most of the games were busted. We lost tokens and they didn't give them back to us. The place was super dirty, half eaten pieces of pizza on the games. The bathrooms were dirty, there were no paper towels. I will not be coming back here. Again, kids working at this place. Where are all the adult workers? They need some serious training on how to properly maintain this business or no one will be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I had my daughters 3rd birthday party here, we order 3 xl pizza, one cheese, one pepperoni, one half and half, at 6:09pm. We recite our cheese pizza around 6:30, they said they would buzz us when the other two were ready. I start to realize that time has passed and people who barely walked in already received their orders. It was 7:09 I went up and asked where were our pizza at? They said oh um you didn't get them? Obviously fucking not if I am asking about them. So the shift manager he had glasses not sure his name was like I am so sorry let me get you two free XL pizza for next time. I explained to him why would I ever want to come back to this shit place for pizza to wait and hour for? So I asked for my money back and he said well I cant give you your money back because it would make our company look bad to cooperate. He then went on about giving us pizza cake, and ice cream. Why would we want desert if we have a birthday cake? Why would we want anything else from this place? He then said okay I will refund your money for you, so we said okay cool. Then when he was about to give it back to us he said well I'm not going to give you the pizza. HOLD THE FUCK ON! Why not? You made us wait an hour for our pizza that we never got, you then said you'll refund us the money, then tell us that we cant have the pizza. He really ruined our experience here and we will never come back here. He ruined our daughter birthday. Our guest ate cake before their dinner.  This place is so fucking pathetic!"}
{"text":"It was decent pizza; but just overall a bit over priced and it felt like I was at a chucky cheese. And the pizza quality was the same as a little ceaser pizza."}
{"text":"This was one very clean location (down to the bathrooms). Although it was packed because it was a Saturday ( what can you expect lol) the staff still managed to keep things clean. No cups, plates, etc lingering, and no tables full of garbage. Why am I focusing on that? Because another Peter Piper location failed miserably in that area and I wanted to give this location kuddos for being clean, tidy, and just a-ok.  Oh how was the pizza you ask.? Eh I have had better but it was ok as well. Will I be back? Yep as my fiance's niece likes this place so we will be back soon."}
{"text":"A great place to take your kids if you have them. I do not but I always seem to come a Peter Piper location a few times a year for other friends who have kids and whose kids insist on having their birthday party at various locations. Pizza is decent albeit a little pricey and the kids seem to love it and in the end, that is all that matters."}
{"text":"It's no wonder this place is empty. Many games take 2 tokens, the game length is 20 seconds. Very few games. No salad bar. The only option for a child who doesn't like pizza is over priced chicken and pineapples. Most kids don't like pineapple. Grapes or apples would be better. Very over priced for the little here. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"You can't beat the lunch buffet all you can eat. The staff is always really nice and helpful in there. They also make any pizza we ask them for. I Love their thin crust pizza, better that most Italien restaurant pizzas in this town.  The kids always enjoy their playtime after lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"great service. great people. the cranberry salad is the best! and pizzas not so bad either, haha. A few of the arcade games took my tokens and the manager on duty was prompt in fixing them and giving me back my tokens. I love this place"}
{"text":"Sometimes not just a place for kids! Needed somewhere to hangout for about 90 minutes that was not in the heat and dust of my daughter's horse riding lesson. Without an abundance of casual places to choose from on this stretch of Carefree Hwy, the other reviews on the site sent me here. It didn't disappoint. Clean, plenty of room to spread out, free wifi that worked, TVs tuned (albeit quietly) to the Dbacks game, a section for adults that was away from the toys and games. I enjoyed some Cherry Crunch Dessert (yummy!) and Vitamin Water from the fountains while working on a lesson plan, then headed back out into the heat. Maybe next time I'll actually save room for pizza!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night and the place was a bit crowded. We ordered one of their package deals.  I was disappointed with the pizza, it was bland and greasy like the garlic bread. I couldn't even finish it because it was greasy and salty. It came with a marinara sauce. I wouldn't order pizza or garlic bread again over there. I'm addition. My husband had a fountain soda drink that didn't taste like it should be. He wanted a regular Coke, however, it tasted more like a diet Coke. A lot of the games were broken and there wasn't that many to choose from in the first place. I would not come back here again if I ha a choice."}
{"text":"Tried PPP for the first time, they messed up my order in a few different ways  1st  They called me back because they forgot what level of spiciness I wanted for my wings.  2nd They forgot my salad  3rd I ordered half combination half cheese and they gave me half pepperoni half cheese   All the staff were very nice and friendly though. They compensated us with a free medium pizza, which we were really thankful for but we still would have rather not gone through the head ache...  THE BATHROOM WAS MORE FILTHY MILEY CYRUS AT THE VMA's!!! ALL STALLS LITERALLY  HAD SHIT OVER FLOWING, AND THE ONE URINAL and ONE GARBAGE CAN WAS OVERFLOWING AS WELL... employees and managers should definitely pay more attention to that!  The location was big but did not have that many games to play with so I'm still a little confused of the target market for the establishment. Pizza was ok..."}
{"text":"Richard at Peter Pipers Pizza in Ahwatukee was very kind and witnesses him make another young child's time in the arcades a great one. Richard came in and fixed the machine after the child didn't get all his tickets. He took real good care of him and let him know that next time something like that happens to just contact an employee.   Afterwards we seen him behind the counter counting others tickets and taking his time with them. Always had a smile and was kind even when it took a while for our kids to chose what they wanted. Richard is the right kind of person for this job. This place is definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious.  Need I say more?  This pizza is perfect for when you want a quick, inexpensive, delicious meal but don't buy extra...it's only great when you eat it fresh...reheating it makes it taste like cardboard.   The toppings aren't fancy...the crust isn't fancy...it's just the perfect amount of crusty bread and toppings to make me happy.  Large one topping pizza (you can even do half and half and it's still considered one topping)...I get mine ordered \"well done\" to be crispy....and its about $11.  Feeds two and you're full. The end"}
{"text":"We always call ahead and order our pizza for take out-phones are answered quickly by friendly staff.  I know this may seem like \"no biggie\" but sometimes you call other places and they make you feel like you're bothering them by calling in an order. Went the other day and we were offered drinks while we waited for our pizza to be ready- nice! Tried the new \"thin crust\" for the first time and it was delicious! I used to eat PPP weekly as a kid and I can definitely say the quality and flavor if this pizza has kept up with the times. Better than any delivery pizza out there. Try the chicken sausage it's yummy!"}
{"text":"I've loved Peter Piper Pizza ever since I was a kid.  I wish they'd bring the chicken sausage topping back and add spinach as a topping. This location: staff is very nice,  order not always right."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service- the manager Christina boxed my pizza supposedly herself and swore it wasn't thin crust. I would know after going there for 25 years what the pizza should look like. Her response- bring the pizza back. I will be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"I think this is the best PPP I've been to. It appeared to be the cleanest PPP I've visited in a while. Lots of fun stuff for the kids, besides some very kid-friendly food. They also have salads, wings, and alcoholic drinks for the adults ;-) We had a large group of people. It was so easy to order, pick up our food, purchase tokens, visit with others, and have fun with the kiddos on all the games. The games offer tickets so the kids can cash in their tickets for prizes. Also, the pizza and salads were pretty delicious. I think the wine was a bit pricey at $5 for a smallish cup and it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of PPP. Really decent pizza, run-of-the mill salads (hey, it's NOT a salad place!), and great fun for the kiddos. We went on a Saturday and let the kids run wild and mad. Had a lot of fun in the noise and chaos. Pizza was good. Staff works around the tables quickly to clean them off and get them ready for the next hungry family coming in.  Wish they had PPP where I live. I miss them."}
{"text":"Okay so honestly, this place is awesome , BUT I would have to give it 2 starts because of MANAGEMENT NOT THE PLACE AND FOOD I will say this... there's these managers I don't know their names but all I know is that they are female ! The male manager there he is always giving out great customer service but there's this Hispanic female manager that she's so rude and she's so bad at talking to people . She will make a situation from bad to worse in seconds.  So overall I LOVE THIS PLACE , but fix your management"}
{"text":"It was a hot and steamy evening... Temps too high to entertain the kids outside. I needed an activity to do with my kids and get them out of the house.   My options:  *A movie?  nope... too busy and not a ton of toddler friendly options. *A restaurant? nope... the kids can't sit still for long and they aren't big eaters either. *A museum?  nope - they close by 5pm. *A splash pad?  perhaps...  (*Side note: if you have other ideas given this situation, please message me!)  And then it came to me... I would take them to Peter Piper Pizza!  I had never been before, so it would be an adventure for me too.  And boy, was it.  We arrived and scored a parking spot in the busy lot, and then waited in line to order food and get some tokens.  We saw batman while in line, which the kids were excited about.  I ordered a personal pizza and a Mac & Cheese + 2 juice boxes and a bottle of water.  The guy took awhile to get my water, and then apologized as it wasn't cold.  The order came up in two parts after a long wait.  This did give us time to hit the restroom and find a table, which I was pleased to see was pretty clean.  Unfortunately, the Mac & Cheese was inedible.  It arrived piping hot, which for kids is not a good idea.  I let it cool down, but even my daughter who loves Mac & Cheese didn't like it.  The kids each ate about a half a piece of pizza and a few sips of juice and then we went off to explore the games...  It was a zoo with kids and parents and maybe a few shady 20 some-things everywhere.  There was a birthday party going on and teenagers running around with squirt guns.  My son was so excited, he ran belly first into a bench that was out of the table.  He cried for a bit but got over it soon... this place felt like the definition of chaos.  I would think it would be a non-parent's worst nightmare!  It was clean-ish, but I could feel germs everywhere regardless!  My kids each did a dolphin ride and then my husband met us to \"surprise\" hang out with us too.  I was fine, but appreciated the extra supervison.  We then found a \"throw the ping pong ball in the cup\" game, which ended up being our favorite.  We also did a skeeball game, and a couple of others,  collected some tickets, and had fun counting them before cashing them in for some prizes.  Selection for the number of tickets we had wasn't great, but the kids managed to choose some little bracelets and plastic hopping frogs.   As we were leaving, we saw Superman too...  This place reminded me a bit of my fond memories of Chuck E Cheese, but now being there as a parent, I can see why kids like it and (most) adults don't.  Nonetheless, it serves a purpose and I'm sure we'll be back... eventually."}
{"text":"The renovation of this place is horrible.  Less games less play area so they can private seating for parties.  Staff is semi friendly depends who you get.  Wings and pizza were good."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here. Usually come in for kid's birthdays. The whole family has a great time. It is just another pizza place, but we have grown very accustomed to it. The employees keep the place pretty clean and the pizza is always hot. Hope the bathrooms have been renovated..."}
{"text":"Peter Piper is Arizona's family oriented pizza chain. Most people think the pizza is complete garbage and often describe it as cardboard, but I think it's just plain great."}
{"text":"The service is slow. The pizza is horrible. They use the lowest quality ingredients and the food is prepared by people who don't care. The pizza was free and it still wasn't worth it. I'm not sure why people go back."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years. No manager on duty tonight. All the kid (workers ) are playing around behind the counter. Order was wrong. They forgot the sausage on the pizza.  Fixed it by putting sausage on a cold pizza and putting it back in the oven. When you lifted a slice it all rolled off......nice. Manager would have done it right."}
{"text":"Bad bad service, second time the screw our order. Last Friday they skipped the order and did not make the pizza. Today they took our order and skipped the drinks, the salad and the beer...."}
{"text":"Disgusting pizza that is a step below frozen. It is not a nice place."}
{"text":"Probably not a bad place for a kids birthday party but it's sort of like having bad dollar store pizza in an elementary school."}
{"text":"Thank you for the outstanding customer service with covering the cost of the order!"}
{"text":"This morning just before 9 a.m. I was walking to an appointment and passed a young man who was meticulously cleaning the exterior and sidewalk and windows of this restaurant. His name is Michael and I mentioned to him that he was impressive. I also called the manager as these days I rarely see people taking as much care and initiative in their job.  Certainly makes me an avid fan of this Peter Piper Pizza and most importantly, Michael. Thea Manger"}
{"text":"I almost rated this place two stars but realized part of the problem was me.  I chose to sit as far away as possible from the group of 40 or more 10-12 yo girls occupying a long seating area in the middle of the store.   Where I ended up was initially a quiet spot over by the play/gaming area that proved to be very noisy as time went on and many families with toddlers moved in around me.  I was feeling cheap and in a rare mood for pizza. While not the worlds greatest pizza I sort of like the thin crispy crust that didn't fold up on me.  In six pieces I managed to try the bacon/onion, sausage, veggie, pineapple/ham.  I had a plate of Caesar and one of ranch salad and a bread stick.  The salads were sort of limp.  For $6.78 +tax with a medium drink I got my moneys worth.  For .99 more I could have had a soft serve cone but I was already full.  The dining area is huge!  I bet it can seat over 200.  Seating for the most part is school cafeteria with a few 4 tops and some pseudo 2 top booths.  As I mentioned there is a play/gaming area at the back of the store, they definitely cater to families who want a meal out on a budget."}
{"text":"Torn between a heavy 3 or a soft 4.  Med Rand H here for lunch.  This was definitely a lot cheerier place than the one near where I work.  The restrooms were well kept.  There were always fresh pizzas out and I saw a couple of folks ask for specific toppings and it was only a short wait.  While not a huge pizza fan there was nothing wring with any of those I sampled.  For a lunch buffet it was quite reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Was at Peter Piper Pizza for my oldest grandson's 4th birthday, it was a sat afternoon and you can tell this place makes it dough from doing kids birthday parties.    There were enough games to entertain the little ones, my other grandson was a little moody and wanted all the tickets, so my son and I played some games to get him more tickets, and when it came to redeeming them my son was trying to tell him what he could get, but he was dead set on having this off road bike toy which was out of his ticket range, the guy behind the booth just told my grandson that he had enough tickets and the bike is his, that guy just made my lil ones day!   This is definitely a place for kids, this isn't fancy pizza,   but the staff is friendly and helpful and the kids had a blast, and isn't that what it's all about? The kids?"}
{"text":"Let's be up-front and honest.  This is not a place I would just go to as an adult unless I was trying to do something special for the kids.  That being said, I do NOT like most kiddy pizza places and had previously sworn to never have a party at such places, but this PPP changed my mind!  We had a work party here with families for \"Take Your Daughter to Work Day.\"  It was a wonderful experience.  Great food (they even made a special cheeseless pie for one of our team members who had a dairy allergy), very clean, and the staff was amazing!  The kids and adults loved their time.  We will be back!  Thanks for a wonderful event. Thanks.  I especially appreciated the gentleman who manned the arcade prize station.  He was exceptionally patient with my 7 year old who Just could not decide how to spend her tickets."}
{"text":"Not sure why people are complaining about PPP, it's pizza joint geared towards letting kids run amuck ( having fun), they do need to churn out pizza in record time to appease the masses, if you want gourmet pizza and sides , maybe Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante, is better suited for you. I went in today , they had gotten my pizza order wrong, no biggie since Tristan the oven guy offered to replace it, so they did. I want to thank the Manger George and the oven guy Tristan for hooking me up and squared away everything."}
{"text":"15 years of eating here, last month or so it's not the same. Bland and tasteless.  Night manager very rude. Made corp. Complaint and no real help.  Think I'm done . A shame after a great product for so long , they change, don't tell you and expect loyal customers to keep coming in for the new inferior product.  NOPE!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter Loves this place! The pizza isn't too bad and the lunch buffet is a great price. This is always a good lunch date for mommy/daughter.  Service is always good and sssh! They have beer and wine here!  Eat that Chuck E Cheese!"}
{"text":"Love this location!  Its spacious, updated, CLEAN, with SUPER FRIENDLY STAFF & MANAGEMENT. The games are so cool l & age appropriate for my 3 year old niece. The games are different, updated and better than any we've ever seen before.  The pizza buffet always rocks, but this location is busy so they're trying to pump out as fast as they can... you may have to wait a minute... But that's ok... There are about 16 flat screens with cartons, news & other programs on at once... A good time had by all!!!"}
{"text":"This location is the same like all the others.  Ordering station, tables, games section, and prizes.  Some kids I use to babysit are all teenagers now, they wanted to re-live their PPP days.  We met up there to catch up!  It was easy to find, huge parking lot, the place was not packed to the gills with kiddie birthday parties (sat afternoon), and it was clean!  The pizza tasted better than I remembered.  The wings were ok.  They had a great everyday deals on the menu.  We got the 2 large & 20 wings.  I had a great time getting caught with everyone's lifes and sharing memories."}
{"text":"All PPP have the same layout.  This one I have to say is cleaner than the others.  Kids are everywhere!!!  The pizza was not bad.  The wings are not too bad either.  They did an excellent job on my friend kid's birthday.  The person dedicated to the party she got every detail down and timed it just right.  Everyone had a great time."}
{"text":"Their pizza is still pretty good after all of these years. I remember when we used to go swimming when I was a kid and then right after we would go for pizza at Peter Piper. Well I won't bore you with my whole life story but just to say that a fond childhood memory still holds true as an adult. Not like I though it was good as a child and then as an adult it tastes like crap, it's not like that here. Never go on the weekends unless you like crowds and screaming maniacal children. In this location there is an ice cream shop and a pet store, sounds to me like a recipe for success; pizza, ice cream and puppies?"}
{"text":"Always packed to the walls on the weekends so plan accordingly. As usual, no gourmet pizza here of course but I still love coming here because they make a super tasty pizza! It reminds me of my childhood."}
{"text":"Had my son's birthday party here today, and our party host was Rayna. She was great, and very friendly. My only complaints are that the pizzas could definitely use some more cheese! (Which is why I give 4 stars) Come on, these are not $5 pizzas, and some of our slices didn't have any cheese AT ALL. And I asked a couple girls in the kitchen to throw my son's personal pizza in early, and they erroneously told our host that we were upset with her!!! We were not. Honestly, I doubt she's paid enough for as hard as she works, and we've already requested her for our next birthday party. Thanks, Rayna!"}
{"text":"It's meh. Didn't care for it. Chuck E. Cheese is better. Heck! CiCi's Pizza is better and I don't even like them... Arcade is lame. Pizza has a rubber texture... Just didn't care for it. First and last time here. I think I'm better off going to Little Caesar's being entertained by how long it takes for 2 people to make 1 Hot and \"Not Ready\" pizza"}
{"text":"I LOVE peter piper pizza. That said the last 2 times I have ordered carry out have been a disappointment. Maybe just this location or this team but it is getting bad. 3 weeks ago it was over an hour for my 2 pizzas. All of that wait and they were dry and over cooked. I got a credit that I used today and when I went in for my 2 pizzas only one was done. They completely forgot about my second one???? Well I get home and open the box and same thing. 2 dry and over cooked pizzas. Please do better PPP. I'm not happy with my dinner. One more strike and I will have to move on for good."}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza is a kid's dream lunch or dinner destination and easy on a parent's wallet.  It's got a mediocre but good enough pizza buffet that's really reasonably priced and a big kid play area with video games and misc activities.  The staff there is mostly teenage kids but they're patient enough with the little ones.  I enjoyed my time here.  I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place but then, it's hard to be constantly cleaning up after billions of kids. haha  Might see you here!"}
{"text":"This is the only location with an air hockey table, but the table sucks. The skee ball machine didn't dispense tickets, either. Aside from that the food and service are decent, and the kiddos love it."}
{"text":"Kids love it...I always cringe over the germs! The kids always seem to be sick a couple days after a visit. Prizes are always over \"priced\"."}
{"text":"I love coming here with the kids. Great food and fun for them as well. It is my number one lunch spot."}
{"text":"Really came through for me the other day, I ordered a couple pizzas for a carry out order and it was done on time In the midst of a very busy Saturday."}
{"text":"$5.99 all you can eat special. .. 2 thumbs up They have great TV monitors and I asked them to change the channel and with gladness  they did."}
{"text":"My kids had fun and they had free WiFi, but the pizza was like eating raw dough. We ordered a pepperoni and the crust was not cooked. This was our first time coming here to eat, and we probably will eat before we come next time. Not very good food at all... everything else was good tho. Dave and busters is way better."}
{"text":"Due to previous reviews, I was uncertain in going to this location. But, was the most convenient. The staff was not very chipper and seemed more annoyed than unfriendly. A few games took our coins but the majority worked fine. It was not overcrowded and the kids had fun.  All in all, we would be happy to go back."}
{"text":"The kiddo wanted to go here for some pizza and games so we went. I have to say this new location is nice inside. The arcade at the old location was bigger. I used to love peter piper pizza when I was a kid. I think it was the cornmeal on the bottom, gave it that crunch. I was disappointed that our pizza didn't have that this time. The boneless wings were good and the pizza was OK, but the kiddo had a great time winning tickets to get a toy at the counter and she ate all her pizza. So mission accomplished. All about the kiddo!!! She's happy and were happy. When we were leaving there was a large group of thug like teenagers and there little group of girls and the were intentionally getting in our way and making it difficult to get out the door and get to our car. I forgot i was at Ghetto-Center. One kid had his pants on to his knees then two other pairs of shorts above that then his boxers sticking out above that. lol There is no way he looks in the mirror and says I look good. Anyway fun for the kid but I don't like the Ghetto-Center area so probably wont be taking the kiddo back there again."}
{"text":"There was a line out the door for the buffet. Only one person working the register . The restaurant is a hot mess express. There was crying kids and babies. Parents drinking pitchers of beer while there kids turned up! Other then that the pizza was bomb and so was the salad! That's why i give it 3 stars!"}
{"text":"I called in 20 minutes before closing to order a pizza. I told them girl on the phone I was 15 mins away. She said they couldn't take the order because they closed in 10 minutes. Just to be sure we were in the same time zone, I said, \"so you close at 10:50pm?\". She said yes. I realize it may not have been the most convenient, but I would have picked up my pizza and left while they were still open."}
{"text":"Had a gift certificate that incorrectly said only valid in Las Vegas. The manager was quick to comp it despite needing to override his system. Thanks Tim the manager!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved and this PPP is 2 minutes away so I wanted some pizza and decided to go since I've always preferred PPP over others. So today I went in to buy a large pepperoni pizza and some wings. So I go to order and tell the lady that I'd like a large pan pepperoni pizza and I ask the lady if she could make sure that the pizza had ENOUGH cheese not extra cheese because ive gotten it before where the cheese slides off or idk what but point is it's mostly sauce so I explained that to her and she tells me that she can do light sauce and I don't want light sauce so I said and then she goes I can do extra cheese for $2 and I told her once again I dont want extra I just want to make sure the pizza is fully covered by the cheese. She repeated her two options and I finally said ok just leave it how it is. (Ive had the same request at other locations and they've all said \"yeah no problem ma'am\") but water I paid and that was it. the wait time was as usual about 20 minutes and when I go pick it up the pizza looks decent but I was still waiting for the rest of my order (the wings) so I stand there and a male employee comes and asks what I need and I reply that I am waiting on wings and need plates, peppers and cheese. He practically throws the bag with the stuff in it at me and I'm still standing there and he asks if I needed anything else I said yes my wings so he goes into the kitchen and gets the box of wings and again slides/throws them towards me and I'm like where's the ranch and the veggies... he goes and grabs the ranch puts in the box and he  looks at me as to why I'm still standing there and again I say \"doesn't this come with veggies?\" He replies idk and goes and asks the lady that was making the wings so she gives him the veggies and he comes and throws them at me and walks away I grab the little piece of shit bag and notice there is a 2 little slices of carrots and 2 of celery! Wtf am I going to do with 4 little fucking veggies?! So I stop lady that was walking by that had on a black polo I'm guessing is like a supervisor and ask her if that's all they gave and she said yes two and two and walked away  she didn't even offer to give me another stupid bag. I wanted to throw that fucking little bag back at her but i ain't her stupid employees!! So at that point I was starving and just wanted to come and eat my pizza and I get home and realize these stingyass motherfuckers only gave me 2 peppers and 2 Parmesan cheese for a LARGE FUCKING  PIZZA! Like seriously! Wtf!! How many do they give out for a medium? I'm so disappointed in their service not even when I lived in the hood did I get service this bad! It's so annoying that this is the closest location to me!!  And I only gave them the two stars because I still like their pizza..."}
{"text":"I like the pizza it's really good , every time I go to this location all the managers I have encountered are very nice and have excellent service, they always smile! the buffet is cheap my kids love it!"}
{"text":"When I first moved her it was hard to find good pizza that my daughter liked. This place has great pizza! Kids have fun and they have wine! So mommas happy about that!! Weekends are crowded with bday parties so we come during the week. The prizes are a good value for the tickets earned. I like when it's quiet and I can watch my daughter while I'm eating."}
{"text":"I used to go to Peter Piper when I was a little kid, so I was excited to find out that they were and still are building some here in Vegas! First thought: very clean and great lighting, lots of space to maneuver to and from the kid's game room. Flat screens at every angle. The pricing is reasonable and they have bundle/family deals to where you can get pizza,drinks, and tokens altogether.  Food: we got the chicken alfredo pizza, pepperoni pizza, chopped salad with ranch and croutons, & $20 worth of tokens = 100 tokens total (bundle Token deal). Their pizza is still delicious 10 years later! I was not disappointed! Still one of my favorite pizzas!  The staff deserves five stars! Or even more! They were all friendly and eager to help with anything that you may need. Great customer service right when you walk through the doors.  The only not so great thing is the game room. I wish it had more games, but we all still had a lot of fun! The prizes are like any other prizes; candy and knock knacks for the kids. Although 20 tickets for one Swedish fish is a bit much when I was only getting like two tickets from some machines."}
{"text":"Local school had a fundraising event and we used a raffle prize for a free pizza here. It's similar to Chuck E Cheese, but a lot less games and area for the kids to play.  Probably better suited to 9, 10 and 11 yr olds moreso than 5, 6 or 7, although that age can have fun here as well.  Pizza was very good and cheesy.  Had a prepackaged cranberry/sunflower salad which was very good.  Didn't realize the game tickets were valued at 2 each ticket, so when we hit the 600 ticket jackpot and only got 300 tickets, we were wondering what the deal was, so we went to get a staff to help us get the remaining tickets, and then found out (silly us!)  They were very nice about it and actually gave us an extra 200 tickets so we could get the desired prize - that was awesome. Good place, would probably go again."}
{"text":"We do field trips for my work here and every time we go is a great time. The facility is neat and clean. The staff are friendly and welcoming. They are great hosts. The food is good for the price you pay.   The only thing is that it takes a little while to get food you order, but still worth the visit"}
{"text":"The pizza was ok.  My younger son wanted mac and cheese and it came out way after the pizza which made it difficult since he is only 4.  It came out super hot, gooey and delicious.  I think next time I  will order it for myself.  The game room is kinda small and the games all take multiple tokens which can get expensive.  It is clean and organized.  Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Peter Piper pizza is one of my favorite pizza since I was young. The only issue today I bought $20 for 100 tokens, the register gave me 2 coins. I put 1 coin in the machine and tokens came out. I put another coin and tokens came out. I counted the coins so I can evenly distribute them to 3 kids. (2 of my sons and a friend of my son). There were only 50 coins instead of 100 that I paid for. I told a worker out front about the issue (same girl that took my order). She stated this has happened before. She went to tell her manager and came back and told me that they wouldn't give me the other 50 tokens. I told her she can have the tokens back and give me a refund. She went to talk to her manager and came back to give me 50 tokens. If this issue happened before then why did she give me trouble the first time to give me tokens I paid for. I am not trying to steal tokens and I want to get what I paid for. I am glad I got the tokens after asking for a refund. The real  issue I am not happy with is having to ask twice. I wish they can check their cameras and see what happened that I only got 50 instead of 100. This may not seem like a big issue. But customers should always get what they pay for. I do not remember the girl I talked to and it's not my job to do so. I do not want anything in return other than Peter piper pizza to improve their customer service and make sure customers get what they pay for."}
{"text":"Very courteous and fair priced such a great location for families to enjoy celebrating kids birthdays etc.  I would only ask that they concentrate a little on spacing things out right but that's all great service !"}
{"text":"Always great.  Always excellent customer service. Always excellent food. My cholesterol levels remained stable, despite regularly dining at Peter Piper Pizza."}
{"text":"I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about."}
{"text":"Pizza buffet from 11 am to 2 pm as well as salad bar... Its pretty empty so, there is little to no line to choose your slices..."}
{"text":"I used to love Peter Piper Pizza. I don't know what's happened to them but at this location it's terrible. Gave them one more try today and it will be the last time. Pizza was horrible. Slimy and disgusting. So much sauce that the crust was soaked with it. Don't know why they can't evenly distribute the pepperoni. Not that it mattered as the pizza went in the garbage."}
{"text":"A great place to let the kids blow off steam on days with severe heat advisories!   Better pizza, games & prices than a place I will only refer to as Chucks :D Granted, the space is smaller & 90% of the tables are reserved for parties (seriously, there should be a limit on how many tables can be reserved!). If you just want to let the kids run around for a bit and eat some pizza without a party reservation, you'll want to send a scout ahead of you to find and hold a table.... not even kidding.  The quality of the pizza is not what it would be at other pizza establishments geared towards adult taste buds, but this place IS geared more at entertaining your kids than it is at providing gourmet pizza. As long as the kids are happy, safe & entertained, I'll eat what they give me happily, lol!   There is no mascot in costume OR 'show', but they have games for all ages, not just toddlers, so that's a plus! There are also 3 televisions set up in the dinning area & they are normally set to sports."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. The pizza tastes great. The cheesy bread is even better. I wished all games were only 1 token and not 2 but still great games. This location is clean. When there is a school function it does get packed and difficult to find seating but an employee will help find a seat and/or clean off a table that was just recently left."}
{"text":"I never give bad reviews but Do Not Eat here.   The staff lost pur party reservation.  We stayed anyway because we had no where else to go.     They were sloooow.   I goy my food 30 min after people in my party but I ordered before them.    I guess my order was too difficult...an extra large Cheese Pizza..when I finally got it it was not done..the dough wasnt done..  If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Went to pick up a quick couple of pizza's on my way home from a long day at work. We called the order in. When I went to pick it up there was a nice young man to give me my pizza. He was clearly new and still learning the ropes. There was a manager standing right behind him taking pizza's out of the oven. He was clearly asking her for help. She seemed irritated and didn't want to be bothered. I felt really bad for the kid that was trying his best to just ring up my order. There were 2 people behind me so after no apologies for making me wait and just helping the kid she just found my order in the system and walked away. Rude! Someone needs to have a conversation with her about not only customer service but just common courtesy to her fellow employees!"}
{"text":"We ordered a big order today and it was hot and ready within 12 minutes for pick up.   The cheeses and dough has improved in the past year and people should give it a try again.  A group of 13 eat these four pizzas in 15 minutes or less."}
{"text":"We went to a birthday party at this location today. My disabled brother misplaced his phone, and we never found it. We told management and Chris was on his hands and knees searching high and low for my brothers phone. What a sweet guy. Will definitely be back. He's a great person."}
{"text":"Love Peter Piper Pizza! What can get better then having a good tasting pizza and my daughter being able to run around and play games? She's 18 months old so I don't have to even give her tokens she just loves to walk around and look at things but when she sees the machine with the claw and you have to grab a ball in the perfect spot to get one... she just loves getting the bouncy balls with the spikes :) I think she has almost 10 in every color! Great spot for kids to run around and not have to struggle to keep your child quiet and in their seat at other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a very small location and CAN BE overwhelming at times. However, this is one of my families prime locations to visit I've never had a problem with management or my orders. They are constantly cleaning up after people which is a plus! Not to mention me and my son always hit the \"jackpot\" on two machines! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Me and my family enjoy going to Peter Piper Pizza at this location. Our kids enjoy the food, and the games. The staff was nice to us and our table was clean."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and I was pretty impressed.   Its not as big as Chuckie Cheese or John's Incredible but it does get the job done in taking your kids out for pizza and games. I'm glad they opened this place in this area because they have nothing for kids in the area.   I attended my God son's t-ball party and all the kids had a blast. Lots of table room and the arcade are isn't that big but easier to keep your eyes on your kids. The pizza was pretty good, bread stick was yummy and the wings were great.    The staff that took care of our party was great. Everything went smooth and we had a blast. Thank you."}
{"text":"This location was a horrible experience. Why 2 stars you ask? Because my son loved the food. Otherwise, this was a solid 1-Star experience. Game after game stole tokens from my son, who was there to celebrate some awesome school behavior. Motorcycles, the ball drop with the gears, balloon game, skee ball and more all took tokens and didn't work correctly or at all. Skee ball only counted 3 balls as part of the game. A number of games had tokens jammed inside of them so they were unplayable. Some games worked but didn't dispense the tickets my son won. Did the facility post an out of order sign on the games we reported? Nope. Did they try to make up for the problem?  Nope. Did they give him the tickets he won when the game malfunctioned? Nope. I actually got sick of reporting the problems because nothing was done about them.  I'm super sad because we love to go to PPP to celebrate special occasions and positive school outcomes. I guess we have to find a different location. =("}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring the kids or hold a birthday party. We've had 2 of my son's parties at Peter Piper and everyone has a blast. The pizza is really good too, I have to admit. My favorite is the veggie with jalapenos. What I like most about this PP is that it's always clean. I've been to other pizza/party places that smell bad when you walk in. Never the case here."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you have a screaming kid with snot pouring out of their nose and want to be around parents who scream at their screaming kids with snot pouring out of their noses.  Their only saving grace used to be that they served Blue Moon on tap so being there was at least tolerable...oh and that really gross wine in a pre-made glass. Now, since Chuckecheese bought Peter Piper, they've replaced Blue Moon with Bud. Bad move, Peter Piper, bad move.  Anyway, we stop here once in awhile before swim lessons for our toddler to let her enjoy the games and spectacle. Pizza is decent, prices are ok, cleanliness, not so much. Be sure to bring a lot of hand sanitizer for your kid."}
{"text":"Obviously being Italian, I love to eat pizza as you can read by my other reviews on pizza places!  Thanks God I work out!!! Total Calorie OVERLOAD!  LOL  I have eaten inside the restaurant and taken out many times!  As far at the eat in dining experience, it's clean and organized, the buffet should have more items on it \"kinda Basic\" Compared to CICI's, it seems to be set up more for children and parties than a sit down date!  I would rather take out and bring it home and watch the movie of my choice!  It fact it has a gaming area for kids.  Yes, no peace and quit!  :(  As far as the pizza, it is eatable, you can taste individual ingredients on the pizza, but I've had pizza around the world and PPP is average!  The staff has always been professional and timely!  Are there better, Yes, would I eat take out again, Yes, do i recommend to eat dine in, no unless you have kids or a group party!  Then its OK!"}
{"text":"We're originally from NM where Peter Piper Pizza is a big deal. We really wanted to have our son's birthday party at Peter Piper Pizza this year but after reading the reviews on Yelp we weren't too sure if it would be a good or bad experience. I'm so glad we still decided to go with Peter Piper Pizza and we chose the Decatur/Sahara location. It was the best customer service experience we've had in a very long time. The staff and management were very friendly and helpful even though we only purchased the Do It Yourself birthday package. The food was just as we remembered and everyone had a wonderful time. We had children from ages 2 to 12 and they all had a great time with the games. Most games were only 1-2 tokens each which is very reasonable. There was always someone at the prize station ready to help our guests turn in their tickets for prizes. There were multiple parties going on and it was still a very fun and comfortable experience. Management and staff checked on us and everyone regularly and they were very pleasant. The dining area and bathrooms were very clean. Again, I can't say THANK YOU!!! enough to the staff and management. You really helped make our son's birthday party a success. We will definitely be going back for parties and just to eat."}
{"text":"This place cool for kids so I gave it a three. Their pizza is just whatever, and their booths are made for 12 years and younger. My American self could barely squeeze in. They do have tables that pull out to whatever size you need. But when the boss lady wants a booth, you get a booth. And I am not talking about my wife, I am referring to the spoiled brats of the millennial parents, my daughter. Anyways, food is just ok, entertainment for kids is $$ and you only get a .10 cent Chinese toy that you could get a bag full at the dollar store, but you went to PPP and paid $20 for tokens so your kid could enjoy that cheap cappy toy. And then later you will enjoy heartburn and some toilet time for the honors. Yeah!! Sign me up to double tokens!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! For years we have preferred this place over many, well known, pizza parlors! They don't deliver, but we didn't mind picking up our pizzas, because they were that much better! Last week we ordered 3 pizzas, each one different from the others, and they were bad! The sauce has obviously been replaced with a cheaper, ketchup tasting sauce, and the pizza was soggy and limp! Now we are a quest to find another good pizza place! Not what it used to be! D-"}
{"text":"We had a kids party here with about 7 kids.  The place was pretty clean and the arcade center was alright.  The pizza was overly expensive for its quality, but the kids didn't seem to mind as much as the parents did.  Overall it was a good experience for the kids and an okay experience for the adults.  But I guess that may just be the way it is."}
{"text":"Fun to hang out or have a party. The pizza kind of tastes like frozen pizza but can't expect much when coming to places like this. Overall a pretty good time."}
{"text":"Foods awesome a few games for the kids. The place was great it's been years since I've been to peter piper pizza....how I missed this place growing up!!! However I open carry everyday every I go no matter what and everywhere I go I carefully exam the place I'm visiting for restrictions on open carry firearms. I was asked very rudely to why I was carrying my firearm and was told that I couldn't have that in here which ok then in a unprofessional manner she said that were signs that I couldn't have firearms while dining with my family here so after going out to my car because we were still eating and my niece still needed to use her token after dinner I went to leave my firearm in my car and inspecting the building even more carefully no signs were posted at the front doors AT ALL so this place can choke"}
{"text":"We came here for an 8 year old's birthday.  It was fun because we were with family but other than that the pizza was less than desirable.  If I was 8 I suppose I would have enjoyed the games a lot more.  I wish they could add some old school 80's games to these places.  They had playoff basketball on though so I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"so far the past 3 times we have been here, they have always forgotten the apps and or forgot a topping on a pie and forgot the desert pizza, sometimes a cup or two. all together makes this place undesireable. The kids were playing on the play land structure and they were saying how it smelled like vomit inside.....YUMMY! not sure everyone here really cares about their job...at least this particular shift. I will not be returning to this location.  enough is enough"}
{"text":"I work in an ER, the Doctor ordered pizzas for the staff. A co-worker suggested Peter Piper Pizza. Three employees are Vegetarian. The order was placed for a veggie pizza and one with meet. The pizzas are picked up and there's no veggie pizza. We call Peter Piper pizza only to be told by the RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL Manager Stephanie that we \"did not order a veggie pizza\", but we could bring the pizza back and she would make a veggie pizza. My reply was were not able to come back at this time as we are an ER and are currently busy. RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL Stephanie never apologized for the mistake nor suggested a credit for the inconvenience. This location has lost several customers. Stephanie needs a class in customer service."}
{"text":"My child's school was having a fund raiser at this Peter Piper. It started at 4:00 pm, we were the first ones to arrive, the place was pretty empty, so you would think that it being a fundraiser night, the games would have been stocked with tickets and worked properly. Nope ! For one, when the game shows you have won 20 tickets, you actually get 10. You get half of the tickets that it shows. Most of the games were out of tickets, we kept having to inform the staff of this and it really got on our nerves. A hispanic woman who looked like she may have been the manager was very rude, clueless and unhelpful. The employees have no problem in showing the customers that they clearly hate their jobs. Some of the customers were part of the fundraiser and some were just regular customers. I didn't enjoy most of the fellow customers there as Border Patrol would have had a field day in there. The children were loud, rude, misbehaving and foul smelling. We ordered a pan pizza which was not cooked all the way through. It was very doughy in the middle. It was a nightmare. I won't go to this particular restaurant again."}
{"text":"I come here every weekend with my family. (McClintock & Baseline) We love this place!! We live in Laveen, AZ and we still make the drive. The pizza is delicious! I love how clean it is an the environment. The managers especially Lucy an employees are awesome! Yes they may sometimes may not be having a good day. But we are all human and you have to respect that. I dont get the bad reviews everywhere you go you will always encounter something bad. I have been coming here for 6 years an I am a very satisfied customer!!"}
{"text":"Had a blast here with my wife and son. $20 in coins goes a long way.  It was the perfect place to bring my son after he went to the doctor for his check up (he had 4 shots!).   Pizza was fantastic as always and the employees were happy to exchange my sons tickets for toys.   5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"This Peter piper is the worst of the worst ordered a pizza went to pick it up nobody ever came to counter after 15 min!! They have some bad management issues to say the least!!"}
{"text":"It's 830 there are 8 people working behind the counter and no one is old enough to pour beer!! Or they don't have time to!! No one has gloves on!! If this was Hells Kitchen you would of heard \"everybody get out!!!!\""}
{"text":"We had a great time celebrating our son's 11th birthday party. Racquet was our party hostess and she made our experience top notch... her service was excellent, her attitude was above and beyond, and she always had a smile on her face. She shined with her magnetic energy and made our experience seamless. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my friends at the peter piper pizza. Great service from the cashier. I'll definitely come again soon, it's very close to my living complex!"}
{"text":"Over-sauced, over-greased, and over-priced!  First, let me start off by saying that Peter Piper Pizza CAN be good.  Despite my introductory statement, I am actually somewhat of a fan of Peter Piper Pizza - my ex's sister was a GM of a Peter Piper store, and the pies that came out of her location were awesome!    Based on past experiences, I can say that Peter Piper Pizza has the potential to be good - very good, in fact.  The problem is, that it can be VERY \"hit or miss.\"  We've been to this location several times, and unfortunately there have been more \"misses\" than \"hits.\"  One time the pizza was very good, but the last two times the pizzas have been absolutely saturated with sauce and grease - enough sauce and grease to float a boat!  We were here on 4/22/17, and I really felt compelled to write this review because of how soggy our pizza was.  $14 for an XL pepperoni - 2 Little Caesar's $5 pepperoni's would have been better - and cheaper!  Unless you like your pizza extra-soggy, I'd suggest you telling them to go easy on the sauce when you order!"}
{"text":"To say the pizza was not so great would be a compliment. I didn't go in to the business with high expectations to begin with since I realize that they cater to kids. I was looking for a quick and hopefully inexpensive pizza with the understanding that this wasn't a gourmet food chain. In my opinion though, the price should be a reflection of the quality, care and time that went into a product or menu item and this was not the case here. The pizza was horrible and for the same price or a couple bucks more get a gourmet pizza at a real Italian restaurant (or get 2 to 3 frozen pizzas that would be better tasting). Service wasn't any better than the food. I ordered two side salads with my pizza and was told they were out of them at the moment but they would come out with the pizza, I said OK. It seemed to be taking a long time for the pizza so I went to the pick up counter and asked \"is there was any chance I could get my salads before the pizza?\". The person behind the counter says \"I can upgrade that to a garden salad which is twice the size, is that OK?\", I said sure. He leaves and comes back with ONE garden salad. I said \"I ordered two salads\", he replies that \"one garden salad is the same as two side salads you just split it\". Oh, how nice of this person to assume the other person I'm eating with is comfortable enough to share out of the same bowl! Not cool! On another occasion I went to the the same counter to ask a question and the manager saw I was there and ignored me. I took about 40 minutes for them to get our pizza out and they were not that busy. I also witnessed many people go to the pick up counter to complain about their orders being wrong or taking taking to long in the time I was there. All in all bad food and bad service. This was my first and last visit. Date of visit 5/22/11"}
{"text":"Place is kind of like Chuck E. Cheese's, but I think their food is better here. The combos you can purchase, ones that come with tokens, are very reasonable. We found ourselves doing the buffet every time we went there, and the only complaint was they could never pump out the easier pizzas that everyone wanted (cheese mainly, and pepperoni). We are a fan, and the munchkin loved all the little toys he got there too."}
{"text":"I waited in the carry out line, got skipped twice by the cashier who helped a customer who was still reviewing the menu and got in the regular ordering line after me. Another group came in after the initial woman and they were still helped before me. I was finally asked to move to the regular line and on my way out I saw another customer walk into the carry out line and be helped immediately by another person who was behind the register. On the phone ordering I was told to stop in at the carry out line. Need more staff and better customer service."}
{"text":"over crowded, under staffed, and not very clean.  my suggestion would be to go on a Monday or Tuesday.  It is not a fun place for little ones any more. Apparently now tweens and teens like to spend friday nights there instead of at the mall"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Peter Piper Pizza and was pleasantly surprised. I've passed by P.P.P. many times and have friends that go to them all the time with their kids and just pictured in my head someplace wild and full of crazy kids running about so I've just never really had a desire to come here to eat. But after passing this particular location a few times and never seeing the parking lot very full, I decided to come at lunch to try out their AYCE pizza buffet.   Prices are very reasonable for a buffet. Adults are $6.49 and kids 10 and under are $4.49. This includes unlimited pizza, salad, breadsticks, and dessert. The drink is an extra cost. Was a bit surprised that they didn't offer any kind of pasta as all other pizza buffet places I've been to offer at least a basic spaghetti.   I came around 12ish on a Monday and the place was pretty empty. Probably 5 other families there, so I was able to pay for my food immediately. By the time I was getting ready to leave, the place started to get packed with the lunch crowd. The buffet was full of many different pizzas from just cheese, pepperoni, veggie, pepperoni and jalapeno, ham and pineapple and many other flavors. The salads were a little empty when I got there, but they quickly filled them up. I started out with a couple slices of veggie and another one that I thought was a spicy one, but it turned out to be a cheese with jalapenos and drizzled with a BBQ sauce, so it was kind of sweet. I also tried out two of the 3 salads. Both were very tasty. I didn't bother to try out the desserts, but they did look good as well.   Pizzas were thin crust with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. I was pretty surprised at the quality of food they offered here for the price. In my opinion, their pizzas are better quality than Cici's.   The place was large with plenty of tables and booths to accommodate large groups. I'm sure that during the weekend this place would get super busy, so I'm glad I decided to come during the week.    The staff here made sure to walk around and make sure that tables were cleaned off and the floors were swept if they needed to be cleaned. The lady at the register was very sweet and worked quickly to get peoples orders out to them as fast as possible.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"What you expect I guess. Busy given school is over (expected). Food a bit over priced and under quality (expected) :/  Pizza used to be quite good...LOVED their mushroom pizza, but decided to get Cali veggie w jalapeños to bulk up the meal without adding calories.  Bummed it didn't have my mushrooms and the crust was awful...like cardboard:/ Original \"favorite for 40 years\"?  I think not.  The kids had a good time and got what they wanted out of the night. Enough games to give them options without bleeding me dry or them getting lost in a huge game room. Still, it'll probably be another year before I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I Visit this location as we were invited to a friends birthday party. It was much more peaceful than any other PPP I've ever been too. I can not give this place 5 stars as I did not eat anything. I will sure be back to this location."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! When I got there, it was jam packed. I think the personnel value their costumers really much. The cashier remembers me. I called them before I went to verify whether they accept coupons.  The only thing that I had a VERY LITTLE issue is logistics. With the very long lines which i did not really mind, the establishment should have some signage that lead costumers to the correct lines."}
{"text":"much better service, games and prices at chunky cheese, it's pretty bad when the technical mgr. won't let a kid go a little over on ticket count especially when several times the games take your token and then don't work"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever, and this location is always nice and clean! It's our go to every time."}
{"text":"I am here as we speak.  I've been coming here for over 12 years now. When I walked in, I was disgusted to see pizza crusts, napkins and wrappers all over the floors and tables. I could not find one clean table, so I got a napkin and dusted one down.  I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to order unless there is a huge line.  However today, the manager I'm guessing who is all dressed in black did not even greet us or tell us it would be a minute before me and another person waited in line to order.   He was totally avoiding the cash register! He was slowly loading pizza in and out of the oven as if he were spaced out !finally a girl came out from the shadows  Then on top of that,  my kids went to get drinks, and once they sat down and tasted it, they said it tasted funny! So I took a sip, they said they got coke, and it tasted like straight water !  I really don't know what the deal is, but I am hoping that the pizza comes out right ! If not, you will get a more epic review Peter Piper on Thomas !"}
{"text":"They need to really work on their service and the speed of their food orders. Yes there was an event going on but lets have more than 1 cash register person. They messed up multiple peoples orders including mine. Waited 30 minutes for 2 kids pizza's. They need to improve a lot before I go back."}
{"text":"Gross my roomate brought this home one night. I would never recommend peter to anyone!  It is cheap and discusting! Parents who feed their children this should be jailed for child abuse."}
{"text":"This review is for the manager. I don't know what his name is but he made me feel like a liar. As a female veteran of 12 years, I understand that it may come off as a surprise when I inquire about any discounts offered as I don't necessarily look like a 31 year old let alone a veteran but thats what my credentials are for. When I presented my creds to the manager he kind of smirked and said \"This is fake\" to which I replied \"No, but I also have a military photo of myself for when I'm challenged.\" when I showed him that photo, which I shouldn't have needed to show him in the first place, he commented \" this is from ROTC\" to which I stated \"No, but I was 18 in this picture.\" I was given the 10% discount but the embarassment of my service being challanged wasn't worth it.  I felt belittled and embarassed.. I felt like a liar when I'm not. Thanks for the $2 off but lucky for me, I wont be visiting again to need it."}
{"text":"Service is amazing! Staff is super friendly and the place is huge! Lunch buffet is awesome because it has pizza, pasta and salads and it's pretty cheap. They have beer for adults and a huge gaming area for kids. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this PPP for a couple of years , and for whatever reason I have never reviewed it .  This location is one of the cleanest you will ever visit . All of the toys are in working order and there is plenty of staff around to keep your food orders flowing quickly . The pizza is ok. It was hot , fresh and made to order but the flavor and quality just really isn't there . be honest though... you aren't coming to PPP for the pizza ! You are coming for the kiddo entertainment and a chance to relax . Their prices are reasonable and you can always use coupons to maximize your savings ."}
{"text":"The memories of childhood past have mislead me. For some reason that I cannot explain I had a craving for Peter Piper Pizza last night or so I thought. I had not been to a Peter Piper in about three years and even then I had just gone in for the lunch buffet.  So we decided to go ahead and give this location a try last night. It was disappointing. We ordered a medium original crust with pepperoni and jalapeno. The crust was like cardboard. The rest just okay.  The real problem was the cleanliness of the place. I understand that along with being a pizza restaurant that this is also a children's entertainment center but I do not understand how piles of trash end up on the floor. I should have made the decision to leave after seeing the condition of the dining room but we had already ordered and I decided to give the pizza a shot.  Basically, I am worried for what the state of the kitchen looks like based on the state of the dining room. I would not suggest this location of Peter Piper Pizza. I am not sure about the others but stear clear of this one."}
{"text":"Total guilty pleasure. Yep, place is small compare to other locations, but a recent renovation makes it ok. We visit the buffet once or twice a month. Office is close by, so its easy. Cant beat the price. I am however impressed that each time I go, one of the ladies working there puts in an order for a veggie pizza if none is on the buffet. Something I appreciate as a vegetarian, and impresses me from a customer service perspective.   the place seems to have a loyal clientele of locals, working in the neighborhood, and families trying ti feed and entertain kids. Its not gourmet, but a harty lunch fir a really decent price."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at this chain in a while, the food is still great just got an update stomach watching an employee dust the air vents over open containers and food. I think there's a better time to do this type of cleaning out at least contain the area before hand. And not to mention he went straight back to touching the food \"without gloves\" immediately after. Protect your customers and their children, there's enough germs in this place."}
{"text":"I don't care how old you are, and if Peter piper pizza seems like a kid place. I'll come here with my friends who are all 21+, buy a few pitchers of beer, play some video games and enjoy some good pizza"}
{"text":"I tried to leave petey piper a note about my wings last night...ordering wings seemed an easy solution to another round of boring 0scars and - the wings, not The Oscars - were very G00D!.   I love the wings at Peter Piper. I do.   Why?  They're baked. Not fried. Baked. Baked is better, and anymore, not more expensive. Used to be, not anymore.   But the reason for a complimentary note was, I ordered sauce on side and the sauce was OUTSTANDING!  A jabeñero sauce that was DELICIOUS!!  Sweet and then hot. Perfect.  So sweet in the beginning, gets hotter, a great, great sauce. So good, I kept the rest for later.   Baked wings with just the right amount of sauce...my amount.   Here are 2 problems:   * 1) if you click on \"customize my order\", which I did, you're given options, but not the ability to write a message to the food handler. This is an error.   As a customer I need the ability to communicate, obviously in a few words, what exactly I want. In this case what I wanted was MORE sauce on side. This Peter Piper option would only allow me to ask for sauce on side, not MORE sauce on side.   * 2nd) look at the photos attached. I wanted to leave Corporate  a complimentary note, a compliment.  But upon hitting the \"leave a note\" option, I was informed that Peter Piper didn't receive surveys any longer. I didn't take a survey, submit a survey didn't want to take a survey but for some reason leaving them a note, at corporate, isn't possible. WTF?  They're rummies here. That's why I always have to remember: it's Peter-fricking-Piper, a 3-year-old's-birthday-joint. Nothing more.   New IT guy/gal?  I dunno. How about the current IT guy/gal just check this stuff?"}
{"text":"Incompetent manager that wasn't able to cancel an order on one card so it could be put on another card....luckily for this place there is no competition so their customer service can be as poor as they want it to be"}
{"text":"5 stars because my 3 year old son loved it and when he was eating pizza he told me he loves me. He says it all the time actually but even though still made me feel very appreciated that he acknowledges all that I do for him to make him happy. Then we went to the park and then I went to the store to buy him a toy. I love my son very much. Anyways, back to the point, we played every game and sometimes more than once or even twice lol. The place is very clean and the food was yummy and it's very affordable. He's way easier to handle than all the other pizza places for kids because it's not too big and overwhelming. Perfect for his age. He ate two slices of pizza! The workers are very helpful even the one who turned the tv up for my child."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Not everyone favorite but mine and my family's. Price isn't bad. The only real reason i give it 4 instead of 5 stars is they are kinda slow and it's always busy."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this location quite a few times. We've always enjoyed it. The pizza is great and the employees are friendly. We also threw my son's 6th birthday party here in sept. Our hostess assigned to our party was great and very patient with all the kids.  My son said it was the best party ever. We'll definately be having more parties here!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with Mushrooms Only. Got my pizza started eating it realized it had sausage mixed in with my pizza and I don't eat meat. It was just disgusting. Great environment for the kids to play but I wasn't in the mood of staying there after that."}
{"text":"Had this for take out the first time a couple months ago when we had a pizza craving. The place seemed pretty spacious and great for a kid's birthday party or family gathering. The pizza was okay. The cinnamon pie/roll/sticks thing was AMAZING. But other than that, I thought it was pretty meh."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good pizza and friendly staff. Fun for kids...and adults. Got the boneless wings and a large pizza. Pretty good. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I love Peter Piper Pizza. However, this location is the worst. And it's the closest one to me so now I have to start ordering/going to a further one. The customer service is one of the worst, even the one on Central and Southern is better. I have given this place 3 tries and and my third one I finally gave up. The first time, I asked for extra sauce on our pizza and they did not add the extra sauce. But they charged me for it. The second time I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and green bell peppers. It was a large pizza, and each slice had about one pepperoni MAX 2. It was a messy pizza and the crust was not as soft and I had to pay extra for the toppings that they barely even put on the pizza. The last try was the buffet. They have the worst buffet. The toppings are so random. A pizza with olives, another with onions and olives, sausage and olives and burnt cheese pizzas. They had 3 burnt cheese pizzas. They didn't even have pepperoni! The pizzas had hardly and sauce and too much cheese. And to top it all off you either got a burnt crust or a hard crust. I'll have to start going to a different one, which is very inconvenient because I live really close to this one."}
{"text":"We usually come here but today - the pizzas (all you can eat) tasted as if they were cooked yesterday and the restrooms were filthy. All seats were clearly not cleaned . Could see urine on the seats. :/"}
{"text":"I came here with my family the girl at the cashier, Danielle was very nice and helpful. I waited too long for my food.When i did i got half of my order. They took my buzzer and told me to wait. I waited and my family had already finished the rest and we waited some more... i see a pizza go out as the guy cut it with his bare hands and I'm thinking ok.. sooo are they allowed to touch ready to eat foods? So i ask if that was for my number then asked me to go get my receipt ..ok.. thats when i got upset. I go over get it and my family finished it at first bite. So i head over to get an x large but still very pricey might as well gone to little cesears. Too bad management dealt with a lot of complaints to notice."}
{"text":"Such a great location! Newly remodeled! Management and staff are great! Pizza games and drinks all for a low price you can't beat! My kids love coming here"}
{"text":"Oh man ... this is NOT good pizza ... it's CHEAP and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the 'za is about as good as Little Caesar's Pizza (i.e. \"not so much\")"}
{"text":"I took my 11 year old daughter & her friend Calista to eat & play there today. When I first arrived, I was concerned they would not have fun since the game side was down due to the lights being worked on. I was wrong, we had pizza and then they played on the slide area & then the staff made up some games that we could all play:  pass the potato, find the soldiers, eating ice cream contest & more.  the kids loved it! The staff even invited me to play as well.. I played a couple of the games & then they gave out prizes to everyone.  Excellent Idea and everyone had fun!! The lunch buffet was good too."}
{"text":"It's like every other peter piper pizza !   Pros it's very clean ! That's always hard to do in kid places !   Cons there isn't any pasta choices just pizza and salad !  Other locations have the pasta and it's perfect for our little ones !  A little disappointed they don't have it at this one"}
{"text":"It's a nice location with great staff! I wish the game area was bigger and had more games . The dinning area is too big I've never seen it full .  Take advantage of the lunch buffet worth it"}
{"text":"Came to the riverview location with my family. I specifically waited for my sister to arrive so that we can order our food at the same time and so we can all eat at the same time. She ordered a x-large pepperoni pizza, I ordered a family pack that came with tokens and drinks and a large pizza, I ordered pepperoni and black olives. We received our buzzer our cashier told us it would buzz in 15/10 minutes, so we filled up our kids drinks and all sat and waited . The buzzer rang litlerally like 3/4 minutes after we picked our seat! But only my sisters pizza was done! Her pizza was cold and not an extra large I asked the woman who was serving the pizza this is an extra large and she answered me yes!! Not only that the pepperoni and a cheese were not even hot !!! Not even our children bothered to eat the rest of those slices after a few bites!  I went up to the front cashier and I complained and asked why was her pizza ready before my pepperoni and black olive pizza we ordered only one minute apart from each other and we received the same buzzer. . I'm so upset and so disappointed with the pizza. They did make us a new fresh hot extra large pepperoni but it shouldn't have happened in the first place will never be returning back to this location and I will call tomorrow to speak to the head manager!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best peter piper pizza locations I have found. They are never that busy and are always clean. I dont think they have the best pizza around but its great for what it is, a place for kids to play!"}
{"text":"Thank you for a wonderful school fundraiser!  Kudos to our fundraiser coordinator, Jessica! This place is clean, kid friendly and has a wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I'm an adult with no kids but I still love going here. Fun games and the pizza is always good. If you plan on eating I suggest you bring some hand sanitizer with you!"}
{"text":"I really like this location but the last couple of times that I have gone in with my family for the lunch buffet I have been so disappointed. The workers who have been checking people out have been so rude. I tried to pay for lunch with a large dollar bill and they lady was annoyed. My family ordered beer and she was put off by the fact that they asked questions about the sizes of cups versus pitchers. The food was okay but by the time we got home we were all sick and running towards the bathrooms! I hope this place gets better!"}
{"text":"I have been to several Peter Piper locations and this was the worst! We waited in line to order which was not a problem but when we got up to our turn the cash register assistant did not talk to us nor acknowledge us in any way. We waited at least 10 minutes before she talked to us even when we tried. It was really rude. We sat down to wait for our food and were served dessert pizza first and then the pizza came. Not good when you have a child and you eat dessert first. We went to the bathroom to clean up before playing games and the bathroom was trashed no towels dirty toliet paper on the floor, disgusting. Then we went to play games and at least 5 were broken.  I will not go back to this location. I will stay close to the Peoria one, way nicer!"}
{"text":"When you want to spend $4.99 on a Lunch Buffet All-You-Can-Eat Pizza, Salad, Breadsticks and Dessert | Served Mon.-Fri. 11am to 2pm.. I guess this is the deal for you."}
{"text":"This place was gross. The pizza was bland and had no flavor, the salads were the same, but drenched in dressing and soggy. The tables had residue on them, and I didn't want to eat on them. I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love PPP but this location SUCKS. Avoid it. If you like their pizza as much as I do then go to the one on Williams Field and Lindsay (I think) as it's much better.   This location for some reason has been off everytime. I had given them 4 chances but after the 4th and the taste being the same. That was it. No more."}
{"text":"Found this place searching for a light, pre-theatre dinner near the Arizona Broadway Theatre, and broke my rule of always checking Yelp! reviews first because we were in such a hurry.  Ordered The Works on ultra thin crust, and it came quickly and was tasty, and the medium was just enough for the two of us to share along with a small pitcher of Shock Top.  But it's a noisy place with games for the kiddies a la Chuck E. Cheese, Showbiz, etc., with a prize counter, and is really fun I'm sure for families with kids who want to drink beer while the kids are otherwise occupied.  Pizza was surprisingly good and met our needs for the moment.  Squeaky clean from restaurant to rest rooms."}
{"text":"What idiots. When I was here last time me and my son waited 45 minutes for our food! Just now, 2nd time in a month, we waited a reasonable time and when our table pager went off, we go to get our food and come to find out our pizza was given to someone else. We confront that other person, he stated the employees gave it to him, not minding that that was someone else food. This place sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have ice cream for less than 1 cent!!!!  The pizza is good. The games are fun for the kids. I wish the pizza and tokens were a bit cheaper, however. Some PPPs bring the order to the table. This one does not. Friendly staff. Fun times."}
{"text":"The service was very nice and helpful, gave use water cups before our order no problem. Our order was ready in no time and it was pretty decent pizza."}
{"text":"Selection of pizza was small on the buffet. Some items were not ready at the time we arrived,, 11:15.  Pizza was good enough for serval trips back to the counter."}
{"text":"So I came here because it's one of the last Peter Pipers with a play park (tubes with slide) and I have a 4 year old that a lot of the games are to hard for. I've been a loyal customer for years. I always purchase coins with meals because they are the best deals. I had a 100 token coin from months ago that I found with some old tickets. They refused to cash it because they said they no longer sell them. A waste of my hard earned money because they don't honor coins they previously sold to me. Maybe I'll start going to chucky cheese. They didn't even think twice when they said no. Take your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is awful, on so many levels! I would give no stars, as a rating, if the option existed. The food is downright nasty. Every machine takes your tokens, doesn't give tickets, and the attendants all know about it. It's like a full blown scam! The photo booth isn't even built out to give change, when it's priced at $2.50 and only takes dollars. I'm utterly flabbergasted that this children's casino is able to do business in this manner. Save your money, stay home! *Also, I find it ironic that some of the worst and truthful reviews are hidden by Yelp under \"not recommended.\" That is truly a shame!"}
{"text":"Let me clarify the 4/5 rating. This is based on \"carryout\" only. I've never actually stopped inside and sat down to eat a meal. What I can say about the actual restaurant is that this is a very family friendly place. Lots of families with kids running around the arcade area.  Now, on to the pizza. I've pretty much grown up on Peter Piper Pizza. It's sort of an acquired taste. I would venture to say that dough is water-based and the pizza sauce comes from a 10-gallon tub. The cheese is mediocre. But man I love this pizza. It's cheap (a large special will run you around 11 bucks), fast, and simple. The menu offers other items beyond your basic pizza... wings, salads, bread sticks, mozarella sticks, etc.  If you're in the mood for a quick bite to eat that's cheap-- head over to Peter Piper Pizza."}
{"text":"We came here today with students on a field trip.  As chaperones, we needed a break after dealing with fidgety kids who were trying their best to be on their best behavior.  THANK GOD FOR PETER PIPER PIZZA!! The children were able to eat their fill (read as quiet time) thanks to the lunchtime buffet, then they could let loose behind the sound shielding glass wall.  I think for what it is, it's a great place. The pizza and salads are what I expect and am not disappointed. The game selection is less than at other locations but overall, the kids didn't care.   You get what you pay for and you don't throw a fit.            - Anonymous middle child."}
{"text":"We came in to have a pizza and wings. It took 30 minutes for the wings to come out and 45 minutes for the pizza!! Beyond ridiculous!!! Especially for a SLOW Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Party hostess Raquel was fantastic! She attended to all the needs of the party guests with a smile. I highly recommend this for your child's birthday party"}
{"text":"I ate here back in 2002 and my one slice of pizza had over 8 beetles dead cooked into the pizza. I just remember that happening In this location and I would just never come back here ever again."}
{"text":"Welcome back, Triple-P!  A lot has changed ever since I used to spend my birthdays with you. No more mini roller coaster, no more obstacles for kids, no more money blowing machine, and most of all, no more green spotted purple dinosaur! (crying emoji)  I couldn't complain since it wasn't for my birthday. My family wanted to bring my little nephew here to celebrate and see what's new. We ordered a couple of their deals which gave us a total of 3 pizzas, 20 wings, 60 tokens, and 8 drinks which brought us near the $100 mark. I highly recommend their buttery Pan Pizza. Unless you like thin crust, you won't be upset. The boneless wings weren't as great as I anticipated, although I believe traditional would have made the difference (kid problems). If you come from Mon-Fri from 11am-2pm, you can try out their lunch buffet and indulge in there variety of beer taps.  The arcade area for the kids seemed pretty small and compact in my opinion. A couple games were out of commission, and the amount of tickets they gave back weren't sufficient enough to get a good variety of prizes. With the 60 tokens, we were only able to collect 200 some tickets. The only cool prize we got was a rubber spider along with a bunch of cheap fruit tarts.  There are more dining tables than anything. One side is reserved for parties and the other side is for everyone else. Thankfully, there are about 15 TVs hanging around for all you sport fans. The staff was very friendly. Some of them even came around the tables to keep the children entertained with toys.  PS: Don't turn on East on O'Bannon to get here."}
{"text":"I love peter piper! Love to bring all my grandmas boyfriends to eat and play games. I love balls"}
{"text":"Not a great choice for children's party! We chose this location for my nephews birthday party and our party host dropped the ball BIGTIME!!!! Our party started at 4pm and at 7pm still had no pizza. We had to cut the cake in order to feed our starving party. Some of our guests left disappointed to feed there kids. After many requests the Manager finally came to talk with us as we were packing up and leaving and waived all of the charges. She offered nothing more. Not even an apology. We never got our pizza, or ice cream. All we received was game tokens. Many of the games were out of order and only 1 ticket machine was operational and the line was over 10 people deep. HORRIBLE NIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"It's only $6 for a lunch buffet.  I expected this to be similar to Cici's but the quality was less than what you would receive at Little Caesar's.  There wasn't much variety and the pizza looked dry and overcooked.  Pepperoni, Pepperoni & Sausage and Cheese were all that was available when we arrived.  They added California Veggie and BBQ while we were there.  It would be nice to have labels so one knows what they're selecting.  It would also be nice if the pizza was cut to the edge of the crust.  It's difficult using one hand to lift pizza on the spatula then to your plate realizing it won't come off the pan because it needs to be cut better.  In addition,'the breadsticks were so hard I could barely chew them.  If you're just taking the kids to play and they don't mind less than mediocre pizza, it's fine.  I would have rather spent $20 on a better pizza but we were in a hurry and this location was convenient to an appointment location.  The location was clean and service was okay.  The dessert pizzas were tasty.  I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"What a crap hole- most of the games just take your tokens or are just broken. No one around to tell about it. Overpriced and dirty. The kids enclosed playground smelled like dirty feet. If it wasn't for a birthday invite, we wouldn't go there. Glad that's over!"}
{"text":"Hate coming here they take forever to make your pizza regardless if it's eat here/2go and the customer service sucks the staff is rude, I've had problems with my pizza before and they always have a attitude correcting it and never offer anything for my problem. Even with the new games and upgraded system"}
{"text":"The place looks great over 10 big screen tvs more space  newer games and brand new carpet... everything has been improved and brand new expect the wifi ..."}
{"text":"Yuck!! What happened to the pizza?  Hubby and I usually love Peter Piper pizza but not the other day. Showed up for lunch  buffet on a Wed. All the pizza slices we tasted seemed off.  The crust was like cardboard but greasy at the same time.The sauce was not flavorful like in the past. And the cheese wasnt good either. The pizzas all looked as though the sauce and cheese had been stirred together and then smeared on the pizza. Weird.   Perhaps the smell we noticed when entering was a warning. If this is a recipe change it is not a good one. The quality of the pizzas has deteriorated. Beware!"}
{"text":"Had my baby girl's birthday here and it was great. We were assigned a server and she was super attentive. Anything we needed, she was there. Wish I would've caught her name. The pizza is actually pretty good and they have Mich Ultra on tap. Dare I say I caught a good buzz there. Worth taking a look for your next kids party."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place you come when it's 115 out and your kids are going stir crazy.  The food is pretty bad but there are games and it's air conditioned.  If you know what your going to get ( frozen pizza and plain romaine salads) you will be fine.  Let's be honest no parent comes here for the food, it's 100% about surviving the summer heat.  If that is your goal then you will be fine."}
{"text":"First review! This location has free wifi and plugins at the booth tables for laptops and phones to charge. Beer with frosted mugs gives this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I usually make the trip here for their lunch buffet, which if you ask me is a good deal. However I went on a Friday with my friend and not even 10 minutes of the lunch buffet and the line was huge! I also had ordered a 10 piece of wings to accompany my buffet. It took over an hour for me to finally go see what was going on. The nice employee, Maria I believe, apologize and went to get them for me after an hour long wait. I understand they are very busy but maybe hiring more people for the weekend would help alot with extra orders of customers."}
{"text":"This was a great place. Tonya was great, very kind and helpful, very clean and great food. Tonya made this experience very special."}
{"text":"The all you can eat lunch buffet is to die for! Must try and some point in your life it is life changing. I eat the buffet every day.  I only go to Peter piper for lunch.  The cashier at the front knows me by name.  They remember to give me a ranch before I even ask! Also they have Coca Cola products, I like the cherry Coke"}
{"text":"As far as Peter Piper Pizza's go, this one is pretty awesome!  Yes, you have the kids running around everywhere.  Yes, you lack gourmet pizza.  But, uh, HELLO.  It's Peter Piper Pizza.  I happen to like (not love) the pizza here, maybe it stems from it being rooted in me as a child.    Anytime we go dining with children under 13 in tow, this is always a great choice.  The kids eat, they play, they tire themselves out and they come home with a bunch of cheap crap they bought with their tickets that cost me triple what it would of cost at the dollar store with regular grown-up money versus tokens and tickets. Anyhow.....  I'm a fan of this particular location because:  1) The place is spacious enough that you are not run down by little people on your way to pick up your order.  2) They keep tables, play areas and restrooms very clean. 3) Service is satisfactory. 4) Play area, arcade games, carousel are all in great condition - nothing torn, falling apart or borderline condemned like other Peter Piper restaurants. 5) They have several 32 inch TV's hanging in case you want to catch a particular game while the kids are playing. 6) And, again, the pizza is really not that bad."}
{"text":"Fun for family but often this location has funky smell. I wouldn't go here just for pizza and if I didn't have kids I wouldn't ever eat here."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday for dinner. I immediately saw that there was no security at the front doors. It would be pretty easy for someone to walk out with a kid. Our food was awful. We paid $22 for two pizzas that where equivalent to frozen pizza from the grocery store. There were tables that had plates and trash on them that never got bussed during the time we where there.  Bottom line, this place was awful. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I get that it's Peter Piper. So the expectations are kind of on the lower end. But this time they let a bum sit inside the restaurant.  I get it, it's hot out side. And if I was home less I would want an air conditioned place to relax and well.  But eating a salami out of a Chik fila bag and then sleeping in a booth. Sorry Not when my children are running around. Never again. Sorry"}
{"text":"Went here last night not knowing exactly  what  to expect. We ordered a family deal and 2 additional drinks for the kids, plus 2 salads. Our friends ordered a family deal as well and got cheesey garlic bread. The pizza wasn't bad! I recommend the pan pizza it seems to havea little more flavor to the crust.  We got 30 tokens from it and we went to the playroom after dinner, the play area was much smaller compared to their last location on Decatur and Alta, but the kids had fun while the adults got to hang out."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Thursday and while the pizza was good (I stuck to the jalapeno and peperoni) the salads were lackluster. I could be remembering the salads from the Chandler PPP which were pre mixed with dressing. The salads here looked like bagged salad with a choice of dressings. On the good side, they did have blue cheese dressing (my favourite). All in all, for the price, its a good place to go if you can tune out screaming kids and video games. Also a good place to go if you have screaming kids who like video games!"}
{"text":"We had my daughter's birthday party here.  I didn't expect perfection, but even with low expectations, we were disappointed.  I'm not sure if they were short-staffed, but we had the following very disappointing issues, and management did not seem particularly concerned when I reported them:  1) Our private party room's tables were all dirty.  Hair, lettuce, frosting, pizza sauce, etc.  Literally on every table. 2) Our \"party host\" took so long to give us our package's tokens that our guests began buying them themselves. 3) When we did get the tokens (super tokens worth 20 tokens that work in the machines), the party host told us we could use them in the token changer's 25 cent slot.  They did not, and our guests spent several frustrating minutes figuring out that they only worked in the other machine. 4) The party host didn't take our pizza order until nearly 45 minutes after we arrived. 5) The bathroom's toilets were clogged with toilet paper (in one) and tampons (in another).  The other toilet had no toilet paper. 6) Our package included fountain drinks.  The guests wanted lemonade.  Guess which fountain drink was out? 7) We ordered 15 waters for the adults.  They only had 10.  4 were cold; the remaining six were warm (not even room temperature). 8)  The package included a separate mini-pizza for the birthday child.  The party host brought the pizza a half hour after the rest of the kids' food--long after my kid was done eating. 9) There was a mistake on the bill--not in my favor, obviously (but it was quickly corrected). 10) The package included a t-shirt for the birthday child.  It was not given to us until I asked. 11) This is probably a very finicky complaint, but the lighting in the party room was so dim.  All of the pictures looked like the party was in a dank basement. 12)  There were two other parties (at least) going on at the same time, and the crowdedness and volume were both intense.  The only positives were that it was reasonably priced, and the party host was polite."}
{"text":"I love Peter Piper Pizza!  No, Im not some 10 year old kid who's a pizza fanatic and this is the best in town.  By all means this is not your gourmet pizza, but hey.. you get what you pay for and for experience, I love it.  I love the pizza here because it's simple crap pizza.. by crap pizza, I mean its fun, not fancy, and just basic thrown together sauce, cheese and toppings goodness.  I like their crust actually..  Weird I know..  I do wish their pizza's werent so much.  They used to be around $5.99 for a large pepperoni.  Prices seem to have gone up.  If you bring the kids, this location is a very cool place.  Tons of games and fun for the kids.  My friends daughter had lost her ticket coupon that showed she'd won 190 coupons.  They still gave her the gifts for it!  how cool is that?  My only complaint was the women handing out the pizzas got into a coughing fit as she was handling the pizzas.  Though she covered herself up, it still gave me the heebie geebies.    I'll come back here.  We all had a blast here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great open space, seems to be popular for families, fairly cheap lunch buffet, but you get what you pay for.    Seeing a new pizza buffet in town I was eager to finally try it.  They have 3 salad options, with no extra dressing, 2 pasta options, bread sticks, a cheese bread option and several pizza options.    The pizza was nothing special, not bad but not outstanding.  Their highlight for me was the mac and cheese which was great, and the free refills on soda.    I may someday give it another chance but hopefully there is a better pizza buffet out there.  Some places will make a point to advertise they'll make any pizza you want not currently on the buffet.  I think they'll make them for you here but I saw no signs advertising this.    It's a nice restaurant and looks to have a lot of options for kids.  If I had kids my review might be a little different."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review on Yelp in a long time since most of my reviews are for restaurants/eating establishments and I haven't been able to taste food properly the past couple months due to radiation.   That being said, the pizza here is terrible.   The crust tastes like cardboard & I don't know what they use for cheese, but it's not cheese.  Of course, the pizza is just a small reason why you'd even bother coming here (do people actually come to Peter Piper specifically for the pizza?).  My nephew likes coming here and I'm glad he'd rather come to this location than others since it's small and the couple times I've been here with him not that crowded. Sure, it probably doesn't have as much to offer in terms of games as some of the other locations, but I'm not the one playing them & he's only 4 so he's good with what they got."}
{"text":"I love ppp! The pizza is so good every time i come here they get my order right, i don't have to wait too long and when they are busy they still manage to make the pizza great-tasting!"}
{"text":"Clean play area. Well maintained games for even the younger children.  My children love going here with their cousins to play and enjoy the pizza.  I would recommend this place to other families with young children. Great for birthday parties too! Only taking one star away because the food isn't the best. But let's be honest, it could be worse for a place that is kid friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible service and deficient management.  When I first moved to Avondale 5 years ago, this was one of our favorite places to visit.  As the popularity of the area grew, the service degenerated.  Go to another location or if your willing to spend more money, go up the street to NYPD, the service alone is worth the extra cost of quality service."}
{"text":"I had my boys' birthday party this past weekend and I just want to say they did a fantastic job!  Earlier in the week I had called, just to verify that they had my reservation and the woman I spoke to said they were busy with buffet and asked if I could callback (which I was totally fine with) however, instead of me calling her back she went out of her way to look me up and call me to confirm my reservation, I was pleasantly surprised.   Anyway, our party hostess was great and helpful and friendly, in fact all of the staff was. There is wasn't crazy over crowded like it normally is and the renovations look great!!   We were pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with PPP, I love the buffet during lunch, who doesn't like all you can eat pizza and salad? The play area is tiny but the games are decent. It was actually cleaner than most PPP I have been to which is a plus, but the customer service was not great. The cashier kept rushing me (probably because a line was forming behind me) and when I finally decided on the buffet she rudely said \"that's all\". Other than that it was a great experience. We will be back, hopefully the cashier was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is a great deal. $6.49, but drinks are overpriced at $2.29 and $2.49, and if you get a water they give you a tiny little shot glass. The booth tables were all dirty. The food was good."}
{"text":"We walked in and the lady that took our order had a bit of an attitude so it wasn't off to a good start. But we ordered a medium cheese pizza and was told it would only take about 15 minutes. I waited 30 minutes before I went up to ask how long it was going to be. Another lady turned around and pulled it right off the shelf while the buzzer they gave me never went off. The lady never apologized. All she could say was \"do you want a coupon for next time?\". Customer service obviously needs some work at this location.  I have never had a problem with any other location and when there's been a problem they are always happy to help.  We won't be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Peter Piper is Back in Las Vegas!      Let's face it once you leave Las Vegas it is so hard to stay away. This also goes for restaurants. After leaving Las Vegas a few years ago, Peter Piper is back! Peter Piper is so serious about staying in Vegas that they made their newest restaurant a premier restaurant. This is the second Las Vegas Peter Piper to open in a month. This Peter Piper is so new that I breathed in the scent of new paint and furnishings. It is so new that only a few days ago I was witnessing construction workers building the restaurant.      If you have never heard of Peter Piper, it is a pizza chain that has catered to young families. If it wasn't the same company as Chuck E. Cheese they would be competitors. The Peter Piper nursery rhythm below emphasis the Peter Piper connection to children:  \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, Where's the peck of pickled peppers that Peter Piper picked?\"    The freshly opened Peter Piper that I walked into today demphasizes a sole focus on children. The Peter Piper that I spent some time in today was missing a playground, tunnels, and robotic animals. However, it is a family friendly restaurant. Two of the three humongous rooms are children friendly. As Meatloaf sang \"Two out of three ain't bad.\" When I explored the place I took in a large room with tables that can accommodate a large party. Adjacent to the room I stepped inside an arcade. The first sight I saw was a concession stand displaying the prizes. The arcade games were so new that I can breath the new electronic smell.     A couple paragraphs back, I said that Peter Piper's is no longer solely focusing on pizza. Today they are also focusing on their food. Their food includes many styles of pizza, bread sticks, wings, and a few pasta dishes. I would discover this food at the time their lunch buffet was ending. The friendly cashier let me know that I could take some pizza home with me before they cleared out the food at 2:15 pm. I wasn't too hungry and placed a moderate portion of pizza in the to go box that I ate off of in the massive room with plate glass windows overlooking Eastern Avenue, the party room, the buffet, and counter. Throughout this room I took in a handful of large screen TVs.     The lunch buffet which primarily was pizza slices, bread sticks, a dessert, and a couple Italian items cane out to $6.49. An additional bottomless Coke was $2 and change. Now if I didn't want a Coke, there was an option to order a beer from the tap. At 2 pm in the afternoon I wanted a Coke and with the lunch buffet it came out to less than $10.      To put it kindly, this wasn't no Metro Pizza. It was decent. I am confident that it wasn't frozen pizza thanks to their new restaurant design where from the arcade I can look into the open kitchen to see them making the pizza. Kudos to the open kitchen design.     In conclusion Peter Piper Pizza is a nice addition to the Las Vegas family friendly restaurant scene. Peter Piper, \"Welcome back to Las Vegas!\""}
{"text":"Eh. Pizza is OK. definitely not the best I've seen here and bit overpriced for what it is. Would be a good place to have a birthday party for kids. Their buffalo chicken is not nearly as spicy as a buffalo chicken pizza should be and their ice cream tastes like cool whip."}
{"text":"A pretty simple order of small wings and pizza. Wings came out within moments. But 20 minutes later we had to ask about our pizza. It was handed over without explanation, and it seems it was sitting there for some time. Not the best service or price. Would look elsewhere next time.   If you have kids, this place might be for you. Lots of kids."}
{"text":"We stopped for a late lunch and were just in time to finish off with the pizza buffet.  There were lots of choices.  The pizzas were fresh and good as was the salad.  Buffet pizzas aren't the same as what you normally order for yourself but we weren't disappointed.    We'd definitely return for the buffet."}
{"text":"I decided to have my sons 3rd bday here last weekend, so this review will be about the \"party\" side of Peter Piper Pizza. When we arrived the tables were decorated, they had plates, cups and balloons all set up. I met with my party planner and started getting the ball rolling. I got the pizza for the kids ordered; started getting the tokens cashed in so the kids could play and the guests started arriving. When you reserve a bday at Peter Piper you are only allowed to reserve in 1  1/2 hr time blocks, not any longer. When I made my reservation a week and a half prior I called the location about the time constraint. I voiced my concern on rushing my sons bday party over just an 1  1/2 hour span. The associate told me that if we needed more time they would just move us to an un reserved table and it shouldn't be a problem, they assured me there would be room. THIS BECAME A HUGE PROBLEM! Not only was my party planner rushing me the whole time, my son didn't even have that much time to play. Having a group of 3-5 yr olds, they take a while to eat, it takes a while to round them all up while they are playing and it takes a while to open presents an 1  1/2 isn't enough time for a party. The kids got to play for maybe 30 minutes by the time the pizza came out, they were still eating when the planner came up to me and said cake and ice cream are coming out. I had to tell him no to wait so the kids could finishing eating. 15 minutes later he brought out the cake and ice cream. After getting all the kids back to the table then singing happy birthday the planner came over and told me I had 5 minutes. I had to rush passing out cake and ice cream, on the last few slices, the planner came over and started clearing the table in front of everyone. I was literally pushed of my table in the middle of serving cake and ice cream still. He said he had to set up for the next party. My planner didn't even help me move my things or presents, I had to get help from all the other guest to cram our whole party into one little booth. At this time parents began getting frustrated, because there were no open tables because all the other reserved parties took the open tables, so there was no where to sit, eat or put presents. At this time I got very frustrated and just decided to call it a day for everyone was getting annoyed with there not being any room for anything even though an associate assured me there would be room if our party was not done with the party. Its very frustrating trying to celebrate a child's birthday when all that is happening is you are being rushed and then kicked off your table. I have to shove my son in the booth, rip open his present say thank you to everyone, pack everything up and leave. That all happened with in 15 minutes. It was awful! Since there was no room for anything I had to start taking extra pizza, cake and presents to the car so people could sit and visit (the few people who decided to stay) at this time the associate followed me out thinking I was leaving without paying. At this point I kind of lost it! I told the associate I had to leave the party to move all of my things and would be back in to pay for the awful experience momentarily. I think I scared the young boy which I apologized for when I cashed out, I was just very frustrated with the whole situation. I paid my bill, gathered the rest of my things and left with my son. I think Peter Piper needs to re-think their party packages and their time limit. I requested respectfully more time and they assured me I would be fine and I wasn't. My sons bday was nothing but a rushed mess (which he doesn't care he is 3) but me my family and the other parents had to go through the rushing and hassle. The last thing you want for a bday is being rushed and hassled! NOT FUN!  The one good thing was the food! Pizza, wings, breadsticks, ice cream..... was all very tasty (the little bit I had time to snack on while running around)"}
{"text":"Oy vey! This Peter Piper has been the worst I have been to. We had to wait 15 minutes standing in the front waiting for someone to take our order and there was no one in front of us. I am not sure if they were understaffed or just didn't know what was going on, a gentleman finally came up front and took our order as if we just got there. After ordering our pizza I went and played games with my son and half of the games were broken. After 30 minutes of playing the games we could get to work, I went and asked about our order (because there were only about 4 families in the whole place) and it was taking quite some time to get our pizza. When I asked the guy about our order he said it would be right up, 15 minutes later our pizza was finally ready. When I picked it up, they forgot we ordered wings with our pizza, so we had to wait for our wings to be made. The pizza was really dry and burnt tasting, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wings were tasteless, there was no buffalo sauce taste to them at all.  Dont think ill be making a trip here again"}
{"text":"We took our little girl here on a Sunday night as a treat. No one was in there but us, so that was a HUGE plus! No kids pushing past mine to get to games. I was a little unimpressed with the amount of games, but she had a blast. We had trouble with two games, but the employees came quickly to fix the problem and even gave my daughter a prize for the game malfunctioning :) I'm not a big pizza lover but I really liked the pizza and my side salad wasn't too bad either! The cashier was very friendly and very willing to help! It was very clean and they continued to clean while we were there. Would only wish for the play area to be cleaner. You could see the dirt on the slides and we took our daughter out of that area.   All around, I was happy to have pleasant employees. It's very rare to have people be kind these says in the service industry. Which is a shame."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Everyone is very helpful and it is the cleanest Peter piper I've ever been to honestly! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"pizza tastes like cicis. that kinda off brand sauce taste. ya know? salads are premade at the buffet and DROWNING in dressing. really gross.  the speciality pizza at the buffet is gone in seconds, leaving 6 pepperoni pizzas no one wants.  overall dissapointing despite the cheap price."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Insanity inside four walls.  I wish the parent community that frequents this place would do a better job of monitoring their offspring but that's not really Peter Piper Pizza's issue.  The staff here is friendly and accommodating. The food is okay - what you would expect.  The games seem to be well maintained as we rarely see one not working.  No real complaints that are in the control of the business."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over a year and it's mostly for my kids however the pizza is really good! Prices aren't bad and it's nice to eat and let my kids run around. We always leave happy and I highly recommend this PPP to anyone looking for a family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"All you can each lunch opens at 1100hrs mon-Friday.. 1110hrs still not ready and management walking around like he doesn't give a hoot. Perfect for in and out we thought but this happens way toooo often.. just stop going to this one we will look elsewhere"}
{"text":"I am unimpressed by this establishment but I don't think I can give it a full review since I did not have any food. I came here for a kid's birthday party. The staff made the party manageable for the adults. You have two slides and a few games. I honestly thought there would be more games or at least games that were more entertaining. The average kid here has to be younger than 8 years old. Why do the games only last 30 seconds? Money grab!"}
{"text":"I should of known it would be dirty before I came here because of past experience. They have what looks like mold in their ice. The floors look like they haven't been cleaned all day. I'm scared to use the restroom if the eat area is this filthy. Their staff is extremely rude and cashier acted like we were bothering her when we ordered our pizza. This will definitely be the last time I come here. I guess it's this way because they are a franchise and not corporate."}
{"text":"I love this PPP! It's always clean and the workers are always friendly. I will always come here from now on."}
{"text":"I've been busy, and haven't had a chance to post much, but I wanted to give this updated review.  We came here a couple of weeks ago for dinner.  We were having some repairs done at our house, and I didn't feel like cooking.  I also didn't feel like driving too far, and everybody was in the mood for pizza.  So, off to Peter Piper we go!  When we arrived, they were hosting a fundraising event for a local school (I like that PPP does this, it shows community involvement, and that they want to be a good neighbor).  The place was crowded, but no more so than any Saturday afternoon.  We ordered our food, grabbed a seat and hung out until our food was ready.  Our wings came out first (boneless, mild), they were tasty, fresh, and disappeared rather fast.  My wife likes the boneless wings better, and while I am a traditionalist; they have always been good at PPP, and thats what we order there.  We ordered an extra large, ultra thin with pepperoni.  When I got the pizza from the pick up area, I was disappointed (we were all disappointed, but I don't ever send food back).  Yes, it was ultra thin, and had plenty of pepperoni, but the toppings on the pizza were shifted (see picture).  Thinking of the pizza as a clock; at 12 and 6 o'clock, the toppings were almost to the edge.  At 9 o'clock the crust was about normal, but from about 1 to 5, we had a large expanse of dry brittle crust with no toppings.  Not appetizing to look at, and not edible.  Where the pizza had toppings on it; it was good, there was plenty of pepperoni, and the pizza was properly sauced.    Interesting this is, the manager is the person who gave me the pizza at the pick up area.  I would have thought that she would have taken one look at the pizza, and told us that she would have a new one made because of the way it looked.  Once again, they were busy, but not that bad.  I know that as a manager at PPP, you have many responsibilities; and can't  just stand there and look at every pizza, but when you see one that looks like this, take it over to the person making the pizzas and ask them why they thought it would be okay to serve this to a customer.  Am I being too harsh because it's Peter Piper Pizza?  I don't think so, you have the word pizza in the name of your restaurant, the pizza should always be made right.  This PPP is consistently good, so maybe we just had an off night.    Now, on to the good things about our visit...  The staff were all friendly, especially the young lady who was hosting the ice cream eating contest.  I think she was having as much fun as the kids were!  We were sitting in the same area, and it was fun to watch.  The restaurant was also very clean (as always).  The employees do a great job of bussing the lazy peoples' tables and keeping everything neat and clean (including the gaming area and restrooms).  Soooooo...will we return?  Yes, we will.  The employees are friendly, the place is clean, and usually the pizza is good.  They just need to work on that consistency...  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Marginal, ordered pepperoni and pineapple.  Very little of each and very little cheese.  Some slices had neither..."}
{"text":"Went here with lots of friends and family after a baptism. We knew there was no way everyone would fit in our house so we called this local Peter Piper. We talked to a manager who took our info and reserved us some tables. We were so grateful that they put our group off to the side, away from the birthday groups. It was great to visit with friends and family. Food was hot, service was quick!"}
{"text":"Disgusting, rude staff.  Do not understand how to work with children.  Will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"Worst place.had my kids birthday party ther on june 23 2018.time was 12-2 my food was cold the tokens were not all given to me.and the ice creamwas served melted.the pizza was little doughy wings were wrong .my veggie tray was srrved with warm ranch.just so upsetting the games my kid played were half working"}
{"text":"On the way out of town it's always fun to stop and get a large Chicago Classic for the road. I obviously don't eat this by myself but am super excited to participate!! This past time we stopped, we phoned in the order. When we got there to pick it up we paid and they showed it to us. We quickly realized that they had made a New York 3 cheese with pepperoni. Of course we said something and they said they would fix it. A little while later they called us back up and we took the pizza to the car. I FAILED TO CHECK THE PIZZA IN THE BUILDING WITH THE LIGHTS ON. I checked the pizza in the car which was dark.... yes I realize this is my fault. We had already driven away and were stuck on the highway due to an accident. They basically just threw on all the toppings for the actual Chicago Classic that we did order. It was so overpowering with seasoning we couldn't even eat it. It was caked in different cheeses and salt/pepper. It was too late to turn around and we got stuck with a pizza we didn't eat. Let me tell you this pisses me off because there are no PPP in California and the only time I get it is when I'm in Arizona.    So now that I am done being mad, PLEASE don't be dumb like me!!!!  Check your order before you leave in a lighting you can actually see in."}
{"text":"For the love of Goodness!!!! I just don't understand why I've been having such bad service at these places. I know it's not real New York pizza or whatever kind of pizza but I still love it enough to make the trip from California to eat here. Came here on a Saturday evening and of course it was busy (duh Saturday). So having expected this I went in with eyes wide open. I ordered one Chicago Classic with no pepperoni and they said it would be 15-20 minutes. So about 30 minutes later I checked in... 40 minutes later I checked in.. 49 minutes later I checked in. FINALLY it was ready. Yes it was the correct order and it was super hot so that made me happy BUT still. The workers were all over the place. The restaurant was packed hence the Saturday night but it was a mess. I just had a take out order and it bums me to say that once again I wasn't happy.    Go here if you're very patient"}
{"text":"Peter Piper where a kid can be a kid I get it so they get two Stars. I ordered 2 kids pack good deal pizza  drink  and 5 tokens. I was giving a pager for the order and me and the kids went to play the games. After about 20 minutes I go to inquire about the mini pizzas and you would have thought I was trying to steal two porterhouse steaks., I still had the pager that didn't go off and the young lady just kept asking for the the receipt. I showed the receipt then she says ohhh  your pizza was ordered but the pager was not setup on it okay so chill with the third degree ( The pizza is ok but not worth a felony) train the help with some customer service and fix your pager system"}
{"text":"Had been to this location a few times & prefer it, even though we live closer to the Bell & 75th Ave location.  Decided to have my daughters 5th Birthday party here. We were a little disappointed upon arrival. No balloons, like promised & no t shirt for signing or personal pizza. They were short staffed & I worked in the restaurant industry for years. So, I tried to have patience. My daughters guests began to arrive & we had no tokens for about 30 minutes into the party. I felt so bad, because all the parents were buying their kids tokens, even though they had plenty coming. Once they got the ball rolling, we did great. Rocky headed things up & she was amazing & doing her best. She just didn't have enough support. All our guests were saying that this was the cleanest, nicest Peter Piper they've been to. And, I agree. It's awesome! Just need a bigger staff!"}
{"text":"I went here last week for my sons birthday paid my deposit for the table spent over 200 dollars in food and drinks and tokens my other family member purchased additional food and tokens. At the end of the night it's time to check out I was treated as if i was trying to steal from them the manager Matthew used vulgar language in-front of the officer on duty Brian which at this point I paid my way to complete the process called corporate and never heard anything back. This is still on going never go to place please do not mess up your child's birthday"}
{"text":"Pizza well done with extra sauce was delicious. The fire oven gives it that crispy bottom & the better taste that the other Peter pipers lack since they switched to conveyor belts. We ordered a cinnamon crunch dessert but were disappointed. It was missing a lot of cinnamon. Tasted like breadstick with a drizzle of icing & dusting of cinnamon. At first I thought it wasn't cooked thru because of how blonde it looked. Today's dessert was not consistent with the usual dessert quality. Did not visit the bathrooms this time so cant comment on that. However, we enjoyed our pizza."}
{"text":"This is the second time they screwed up my pickup order first leaving me with the wrong Pizza. Today its Cold food because they messed up the order making me wait for the wings while my Pizza and Dessert sat and got cold. They did offer to comp the first time but the second time left me with a bad taste in my mouth. No more Peter Piper for me. They need to spend some money and hire people with half a brain. I used to love Peter Piper pizza. Maybe it's just the location."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this Peter Piper because it is never really crazy busy Even on the weekends, they do have a good amount of birthday parties but nothing too crazy  The service is generally good here as the employees are nice and friendly  The pizza is pretty good as well, I have always been a fan of Peter Piper Pizza  Their games are a little dated but they seem to do the job I have no complaints about this location The tables are clean, the floor is clean, and parking is easy"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, newly remodeled, kids love the games. Not giving 5 stars because the pizza took a pretty long time. We also had to clear our own table. It's Saturday and the restaurant was super busy. Still had a great time."}
{"text":"Oh peter piper what can say you make me happy. I have been to many pizza joints in my day but none like you. I'll always keep coming back to you. Being from Cali I appreciate you more.   Having said that I have been to this location countless times since they opened. This place is usually calm during the week with the exception of some Friday and Saturday afternoons. Place is always clean and service is always great. I do miss the original manager of this store Oscar. He was a really friendly person and always provided excellent customer service to all his customers. Made you want to come back to this location with just that alone. It's not the same without him around but I'll keep coming back. Till next time!"}
{"text":"Since my son loved it - then it deserves a good rating!  It is what it is - average food but plenty of entertainment for the little ones."}
{"text":"We had my son's 16th bday party here and everything was perfect! Great service, good food and fun. All of the kids had a blast. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Good place to go for an inexpensive lunch. Stopped by here and tried the $5.99 pizza buffet, how can you go wrong! The pizza is alright and it has enough flavor and different toppings to go back for more slices. The salad bar is simple, bowls of chopped romaine and extras like, red onions, olives and mushrooms. Several choices of salad dressing.   The atmosphere is geared towards children and games, but they do serve beer for the adults. Good place to take kids or a bunch of hungries to chow down."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this location since it first opened I believe that was 10 years ago? We live closer to the PPP on Chandler and Dobson but we drive the extra just to come here. Favorite pizza for my family and I! I swear yall should sponsor us lol we eat here all the time!   The pizza here is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza experience ever. I ordered a pizza that was supposed to be fresh. They told me to pick it up in 20 minutes. My husband was there in 15 minutes.  Apparently someone with the similar name ordered a similar pizza (what are the chances of that) as me. They rang me up under that persons name and my husband told them it was the wrong ticket. After clarifying the correct name and waiting a couple minutes they said the pizza would be out in a minute. The manager asked again what name the pizza was under and gave me my pizza and apparently my pizza was sitting there the whole time. My husband brought home the pizza and it was cold and not at all fresh. I called the manager who was rude and didn't bother to care that the pizza was not fresh. All she kept saying was \" the ticket was wrong but you got your pizza\" I told the pizza was disgusting and she refused to listen. Customer service was poor. Won't be going here again. I will be contacting the GM of this store."}
{"text":"Customer service was great!!!! The pizza nice and fresh aaaaand yummy!!!! I'll be returning"}
{"text":"A good option for those wanting a pizza buffet for a good price.   Sure, they don't offer high-end pizza, salads or desserts, but they are good in my opinion. The pizzas were hot and fresh and the salads were crispy and tasty. They had about 10-12 different kinds of pizzas to choose from and 3 different salads along with garlic bread and two desserts.   I came at the beginning of lunch rush hour, so there weren't too many people yet, but within about 10 minutes the place was full of families with kids and the people here on their lunch break. Even though there were lots of people for the buffet, the staff were very good at keeping pizzas out and fresh salads available.   The inside of the place is large and was well kept. All empty tables were wiped down and the floor was swept/vacuumed. Also, the trash cans were emptied.  The All-You-Can-Eat buffet is only available Monday through Friday between 11 am and 2 pm. Adult price is $6.49 and kids 10 and under are $4.49. This does not include the drink."}
{"text":"First, I should say I was relieved they had availability for a big bday party on short notice (rained out of original plan for park party). The food was as expected, the games about the same. The service, though, pretty much was nonexistent!!! I have never worked so hard at a birthday party and spent close to $400.   I have been to parties there before, and the parents get to kick back while the 'party host' helps out by getting the pizza on the plates before the kids sit down, helps to fill the kids' drink cups or bring pitchers of lemonade or water so the mom/dad isn't frantically trying to fill 25 cups at the fountain, put lids and straw in each and shuttling them all back across the place to the tables.   Our host was nice and pleasant but completely lacked a sense of urgency, and was pretty much nothing more than a pizza delivery person. I ordered drink cups for parents (mind you, that was all I ordered the entire time since you order pizza at the start), and after 20 minutes realized they never came. She slowly carried out the pizzas and set them on the kids tables (they are 6 and younger). As she missed in back with one of the pizzas, she saw us frantically trying to set up the table before the kids came back, and looked puzzled. I explained that kids that age don't really just grab a slice of piping hot off pizza by themselves.  i told her we were ready for cake and she said I will go get it. I asked if she could help cut/serve, not just carry it out. She didn't seem thrilled but ended up making a small effort and brought out a cake serving utensil.  I told her to skip the ice cream, which came with it, because we just didn't need it. But, the party included a tshirt for my child, that all the guests can sign. He was kinda looking forward to,that, since he has done it at other parties. After everyone left and she brought the check (with a bold handwritten star next to the the line where you write in the tip), I realized she forgot the shirt.   I went to the front and asked the manager to adjust the check for a coupon I forgot about (bday kid free) and mentioned I was disappointed about the shirt. He looked at me blankly. He offered a pizza paddle or something ridiculous. I said no, asked him to adjust the check accordingly and bring it back when done.   The party host retuned with the check (they took 7.99 off for the shirt) and then she stood there staring at me. She then asked if I was going to leave a tip!?!? I told her I would like to actually see the final total first and handed it to my husband, sort of hinting to stop standing there staring at me. We left what I think was a generous tip ($30) based on the fact that over a 90min period all she did was carry pizzas to our table and sorta help with cake.   What's funny, is that as we were leaving I saw another \"party host\" immediately setting up another party with water pitchers and water cups, and being helpful. I asked for water cups at one point and never even revieved them. I finally just gave the adults the Dixie cups that are used for tokens.  Definitely not going to have another party here. For the same money...go to pump it up or somewhere that makes it easy. At least the kids had fun!"}
{"text":"Went to have buffet lunch at 12:45. Had to wait a long time to even pay. Only one person at cash register. Then went to get pizza.  There where only two half filled pans. Both not hot. Salad had two of the three empty. No staff appeared to care. No staff said anything to the 6 of us waiting. The drink area was filthy soda all over. Most of the tables were not cleaned off. My question is where was the manager? The pizza that I  finally got was just so so. What has happened to the quality that use to be here? To me it is on the management shoulder. This is the second time in a row that it has been that way."}
{"text":"Brought the kids in for a reward for their hard work. The staff at this location (Dobson & 202 Mesa) is amazing. They are super friendly, and even though they were all busy , they provided exceptional customer service the whole time. The manager, Mike LaRocca was in the trenches with his team, whipping up orders and always had a smile on his face. The facility is clean, and the service is fast.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I gave them two stars because my nieces and nephew had a good time and I liked seeing that. Also they didn't take forever to make the pizza for the hungry vultures. However, I didn't get to eat because they DONT HAVE ANYTHING THATS GLUTEN FREE!!! It's 2017, PPP! People have celiac disease or trying out the next cool Fad!"}
{"text":"Lame. Waited 35 mins for my pizza when told it be ready in 25. Huge waste of space for parties. Just bout Every game was broken. Charge 65 cents for some ranch. Seriously!!  Will never be returning here. Chucky cheese has way more games an even if they packed you still dont wait over 30 mins for pizza. On top of it, every game cost 2 tokens (50) cents. Get real. Total rip off"}
{"text":"Got lured in for the $6.49 lunch buffet. What a waste of time and money that was! While the pizza taste slightly better than that at the Cici's buffet, it is still of low quality and got heartburn burpies before I even walked out the door. The bread sticks and desert are essentially the same product as the pizza, just one has cinnamon on it and the other has what appears to be cheese packet quality \"cheese\" spread across it. This \"buffet\" only had 1 or 2 salads out (both looked like Cesar). If you opt for any other type of salad dressing, they charge extra for packets of dressing. Recommend spending the extra $1 (appx) and hit up Fired Pie, Mod pizza or Pieology...and while those are not considered buffets, you can load that puppy up and get your moneys worth, as well as have much higher quality ingredients. Tip: Soda is not included in the price of the buffet."}
{"text":"Cleaner and better but still a bit of a nightmare.  I try to go early in the day on the weekends.  Beer selection is terrible but one isn't going to PPP for HH - but a good beer takes the edge off and allows the parents to stay a smudge longer which allows the kids to stay longer (and spend more tokens)... maybe someday the lines will be drawn?  IDK but until then  - we try to avoid at al costs until the pestering prevails.  Maybe that's the strategy?"}
{"text":"First timer. Came for a birthday party for my nephew. Pizza was better than I expected. Rather busy night, so there wasn't much room to move around. Many machines and games were not working. Which sucks, because we have five kids to entertain. The bathrooms were a stye (did I spell that right?).  I don't believe I will be back any time soon. There must be many better places for a birthday party."}
{"text":"New and improved! The five stars is for how accomodating the staff are. The food isn't gormet quality but it's yummy, consistent and reminds us all of a time gone by."}
{"text":"We had a really good experience. Food was good and atmosphere was good. We must of went on a really good day. Even other customers there to have a good time with their family were so kind to my kids. The manager there was so sweet. It's nice to get customer service from someone who you really know loves their job and their team.  I wish I could remember her name! We'll be back for more fun."}
{"text":"My 3 year old and I came in for the lunch buffet,  it's only $6.99 I believe and kids under 3 are free, which is perfect because my daughter don't eat much. The pizza was fresh, Alot of variety and it was delicious.  It was very clean,  and the kid area is better then other PPP. The staff was very friendly.  The restrooms were clean but their was a very strong poop smell, their was no air freshener around.  Overall I like this place Alot."}
{"text":"Nothing overly bad about it.  It's your standard Peter Piper.  I think my problem was more with the clientele than the employees or the facility.  I was born and raised in the barrio, but come on......kids were acting like their parents weren't even there.  When your kids are over ten, you need to let them know that Peter Piper and Chuck E Cheese aren't really for you anymore.  These kids were ten and twelve acting like they were five.  My grandma would have smacked em.  My parents would not have taken us there in the first place.  If it were just for the food and employees, it would be a three.  The customers make it a 2.  Rude!"}
{"text":"I've been passing this establishment since it's opening...but reluctant to stop in because of my diet restrictions. However when I received a discount coupon my curiosity got the better of me. The building is very large with an enormous amount of seating space, counter areas and separate arcade in the rear . The pizza was very varied and and hot. The salad was also fresh and crispy. The pasta was without doubt was one of the best. This restaurant beats the pants off other similar pizza buffets...especially CiCi."}
{"text":"Always a great place to bring our little one (4 years old) Games are Fun, pizza is always great. Prices haven't changed much over the years. Highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion."}
{"text":"Service sucked, had to keep repeating my order on the phone and the girl was no help with the questions I had. Then picking up my order the manager was even less help. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza actually--I'm shocked.  I used to take my daughter over to Chuck E. Cheese when we lived in the Bay Area and the pizza there was a friggin' joke.  This place has all the games and stuff that you would find at Chuck E. Cheese, but the pizza here is like ambrosia in comparison.  Tasty sauce, substantial and good-tasting crust, fresh toppings--yes, here the pizza isn't an afterthought to the games, the tokens, and the ticket redemption area.  If it wasn't for all the kids running around and the noise, I'd probably come here more often and just order pizza.  My daughter informed me after taking her to a classmate's birthday party here that she still prefers the pizza over at CEC's  Well, at least my wife and I can tuck into a nice pie while she plays games.  That and bottomless drinks--works for me."}
{"text":"Is it wrong that I like the taste of Peter Piper Pizza? It tastes like cardboard, but for some reason I love it still. I remember going to Peter Piper as a kid - having birthday parties here. Not this location, but still... they're all basically the same - various levels of shitty.   This location doesn't have too many kids usually and their arcade game selection is on the sad end of the scale. Still, I'm 33 - I don't come here for the games. I come for the shitty pizza... which I like. This place in particular does a pretty good job on the pizza - but most locations are about the same.  It's cheap and tasty and filling. If you haven't in a long time - get some take out or something... It's nowhere near the best pizza ever, but it's good in its own way. Don't judge my other pizza reviews by the fact that I like this crap. It's my secret shame."}
{"text":"We came here this past Friday night for a end-of-season baseball get together, and it was PACKED. Granted we did come on a Friday night, but for us to order our pizza for our family of three, we waited in line for 30 minutes, and at least another 30 to get the pizza itself. That was disappointing to say the least, but we understand they were busy. I normally love Peter Piper's pizza, but that night seemed to be particularly greasy. I will continue to return with the hopes that next time it is not quite so crowded."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to PPP since when do I need to leave a tip for take out. I went into card reader Not to leave a tip and my sale was cancelled. Until I had to say yes to tip of 10-20%. I should've cancelled and walked out but since I had 15 hungry kids at home I paid this. And all the pizza were cold what kind of racket are you guys doing. I thought PP was a place where families can go for a great evening and reasonable priced. I am sorry you have lost me as a long time customer."}
{"text":"Maybe Peter Piper should consider labeling the goodie bins with letters or numbers in addition to the amount of tickets required. Nathan was great with the hoard of children excited about their prizes but Steve was rude to several children ... \"use your words\" and \"use your outdoor voice\" were just a few comments that I heard him say. I realize it's noisy but kids are kids, they'd point to the item they wanted and Steve would make an exaggerated effort to lean over the counter to see what the children were pointing at.  I remarked that I couldn't name half of the items, outside of candy or the obvious pencil, what are most of those items called??  The more Steve barked, the more timid some children became. Our granddaughter decided to see if the ticket eater machine would take her ticket receipt ... to her surprise, it gobbled it right up!  We told Nathan (who was on the floor helping someone else) and he asked how many did she have, we told him 114, and he said no problem.  Unfortunately, Steve was available behind the counter before Nathan, he showed no sympathy toward us, we told him what Nathan had said and that was our only saving grace.  I appreciate all ages being employed but if children aren't your thing, don't work at Peter Piper Pizza, especially behind the prize counter!!  The food service portion of our visit was excellent, a very busy evening makes it hard to keep all the tables clean, understandable."}
{"text":"Fun Fun Fun 1 on 1 Driver Race Car Game. 2 Tokens. Clean Place. Friendly Service. Great Pizza. Good Time. Kids Had Fun Running About. We'll Be back!!"}
{"text":"I guess all that matters was that the kids had fun and they did. The place was clean. That's what I liked of this place. I think I got ripped off from the games at least 7 times! Either I didn't get tickets, or it would just steal my tokens. All the tickets I would have been winning would be given to my son so he could cash in and buy things at the counter. So I was pissed that it kept ripping me off. And the counter toys are super expensive! I don't think I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Free Wifi! We came for a Birthday party, we've been here before. I like how they announce the birthday kids birthday and wish them a Huge Happy Birthday. I like the setup of this Peter Piper, the party tables and the other tables have a wall separating them. It was a  little early so there wasn't too much of a crowd. The nice thing about coming early is the place is clean  and thats a plus! The assistant manager was really nice and on the floor as an active member keeping things up. The pizza seemed a little thinner than usual, but other than that the pizza was Peter Piper Perfect. I had some of the ice cream as well and it was good.  We shall be back either to this location or to others. I Love Pizza!"}
{"text":"I ordered our pizza on the way over so that there would be less of a wait. That was the first time I had done that, I'll probably do that from now on. On the phone I was told pizza will be ready in 15min. It was perfect timing, because it was ready by the time we sat down. We had a late night visit around 10 pm on a Saturday night, so the place was not busy at all. What a great time to go because this place is usually packed. Pizza was Peter Piper Perfect. I Love Pizza!"}
{"text":"The kids and I both enjoy Peter Piper Pizza! The lunch buffet is nice, yummy, and super cheap; but definitely not healthy. You even get the dessert cinnamon pizza with the buffet. I always end up spending $20 on tokens with my two kids, so I don't make it a habit of coming too often. This location seems pretty clean, and the staff so far has always been great. The pizza isn't the best in the world, but the best \"kids place\" pizza for sure. They have a lot of varieties, and even good options for vegetarian pizza."}
{"text":"I love taking my kids to Peter Piper Pizza for the lunch buffet. This is not the largest Peter Piper Pizza around so the arcade at this specific location is relatively small, but it's great for keeping your kids contained. My kids always have a great time and they also will make you a pizza for the buffet if you request, which is great because we don't do pork and like more variety than just cheese. The staff here are always friendly and helpful every time we go to this location. The only downside to going here is that I always end up spending a lot of money because of the tokens!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how good the service was (Sue...the manager was on her game)! The pizza was good and it seemed they had fresh hot ones coming out for the buffet at a good pace.  Also not usually a fan of salad but for some reason i had the Ceasar and again impressed.  Let's be real for the price this buffet is the best bang for your buck!  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Lots of fun with the games. My daughter loved playing and getting tickets, but my frustration is with the kitchen. I ordered boneless wings and plain bread sticks, no pizza. Took 30 minutes for the wings which is understandable, but the breadsticks came out separate and took 1 hour 1 minute from the time I ordered. Not real pleased! Kitchen needs some help!!"}
{"text":"This is the best peter piper in the area! (Dare I say all of Az?) management and employees are fun and helpful, speedy service and quality food :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times.  When you have a child it's almost unavoidable.  I must say that this location is nice, clean and the employees are friendly and helpful.  My sister and I took my daughter here for lunch as a birthday treat and she had a great time playing the games.  The employee who was working at the prize counter was very patient with the kids even when it got busy.  The food is average but they have a great lunch buffet.  Pizza and salad, all you can eat.  Adults are just $4.99 and kids are $3.99.  Good deal!"}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza- not just for kids anymore.  PPP, or P cubed if you will, has a great lunch special that's like $3.99 for all the salad and pizza you can eat. Drinks are extra of course. My friend was babysitting two little kids one morning, so we took them there and were pretty much the ONLY people there with children. In fact, I think most of the diners actually forgot that PPP is a family restaurant because whenever the kids would yell, laugh or cry, we kinda got some dirty looks. There are a lot of businesses in the area and PPP has really become the lunch spot of choice for many of the employees.  The pizza is good, but we also were probably the first people there, so we were able to get the grubby hands- free slices and salad from the buffet. We played some skee ball and rode the Motion Theater- which I highly recommend and then called it a day.  I say hit up PPP with or without kids, it's cheap, it's fun and they don't have creepy, singing robot animals like Chuck E. Cheese."}
{"text":"I walk up to the counter and I stand there a good two minutes before anyone comes out to acknowledge I'm at the counter and then some kid in street clothes rings me up.. The kitchen is a complete disaster there are dirty dishes all over the tables the floors and counters are covered in a bit of everything, the dining room area is trashed every table is dirty and there is crap all over the floor. Totally disgusted by this location.. It's clear that the workers do not clean regularly throughout the day.."}
{"text":"This was a very interesting experience for me. I had just gone with friends to see the Christmas lights, and I was tired, had a headache, and my stomach hurt a little (I'm old). I could not wait to drive home, but the kids wanted to eat something. They couldn't make up their minds. They kept waffling from Mexican to Indian to pancakes to steakhouses to sushi. I was losing my mind. One of them mentioned pizza, so to stop the craziness, I said \"Great..Pizza it is! Which place?\" The kids knew about this place. I'd never heard of it. We get there, and from the outside, it looked like one of those pizza buffet places. However, when we got inside, it was totally different. You ordered the pizza, it wasn't pay one price. There were a lot of big tables, perfect for our group. It was very clean. They gave us a buzzer to tell us when out pizza was done. Then the kids asked if they could go play the games. I had no idea what they meant...what games? Well...attached to the restaurant, was an arcade. Great idea! Gets the kids out of our hair for a few minutes. Even though the buzzer sounded, they brought the pizza to our table, because the place wasn't too busy. I guess that I was hungry, because I ate half of a large pizza. My stomach still hurt, but at least it was full now. And the pizza was good. We had the regular crust (half Hawaiian, half bacon). They offer regular crust, thick crust or thin crust, but the regular was pretty thin. If I ever throw a kid's party, it will be here."}
{"text":"pizza is ok but worst customer service in the game room and management staff is horrible. I was playing goal Line rush and the machine didn't register one token, so I went ahead and went to the redemption counter to ask for help. Once the second attendant came out, I let her know my issue and let her know that someone was playing the game right after I left the machine. She went to the machine and open up the coin door and looked at the coin Mechs and then drop to 2 tokens and played the game and told me the game was fine and paused for a few seconds, never did she apologize about the inconvenience or offered my tokens and automatically acted as if I was lying(come on I had over 100 tokens in my cups). That's when I got upset and asked for my money back and asked for a manager. The GM Brandon came out and I started to explain my situation to him and he told me she was doing her job. He also questioned why I was rising my voice, let me see.... I spend $70 in your establishment and when your game has a malfunction and I bring it your attention, you treat me as a liar....I don't know???   Don't waste your time and hard earn money here. You're better off going to D&B or Gameworks."}
{"text":"I'm just as surprised to write this as you likely are to read this but the pizza the other night was actually surprisingly good. Not just good for a Peter Piper Pizza too.   I've had worse pizza at places that are known for pizza. Way to go!   As for the rest of the place it seems pretty clean and new. The games worked and I enjoyed myself there with our friend's kids."}
{"text":"My first time to this location was a couple of weeks ago for a family outing.  The space is large and open, staff is friendly and helpful, and parking is plentiful and easy.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza to start and it was fine.  Nothing to rave about but it wasn't bad either.  My older child had a blast in their arcade and I found it enjoyable myself.    After taking a short break from the arcade, I ordered their Brookie - a brownie/cookie hybrid baked dessert with a serving of vanilla ice cream.  It took 25 minutes for this single item to ready but at least it came out warm and delicious.  It's very similar to the Pizzokies or whatever you want to call them that can be found at certain chain restaurants.  If I order it again, I'll be sure to order it with all of our food and not separately like I did so I won't be stuck waiting around.  With this location being so close to home, I plan on making regular visits here to treat my children for some food and fun."}
{"text":"This review is for a Birthday Party. We had our daughters 5th Birthday here on a Sunday afternoon, and honestly, it was great. We showed up 30 minutes early to get checked in and start picking what we were going to order. All the food came out great (pizza, wings, and salad). They did seem a little understaffed and I did over hear that someone quit before coming to their shift that day... which could have caused the lack of party helpers. Our party hostess was great at managing at least 3 parties that day and I'm not sure how she kept up with everything! Kudos to her bc I had no problems or issues with customer service or asking for stuff that we needed without it being brought on time. The one thing MOST Peter Piper Pizza's need to work on is spacing between the parties. Where we were located was between two other parties and there was only enough room for 1(maybe 2) person(s) to get through at a time."}
{"text":"Incredible this place is packed. There us about 30 plus people in each line to pay for food and for the buffet. Only 1 cashier. Manager is just walking around looking at all the people but does nothing about it. They have staff just standing around instead of going on the register to help out with the line. Or even to get salad on the buffet some people were madabout that to. The staff and management was more watching if people had the stamp on the hand for the buffet instead of getting the lines down. I asked the cashier witb this line go big why one one cashier she said thats what im saying. Then I send my daughter for a box for my left over pizza and the manager (white lady) tells her I cant bring your pizza over. I was like what the fuck? Since when im thinking its cuz I am Hispanic cuz I have naver had this problem anywhere else. I would not recommend this restaurant. Bad bad"}
{"text":"I really like this pizza and the lunch buffet is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I'm saying this with laughter and humor... I truly believe Peter Piper is a gateway drug to the casino... haha... some of the games have us grown folks dropping major coin to win these prizes and it's comical!!! No but seriously, if you haven't been to a place like this and you have kids, bring them. They make it easy for party celebrations, and the location has plenty of space to accommodate just about any group size.   Our experience was good as far as celebrating a friends daughters birthday (2 years old). They have plenty of TV's available with some kind of sporting event airing (football, soccer, golf, Hockey, etc...) and you can easily grab some beer (draft) or wine so you can \"try to relax\".    Most of the games are 1 token while some can be 2 or 4 depending on what your playing which makes it different then Chuck E Cheese (all games are 1 token no matter what) but the quality of games and space make it more appealing.  Plenty of choices from the menu of food items but most party's stick to Pizza, wings, and the dessert pizza (my favorite). Salad are pretty simple but pre-bagged so if your looking for fresh alternative options (aka gluten free, etc...) ... keep looking :-)   They were doing their best to keep it clean but with so many people at \"prime time\" it can be a bit challenging. Especially when you have some \"trifling folks\" who expect someone to clean up after them & their kids dropping cupcakes or spilling stuff... They are kids, what do you expect??    Given that we had a party event you work with your party coordinator. It was crazy busy when we went and lots of the guest were arriving throughout the event time so ordering additional pizza's just through the event coordinator could be challenging as your wanting to get your orders in ASAP. Turn time wasn't long but you can't use the regular line. That way they can easily track just the 1 bill you have.  Gave it 4 stars because is organized chaos!! I'm a parent with 2 kids so I know what to expect. This place works and the staff is doing their best with the chaos better than many other places I've visited."}
{"text":"Not a super big game room but ideal for birthday parties to keep track of the kiddos. Honestly, I come for the cinnamon bake desert!!!"}
{"text":"I normally love peter piper pizza!  Tonight we ordered our normal-  breadsticks & pepperoni pizza. Pizza does not look that fresh & the breadsticks are terrible!  They have no garlic butter stuff that they spread on them usually and they taste just like herb stuff, they were not made correctly. I'm not happy with the quality."}
{"text":"We just left Peter Piper Pizza Megan and Kayla made our experience really great. They got our order out fast and made us feel right at home. We love our Buckeye Peter Piper Pizza. Thank you Megan!!!  - Alonzo Family"}
{"text":"The food was as expected and the games were fine for the kids. My complaint is for the service. We purchased a bunch in extra tokens for the kids and after the evening was over we still had a ton left over. So, like a normal human, I took them up to the toy counter and asked them if I could exchange them for a larger denomination so I didn't have to carry $20 in tokens home with me. The sent me to the front counter. Ok, fine. So I went to the front counter and spoke to the Manager who told me their policy was they couldn't allow that. Something with inventory in the tills will be off and the cashiers are held accountable for it. Lame. So I go back to the table and my fiancé walks back up there and the same Manager does it for her. So.....why as a policy does Peter Piper not want us to be able to change in our 20 tokens and just take a single $20 token? Cruddy customer service but really not entirely her fault. Stupid policy. I guess we'll go spend our money at Fat Cats, Chuck E Cheese, or Main Event."}
{"text":"This place smells like sewer water or septic backup definitely not the place to eat...the smell will get you sick alone"}
{"text":"I luv the buffet here. Been to others but they rarely have all what they have here. Variety of pizzas, breadsticks, 2 different pastas, 3 different salads, and cinnamon pizza for dessert. Always be a go to spot."}
{"text":"This Peter Piper Pizza is the only place I will go for our pizza. It is always excellent & in the event that a mistake is ever made, they always make it right and then some!!! Way better than Dominos or Pizza Hut. The pizza and the toppings are always fresh and the employees are wonderful!!!! Yes, I am definitely a frequent flyer!!!!!! ; )"}
{"text":"First off if you carry...Peter Piper Pizza does not believe in our 2nd Amendment Rights. Therefore we shall never return.   That said we arrived at 105 to a completely empty bufett that took untill 130 to get caught back up. Pizza is good overall. Not the best or worst bufett.  Middle of the road. Cheap food almost fast."}
{"text":"The manager was very rude and unwelcoming. Came in with a group of friends on business and then said she didn't allow people who didn't pay for the buffet to sit with us. She was making us uncomfortable by watching us eat the whole time."}
{"text":"First time here, the pizza is pretty good. The nuggets are good. Management is very nice and the cashiers friendly as well. The playground is ok and the games were fun."}
{"text":"The buffet price includes all you can eat pizza and salad.  The price is a great deal.  Have a dozen varieties of pizza choices. The seating is spacious.  The salad is fresh."}
{"text":"This Peter Piper is usually good service. It's too bad Peter Piper is so corporate and works these poor people so hard.  Hire more people for goodness sakes! I was placed on hold tonight for a few minutes and finally hung up. I feel really bad for the folks that work here. They get 5 stars in my book and PPP corporation gets 1."}
{"text":"It was overall a good experience for a birthday party for my 7 year old and his buddies from school.   For about $12 a head (adults and kids) we had enough pizza and drinks for everyone, and even wings and a couple of pitchers of beer for the grown-ups. The price even included ice cream, which went well with the cake I brought. Go for the extra token deal (100 for $20). It's hard to have too many tokens in a situation like this.  Food quality is about what you'd expect in an arcade that sells pizza. Nothing to complain about, really.  This location sometimes gets a few bad mentions for the clientele. We were there mid-afternoon on a Saturday and anyone used to a diverse central-city crowd wouldn't have been put off by any customer in attendance. Service was pleasant and and well-experienced. Our server knew how to stage things sequentially, which was appreciated.  About the only downside is parking. You might need to park between the pad which houses the place and the remnants of Tower Plaza instead of directly in front. Not a big deal."}
{"text":"Cool place to bring the kids.  We basically ate for nothing, let me explain :)  Since both of my kids made it to honor roll, they get 5 bucks worth of tokens and a free personal pan pizza.  Yes we had to foot the bill for drinks, but after 4 bucks we spent a few hours here.    Pretty good deal and a great way to encourage kids to get good grades.  Dinner, games, and a family event what else could you ask for?  Great customer service and in general the staff enjoy being around kids."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. They recently updated and it looks nice. It's partitioned very well and doesn't have a confusing feel like some other peter piper's or chuckie cheese.   We were here on a Friday around 6pm and it was pretty dead but lots of employees on top of things including the manager walking the floor. An employee did check on us with how the pizza was and it was nice and hot which it always is. The usual ball machine which the kids are usually 50/50 on gave them one EVERY TIME, so they stopped at 4 balls. I think most games are 2 tokens now and sometimes you get more fun than you spend and sometimes not.   Not the cheapest place for eating out if you include tokens but we never have a bad experience here and enjoy the pizza and the kiddos enjoy the games."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday which was a Saturday. Very dirty place floors looked horrible tables were nasty. Pretty sad when customer had to clean off the tables themselves. I ordered wings with my pizza and pizza came out wings weren't ready. I totally understood that but when other wings are coming out to people who ordered after me I asked the lady I believe a manager she had a different shirt on she looked at my ticket I asked why others got theirs first she said that's just the way it is. Horrible horrible customer service. Poor toy counter girl was the only one up there with 30 kids waiting. Young guy came in there just to clean up the area and left. I asked someone if she could have help and that same young kid came back out. How sad. Plus she had no clue what kids were standing there. 30 mins later we were helped. I wouldn't recommend this Peter piper ever."}
{"text":"106 degrees outside and it feels like the same inside. Everyone in our party complained of the heat, people around us fanning themselves with paper plates. Manager said they're working on it, he said there is too much body heat because this place is packed! He said if they turn up the air the a/c freezes up. So what do they do? Only put only two fans on top of the drink machines. Really?? That would cool maybe a 5 foot radius... People are sweating through their t-shirts and I have sweat running down my neck. There's a Home Depot down the block, get some portable a/c units. Hmmm...This has happened before if he knew the a/c freezes up.  Don't come here unless you want heat stoke!"}
{"text":"Brought my son and niece here on Sunday for some pizza and games.  The location is OK.  I typically go to one near Arrowhead mall which sets the bar high.  This location had an OK game selection.  Many of the machines were out of or not distributing tickets.  Frustrating for 6 year olds.. (and 31 year olds..)  Though I don't necessarily choose Peter Piper for their namesake, the pizza is far better than Chuck E Cheese's.  I'd rather eat salad then eat pizza there.  The pizza at this location was ok.  Seemed to lack the flavor that I am used to, but maybe it was just me..  Overall, we had a great time.  Won a bunch of tickets.  I somehow managed to get both kids to SAVE their tickets up for a bigger prize.  Trust me, not an easy thing to convince a kid to do."}
{"text":"Always like their lunch buffet when I'm just looking for a quick pizza and salad fix not just kid friendly but adult as well I'm not a vegetation but their California veg.is always tasty"}
{"text":"The food came out slow... The token machines dispensed the incorrect amount of tokens..."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet as my oldest son has been begging to go. It was a mad house!  There was no ice for fountain drinks, no forks, no breadsticks, hardly any pizza to choose from (due to them not keeping up with the demand), and only 1 salad to choose from. I saw many 'questionable' people loading up their plates--like 8 slices on one plate. It was so busy that they didn't even have proper plates. We ate on cheap paper plates!  We stood in line for over 10 minutes to get through the buffet line. I was still hungry after my one slice of pizza and handful of salad, but didn't want to go wait in the line again, as it was even longer. I guess it's a good diet plan."}
{"text":"It's not the worst, but certainly not the greatest either. The locks in the bathroom stall doors need to be replaced. I had to pay an arm and a leg just for fountain drinks. I kind of wish they had a different set up for the games. It's just too small of a space. You are likely to have kids running into you and you will probably have the adults running into you as well. I also wish you had more toddler friendly games. My daughter is two and most of the games don't suit her. Also, if anyone plans a pizza night. Don't plan for Saturday. Trust me, it's not worth it. Loud and annoying. You can't sit and talk to anyone because of the noise."}
{"text":"My childhood was all about Peter Piper Pizza. Was really excited they started opening again throughout the valley and was excited to attend a party there this evening. Told my eldest son this was my Chuck E. Cheese.   Sadly, it was disappointing. Far from what I remembered as a child. Place had a huge dining area (YAY) but tiny game area (BOO). The game area was a third of the dining area. Games were far more expensive than CEC. On top of that most games had a stick saying, \"I'll be fixed soon!\"  With a limited amount of games as it is, it's sad to have almost a quarter of the games down. On top of that, no rides. Now correct me if I'm wrong but Peter Piper Pizza was known for their rides. Selected but they had rides which added to the fun.   Would I come back? Never, unless I am attending a party.   It's honestly not worth it."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza but the area for the games was too small.. Not enough variety of games.. It's not like the Peter piper pizza from before."}
{"text":"Cheap and average food for a buffet. Need to do a better job corraling the kids, they run all over and to be honest it just seems dangerous.  I think if they could somehow block the dining side a little better it would be more condusive to a better experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some lunch over the weekend for the first time. Was hoping to try out the buffet, but that is only Monday-Friday's. We ordered a large New York 3-Cheese with Pepperoni (Blend of Mozzarella, Cheddar and Smoked Provolone. Topped with Pepperoni and Special Herbs and Spices), a soft drink, and a beer. Our total was about $24.   I did see a special for one large item pizza, bread sticks, and tokens (I forget how many tokens) for $19.99 that I wanted to try for the video games, but my boyfriend warned me that their games were lame these days. I went and looked and behold, all of the cool arcade games have been replace with lame ticket machine games! I then realized how old I have become and even things at Peter Piper Pizza change over time.  The pizza was yummy. I asked for parmesan and the girl who gave me my pizza pointed into a sea of people and tables. I walked that way, saw where I think there were supposed to be bottles of it, and didn't find any. I waited until I found an empty table that people had already left to snag one. For a Saturday this location was not very busy, so I think they need to put out more parmesan. The pizza was hot and tasty, the beer was flat though. The bathrooms were also clean but my bathroom stall door would not stay shut. Management should fix this."}
{"text":"Busy on weekends, its a Peter Piper what more to really say."}
{"text":"Here for a B-Day party, very busy location, staff was attentive and kids loved the games. Its Peter Piper what more can I really say busier than most locations"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Petter Piper Pizza since I was kid. There pizza is really good, flavorful and crunchy crust! I just recently tried there fried zucchini and it was also pretty good. The staff here was pretty friendly and gave me extra ranch no charge."}
{"text":"My 3 year old loves coming here, and I actually enjoy it too. The lunch buffet is a great deal. I only wish they would play different channels on the televisions. It's always ESPN, Fox News, and Cartoon Network.  None of those are appealing to a Mom who's out with her kids. How about some HGTV or TLC?"}
{"text":"Well you know what to expect, had the lunch buffet, hit the spot for several different pizzas I craved."}
{"text":"This review is for the weekday buffet. It is MADNESS during the lunch rush!!! At first, there was only ONE cashier and literally 20 people in line! Speaking of the line, the line to grab pizza is simply crazy!! There were 30 people consistently in line and the line goes slow!! It is kind of like waiting for an airplane to disembark...you simply can't understand what takes so damn LONG for the line to move!!!   There are people who take SO MUCH pizza at once that I just don't get it. It slows down the line. If everyone would just take a few slices, the line would move quicker and you would eat HOT pizza!! Then there are the idiot parents who give a plate full of pizza to a three year old (more pizza than a three year old could possibly eat) and the three year old drops the pizza off the plate in front of the pizza line and there is more hold up for clean up. Yes, it happened twice involving small children, that I saw, probably more that I didn't see. Then there was the adult who piled his plate so high that pizza slid off his plate right in front of the pizza line. Geez.....  The employees were hustling, but I think they need more employees to handle the crowds!! Often the salads were empty. Since the line was so long for pizza, I would have settled for salad, but there wasn't any salad of any variety!!  This buffet is actually good, the variety is satisfying, and at a great price, but the crowds are frustrating! The employees here impressed me. Despite the crowds, the chaos and the demands, they all had great attitudes!! The employees are an asset to this location!!   I'd give the buffet 5 stars for the price and the variety, but I give only three stars because there was only one cashier when the line was so long, the salad was often empty, the desert was empty at the end of our visit, and more didn't get put out before it was time for us to leave!!"}
{"text":"I will update my ratings because my concerns were addressed promptly and solved ... Brittany was great made sure Everything was compensated above and beyond . Was absolutely shocked by the customer service and prompt attention to my complaints .."}
{"text":"They have good deals on family packs which includes pizza, drinks an tokens and I also ordered hot wings and they are actually good!   The manager, I think his name is Mike, was very nice and greated us when we walked in and he personally took our order. We are definitely coming back again to try the buffet lunch special we didn't know they have.   Very nice place to take the kids to have fun and eat. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after church so that the kids could play. Pizza was average as expected and the kiddos had a great time as always. I became concerned when toward the end of the eveing the staff was cleaning the resteraunt with a leaf blower (that was not a misspell) when people were still eating. Now I am concerned about the rest of the place.  Don't come here with high expectations."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Friendly service. Terrific value!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet for $6 is a steal!  The great white pizza is incredible! If you're into just a simple pizza, you can't go wrong with their pepperoni. Super cheesy, super delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of other Peter Pipers in the valley and this one just doesn't measure up.   The good: the woman who took our order was super friendly and it was ready in a timely manner. The breadsticks weren't as good as the other locations for some reason, but they were fine. Our pizza was also just not quite up to par (again, not like we expect gourmet from PP but still) but still enjoyable for what it is.   I will say this space is much smaller than other locations. The games are just lined up along the wall and there is no barrier or clear \"game area\". Again there is a lack of space to do so. A few booths along the window then long tables lined up diagonally to take up the rest of the area.   The bathroom was as clean as it could be for being so old. This place seriously needs an upgrade especially if you're bringing your kids here or would want a birthday party here. The other locations show this one up. I get you can't do much about the size of the space but a little update would do wonders.   If you have the resources to get to another location I would say it's worth the drive. If not, this place will do, but won't get any younger."}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know about this place is it is geared towards families with kids, they always have birthday parties going on and they have games in the back where you can win tickets and trade them in for prizes, so if you don't like eating around kids, avoid this place right off the bat.   I would imagine this place is great for said parties and families. I have no idea what kind of service they provide for parties, so if that is what you are interested in ignore this review.   I don't have kids but I do enjoy pizza. It was around 3pm on a Saturday so I figure we were probably in between most larger parties. There were still several families already eating and kids running around but nothing terribly crazy.   Ordered a large pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni. You order at the counter and they give you a buzzer, when it goes off you go up and pick up your food. I liked the pizza, it had thinner crust (but not \"thin crust\" style) and even though it was basic, sometimes that is exactly what I'm looking for. Nothing gourmet, nothing fancy, just some good old pizza that isn't from papa johns or Pizza Hut. I definitely think this pizza is better than that, but it just depends on how you like your crust.   Overall a nice casual place for easy pizza. But be prepared to be around families and don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"The waiting time for pizza is ridiculous, the manager will not even give a refund waiting over 2hours for pizza for a party . Do bring your kids to this location it sucks big time !!!!!"}
{"text":"best location in Arizona..they still have the old style oven and not the new conveyer belt style oven that they are all using now..also, its been remodeled within the last year or two.staff is pleasant, and their buffet ,during the weekdays, is always busy, so they are doing something right. I've been to newer locations that are run down, and this one is very nice considering its age. I've been going to this one since I was like 7 years old (I'm 33). I hope it never moves from this location."}
{"text":"Greatest pizza place of all time they sexy black guy who works there as well in the mornings"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here and I gotta say I enjoyed it. Being our first time there we took a super long. The lady who took our order was very patient and nice. She helped us choose the right combo for the best price.   The facility is nice and clean. We at at the long tables which I think is more for birthday parties. Since there was only one other group in the entire restaurant I don't think they cared. I was a little amazed that the video games worked and was in nice condition.   The food was good. I enjoyed the pizza. We ordered the regular crust and it had great flavor. We also ordered some mild wings and they also tasted great. I do have to say that the wings were very very small. I don't know if that means that their chickens had less steroids or what but at least they tasted good. The kids ate their pizza quick which is a good thing because they are picky eaters. So I'm guessing we will be back."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I tag along on outings to kid-oriented pizza places quite often. My expectations are low. As long as the young ones have fun, I'm good. Despite this, Peter Piper Pizza found a way to disappoint.  I have posted photos of two pizzas: The California Veggie we received and the promotional photo from which we ordered. No resemblance. Worse still, there was a very bitter aftertaste that made it inedible. Perhaps from the mushrooms? We talked about returning it, but instead just focused on the pepperoni pizza we had also ordered.  The kids? They had fun. But our meal was $60 including game tokens. With inedible pizza, a good family value it was not. The adults went home hungry. Also, there is no salad bar available in the evening; just some prepackaged and expensive mixed lettuce. Where are all the \"healthy choices\" they advertise?"}
{"text":"Despite updating their logo and new advertising emphasizing healthy choices, it's still Peter Piper Pizza. The pizza is affordable. The drinks less so. Game tokens don't go as far as you'd expect because so many games require two or more.  We opted for basic single topping pepperoni and sausage pizzas due to the preferences of the young ones in our party. Not horrible, but... There was one twenty something with us who loved the pizza, however, sentimentally reliving all those birthday parties of her youth.  We came on a Saturday, a mistake of course. Our two little girls (ages four and five) were elbowed out of a game they were learning by an aggressive older boy. I intervened, pointing out he was stealing by taking over their game in progress. His parent was disinterested. Youthful Peter Piper Pizza employees were nowhere in sight. I had to pull the boy away myself. The game area was very chaotic all around. Definitely some more employee monitoring is needed during the busy times.  My suggestion? Go to Chuck E Cheese if you have young children. It's safer for them. The tokens go farther (less confusing for little ones since most games require only one token). Security at the door is better. A minimum wage teenager dressed as a mouse. Even the pizza, while not great, is preferable. And cost is only a little higher.   If you just want a cheap lunchtime buffet, or if your kids are a little older, PPP may still be fine."}
{"text":"As Peter Piper Pizzas go, this is a pretty nice one.  Large dining room, with large round tables, long tables and booths, a seating arrangement for any need. Despite some comments to the contrary in other reviews, the staff seems to do a good job keeping the facility clean.  There is an extensive play area, with a variety of games appropriate for a wide range of ages. Most everything was functioning on this visit. A heads up. You'll only receive half the tickets indicated on many of the games, but will then receive twice the credit for your tickets when you feed them into the automated ticket counters. Works out in the end.   You'll see televisions at all angles, playing cartoons for the kids and sports for the parents.  The problems every Peter Piper Pizza has persist here. The pizza is of marginal quality, suitable for kids, but a disappointment for most adults. There may be lots of aggressive kids and parents at peak times, with little staff supervision evident. While the pizza is reasonably priced, a visit can become expensive for a family when you factor in beverages and especially tokens for the games. And it's amazing how little you will receive at the prize counter in exchange for hundreds of tickets.  In summary, your kids will love it and you should be able to tolerate it. Not a bad outing."}
{"text":"They had my niece's birthday party here and sometimes I take my niece and nephew here when I'm in town visiting. They have a ton of tables, perfect for parties. They have a ton of tvs. They have a cool area with a ton of games. It's not huge like a Chuck E. Cheese but it's entertainment enough for children. They have a small prize counter to cash in your tickets. The food is mediocre but better than Chuck E. Cheese!"}
{"text":"Peter piper is pretty awesome.  it's great for kids, great for families, it's just great for everyone.  What more is there to like,  it's pizza, games, and fun for all ages.  i know that i would recommend this pizza place any day."}
{"text":"We were planning on going to another pizza establishment, but there was a line and we didn't feel like waiting.  My father in law took me to a Peter Piper a few years ago, and surprisingly, it was decent!  I had seen this place a few times, as well as the one closer to my house in Surprise.  I remembered that they had a decent priced lunch buffet, so we decided to stop in for some grub.  First off, this Peter Piper is HUGE!  Never seen one as big in my life.  They were super busy, yet there were still tons of open places to sit and room to merge.  We decided to go with the weekday lunch buffet.  The buffet  was $6.49 and kids under 3 eat for free.  It was only $16.50 for all 3 of us to eat including one soda.  Not bad, not bad at all.    The lunch buffet had a lot of different options.  Because they were so busy, fresh pizzas were coming out left and right.  At any given time, they had at least 10 pizzas to choose from.  They also had cheesy bread, garlic knots/rolls, a salad (didn't try any of it) as well as 2 different kinds of dessert pizza.  The pizza is not \"gourmet\" or anything like that, but it was surprisingly good and especially good for only $6.49.  It was way better than somewhere like Little Ceasars, Pizza Hut, Dominos etc.  It almost reminded me of the pizza I make at home.  Pretty thin crust, not too much sauce, and lots of cheese.  The best thing at the buffet had to have been the garlic knots.  These are little thumb sized balls of dough, coated in garlic oil and salt.  The outer crust of these things had a bunch of tiny bubbles on them and that provided great texture and a really good crunch while biting into them.  I was impressed!  The dessert pizzas were pretty good, too!  They had an apple cinnamon one and a strawberry type one.  The apple cinnamon was the better of the 2.  The strawberry one was a bit too sweet.  After we were done eating, we dropped a couple of bucks at the arcade type thing they have.  This part of the restaurant was actually a bit small.  They could use some extra space of the dining area to maybe expand the games?  They only had like 2 \"rides\" for little kids and one of them was broken.  Most of the games were ticket type games.  They did have one claw machine with those rubber spiky balls in them.  I won 2 of them for my son, Bill.    Overall, I liked it better than I probably should have.  If I'm going out for pizza and want to spend some decent money, Peter Piper is nowhere in the equation.  If I want a cheap, fast, and unlimited buffet, Peter Piper is my place!  I can definitely see having a birthday party here or just coming back during the week on one of my days off when I don't want to drop $15.00 on a \"good pizza\".  The price can't be beat and the quality is not bad...even for a pizza snob like myself ;-)."}
{"text":"This location has ovens that other  locations do not, if you grew up on this pizza the pizza made in these ovens will take you back. When other locations went to conveyor BS this location will give you the best pizzas with the PPP taste. They might not have a lot of games but they have the best pizza of any Peter Piper hands down, I travel from goodyear to Scottsdale just for the pizza."}
{"text":"Ok I was not expecting much, and they delivered.  It was clean, so that was good.  They have the games off in the back, so if you do not want to sit by a bunch of kids you do not have to.  The pizza is just bland and boring.  I had a buffet and the salad is all mixed together with the dressing.  I tried it, but I knew it was gonna be nasty.  I'm not sure why I went in today.  Nostalgia got the better of me.  I miss the old days when they had fried zucchini in long strips, and the sauce was tangy.  Those days are gone.  It did not help that the man at the counter looked me up and down and said, \"Well hellooo there.\" and then proceeded to call me \"Love.\"  Ewww.  Just ewww.  Don't. Do. That."}
{"text":"I love taking the kids here but something happened last Friday that had me baffled. My family and I were eating lunch when a lady came in to pick up her pizza. I really don't know exactly what happened but then I heard shouting when I looked up it was coming from the manager who got in the lady's face and was yelling calling her names. I quickly distracted my children so they did have to see how obscene that man was being to the customer. Bad service and we won't be back if their employees act this way."}
{"text":"I've literally been coming to this location since birth. Never once have I personally had a bad experience. I ordered today over the phone and had the customer service provided to me by Delores. She spoke clearly and offered promotions and even up sold me on my size of pizzas! Very nice when your the voice of a company for your customers."}
{"text":"The manager, Steve, was very rude. I was asking for information about parties and he said he couldn't talk to me until after the dinner rush was over. I totally agree but the way he said it was very arrogant. When I asked his name, he said, \"Steve, and have a great night.\" I then said I would still like to talk about the party he just turned around and kept walking. This is the way your treated when you want to spend money at their establishment. :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the lunch buffet. They had several types of pizza and even though it was busy it was still fairly stocked. The staff was really nice and the games were mostly working, but some of them did not give out tickets when they should. (One of the skeeball machines for example)."}
{"text":"I think it deserves 4 stars. Don't walk in and expect gourmet pizza. But for $6.50 from 11-2 you can get a nice little buffet with several options. I didn't have one I disliked. The cherry and cinnamon pizzas were great and also the salads were good... nice and cold and I really liked the mandarin cranberry one. They got a little game section as well"}
{"text":"Pizza. Just basic not worth the  the 50 dollars for 2 pizzas and 20 wings I will never  eat at this chain again    pizza  had spaghetti sauce    and little to no cheese on pizza. Wings. We're the same thing  seems like premaid  grocery store  wings with Frank's  red hot sauce on them. Smh.  Really bad experience. Sorry"}
{"text":"We went for a family night on Thursday and the staff there are absolutely fantastic! So friendly and accommodating I was blown away how they all went above and beyond. Bertha was great about helping me with a game that wan't working and they made the pizza wrong so they made another one without hesitation. I really am still amazed about how great their customer service is. Whoever is their manager should be super proud!"}
{"text":"Once a year or so my kids will finally beg me enough for me to bring them here. I don't enjoy these kind of places at all and the mediocre pizza doesn't help. I like that they have a buffet at lunch time. It makes it easier to please everyone as far as what kind of pizza they want but you have to be quick to get what you want. The kids like it here and I guess that is who its for but if it were up to me I would never come here."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly!!! They greeted us the second we walked in. The buffet is what we came for, it's from 11-2 and $6.49 for adults, $4.49 for kinds and under 3 are free. Drinks are separate, and a little pricey, but it's free refills. They ask you if you would like any specific pizza, and will make it for you, which is awesome!!! The place is also super clean, which is a major plus!!! They must have remodeled at some point because I remember it being much smaller. I'd recommend coming here for the lunch buffet, it's relatively quiet because as long as it's not summer or a holiday, the big kids are in school, and it's mostly adults with small children."}
{"text":"They did the place over a while ago since that the prices went up and the quality of food went down. You use to come here at least once every other month or so but last couple of times the food has been crappy and there prices went up. Think I'll just start ordering in and find a game for the kids to play."}
{"text":"Decent place for all-you-can-eat pizza, but it felt like a really weird version of Chuck E. Cheese or John's Incredible Pizza with all the games and prizes. The price was only $4 when I went many years ago, but I'm sure the price has gone way up in the intervening time that's passed. I remember eating pizza, salad, breadsticks and ice cream, which isn't terrible for $4 plus tax and tip. Staff barely interacted with me and the place was clean. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Been there many times but I actually went for lunch. I they had many different pizza to choose from for the buffet, but that's about it, they constantly ran out of salad, garlic bread and the desert were not even there. Those two items finally came out close to two, but that's when it's all over.   The place is dirty and I hate seeing food in the game area."}
{"text":"Horrible experience don't go here at all! We ordered 2 extra large and were given the wrong ones. I know this place is filled with kids, but this time it was blood curdling loud screaming non stop. Walked out with my pizza to go instead.  Also, the tables were DIRTY."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price for all you can eat. Salads are great and they ask what pizza would you like on the buffet."}
{"text":"Great place.  The only thing that concerned me is yesterday 3/31/2017 took my daughter to the restroom and your establishment had no hand soap.  Worried me because how do you guys wash your hands (employees).  Not only that but my 2 year old got diahria an hour after eating and is still with the runs today.  Just to be safe I'm not taking my family anymore.  Always check restroom before eating it tells how well maintained and sanitary the place is."}
{"text":"C got asked to join a friend for a Peter Piper night. Yippee. OK, that's not fair. It's just that the entire experience, almost, is geared for kids. So when a kid is invited it's like they've won the lottery. It's hard to tell them they can't go because YOU don't want to. Anywhoos,  This location has plenty of parking. The night we were there they were doing awards for a city football league. There were a lot of people there, but it still didn't feel that crowded.  The staff was nice enough, mostly younger kids. There was relatively no line to order when we got there and the counter person was very nice.   We ordered a large pizza so we could take some home to K. The pizza is average at best. But C is more interested in the games. I buy a token pack so he has plenty of game time. C and his buddy literally played for a couple hours. I guess in the end, that makes it a great place for parents as well because you have a place where your kids can run off and have fun without driving you crazy.  The facility was clean as well. A couple small negatives were that the soda machine station ran out of ice, but it was refilled relatively quickly and it was actually kind of messy. I figure that was about par for the course though since there were so many little rugrats running around getting their own sodas.  Average Pizza. Average Price. Clean Facility. Nice Staff. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Great Place for kids and parents because they have beer on tap! Free Wi-Fi and very clean"}
{"text":"I just want to thank the entire staff who was working today, and give a SPECIAL THANK YOU to Amanda!!  My boy and I live near by, and go to this Peter Piper Pizza a couple times a month for daddy / son time.  Multiple times when we are there, so is Amanda. Every time she seems to be at the ticket counter. Instead of just taking your tickets and giving prizes, like most other places, she always engages my son and I (and others) in a genuine way - trying to make our experience special.  I truly appreciate her making our time even that much more memorable - thank you! Ryan & Marcus"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was kid , there pizza is the best if you want convenience and great deals. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"If you have kids, bring them here! If your kids love pizza, bring them here! If you kids love arcade games, bring them here!  This place is the mecca for kiddos and grown-ups who are a kid at heart. I've been bringing my nieces to this Peter Piper Pizza for years and they love running around from one game to the next. PPP also has decent pizza and thank goodness that they have beers on tap. The kiddos tire themselves out from eating and playing for hours.   Let's just say, I will be bringing the kiddos back here more often than I should :)"}
{"text":"We came here for a bday party....   it is our worst experience since we started coming here.     Service time was horrible, we had to keep asking for our order....  when they did get our food it was only partial.    Pizza was made very sloppy."}
{"text":"We of frequent Peter piper as we have small children and look for family friendly fun options. This place is always clean and employees are always friendly. Decent selection of games and prize selection could be better but all in all great fun and tasty food"}
{"text":"Good food Great service from the staff Never got food that i needed to send back I like all the peter pipper pizzas. I always take my kids there and they always have a blast. There are many locations and all the ones i have been to are pretty good."}
{"text":"This is the mutha load of the Peter Piper Pizza Arcade.  We are talking spending $40 on skeetball and \"bop the frog\"-- easily.  To be completely honest, not that I am a PPP connoisseur, this location at Tower Plaza has the best pizza of all the PPP.  They sell beer too.  And it's cheap and just when you crave that card-boardy crust and minimal sauce with really greasy cheese, this place seems to get it just right and I like it and I am not afraid to admit it.  thankyouverymuch"}
{"text":"On October 25th I placed an order online to make it quick and convenient for pick-up. I ordered a pizza and wings. The given pick-up time was 7:54 so i got there a few minutes after 8:00. After I paid the cashier told me my order was not ready and that i would be out soon. After waiting 20 minutes I went back up to ask if it was ready, she asked the other workers then finally looked in the oven where they keep finished orders and realized it had been sitting there the whole time. They then could not find my wings, which ended up being in the same oven. My pizza was cold and my wings were cold and chewy. I decided I would give it another chance and went back this past Thursday. I did not order online, i went in and ordered. My pizzas came out at different times, it was not even cut properly the slices ripped in half, and my wings were not the correct flavor. I took the wings up and they said they were correct which I knew was not true because i ordered the same ones the last time I had went. I then walked back up to buy ranch, a worker made eye contact with me as im standing there waiting and she pulled her phone out her pocket and walked towards the back. She then walked to another guy and asked him a question. He looked at me too and continued to do what he was doing. She then walked to the front grabbed something and left. They were all aware that I was standing there and it was clear I needed help, I had cash in my hand and stood right infront of the register but was not acknowledged. After a few minutes of standing there another girl came from the back and helped me. As she took the money she answered a phone call and did not hand me my change back. Will not return to this location, poor customer service and food was not correct. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Would not give any stars if I could!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place for a large selection of pizza buffet. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pizza was fresh, hot and delightful."}
{"text":"First time at this location. We came when the buffet was closing. Normally, we'd expect the workers to be unhappy we came in so late--not at all. The two guys working were SO nice. Their customer service rocks. The food was even great! We also normally go to the one in Gilbert, but this one was close to us--it was so clean as well. Not sure why all the bad ratings...it's not a fancy pizza place. Definitely five stars for what it's worth."}
{"text":"always check the online coupons there's always good dealFill in manager Christina was very nice"}
{"text":"I stand by my first review but I cannot compliment the weekend service. We went here this past Sunday. It was fulled packed. The game area was horrible with almost every machine being occupied. But that's understandable. What I cannot give a pass to, is the pizza quality. I usually like the pizza here but on this day it was horrible. Too much sauce and not enough cheese on the pepperoni pizza. CLEARLY, they were trying to push out the pizzas ASAP and were ignoring the quality. Unacceptable. PPP, I'm sure many customers would prefer that you take your time to correctly make the pizzas instead of pushing them out as fast as you can. Horrible quality. Will not return on a weekend. We will stick to weekdays."}
{"text":"I may be an adult now, but this is and always has been my favorite pizza!! Some people hate it, but I think it's absolutely the best pizza. :)"}
{"text":"This place is starting to become one of the messiest places to eat I've ever been to. Fresh meat   for all meat pizza? I found a cockroach on the table still alive."}
{"text":"We came to have a small celebration for my daughters 7th birthday and as she put it, it was \"the BEST birthday EVER\" ! I'm very lucky to have such a thankful child who was happy with her mom and dad, 1 Aunt, 1 Uncle, 1 Cousin and Grandma and Grandpa as the party guest!  Let me start by saying that we walked in not knowing what the heck we were gonna do, even though we've been there a million times before.  So we talked to Matty, the Manager and he gladly helped us out with the carry out special that we ate there.  He was very accommodation and super nice!  The pizza was great and the cheese and peppers shakers were all filled.  I know that seems like a very miniscule thing, but when all you want is to shake some cheese and pepper on your pizza, it's nice not having to go ask them to be refilled or ask the table behind you to use theirs.  All the games were working and none were out of tickets.  Matty even gave my daughter a big, ginormous purple Peter Piper Pizza pen for her birthday.  She LOVED it!  So thank you for making her very \"quaint\" party \"the BEST birthday EVER!\""}
{"text":"Are you ready to carb-load on the cheap? If the answer is yes then this is your place to be.  I came here for the lunch buffet with zero expectations.  They have pre-made salads they were ok but a little soggy but the real reason we are here is the PIZZA.  It's definitely better than cici's and they have a wide variety of pizzas and the cashier even asked us if we had any requests. I'm a vegetarian and they had cheese, veggie pizzas available every trip and cheese sticks and pretzel sticks too.  I'm sure they would have made something custom but I wasn't feeling picky and didn't want wait for a special pizza. The dessert pizza is so good -the cherry and the cinnamon equally good. You can find coupons that make it  a steal of a deal too."}
{"text":"Nice place to take kids if you can handle the crowd of other kids. Good family place."}
{"text":"Visited this place on November 19th 2016, which is National Adoption Day, and the service was horrible. The cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. We had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. As we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet. At that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time. The food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. This place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business."}
{"text":"PPP has some of my favorite pizza. This location is pretty good, but it could be cleaner. There are always dirty tables and trash everywhere. However, the pizza, breadsticks, and boneless wings are all very good. Whether we order to go or to dine in, the food is consistently good and comes out quickly."}
{"text":"I swear they water down the beer here. Other than that, there was a melted ice cream cone in the arcade the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"My kids ALWAYS want to come here! The pizza actually doesn't taste bad! One of my children doesn't particularly care for sauce, so the garlic bread pizza they serve is right up his alley. The weekday lunch buffet is a great deal. They even let a child age 2 or under eat it for free (Yes, A child, as in limit one.) Salads are available - as part of the buffet or served as an entrée.   Peter Piper coupons can be found on their website, and you can also sign up to receive offers via email. The deals are pretty good, too. They are usually for some sort of pizza and token combination.   I have had birthday parties for my kiddos here. Things went very smoothly each time, and the pricing was quite reasonable.   The kids love the games and play area. It's pretty clean. However, it gets busy here quickly. Some parents don't watch their kids, so there are usually a bunch of kids running amok, climbing on arcade games, etc. Aside from that, this is a fun place with decent food and pleasant employees."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch with my mom and daughters after shopping at the Anthem Outlets. We arrived about 1pm and the place only had maybe 3 other sets of people there. I figured that would be normal on a Thursday. The place was pretty clean inside, and the lady that took are order (who was also the dough master - she told us and her badge said) was really great. She was very friendly and really made ordering easy. The play area was a little on the small size compared to other Peter Piper Pizzas I have been to in the Valley. I did like how they had 2 different machines that kids could get prizes out of instead of just the ball machine. There was also a dinosaur machine too. It was great until it started to mess with me, teasing me with a dinosaur in the claw then having it flip back into the machine and I lose out. Needless to say after several attempts I gave up. Luckily I had gotten each of my girls a dinosaur already, thank goodness. Back to the pizza, the time it took for it to be made didn't seem that long to me since I was out playing games with my girls, but my mom thought it took longer than it should have. (But she did eyeball the buffet while waiting for out pizzas to be ready. So maybe that was like pouring vinegar in a open wound since she was hungry.) Each of my girls got personal pizzas while my mom and I split a medium, thin crust, 3 cheese and pepperoni. I did like the thin crust on the pizza, but it was a little on the greasy side for me. That didn't stop me from eating it, but I am regretting it now since I have a stomach ache. My girls like their pizzas, and being able to use the free personal pizza gift certificates my daughter earned at school was great. She really felt like she earned it, and it reminded me a lot of the Pizza Hut Book-it days when I was younger. All in all the place was fun for an afternoon. My youngest loved the smaller climber they had in there with the slide. I think that was her favorite part, my oldest loved playing the different games and earning tickets. Me I liked the basketball game. Grandma even went out and played with them a little too. I think the best part of the visit was that we pretty much had the entire game area all to ourselves since after about 30 minutes everyone else left. We were probably there for about 1.5 hours eating pizza and playing in the game room. If we had not already had coins for the machines leftover from a birthday party at another PPP, then the visit would have been pricey, but since those were a sunk cost it was a fun afternoon for the kids, and luckily I am the only one with a stomach ache. We may be back if we are in the area again, but next time we will need to wait for a better deal, $16 for a medium pizza is a bit pricey especially with all the extra grease that came with it."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. The cinnamon roll thing was the bomb. Mainly came to see what it was all about before we booked a birthday party. Definitely a place to bring kiddos. Be prepared to spend some time and money with the games. Both my girls liked it and the location is very convenient for us being right in Buckeye. We will probably be back for more than the aforementioned birthday party."}
{"text":"All of the good games are broken (ski ball, basketball, etc.) No air hockey table.   They took 40 minutes to get our large pizza to our table only to be given a medium.....  There's lots of Peter pipers out there, most better then this on)."}
{"text":"With a line coming out of the door and the heat the way it is, you'd think maybe it would be a priority to get the line moving quickly.  I have never been in a line for pizza that moved at such a slow pace, and with 4 stations open taking orders it was pretty shameful.  35min wait in line may be cut down if people taking the orders didn't have you reiterate yourself three times.  Never coming back.  Another reason to stay away from Metro-center."}
{"text":"Still terrible service every time. Standing here waiting at the ticket counter for about 15 min and several workers have walked by and don't even say anything , just look and keep walking. There was no one here at the counter and someone just showed up finally and the line behind us is crazy now. Several games are out of order as usual. They do have about 4 new games but service is horrible as always."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Here it is 2 months later and I am so disappointed.   And disgusted...  we are her for the lunch buffet and it is filthy, there is hardly any pizza on the line, it is all dried and old looking (and it is all pepperoni), the plates looked like they haven't been washed, and their food prep guy is handling raw veggies for their salads without gloves.  Management doesn't seem to care either. Hhmmm... reconsidering coming back after this experience.     Ok, so this is a new location and it looks like they have a few kinks to work out, but overall I like it so far.  We've visited at least a half dozen times, sometimes for the lunch buffet, a  few times for dinner, and we had a bday party there last month.  Each time was enjoyable.  The buffet was good, pizza is usually good but could use a bit more time in the oven.  Our party was just \"ok\" though.  Our hostess was a mess, she couldn't get her act together.  She was basically confused and kept forgetting things.  She forgot to bring out my kid's special birthday pizza, which is included in the birthday package, and so it was thrown away by other staff. Kiddo was upset about it because he wanted his special birthday pizza.  She then brought our ice cream out 10 minutes before the cake was brought out and in Phoenix that's a no no.  It was melted before the cake was cut.  We weren't brought forks, spoons, or napkins for that matter.  We were then basically told to leave because the tables were reserved for another party (ok I get it) but the two tables across from us, which were the exact same size and location were empty...  really?  She couldn't just move the other party next door?  So all 30 of us had to relocate to the tables next to us.   We will go back though, just not for a party."}
{"text":"Great place for younger kids. It is like a mini chuckie cheese for those young aged children. Sends like thus place gets a lot of parties from looking at the spaces and tables for people to sit.  However, there is not too many games to play for the children. The food is decent tho, we got the pizza,  soda,  and cone for dessert! Not to shabby for my 2 year old niece/ god daughter."}
{"text":"This evening was my dads first time at a Peter piper pizza. When arriving the manager Lucy (once I asked who she was) was extremely energetic and very welcoming. My dad was a little apprehensive on the restaurant being too much of a child's restaurant and didn't think it would meet his needs as a fine diner. The entire experience was just incredible to the moment we ordered then receiving our food and Lucy walking it out to us By only remembering our face. She had her entire team occupied on making sure we were all having a good time including my dad. A gentleman by the name of Charlie was in the dining room cleaning and then approach my dad and told him he loved his football hat. I don't think we've ever gone somewhere where the people at a restaurant actually care about the customers. We realize that a fundraiser was going on After asking Lucy. She let my six year old daughter participate even though she didn't go to that school. It all comes down to an excellent visit that my family and I encountered and we want to thank everybody who helped us have a great experience including my dad. We will definitely be recommending this location and having my daughter's seventh birthday. When reading this review, you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I just had 2 for 1 lunch special here today Jan 2, 2018, from 12-2:30 pm.  I am giving my experience 1 star because I was so appalled at the waste of food by the pizza maker.  He had every inch on the steel table in front of the oven filled with already baked pizzas, that were there for a long time.  The buffet hot plate was also all full of pizzas.  At first I saw him throw away pans that had 2-3 pieces left, into the trash, instead of combining them into other partially eaten pans.  But later I saw him throw away entire untouched whole pizzas because he said they were \"stale\", and so he could put more that had been sitting on the steel table, out on the buffet hotplate.  I then said \"If you have to throw away entire untouched pizzas because they are stale, that means you are baking too many.\"   Why even make and bake them if you are gonna throw the whole thing away.   He said, \"We can't run out.\"  The 1 star is for the food waste, and also not busing the tables, and run out of cheese and plates.    I hate wasting food.  I recently saw on TV skeletons of living children (barely alive, had tubes in them) who were starving in Yemen.  Then rows and rows of dead children, wrapped in clothes that were twisted at both ends, looked pathetically like rows of \"tamales\", but they had dead kids inside, who didn't get enough to eat.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/19/middleeast/yemen-intl/index.html  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-save-the-children-yemen-20171116-story.html  I go to other Peter Pipers for lunch special such as 40th St and Thomas, McDowell and Miller, and Dobson and 101, time and time again, and I have never seen such waste at those locations.    No one came to take away our piles of dirty dishes, so we put them on other tables.    They ran out of plates, and people were putting their dirty oily plates on top of the paper and baskets that the clean plates were dispensed from, and people were picking up those and looking at them strangely, like \"hey this plate is full of crumbs\".  No employee noticed that there were no more plates.  They should replenish them when getting low, not have to be told when totally out and people putting their dirty plates in those empty plate holders.  None of the grated cheese canisters had cheese in them, so I had to give them to the cashier to get them filled for me.  Someone should replenish those, too.  Or have enough, there was only 2 cheese containers (empty), and 1 red pepper that I saw for the entire restaurant.  I did not see anymore on the tables.   Other locations have LOTS of canisters.  No wonder these were empty.    I usually go to the 40th St and Thomas location, because I have gone to the other above-mentioned locations and always found them stacked with dirty dishes, and other sights that make my experience less than happy.   I also did not think the pizza maker at this 7th St. andGreenway location was very customer service oriented, when they are at 40th Street and Thomas and Dobson and 101.  The people at this Greenway and 7th St location don't seem to answer you when you stand there as if you need something, even when I say \"hello, hello\" to try to get someone's attention.  Fortunately this location isn't close to my house, I only came here to take a friend's son out, who was visiting from another state for the holidays and was alone.  I think my experience is all a reflection of poor management, not the employees."}
{"text":"I LOVE Peter Piper Pizza because the crust is thin and crispy.  I like pizza that is still horizontal 30 min out of the oven, not the kind that is floppy and you can roll up.  My favorite is super thin crust Supreme, cooked extra crispy or well-done.  I love the crunch between your front teeth when it just  comes out of the oven.  I come to this location only because I want to use a coupon at Joanns directly across the mall.  I  have a PPP about 3 miles from my house, Miller and McDowell,  but it is not a corporate store, therefore does not serve the 3 salads. It only has a boring iceberg lettuce salad, to which you add your own tomatoes, and other \"salad bar\" ingredients.  I go to corporate stores only for the delicious caesar salad, which is full of cheese.  Each time I come to this Riverview Dobson/Rio Salado location, Michael, the very tall skinny white guy manager, is sooooo cheerful and pleasant!!!   I give him 5  stars!     I only eat here during the lunch buffet. If I do not come during the weekdays when school is in session, the place, e.g. today Memorial Day  2017, is ransacked.  I think they should hire MORE people on days like this.  It is pathetic, for which I give one star.  Food particles all over the floor, 80% of the vacant booths have plates and food and trash in them, that STAYED UNCLEANED  long after the people who sat there left.  Those booths stayed UNcleaned the entire 2 hours I stayed there.  Would be nice to clean the tables, and clear the trash up so new people could enjoy the booths, especially by the windows.   Also food on the seats. I hate it when employees just brush the cheese and crumbs off the tables onto the benches for you to sit on.    The plate dispensers were always empty.  How do you get the food with no plates.  I gues the dishwasher could not keep up, cos later I saw paper plates.  I said I come for the caesar salad, but I had to wait 30 min before I got some, cos no one had time to make more.  This is AFTER I already told several employees, that the caesar  salad needed replenishing.  Tho they did fill the bowl once, I missed out cos I was not already standing there waiting for them to make more salad.   Instead I was sitting at my table, which I cleared myself when I arrived.   FINALLY , I tell Mike, the manager about no salad, and he cheerfully makes more right away.  Mike is the only person who seems to \"do things right away\" upon request, yet he is only one person.   I mean, this man has it in his capacity, to do this and that \"right away\", when no one else does.  Maybe because he is \"extra help\", and does not have a specific assignment, such as making pizzas.  He does it all to move things along.  Well the trash and untidyness of the restaurant is less than 1 star.  It is one thing to have it be that way in the moment, but quite another deserving less than 1 star for it to be like that for HOURS, and see no one cleaning up from \"time to time\".    Also the pizza maker, who makes the pizzas each time I go to Riverview location, does not spread the goodies to the edge of the pizza like I experience at the 40th Street and Thomas location.  Also 40th St  pizza is crispier, somehow.  It is not a fluke at both places, but happens again and again each time I go to both locations.  Same result.  It is all cos of Joanns coupons I go to this Riverview less desirable location.  40th St and Thomas is about the same distance for me.    Oh boy, all those tables unbussed when I left after 2 pm (arrived at 12), Mike's 5  star service                             and attitude, just could not outweigh all that mess contrary to Mike's \"right away\" service, to make me give it a higher rating than 2.5 stars.  I assume higher management does not support Mike's level with MORE help during weekends and holidays.    When I went out the door, I could hear the screaming kids in the restaurant, half way across the parking lot to Joanns.  I am a senior citizen who eats at PPP alone.  If I were a mother with 4 kids under the age of 10, I guess I wouldn't even notice the \"mess\", and food all over the seats and floor, and all that \"happy screaming and yelling\", would I?"}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday afternoon to check it out, I remember going to peter piper pizza when I was younger when it had the mini train and tons of games to partake in.   Sadly this place isn't the same as it used to be, you have a dining area, then a dining party area and then in the far back a little play area, probably max of 20 games. The games were ok, some of them jipped you on tickets, and some were worth far less than 2 tokens. Not to mention how slow the ticket counter is to redeem for prizes. The guy was friendly but he definitely wasn't motivated to move any faster than he needed to.   The food was just ok as well. Tried the buffet which was ok, you had your vast variety of pizzas, salads and pastas. The pizzas weren't bad, the salad was ok until I found a few bugs, like tiny gnats that love produce items. I know cause I work with produce and do meal preps. I was grossed out and had to stop eating it...so clearly they don't wash their lettuce. Even if it comes in ready to make bags it should still rinsed out. The pasta was ok as well, tasted more like something that came out of a frozen food bag.   Overall I wasn't impressed, but the pizza made up for everything else."}
{"text":"Called in an order. When I went to pick it up they first told me they didn't have an order for me that I most likely called another store. Then the manager came up and confirmed my pizza order and claimed I cancelled part of it, which I did not. The manager and assistant manager basically pointed the finger and another girl on the register. When she finished she pulled up my order...which was correct. All they told me was we are sorry but it will be another 5-6 minutes to finish your order. If I had another 5-6 minutes that would have been great. But I didn't so I left with a partial order. It's not like they were busy or had long lines. They just aren't paying attention to the little business they had at 5:15p. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved peter piper back when they had it. So we were excited when they came to Vegas. We took our son here to eat and customer service was excellent. They're very knowledgeable and nice. We got our pizza, they forgot our wings, no biggie Rey brought it out shortly after. The pizza wasn't cooked enough, it was kind of doughy so they made a new pizza. We asked they just put the one we bought in but they were courteous enough to make a fresh one. Disappointment was on the game room. It's so tiny, maybe like two times as big as a cicis pizza game room. Pizza was ok, but not like the peter piper in El Paso( we visit every year). Kind of sad it's not what we expected."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. As soon as I walked in I should have ran back outside. We usually make the 20 minute drive to the one in ahwatukee but son was not willing to wait any longer so we decided to go to this location. We found a live bed bug crawling on the seats. This whole place needs to be shut down. It's so disgusting. Not in the best location either."}
{"text":"Upon first coming to Phoenix Arizona in 1987, one of the first places I became familiar with was Peter Piper Pizza (the 35th Ave/Bell location which sadly no longer exists).  They really had something for everyone - games for the kids, jukebox (though I don't know of any current location that has one unfortunately - much missed feature!)  But most notably very affordable reasonably priced pizza.    Now mind you, back at that time one of the most common comments I heard was \"Cheapest pizza you can get - but it tastes like cardboard\".   In the years since though, Peter Piper has added a variety of different crust style options.  And like most businesses, the price has gone up over the years but when it comes to pizza, they have perhaps the best possible value.  The buffet they offer during lunch hours during the week is a particular favorite and something that offers a strong reason to visit.  Great variety of pizzas to sample plus salads, breadsticks, and dessert pies.  Location is clean, service is generally helpful and pleasant.  On my most recent visit, the only real (minor) problem I ran into is that they didn't have forks anywhere except for one of the condiment stations near the back.  I strongly encourage people to support local businesses (yes, PPP is a chain with locations in a few other states but their headquarters is here in Phoenix and is primarily an AZ company) - especially given how the three major pizza chains in the area all are horrible and treat customers terribly (I don't know if this is a problem nationwide or some bizarre Phoenix thing) but all three have lost me as a customer.  Papa John's is the worst offender since their Phoenix Director of Operations Christina Carter feels a need to personally email gay customers telling them to take their business elsewhere.    PPP is a refreshing change to the corrupt Big Three (Papa Johns, Domino's, Pizza Hut) and I've never had any kind of problem or been treated poorly by them.  Because it's a great place for hanging out with friends, I actually have many fond memories connected with them.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This Peter Piper has the worst customer service. We waited behind a guy and there was no one behind the register or in the back cooking only people cleaning the tables and benches. Then a lady came up to the counter and was rude to the man in front of my husband and I. Then she walked away and didn't even take our order. Then 2-3 more e employees came out of the back and after about another 2 minutes one employee asked us if we had ordered. Then he was the only employee that actually said anything to us. Not impressed will not recommend."}
{"text":"I was up here and wanted some grub while running errands and saw the pizza buffet special for 6 bucks, so I ran in here to grab a quick lunch. I should've looked at the pizza and salad before....and honestly felt a little lame after I left this area and realized how many other places there are in this lot alone. Potbelly sandwiches, Capriottis, Andale to name a few....but I just wanted pizza. Anyways, I paid and went to the buffet and all the pizza had sweaty cheese like it had been there awhile. There were 3 salads and they were already mixed and tossed with massive amounts of dressing. Gross. I waited til they put out a new pizza and got a couple pieces of that and called it quits. There weren't a ton of people in there and I guess if I weren't in such a hurry, I would've put all these clues together and just skipped this place all together."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! Food at buffet is under cooked and stale. Drinks are flat. Most of the games are broken and eat your coins. No helping hands around to attempt to get your coins back. Restrooms are the icing on the cake. There's sh*t on the walls and all over the seat. They need to hire more staff members to clean this place. I came with 10 buffets and none of us ate because we were disgusted. So we let the kids play and we're probably gonna stop at panda on the way home!"}
{"text":"In all the time I've been going to the Peter Piper Pizza restaurant chain, never have I felt so poorly treated, so humiliated and disrespected, as when I visited this location.  I visited with my 6 month old niece and my son. I paid for one buffet and one cup because my son had already eaten at school and my niece obviously wasn't going to eat. I got two slices of pizza, sat down with the kids, and realized I didn't have a high chair. I got up with my niece, told my son not to touch the pizza because I'd only paid for myself, and went to ask the staff where the high chairs were.  Three minutes later, I was back at the table with the baby in a high chair, and I saw that my son has taken a couple bites of pizza. He was reminded not to touch it, and I started eating, thinking it was no big deal. Apparently, a couple employees (Brett and Miriam; I wrote their names down before I left) thought it was a big deal. I saw them staring at me, pointing directly at me, talking to each other, and this was at the front register where all the other customers could see and hear them.  I got up to confront them for their incredibly rude behavior (pointing me out in front of all the other guests, discussing me in front of all the other guests), and Brett came around the counter to confront me, again in front of all the other guests, which only continued the humiliation.  He said I had given my son pizza, and I had to pay for another buffet. I explained that I had gotten the pizza for myself, and only left it alone for a few minutes to go find a high chair. He said it didn't matter, that I had to pay or leave. Basically, they forced me to pay for another buffet so that I could stay and get my own money's worth, since I'd already paid for myself.  When I called later and explained everything to the store manager, Danny, he apologized, but then went on to redirect the sympathy back to his own employees, saying he feels bad for them, it's actually very embarrassing for THEM, as they often have to confront patrons who don't pay for the buffet (a very, very tone-deaf response). He asked me to come back in, have a better experience, and I specifically told him I would not come back in unless I was given a refund. He then clearly agreed to give me a refund.  When I came in today, he gave me a cup and a bracelet. I figured he was giving me a complementary buffet to make up for the horrible experience last week, which I thought was nice, until I realized that was all he was giving me. There was no refund.  I told him he had agreed to give me a refund, and that's what I expected. If he wasn't giving me a complementary buffet, he could take the bracelet and the cup back. He responded that he had a very long line to take care of, and though he didn't think I should get a refund because my son ate pizza, he would give me one to \"resolve this faster.\"  He then tried to refund the price of a child buffet, despite the fact that I presented him with a receipt for the cost of an adult buffet, which is what I had been charged since my son is older than 10. Danny said, and I quote, \"Whatever, I have a lot of people waiting. I'll make it seven dollars. We're done now.\"  It goes without saying that I'll never set foot in this restaurant again, not as long as Danny is in charge, not as long as Brett and Miriam work there, and I'll tell everyone I know to avoid it."}
{"text":"Just had a family dinner to let the lil guy have some play time . All was great until we found the hair on our pizza . No employees wearing hairnets gloves or any  kind of hair protection . We were offered another pizzaUh no thank you ! They did refund the price of the \"Hair pizza\" so that was very nice . Over all just be observant of what you are being served."}
{"text":"I called in a phone order so I would not have long to wait, I bought the kids with me and figured I would let them play a couple of games. I played for about 1/2 an hour & went to check on our order and they informed me that it was JUST NOW going in the oven, I was a little perturbed but the lady was super nice and comped us all drinks. Back to the video games, the kids were happy & not sweating me so everything was cool. We run out of tokens & go back to check on our order only to find out the manager was comping the entire order and throwing in an extra pizza to boot. Wow. Could not believe how far they were willing to go to ensure that everyone has a great experience there. They really went above and beyond. The place was clean, the video games were in great shape, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Can't recommend this place enough, the Chicken Alfredo pizza is all that too. You really can't go wrong here, especially if you have kids."}
{"text":"Crazy a lot kids great time ...all employees working hard... for all to have a good time  Only one beer per person ok i know to manmy kids"}
{"text":"I have two words, Brandon and Chad which happen to be Awesome members of Management! This was our first visit to try the lunch buffet. We really had a great experience, the buffet items were fresh, hot and tasty. The dining area was spotless and the restaurant is super inviting.   The lunch buffet was fresh, hot and full of good tasty items which they kept up on. I was very pleased with the variety of items. That cranberry salad was delicious, I also enjoyed that yummy spiral mac and cheese!  I enjoyed my conversation with Staff Members of Management Brandon and Chad, I wanted to know more about the future of PP, they were a real joy to talk to.   We will be back, I think the buffet is a Winner!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, but two complaints- one is not that bad.  After we paid and sat down- like 10 minutes later, I went up to get our pitcher of beer and the girl didn't ask for my receipt. So just go up with authority and say \"i didn't get my beer\" and you can probably get free beer. Secondly, this is the kind of joint where you play games and get tickets. When your 5 year old needs to spend 360 points its like pulling teeth to get him to decide... But when he's made his decision and the guy behind the counter then says that they are all out of that item- that sucks. Then when he decides on a second item (5 more minutes) and the guy tells you that there out off that- it sucks even more.  Add a third time and now I'm pissed off.  Were talking about a total inventory carrying cost of like $200 worth of cheap chinese junk and they can't figure out what's most popular and keep it in stock?  Totally ruined my time and my 5 year olds as he got stuck with crap he never wanted in the first place plus 20 jolly ranchers"}
{"text":"Came to Peter Pipers Pizza for the first time after its re-opening since it closed 10years ago. I wasn't so pleased with my experience. It smelled  like sewer which ruined my appetite. On top of that the manager was rude toward me after I walked up to the counter to pick up my pizza. The only friendly member was Eloy. He took my order and was friendly the whole time."}
{"text":"I have had a bad experience here every single time that I've gone. I have only returned because it is so close to my house and who doesn't love Peter Piper Pizza? The service is disgraceful. I've had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes over what I was quoted. My orders have been wrong. And they do not care! No empathy or even attention for that matter. I once was blatantly ignored by the staff for 5 minutes until a gentleman behind me kindly got someone's attention - they were too busy gossiping in the back! Unbelievable. Customers are clearly discontent and annoyed and their managers do nothing about it. After this last experience, I am through with this location. Save your money or spend on something worth your while."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza hands down, so delicious you can't stop eating it, until the heartburn kicks in...The original crust, sauce and cheese is always consistent. For years and years since I was a kid and grew up eating Peter Piper it has been the same great taste, and kinda reminds me a little bit of home and childhood. I do feel weird coming here just because I always imagine this place more for kids but during lunch there are nothing but adults here, I imagine because their buffet is such a great deal. This location is also huge and always clean, friendly staff, I can never get tired of their food, so good!!"}
{"text":"This place is clean!! Blake and Jeremy were extremely helpful! Nice location. We will be back. All the games worked great and we had a blast!!! Thanks guys!! Great job! I'm in the hospitality business and no joke they have a great attitude here!!! Keep smiling."}
{"text":"I LOVE Peter Piper Pizza BUT this location is killing me. I use to work at a PPP and I know that when you're expecting a rush you pre-make pizzas, but that can be a problem if there isn't a \"rush\". The dough then starts to rise and it just doesn't taste the same. With that being said I make it a point to ask for \"fresh dough\" to be used when making my pizza and they ALWAYS fail."}
{"text":"This Place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY all the time!!!! Lazy employees. Please hire someone other than a nineteen year old for the fast times."}
{"text":"This place is great especially for children's parties. We went there for my granddaughter's 4th birthday and a party of 10. Large, clean and well lit parking area, entrance has several wide glass doors, ordering and pick up areas easy and well defined with plenty of proficient staff, cooking area appeared clean and efficient, dining area was always kept clean and condiment tables always kept fully stocked. Lots of well maintained arcade type games as well as some rides. You can trade in your winning ticket stubs for some nice prizes at the toy store. Some TVs scattered through out the dining area. You place your order and you receive a beeper to notify you when your pizza is ready. If you have numerous pizzas for a large party the friendly staff will assist you with no hesitation. We all had a good time and the pizzas and wings were good too! BTW you can reserve a table and order in advance if you would like.  Just walk in and the party is on!  I feel like I am doing a paid promotion for Peter Piper Pizza but I am not...this actually happened yesterday @ 6:00 pm.! Thanks Peter Piper!"}
{"text":"They have an all you can eat pizza lunch for around $6 dollars. There are several different pizzas you can choose from and a desert pizza to end your meal.  This is not the reason we go. The pizza is OK but many places make better. We go there because we have a grandson and he likes to push the buttons on the games and win tickets. He had a great time and I love to watch him push the buttons.  There are many reasons to go there: Party, of any kind, meeting friends with kids, family outing. Maybe you just want a piece of pizza and some time to relax in a corner.  Another reason: I am always treated well when I go there. If I want a piece of pizza that is not on out. Just ask and they will fix you any kind they make."}
{"text":"Did I ever think I would be writing a review in favor of this place?  Heck no.  As a parent to a 4 year old who loves amusement parks (my fault for bringing her to Disneyland six times already), I am always in search of things to amuse her outside of our home.    The first time we came here, it was for her soccer team awards luncheon.  I was dreading coming here because I am definitely not the type of mom who enjoys these sorts of events.  Still, we were surprised by the CLEANLINESS and the PIZZA.    Was the pizza good?  No!  But was it bad?  Not at all.  Let's say it is leagues above Little Caesars and Chuck E Cheese's and about on par with Hungry Howie's.  It is pizza for kids.  And whatever they put in it, it gets my kid to actually eat pizza (she prefers healthy to junk food any day).    We have since been back THREE times, including this afternoon.    My daughter loves the rides here and spends 99 percent of her time on the carousel, Garfield or the train.  She also likes to climb inside their little jungle gym.  She inevitably wants to get a prize, but having played only one game herself... she has no tickets.  That's where I step in, playing all the high-yielding and quick-earning games in a hurry so she can redeem and I can get out of there!  The employees are always nice, though some are a little more generous at the redemption center than others (and will round up on the ticket count).    All in all, a decent place to take younger kids to play inside a/c for an hour or two.    Oh - I almost forgot - it is also cheap.  I brought two kids today and with pizza, drinks and tokens I only spent about $30.  Pretty good for about two hours of entertainment for two kids."}
{"text":"Childhood pizza place, lost count how many children birthday parties we have been to but such fun memories and as they say, if you child is happy thats all that matters.   Pizza is not bad, the crust is always tasty for kid style pizza.   Free refills on drinks so get the smaller cups and save some dough."}
{"text":"Been coming here for Birthday Parties for some time and my daughter wanted to eat here because she loves their pizza.  Good place to have a kids party here with lots of games and reasonable prices for the food along with a few TV monitors for the dad's to watch their games.  Fun for all and lots of memories through the years.  They also have a pizza buffet on weekdays which you can gorge yourself if you choose."}
{"text":"Had my kids b-day parties here- our host was friendly and very sweet. She made sure we had everything we needed. Definitely doing it here again next year!"}
{"text":"The taste of the pizza was just mediocre. The toppings were almost non-existent. Hand-held buzzer never rang for food pickup; I went to delivery point several times to inquire. Finally about 20 minutes after ordering, a pizza matching my description was available. No one ever tried to complete the order with pizza delivery to table or call that order was ready. Staff was very nonchalant about it, which was even more annoying. There are plenty of better pizza places that actually SERVE their customers better."}
