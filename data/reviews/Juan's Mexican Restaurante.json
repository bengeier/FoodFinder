{"text":"Spending half my life between Texas and California, I can tell you this is the most overpriced and inadequate Mexican food I have ever ordered. I ordered through Waiters en Route and $50 got me a tiny little side of Guacamole ($8.95) and two orders of taquitos. One of the orders was supposed to be \"Enchiladas\" but they were just taquitos covered in sauce. I asked for no beans on one of the orders, and beans drenched the entire plate and I had to throw the entire order away. Save your money and go to Taco Bell, the food is better at 1/5 the price. Keep in mind quality is all relative, if I were paying $10, I wouldn't complain, but for $50, they should be put in jail for fraud."}
{"text":"Reasons why I enjoy Juan's Mexican Restaurante:

- It's Mexican food...need I say more?
- It's location is PRIME - right on Stephen Ave
- The service is great
- The prices are reasonable
- You can go there and have dessert as your main course :)

To anyone going to Juan's for the first time, I highly recommend the Champinones Al Ajillo as the appetizer. Their Burritos, Enchiladas and Tostadas are delicious as the main course, and I MUST emphasize that the absolute piece de resistance is their fried ice cream for dessert. If you're feeling ballsy, do what I did and order the friend ice cream as your entree. Trust me, your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"I am not sure I can count how many times I have went here, but I do know that I have never had a bad meal and I always look forward to the next trip. There are not many restaurants along Steven Avenue that are as authentic as this one. The service is always great, with cheerful and attentive staff. As is typical, lunch starts with a free basket of nachos and a delicious home made salsa. These tide you over until the usually quick lunch comes. There is no parking close, but that is downtown. There are a bunch of stairs going down to the restaurant but these would be the only two negatives to a delicious spot."}
{"text":"Fun facts about Juan's: They have salsa dancing on Friday nights. They can pull out the tables for the dance floor. I happened upon this by accident, and it is really cute and lots of fun.

Now, the first time I went to Juan's, I was craving Chimichangas. The lack of authentic and good Mexican restaurants in Calgary when I was growing up had warped my view of what constituted Mexican food. There are NO deep fried burritos at Juan's and they get full props for this from me. Instead they have fresh, delicious and relatively healthy selections of authentic cuisine. So I had the phenomenal enchiladas de pollo con mole. Yum. Instead of bread to start you get tortilla chips and two amazing salsas. 

Also: Chimichangas are apparently Tex-Mex. We now have good Mexican - isn't Calgary the Texas of the North?! I need some decent Tex Mex. If you can get better Tex Mex in Thailand, that's a sad state of affairs."}
{"text":"I have been teaching Spanish once a week to a group of my mother's friends, and for graduation I decided to offer them a buffet of authentic Mexican food.  Now I have heard very good things about Juan's so like a true yelper I thought I would get them to do the catering.  

The menu that day consisted of two orders of Chicken Enchiladas covered with chocolate sauce or Mole; two huge Chilli Releno stuffed with cheese, a nice tender Carne Asada with onions and fried vegetables with a nice hot sauce and Ceviche which is bits of fish, octopus and shrimp in a tangy lemon chilli sauce with chunks of fresh avocado.

There was also a generous portion of tortilla chips and a fresh basket of tortillas.  Juan then threw in a large container of frijoles and Mexican rice.  My goodness not only did my students do well in their Spanish class but they also did well in finishing off every plate.  I saw people going back for their third plate.

On the side I ordered Mexican salsa which is cilantro, tomatoes, onion and chilli... so delicious and so fresh, a great topping for everything...especially topping off a tortilla with carne ( meat) rice and beans; just add a little of this it is so, so filling.

I can truly say this was just like eating in Mexico, by far the best Mexican restaurant I have eaten in Calgary. Thank god Juan exists and Juan himself goes out of his way to make your food experience happen."}
{"text":"Coming from California I suppose I was bound to be disappointed by Mexican food in Calgary.  Still, I was hopeful.  I'd been coming to Juan's on Friday nights for salsa dancing for a couple of weeks, and the last time out I decided to come early with a couple of people for dinner.  It wasn't the worst food I've had, but it was very unimpressive.  More than anything else, it was really salty and tasted, for lack of a better word to describe it, flat.  My dish (the Snapper Veracruz) was priced at $22, so I'd expected better.  My dinner companions ordered enchiladas and some chicken dish, and agreed with my impressions.

I'll be back for the dancing and the sangria, but I'll pass on the food."}
{"text":"I am so sick of medioocre Mexican places in Calgary! its just not fair that people can't find a decent place to experience one of the finest and most developed cuisines of the world!! It drives me crazy that all these \"mexican\" places in calgary just dont try! I tell you! Its a shame! 

  What is it that keeps these \"mexican\" menus from ever being raised to where it should be? perhaps unaware customers, who are used to the taste? Maybe some think because its better than Taco bell, its authentic and good....  Oh well, another one bites the dust... 

So now that I am over my anger let me talk about our experience here.

I came here with my good pal Andy, we had been on the hunt for a good while just struttin up and down stephen ave looking for a hole in the wall. Well we thought we found it at Juans, walked in the door and I told Andy \"Ohhh Man this place smells good! thats always a good sign!\" I was truly hoping that these guys would do it right! \"FINALLY i just might have found it!\"  Boy was I wrong... sometimes the only way to tell if a goose lays rotten eggs is to wait and see if the egg hatches! oh brother!!! I really should have read the yelp reviews before we chose to eat here! 

Ok so to keep this review from being over the top let me just lay out some of the cons of Juan's.

-Prices: Way over priced food for what you get.

-Nachos: Just BAD, even boston pizza could school these guys! 
  
- Bad staples: Coverted Rice (uncle bens) and Canned refried frijoles: Not the only mexican place in Calgary guilty of this crime but these were paticularilly bad..

-Sauce: I tell you the huevos rancheros would have been better without the stuff at all.. Tasted like bad spaggetti sauce...

Ceviche: While actually not tasting to bad, the presentation was terrible. Complete with a giant slice of a crystallized mealy tomato on top! its like they were trying to hide what was underneath.

The Ambience here was actually kind of cool, and we later discovered that people come here just to dance and drink!(big dance floor) Sadly I don't know how to dance so I can only review the food aspect. The service was fine and all but the food was so sub par that I wouldn't even have changed my rating if it was above average... I am done talking about this place... meh..."}
