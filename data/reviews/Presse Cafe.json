{"text":"Just want to share a wonderful experience of Presse Cafe right in the Cornell Community Centre.

Great food. Very authentic. I ordered a catering for my husband's birthday party at the Community Centre. Great smoke salmon, prosciutto sandwiches, roast beef sandwiches, fresh juice, fruit cups... Everybody are impressed with the quality, presentation, and services. Everything are wrapped around with lovely ribbons. Kids love all the food too. A great way to bring healthy food to a party. Nobody ask for junk food at all!

My 5 years old and 8 years old love the food and make it a family tradition to have Sunday Brunch there.  A great start for a great week :)"}
{"text":"Café où l'on peut lire des journaux et se connecter à Internet avec son portable."}
{"text":"The customer service in this place is so bad, it deserves to be boycotted. They will let you wait and wait and wait to use the washroom, telling you somebody else is in there, when in reality they just lost the key. I waited 1/2 hour, until profuse knocking made me certain no one was in the washroom. I watched while the worker told several other people that 'someone is already in there'. I saw one person waiting for 10 minutes, until I finally informed that person that she was waiting for nothing. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Coffee is great. Service and staff are superb. The cafe is wonderfully clean. Huge assortment of food, too."}
{"text":"Coffee was sub standard and nowhere close to Crema which i was looking for.
The space is nice."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I had the chicken avocado wrap and the pasta salad. It's a little expensive but the food is tasty. I wish there were more places to sit since lunchtime can be busy. Still, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mon casse-croûte habituel. Travaillant dans le secteur, j'y vais fréquemment pour m'acheter leurs délicieux paninis. Les choix varient selon les jours mais on y retrouve habituellement les paninis poulet et tomates séchées, prosciutto et fromage, brie et pomme, et aussi des wrap, soupes et un bon choix de salades. Le service à la clientèle est super: personnel toujours souriant, rapide, aimable avec leurs clients. Il y a un étage supérieur et l'Internet wifi gratuit."}
{"text":"Do we really need yet another coffee house in this area? This one is somewhat overpriced, baked goods are overly dry, staff is inattentive/indifferent and can't get a simple order right. Coffee was good but no better than anywhere else."}
{"text":"I like this place but the hours are super inconsistent. It says they are open today, but just stopped by and it is clearly closed. No sign on the door, no explanation. This has happened several times before where it's been inexplicably closed when I showed up. Again, the place is good, but since I can't trust it to actually be open when I get there, I think I will take it off of my list of top places. Hopefully they can get themselves together and figure out their hours and perhaps even be so kind as to let their customers know what their hours are."}
{"text":"I go here often because it's close to work, but the service is very slow.  The coffee is OK, but not better than any other chain cafe like Starbucks or Second Cup.  

The staff also do weird things, like hand you pastries with a napkin on the outside of the bag.  This is immediately after they handle money and other things full of germs.  My sense is that the ownership here hasn't implemented a really streamlined service model.  You would never get this at a Starbucks, for instance.

Also, in the summer there are tons of fruit flies swarming around their pastries."}
{"text":"Coffee was decent but I thought the ham and egg croissant was lacking for the price. But it's a quick grab and go if you're in a hurry in the morning."}
{"text":"Came here twice and both times the coffee and espresso drinks were really watery. Felt like we were robbed of our money. The staff was very nice though."}
{"text":"The tomato and red pepper soup was very good and they have a very good variety of sandwiches. The chicken and sun dried tomatoes as far as ive tried was very nice."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've walked by countless times and thought \"I should go in there one day\". Today it was cold and I was hungry and needed to send a couple of texts so popped in. The tuna and black olive wrap I chose was very good and the latte was rich and thick, just the way I like it. The music is soothing, the atmosphere is cool and calm and it is a nice place to chill.  I will be back with friends. It's a great place to sit and talk too since it's not noisy or busy."}
{"text":"Le meilleur café du Marché Central. Même si c'est une franchise chacun d'elle à sa personnalité propre.

WIFI, terrasse, sandwich, salade, café, pâtisserie..... la routine habituelle quoi.
Mes favoris : sandwich au poulet, wrap ton et olives et la selection de thé. 

Je vous jure que quand le terrasse est pleine l'été on en oublie presque qu'on est au milieu d'un stationnement. En période d'examen l'endroit est bondé. Le service est toujours A1, la musique classique y est discrète, c'est bon pas trop chère, et ça change du Tim :) ! Et ce n'est pas tous ils sont ouvert jusqu'à minuit :))

Pour ceux que ça intéressent: suite à une fraude financière dont ont été victimes les surs du bon Pasteurs qui avaient investient massivement dans le Marché Central,  la parti \"power center\" du marché à manqué ne jamais voir le jour. Que serait devenu Montréal sans cela? Franchement ..... 
Pour une fois la sur économe à été déjouée par un grand séducteur. J'ai toujours de la difficulté à avoir de l'empathie pour les communautés religieuses. Je reconnais leur contribution importante et quand elles étaient en charge entre autre des hôpitaux, ils étaient propre et efficaces. Mais, on leur à concédé des terrains immense sur le territoire du Québec et toute sorte d'avantage. Mais pour ceux que ça inquiète les surs ont revendu le tous pour environ 300 millions de dollars."}
{"text":"A little Zen in the city core

Coffee shops for me are not about grab and go. They are about sitting back and relaxing in a comfy chair with a warm brew and a sweet treat.

So I was really thrilled when this chain shop renovated and brought in the atmosphere! The new look reminded me of Veritas -- the stores are not related except that they are both coffee shops. Big easy chairs, plenty of reading material in English and French, and delectable goodies to go with simply good coffee. Ask for your stampie card and collect towards a free coffee!

This outlet also sells sandwiches and salads. On a nice day there are tables out on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon to do some TimTam slams. The hot chocolate was good, creamy, not too sweet. We also tried their mochacinno, also good, sort of sweet, sort of bitter dark chocolate. The prices were middle of the road. The atmosphere and service was quiet but cozy and friendly. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Delighted there's another coffee shop near me! Presse Café just opened around the block of Yonge and Bloor. It's nice to see something new pop up too.

Their store front isn't as attractive as it can be with a red and white theme - but totally Canadian which I'm fond of. They have a small outdoor patio-like area in front of the cafe.

This morning I gave them a visit along the way to work. They were serving free coffee the entire week, but because I generally don't consume regular coffee so I actually bought a medium cup of cappuccino instead. It costed me $4.10 after tax. The cappuccino is blended well and with a nice aroma. However, I think it may be slightly overpriced in comparison to other coffee shops - may as well go to Starbucks.

As for their service, they are quite nice and asked nicely whether I wanted anything with my coffee such as cinnamon or chocolate on top. Because they newly opened, I think their staff is new and is still getting used to the process. They had trouble remembering who paid or not. Myself and a few others in line were waiting to pay as they forgot we haven't yet :P

The inside of Presse Café was quite tidy and nice. It was quiet and relaxing. Everything was brightly lit and their food bar looked amazing! They have a large assortment of breakfast goodies, sandwiches and tarts."}
{"text":"Not that there are a lot options if you're already in the community centre, but this isn't the worst thing that could of made its way into a community centre.

First, when you walk in, you'll definitely smell it. Always seem to smell croissants when I enter the building, which I'm honestly not complaining about.

The coffee here isn't bad, but not the best either. A good option for those of us that work in the community centre and are in desperate need of caffeine. They also have different sandwiches and soups, and the Prosciutto Sandwich I had was quite delicious. 

The service is a bit on and off. The sandwich I got was heated on a panini press, but the bread was the only thing that ended up warming. The insides were all cold still. Ended up putting it in the microwave afterwards. My friend once got a soup, and the girl there forgot to turn on the heater (I guess), and tried to give him semi-heated soup. Another friend gets a mixed coffee everyday, and they still cant get the order right. 

They are super friendly though, and do try to their best to accommodate. Unfortunately it costs almost an arm and leg to get things there, with the sandwiches at $8+ and coffees at $4+. Not really worth it in my opinion, but you don't really have any other options. They do provide free wifi, but it seems a bit redundant when the community centre already does that...

If you're planning a day at the community centre, I'd recommend bringing your own food/beverages... Just hurts my wallet too much!"}
{"text":"The place is lovely and the coffee is great, but they really should take American Express, especially considering the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I think this was the best breakfast that I have ever had on vacation. My friend and I wandered downtown and well, nothing was open. It seems like everything starts up around 11am. This place though boasted that it was open 24 hours. I was somewhat reluctant because, let's face it, 24 hour places usually stink. I was so wrong though. The breakfast was cooked fresh and enormous. Eggs over easy, salad with dressing, toast with peanut butter, bacon, potatoes and several different fruits plus a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Wow! I looked in their display cases and they had huge sandwiches and yummy looking desserts. Wifi was free and they had computers you could use. They are cash only but have an ATM right by the entrance. The employees were nice and the place was packed- it must be the go to place for people who are hungry and up before 11. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tried the forest ham, cheese and egg croissant today and it was amazing! Super flakey, cheese melted perfectly and egg was very soft. It was a bit pricey though but the taste was just amazing. Think I found a new lunch place :)"}
{"text":"I got a free coffee from them because it appears to be their grand opening.  It was stronger than Tim Hortons, weaker than Starbucks but didn't have the same sweetness that McDonald's. I didn't look at their lunch menu because all I wanted was their free coffee, but I'd classify this place as something close to Aroma Espresso Bar. Franchised, not independent, but not as \"chainy\" as Starbucks. Will visit again.

{"text":"3.5 stars.
i like the concept the decor is clean.  it has a nice cafe vibe.  food was average.  conceptually i like the idea of this place but food was executed in a way that didnt really make it all that great.  salad was stale i found half brown acacado that tasted funny in my salad.  it also took them forever to toss my coworker and my salad.  all and all \"something\"is missing  my coworker and i werent overly impressed and dont know what would draw me back....food didnt look overly appealing."}
{"text":"Located in the Cornell Community Centre & Library,  the brand has a nice, modern, and fresh look. It's also part of a company that originates from Quebec! 

I ordered a large chai latte that cost $4.00 exact ($3.80 excl. tax). The latte itself was yummy - I wish it were a bit hotter though so that the heat would last longer throughout my study time at the library. 

I like that Cornell Community Centre & Library has decided to partner with this cafe company - it's a nice change from other community centre food stands that offer the typical junk food fare and a great change from other big-brand cafes. 

I can't wait to come back and make the Cornell library my study place - knowing there's a nearby place for sandwiches, pastries, and coffee will make my study time here at Cornell worthwhile."}
{"text":"This place is cute for quick bite, but nothing special. They have a variety of sandwiches, salads, pastries and beverages. We had a the chicken and sun dried tomato pressewich and the salad with the strawberries and blueberries. Good, but not awesome. Friendly service and a nice atmosphere are a plus."}
{"text":"Stopped by here because I needed a caffeine pick-me-up and thought that this place may be a better alternative to the Starbucks down the block - what a grave mistake.

I ordered a cappucino, which was so burnt that I couldn't continue after 3 sips. My cousin, who was with me, was not a coffee drinker and did not make a purchase as it was meant to be a quick stop. The lady behind the counter, however, insisted that she order something or step out of the cafe - this was while she swiped my card to pay for my drink.

Much more appreciation for Starbucks!"}
{"text":"The word(s) AVERAGE AT BEST really comes to mind, service is hit and miss. 
Coffee decent, nothing great, nothing terrible here.."}
{"text":"A  regular coffee joint. They do soup / wraps / sandwiches for lunch. Nothin extraordinary . I had a wrap & soup for lunch. Food here is so generic that 2 hours later I remember nothin about how it tasted. 


Food -  Ok
Service -Ok
Ambiance - Casual
Worth the money - Yes"}
{"text":"Great cafe!I like their sandwiches along with the coffee. Has really good ambience and in summer their outdoor seating is the best. They have great salad options as well for people on diet. They have good internet  and  indoor sitting  for those who love to work in cafés. Also the staff is very polite."}
{"text":"There was a fly in my sandwich, though workers are really nice and the food is good. I love the soup."}
{"text":"I was happy to find a new coffee shop at Bloor Street!! I tried the machiatto and it was extremely well prepared. I had my machiatto in a relaxed atmosphere, which gave me the chance to re-group myself and to finish an important email that I had to send. I strongly recommend paying a visit to this place, either just to taste a wonderful coffee with a pannini or to go through your thoughts on a good environment."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find more than just coffee and baked goods. The chicken and sundries tomato sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you need a break from a stressful day of shopping at marche central this place has a Great selection of tea from mighty leaf. 
You can expect to pay a little more for premium quality but it's well worth it.
They have a large verity of drinks and snacks. 
In the summer u can enjoy the terrace. Very clean space. And lots of room if
U want to work on your laptop or small business meeting."}
{"text":"A nice, clean, and cute place to have a quiet lunch. Free wifi is offered. Sitting by big glass windows enjoying a simple lunch is just great."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, staff didn't really appear to want to be there. Almond croissant was filled with almond extract flavoured icing or something. Blech!"}
{"text":"For a first time in that place it's okey if it's just for a little time there because when it's busy it's not a big place so you should in and out but other wise it's a cool place and relax to go grap a coffee or Thea. I took a ice Thea menthe and lemon and it was very good and refreshing by the day who was very sunny!"}
{"text":"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #2] Small cafe with drinks and pastries.  I needed a snack and a drink after an early morning run to Vieux Port and through Old Montreal.  So, I was looking for a place that gets your order done quickly, was open early, and took credit cards.  I ordered a smoothie and chocolate croissant.  Service was friendly.  I did observe later on that Presse Cafe is a chain, which has several locations scattered throughout Montreal.  Pastries are okay - I'd rate my croissant as middle of the road - not as flaky and buttery as other croissants I've eaten.  Also, it's not bad either and prices seem reasonable.  Smoothies are around $4 CAD and the croissant was around $2.50 CAD.  The cafe is good for convenience if you want a quick small breakfast and a drink to go along with it."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast one morning it was pretty busy since it was a Friday morning, it looked like a lot of the office people were out and about. The staff was helpful and friendly and easily switched into speaking English to help me.

I ordered an iced cappuccino and an chocaltine both were awesime the cocaltine tasted fresh and was full of chocolate. They have lemon water that they offer to all customers which is a nice touch. 

Overall, it's just another little coffee shop similar to all the others but if youre looking for a quick bite in the core of Montreal then this is a great place."}
{"text":"This review is for their coffee and sevice.

It can't get any better!

Freshly grinded coffee, and piping hot!!
I never get my coffee this hot at the other 2 coffee place ..(tims and mcD).

Comes in a nice cup and cardboard sleeve all the time! Never have to ask for the sleve.
Good qualit cups and caps !! Never leak at the rim.

Service is fast, good and friendly!

I have not tried their sandwiches, they do look good! 

This is my new coffee hotspot!!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, but the couple times I've been there the staff has been pretty rude and unhelpful.  Stayed for a couple hours as I needed a place to work in the area, ordered food/drinks multiple times as was working from there, every transaction was really unpleasant.  Wifi was also really slow."}
{"text":"This place is clean, modern looking, with great coffee and nice pastries and sandwiches. It's a great spot for meetings with clients/friends, etc. The staff are super friendly. The coffee is pretty good too. Most of their sandwiches are pre-made and just sit there behind the glass counter, which is not my cup of tea. I prefer freshly made sandwiches. Last time I was there, I got a croissant with ham, swiss cheese, and fried egg. It was surprisingly really good. I give this place a solid 4-star rating. They deserve it."}
{"text":"I have had a sandwich from here before, but this review is purely based on the coffee i bought this last visit.  I like to drink coffee, but I limit my caffeine intake.  So when I do decide to get a caffeinated beverage, I like for it to be half decent, or at least that I get the drink I ordered.  My husband ordered a medium latte for me.  And when i picked up the cup, I felt there was something wrong.  The cup felt like it was only half full.  I opened it, and it looked maybe 3/4 full.  I knew that they had given me a cappuccino instead of a latte.  I know I should have gone back to complain, but I was in a hurry so I didn't say anything.  You would think that when manning a coffee stand, the people that work there should know the difference between a latte and a cappuccino....."}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite. I had the best chicken pesto press and my friend had a salad! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Open 24 hours!
Good location
Great variety
FREE WI-FI
Inside clean and good size
Friendly service
Great tasting food & drinks!
Good value

Cons:
Accidentally gave us a wrong item on of the times we were there (no biggy)
Cash only!  :("}
{"text":"Immediate knockdown of a star for being a chain coffee shop that doesn't offer free wifi.  So there.

I stopped here to avoid a rainstorm that caught me without an umbrella and I thought it would be nice to grab a yoghurt, cappuccino, and get a bit of work done whilst I waited.  Mango yoghurt parfait was too sugary, cappuccino was more like a latte, and work was limited to offline stuff since I'm too cheap to pay the $4 for 30 minutes.  Especially since the rain stopped and I was out of there in 10 anyway."}
{"text":"It's conveniently located inside the Cornell community center. Coffees and lattes are great. 
Pastries are good but they are overpriced. 
Sandwiches and soup are decent.
It's a great place to grab a bite or drinks when you're at the community center or library. Given the limited option, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come after work during the week. It has lots of food options so you can get a decent meal. I just came there for coffee.
Noise level is perfect, you can meet someone and have a conversation.
The only thing is that the time is inaccurate on the Yelp app. It's showing it as being open until 9 p.m. which is not the case last time I came with a friend."}
