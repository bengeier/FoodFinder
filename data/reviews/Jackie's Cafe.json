{"text":"Great cafe.  Food is great and owner is really nice.  Worth stopping in if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I live right around the corner and decided to finally check it out after passing by it for awhile. When we first walked in the place was really inviting. Our waitress was super nice and always made sure we were doing okay. We met Jackie who is so sweet and genuine. you can tell she wanted everyone who came into her restaurant to fell relax and to have a great time. I recommend her grilled cheese and pasta salad! So good. We couldn't help but try her red velvet cake before leaving which was amazing. And the coffee was really great especially with the sweet cream. We really enjoyed our lunch at Jackie's and I highly recommend people to go there."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and Jackie is the sweetest :) great food and coffee, too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different to eat ? Something with that one of a kind ambiance and yummy Menu ?? Look no further , come to \" Jackies Cafe \" after all with a name like that you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"We saw a new cafe by our house so we decided to stop by. Loved the owner and the food with a great atmosphere. Tried the egg salad sandwish on a croissant and egg bacon and ham  quiche.  Mmm mmm mmm.  Definitely coming back for more! Love to see small business owners doing an awsome job!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst place I have ever been to. We waited over an hour for our food which consisted of two cold sandwiches and one omelet. They didn't start making the food until after we had been there for 50 min. Considering there are only five tables in the place, it is difficult to understand why it took so long. And we were never offered an explanation. Despite having approximately five staff members, they all stood around staring at each other instead of offering help of any kind to get our food ready. The manager was making rounds at the four other tables, but never stopped by our table to offer an apology or an explanation."}
{"text":"On a recommendation we came here for breakfast. Good food and friendly service - thanks Jackie! Also, the place is decorated very tastefully and has a homey feel. We'll be back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a great, new place in our neighborhood. My husband & I walked over to check it out & have breakfast & coffee. We had the vegetarian quiche & Jackie's 'pleasant surprise hot cake!' Very good! Jackie is so nice...we look forward to visiting her again very soon."}
{"text":"I ordered a delicious ham & bacon quiche while my sis ordered the prosciutto cheese omelet.  Very tasty perfect portions.  The only thing I would liked to have seen on the menu would have been pancakes or French toast.  The breakfast items were limited.  We will definitely go back and try out the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch at Jackie's Cafe.  The croissant was so fresh and it basically melted in my mouth.  The vibe was very positive and cozy.  You feel like you are at home celebrating with your favorite friends and family.  The prices are reasonable. The quality of the food is excellent.  Jackie is very friendly and she makes sure that all of the customers have a great dining experience.  This restaurant is extremely clean.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone that loves great food in a great environment."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Amazing coconut shrimp salad!  Can't wait to try next item on menu."}
{"text":"Do not be misled by the good reviews of this place. I would give it zero stars if I could. We came in for lunch on a Thursday, and it literally took an hour from the time we placed our order until I got my food. At about 50 minutes after placing our order, they still had not started cooking my omelette. I looked up at that point and saw the woman who was supposed to be cooking the food had moved away from the food prep area and was very slowly stirring a pot of iced tea while all the other staff stood next to her talking. She looked up at our table and asked loudly, \"do you need something?\" I wanted to say, \"yes, I need my food.\"  I will say that the dark haired waitress was nice, and the croissant was pretty good. Unfortunately, that did not even begin to make up for the rest of it."}
{"text":"I had a chance to stop in and check out this amazing new cafe over the weekend and I must say that I'm impressed. The beautifully decorated dining area is modern, colorful, and  inviting...you almost forget that you're in a cafe. Oh and Jackie, the owner was very friendly and welcoming. She is hands on and takes the time to greet each and every guest. There is something on the menu for everyone even vegetarians. Now that's a plus! This is a great addition to the area. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This cafe is amazing. Jacky is super pleasant and friendly. She served us very fast and was personable when taking our order. We got our food quickly and it looked magnificent. It tasted really nice and I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful my omelette was. She also served me some iced coffee that was refreshing and complemented my meal well. The cafe is brand new and already has a great atmosphere. Can't wait to watch this location grow in character as time goes on."}
{"text":"What a find!!  New to the Mesa area and found Jackie's Cafe today.  We met Jackie and tried the daily specials.  Very satisfied!  Unique variety on the menu and fresh healthy choices.   Homemade goodness and full fresh flavors. Jackie's passion definitely shines through in her creative dishes, preparation, presentation, welcoming service and the comfy, bright atmosphere.  Strongly recommend this cafe and will definitely return."}
{"text":"We came for a late breakfast, was amazing! Definitely suggest everyone coming and checking it out! Cute atmosphere and great food! Very happy that she is open a little later than most!"}
{"text":"This is such a great little spot.  My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new in Gilbert and I Yelp'd this little spot.  Don't let the 3-star dissuade you.  It is a great little space that is a mix between a cozy coffee shop,  a dining area, and a comfortable breakfast spot.  It was delightful.  Jackie was so sweet and the food was delicious.  I had the Veggie Quiche and he had a delicious omelet.  Both were wonderful!  The fruit was a mix of blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries.  Delicious!  The quiche had a wonderful flavor with a flaky crust.  The coffee was delicious, and it was very comparable price wise.  It was fresh and lovely!  You must stop in!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews! This place was review worthy!! Husband had an egg salad sandwich! Loved it! I had the grilled turkey and ham. The cucumber salad was awesome nice and tangy (I have a thing for lemons) the service was great!! Thankful we gave it a try we will be back to try the breakfast!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live around the corner and decided to check the place out. We thought it was more of a coffee shop but it's definitely more of a cafe, the coffee was good though! We met Jackie herself! Place is very warm and inviting. Try the egg salad sandwich or anything on a croissant! So good!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Not the best location so it makes it hard to spot but once I found it I knew I had to come back. Their iced coffee if exquisite beyond belief and to even compare it to Starbucks would be an atrocity. If you are looking for a casual and small place to chat with friends or just sit and study, I recommend Jackie's Café highly!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Jackie's cafe. It's really cute. The owner and her son are the only people that work there and they are super genuine people.  The food is awesome too! I had an egg salad sandwich on a croissant and a crumbly cherry dessert. Really buttery and yummy. I ordered more egg salad sandwich and I took some home for later because it was SO good!   There's just something about this place that you just want to see it exceed. I know I loved coming here, I hope others enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"My visit was simply amazing. Beautifully decorated the café made you feel like you were at home. The food was delicious. I had the veggie wrap with the summer pasta salad. Jackie was very nice and delightful. I recommend this café to anyone in the Phoenix area or beyond."}
{"text":"How is it that I have been taking my kids to school up the street from this place for eight years and never knew it existed?  Met a friend for lunch the other day and the food was delicious!  I had the chicken Caesar salad and my friend had the coconut mango shrimp salad.  Both of us thought our salads were delicious.  The cafe itself is really cute and eclectic.  Spotlessly clean, a little funky and comfortable.  Jackie is very friendly and welcoming.  Perfect place for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"My new fave Sunday brunch spot!! Today I'm here with Trinity...she's enjoying the shade at our outside table. Very dog friendly establishment!! Jackie herself came out to warmly greet us! Jackie did not fail me!! The grilled turkey & ham sandwich was very filling and tasted amazing!! You could taste the love Jackie made it with! Even Trinity loved the cucumber salad! We will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this great new local spot! Truly local and homemade. We had the egg salad on croissant for lunch. Absolutely perfect and delicious. The cucumber salad side was awesome. Jackie is friendly and helpful and the place is really comfortable. Perfect place to meet friends for lunch or just for coffee and a snack. I can't wait to come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love me some Jackie's Cafe!!  The food is awesome.  Jackie is a super nice lady who is obviously a very caring person and and awesome cook!  Great place for business meetings too."}
{"text":"I like this little restaurant. Jackie the owner is very friendly with her customers. My daughter loved her omelette and my over easy eggs had some special spices secretly hidden underneath, delish!! Thanks Jackie!!"}
{"text":"What a treat. Found this on Yelp, Jackie's had such great reviews I had to give it a try. Definitely not disappointed. I felt like I had walked into Jackie's home and she made lunch.  Not only was the food excellent (Try the beef sandwich! It's delectable!) but Jackie makes everything to order then comes out herself to make sure that you are  happy and comfortable.  Will be going back soon and often. Next trip, breakfast!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience . Great food great customs service and loved the ambiance . I had the tuna sandwich with bacon and cucumber salad that was wonderful and my husband had and egg salad sandwich with a fruit cup. Both sandwiches had so much flavor ! Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"A true gem! If you enjoy home cooking, friendly environments, Jackie's is the place!  We happened in one Sunday afternoon to check it out and had the most amazing brunch. Jackie's is now a favorite. Be sure to try the crab cakes, the quiche, the egg salad....everything! Best iced tea around.   Portion sizes are perfect and full of flavor.   Jackie's is a local favorite we need to support. Don't let the temporary construction on Cooper Road detour you, the food & atmosphere is well worth it!  Ideal for a long lunch, quick coffee, or business meeting."}
{"text":"What a gem of a resturant.  Miss Jackie is so genuine and really cares about you having the best experience possible.  I had the egg salad croissant and it was AMAZING!  Do yourself a favor and give this place a chance.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Wonderful new place with fresh flavorful food. Can't be in a hurry,  she's trying to make it work and doesn't have a lot of staff. Best Quiche I've ever had. Short breakfast menu but lots of lunch options. Friendly,  comfortable atmosphere- give it a chance!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and Jackie is amazing also!!  The best customer service , good coffee and great deserts!  Construction is going on in the area but don't let that keep you away. In fact-n this place needs you more than ever with the construction going on in front of her place. Give it a try- support a local! You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little gem!  My husband and I had brunch their today.  When we walked in we were impressed immediately by how cute the cafe was.  I ordered the quiche and coffee, both were great!  My husband ordered a scrambled egg dish.  The eggs were excellent!  Delish!  Even the water was good, no lemon required!  Stop in check her out and support our local businesses!"}
