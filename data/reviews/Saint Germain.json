{"text":"How far we have fallen... OMG!  My husband had taken me here eons ago when this place was packed and I loved it.   So sad to see that this place is clearly on its last legs.  Food was average.  Definitely not worth the price.  Service was OK... not that the waiter would have been challenged since we were the only ones there for at least 30-45 mins.   What happened??   It is so sad...."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Saturday night with a party of four.

The menu is fairly small on selection but everything on the menu sounds good.

For starters, a caesar salad, a french onion soup and a portion of burgundy escargots were ordered.  The salad and french onion soup was really well done and excellent.  The escargots were good but not as good as I was hoping it to be for a restaurant like Saint Germain.

Four different entree items were ordered, the duck leg confit, cameralized pork belly, swordfish 'steak-au-poivre' and beef bourgignon.  The pork belly was definitely the best dish out of the four.  It was really tender and the belly fat was melt in your mouth goodness.  Cooked with an incredible sauce, the pork belly was just amazing.  My duck leg was a little bit dry and so was the swordfish.  The beef bourgignon was really good but I found the beef again to be slightly dry.

2 different desserts were ordered, vanilla creme brulee and glace maison.  The creme brulee was way too sweet and the sugar on the top was not brulee'd very well.  The selection of ice creams and sorbets were different from your run of the mill stores and the 3 different kinds that were ordered were really good.

Service was excellent.  Our server was really friendly and did a fantastic job.  Ambience was fairly romantic.  Really low lighting and music playing in the background.

All in all, it was a good meal but I expected more from a higher end restaurant.  They offer a 3 course menu on Sunday nights for $39.99 and free corkage.  I might return to try that but I don't think I would go back for a normal meal at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here several times, so this is sort of an overview.  

The positives - the service is always excellent, there is no corkage on Sunday nights, the room has very nice ambience, and the overall quality of the food is great.  

The downsides: maybe one out of every eight dishes is a wee bit overcooked [especially fish], sometimes there isn't enough staff to go around, the Sunday night prix fixe menu is gone.

Will I be back? Yes.  They do a great, consistent lamb that has me chewing the bones, and their desserts are great."}
{"text":"We went for a dinner here with a Groupon coupon we had purchased. Neither of us had ever been. We went during stampede, and so the place was EMPTY (there were 4 other diners when we arrived).

My first impression, decor-wise, is that the place isn't done. The floor is concrete, and while my fiance assured me that this was the 'look' they were going for, to me it just look unfinished. The tables seemed too far apart and there was a huge space in the middle of the restaurant completely unoccupied and undecored. It just didn't feel right. The music was a mix of old school remixes and country, which also didn't help with the atmosphere.

The service was fine, our server was very friendly, but for a restaurant with prices like these I expect excellent service from a personality and technical perspective. We often had to wait a long time for her to return to the table.

The appetizers: french onion soup and beef tartare. The soup was great, lots of cheese, super tasty. The tartare had a lot of dijon, I would recommend asking for less in your oder. Overall, just fine.

Entrees: chicken breast and T-bone steak. The chicken was ok, nothign special, the sauce was pretty bland, and had separated which makes me think it was not fresh. The t-bone was cooked perfectly to order, and was quite tasty. We ordered it without sauce, although they have four to choose from. The order of fries was an entire bowl, big enough to share.

Wine: Our server warned us that they were changing over their wine menu and might not have everything. We placed our order for two different glasses. The red they had; the white they did not, but instead of letting us know, she just brought a glass of a 'similar' white. I feel that could have been handled better.

Dessert: Raspberry Ganache. Very yummy, fresh fruit and real whipped cream. This was the best part of the meal for me.

Overall, it's like this place was trying to be high-end but didn't quite make it, although their prices would disagree. I was let down, and won't go back. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've had better food at Brewsters or The Keg."}
{"text":"I tried it out after getting a Dealfind coupon. I had heard good things about it, but that was back a few years ago (as indicated by their awards in 2005-2007). So, thinking that hopefully that they kept some of the quality (as I understand it now, their award winning chef left after those awards, worked for a few places, and is now the maestro who runs the new gourmet doughnut shop Jelly Modern Donuts on 8th St SW). 

Well, it was a Friday evening at 7pm, and it was practically abandoned. Not a good thing. There was no one at the bar, and it took a bit of time for the lone waitress to seat us (next to the only OTHER couple). It's a pretty large resto, and to be that empty on a friday night never bodes well. Then came the appetizers, a pound of mussels, but it was decent though not too outstanding. But when the main entrees came... an overly expensive burger with President's Choice thin burger buns (if I was paying full price, I would have been incredibly upset. my wife snacks on those buns so it was recognized pretty damn quickly. If you're charging $20 for a burger and fries, then at least have a Fresh bun), and a tuna tartar using.... CANNED tuna. Add the beer and the tea my wife had, and the meal went over $90 (again, thank god for the dealfind coupon... I would have been REALLY angry for this kind of quality food for that price). Even then, I still ended up paying about $50 for that, which was still a ripoff. 

Thank heavens it's gone now. Even with a discount coupon, it's just awful, with horrendous food, overly dark depressing atmosphere, lonely and poor service. And now, it's gone."}
{"text":"I had a great experience when the restaurant when it first opened and decided to go back earlier this year with some out of town friends during dine out week.  I was severely disappointed with everything from the service to the food.  For a fine dining restaurant, the host didn't even bother to walk us to our table and simply pointed us to a open table while he walked away to get our menus.  Each service took an hour to get out.  The salad was not seasoned, the entree was burnt and the dessert was probably the best out of the 3 courses, but was just marginal.  I could have made that meal better at home.  To top it all off it took the server over 30 min to return for our credit card payment because all the staff were crowding around the bar catching the end of the shootout during a Flames game.

I would have thought the restaurant would have liked to make a good impression on customers especially during dine out week, but obviously they felt indifferent.  

I will never return nor will I recommend others to go to the restaurant as the industry in Calgary is only becoming more competitive with other fine restaurants opening up."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here to celebrate mother's day.  They were great and really accommodating in making a special surprise with preordered flowers at the table, wine, and just being overall very warm and inviting.  The food was exquisitely crafted and just delicious.  

Lush decor and perfect music just set the tone for a wonderful dinner."}
