{"text":"The workers there were so handsome. Especially the bearded cook.  The food was meh.   10/10 would eat there again."}
{"text":"This place must be tried to be believed and yes, you have to go to the parking lot at Rona in the Stockyards in order to try it."}
{"text":"Finding this place is like finding a four leaf clover! By far the best burgers in this part of town. Great food, good price, great quick service."}
{"text":"Wow... I probably shouldn't post this. Looking for some great, if not the best, BBQ/Smoked meats in the city? Come spring, stalk the RONA parking lot in the Upper Junction. Keep an eye for a trailer, and get ready to enjoy some delicious and very affordable BBQ."}
{"text":"I live in the Junction but rarely go to Rona, so I'm shocked and sad that I didn't even know this place existed before yesterday. The pulled pork sandwich I had yesterday was very, very good, although the next time I order it, I'll ask them to cut it into two pieces.  I need to go back a few more times and try the ribs at least once before I commit to 5 stars. It will be a hardship, but I'm doing it for you, Yelp readers."}
{"text":"I've seen the truck a couple of different times when shopping, but wasn't hungry at the time.  I did remember the name and looked it up later.  Upon reading the reviews, I just had to try.  And I'm glad I did.  Between two of us, we each had a pulled pork sandwich and shared a braised beef poutine.  This did not leave us hungry.  The sandwich was awesome!  The pulled pork was great, but the icing on the cake is the amazing bun.  No, it's not quite a coco bread, but it's a very soft & tasty bread which pairs really well with the pulled pork tossed in a nice BBQ sauce.  Upon opening up the braised beef poutine, my first impression was that there wasn't enough gravy.  However, after eating it, I realize why.  Too much gravy would really ruin this poutine as the rosemary flavour wouldn't come out quite as much and the fries would lose their crispiness.  While I was initially the slightest bit disappointed when I saw it, I couldn't do anything but rave about it after eating.  Hands down, this is the best non-traditional poutine that I have ever had.  True, it's not a \"traditional\" poutine, so don't expect it to be overloaded with gravy & curds.  The rosemary, beef, gravy and crispiness of the fries compliment each other very well.  The beef is also extremely tender.  Normally I won't do non-traditional poutine as I find that adding ingredients usually takes away from the experience and original flavour of the poutine.  This braised beef poutine is the one exception.  I would actually choose this over traditional poutine.  Lucky for me, I do my grocery shopping in the area, so I always have the option to stop by and grab some lunch or dinner.  This is my new favourite place for take out, and it's finally a place close by!   UPDATE: Dropped by again on Friday night.  This time we had tried a full rack of pork ribs and a triple slider cheeseburger.  The ribs were great and I was surprised by how massive the ribs were!  I swear it was the entire side of a huge pig!  Next time I'll know to ask for some extra sauce on the side for the leftovers as I got way more than I had bargained for and was originally not expecting to have any leftovers.  These are close to the best ribs I've had.  To be honest, I have had better at Rib Fest, but that should be expected.  To be completely fair, at Rib Fest, those vendors only do ribs.  Those ribs also tend to be \"fresher\" as you get them seconds after they are done cooking and then eat them on-site.  Fat Louie's doesn't have the benefit of having a very large crowd such as at one of these events (so it's not possible to constantly be cooking and selling immediately once cooked), and then there is the extra time it takes to get the ribs home.  Further to that, as this was a last minute decision while in the area, I didn't \"build up an appetite\", so I wasn't even close to starving, just a bit hungry.  A trip to Rib Fest is always planned, so I'm starving by the time I get there.  Everything is always better when you are starving.  Having said that, it's not really a fair comparison between Rib Fest and Fat Louie's.  But outside of Rib Fest, these are the best ribs I've ever had!  A full rack is around the same cost at both Fat Louie's and at Rib Fest, but the rack I got from Fat Louie's was twice the size of what I'd get from Rib Fest, so I really can't complain about that at all!  I was a bit surprised with the triple slider cheeseburger.  I was expecting a fairly small burger.  While it wasn't massive, it sure as hell wasn't tiny.  It was a great burger and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again (if I'm craving a burger, I'd rather go here than McDonalds).  The only change I'd make for next time would be to ask for some bbq sauce on the burger as well, I think it would go very nicely with it.  Once again, I was not disappointed and definitely plan to come back again!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and thought give it a try but when i went there it was closed even though on yelp it says it would be open until 8pm"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great food and friendly service.  I have been driving by this place for two years thinking I should try it. Today I did! I had 2 orders of the rib combo. I bought them in the afternoon and reheated it for dinner - soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"I don't know what that guy is talking about but I've tried several times to eat here and it's always shut down. This page should've been removed a long time ago."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best bbq in Toronto. I cannot believe how great the food is here and the owner is such a good genuine guy too. The prices are amazing too. You can get so much food for $20. Myself and my wife live nearby and on those long summer evenings we will take a nice walk with our dog to Fat Louie's and sit on the benches and enjoy our food and it is honestly one of my favourite things to do at that time of the year. Also make sure you get the rosemary fries because those things are amazing."}
{"text":"Got the braised beef poutine and it was excellent. My partner had the beef brisket sandwich, also great. Even the prices are good!"}
{"text":"Great place for pulled pork!! I didn't expect much when I spotted this place when I was shopping at Home Depot and Rona, but I was getting handy man hungry with the home reno project I was doing and decided to try it out.  The pulled pork sandwich was delicious!  It would rival anything a full restaurant could conjur up.  I kid you not, this food truck makes amazing BBQ pork.  The bun was crisped to perfection and the pork was tender and seasoned well.  And it only cost me $5.50!!!!!   The best bang for a buck I've ever had.  This comes from me after trying the food truck fest at the CNE and having a weeks worth of other foods truck meals at work. I don't know why they don't move around and  get more exposure because they would annihilate their competitors."}
{"text":"It was Meh.   I had a beef brisket sandwich with Fries. The Fries were pretty good - nice with the rosemary on them, and a good balance of crispy and limp in the carton.   The sandwich was disappointing. The bun was quite large and the meat didn't fully cover the bun. Found the brisket to be dry and tough, with little fat present. There wasn't much bbq or smoke flavour on the meat as well, and the sauce is unremarkable.   Overall, was Meh nothing special. I've been up to collingwood to 'the smoke' several times, and to 'buster rhinos' in Oshawa area many times, and both feature better brisket."}
{"text":"Had the slider cheeseburger and it was fantastic. Bun was crispy and airy meat very juicy and tasty.  Very glad to have found this spot!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in as we were working in the area.  We ordered the poutine with beef on it.  Was good.  A meal in itself.  I had the smoked brisket sandwich.  I have to say good flavor.  I isn't detect the smoky party, but other wise good value."}
{"text":"So happy this truck is still around.  Haven't been able to come by in ages.    It really is still one of the best hidden secrets in the city.    Glad that my smoked brisket sandwich came out super moist and juicy and not overly smokey.  And now that they've built a new mall across the yard, it may be more incentive to come out to this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"This is it!!!! No idea when this place got here but I'm glad I've found it now!  Small menu but everything is d-lish! Minus the coleslaw, meh..  Ribs, burgers, brisket and the pulled pork oh the pulled pork, get two well worth the meat sweats!   Possibly the best BBQ in the city  Truck it up!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful service. Came all the way from Rochester, NY. Was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh boy. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!! I'm thrilled to write this review. Let's get started.   I ordered: -triple slider cheeseburger -beef poutine  The burger: 10/10 -- grilled to perfection, awesome bun, manageable, tasty, just incredible. Like the best backyard BBQ burger you ever made.  The poutine: 100/10 -- yes, one hundred out of ten. The juicy beef, the insanely tasty gravy and broth, the perfectly melted curds, the crispy and fresh french fries, the spices, just. I don't know how many things I've ever eaten in this world that tasted this good. But I was grateful to be alive and to have tastebuds the entire time I was eating this.  What will keep me coming back is the very fair and reasonable prices - makes it an easy decision to come back because you KNOW it's worth it.  Kudos folks, kudos."}
{"text":"The saddest time of the year is when the Closed sign goes up and I gaze into the distance as the truck hauls FLB away to be put into hibernation. Weeks go by, snow and ice come and go then finally, spring and I drive by FLBs tri-seasonal home watching expectantly for the gloriously emblazoned trailer not only promising amazing smoked BBQ but delivering! From the triple sliders oozing cheese, to the smoky sweet pulled pork piled high on the bun, topped with homemade coleslaw, maybe today I'll have the Braised Beef Poutine, or Chili Cheese fries, but wait! It's Friday which means Ribs....smokey, spicy, hot, sweet.....Fat Louis how do I love thee?......I've lost count of the ways"}
{"text":"Great service, large portions, and excellent BBQ! The braised beef, pulled pork, and bbq ribs were all delicious. We had the special sauce on the ribs which came with almonds and cayenne spice. The bread was a bit dry though but the filling more than made up for it. It's a weird location at the parking lot of rona."}
{"text":"Happy to tell you, the place was open as of today.   The spot is staffed by nice people, and the food was tasty! We ordered Pulled pork sandwich, Brisket sandwich, and Rosemary Fries (and got a free drink); all for under $20 which is a good bargain.  The food was really good, the Pulled Pork was a bit oily, but its the best pulled pork I've had in Toronto. The brisket was not what I expected, but in their defense ive never had it in a sandwich before. I can tell you, it was fresh and tasted very good.   The buns were surprisingly fresh, i wonder if they make their own? The sauce on both sandwiches was unique and as BBQ'ish as it gets. I'm guessing they make their own sauce, because they do all their own BBQ'ing at the spot.  We need to talk about the Rosemary Fries. I never had this and it tasted fantastic. Really summer like, refreshing. Fries were not oily, were 'crispylicious', I want more!  The place is at the corner of the Hardware store, and they have bench seating. Having said that, dont be intimidated by the location, give them a try, order something to-go.  Bang for the buck! You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Completely hidden but totally worth it. I had a BBQ Chicken sandwich with their amazing Rosemary fries. Definitely a filling meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and really great price, unlike those other overpriced food truck prices. I had the Triple Slider Cheeseburger ($5) and Braised Beef Poutine ($5.50), came with a free can of pop for the combo. The burger consists of three slider-size patties, cheese, red onions and pickles in lightly toasted buns. The poutine has loads of juicy beef and good amount of cheese curds, though I found the sauce too much and liquidly, not like gravy. The meal was quick and very satisfying, too bad they will be closed for the season on October 4.  I have asked them when they will reopen in 2016, estimating end of April to beginning of May."}
{"text":"I stopped by last weekend on what I believe was their last day of the season.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the triple slider cheeseburger with rosemary fries and a beverage and including tip I paid $20 which is not bad at all.  The burgers and fries were cooked well and neither of us had any issue with our food. The only reason I've rated my experience a 3/5 is because there really wasn't anything that separated our meal from other burger and fries experiences that I would say was outstanding. I've got burgers from other BBQ places that either had a smoked flavour or unique ingredients to them, but the triple slider burger had none of these attributes and appeared to simply be 3 small ground chuck patties on a bun.  That being said, the food was done well enough that I will be back next season to try the pork and brisket and will update my review accordingly."}
