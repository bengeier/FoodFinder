{"text":"Mhmmm Veda, the perfect place to get snacks for my classes in the Multi-faith center (actually, it's the only place you can get snacks..).

Veda prides itself in serving healthy Indian foods you can take and go. Personally I usually get the samosa which there are two variations, vegetarian or chicken. They are also baked not fried which is the healthy aspect to it. I've also tried the stuff naan which was ok, the dipping sauce was really yummy.

One thing to note is that they don't always have their whole menu available. It seems that they never had the mango lassi and other things the site says it has (perhaps it's a reduced menu). Oh and they do serve coffee and have a couple of tea choices.

There are like 4 tables where you can chow down your food but i just head straight to class!"}
{"text":"An absolute student staple.

The cost versus portion size + healthiness + yumminess ratio is pleasantly lower than the norm on campus - and indeed in downtown overall.

Samosas are about $1.50, a bowl with rice and two curries/dishes will cost you about $6 (and is very. filling), and the empanadas are something over $2. All are tasty and come highly recommended - especially in light of the fact that it's all relatively healthy, and doesn't leave you with that greasy self-loathing that often accompanies saucy Indian food. 

Worth noting is that their samosas are baked, and have a Jamaican-patty-like shell which I love. Also, they are super vegetarian friendly (hurray!)

I will come regularly, and thank the Food Services gods that U of T has such a yummy, healthy, and affordable vendor."}
{"text":"Great little place inside the multi-faith centre, across from the grad student pub at the University of Toronto. The curry bowl is a great deal, and a small is not small at all, it usually feeds me well for two lunches. What I like best is that they offer brown rice, and also that their curries have no secret wheat, they spice them well to a mid-range heat, and there is no overdoing it on oil and ghee so that the dishes are fairly light, or at least less greasy than you might be used to. My staple is the lentil/daal curry bowl, which usually comes with two curries, (I opt for a double-serving of the one). Note: Some of the religious student associations housed in this building won't allow beef curry to be prepared and sold here, so if you want to try Veda's madras, you'll have to walk over to their other location in the Engineering building toward the heart of campus. There are a couple of tables in this space, but needing to takeaway is to be expected. If you want a hearty, comforting, but not too heavy lunch for $7-ish, try Veda and see what you think."}
