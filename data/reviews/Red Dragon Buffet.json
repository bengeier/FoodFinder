{"text":"The red dragon buffet has gone down in quality, but raised the amount of options they have. It would be more beneficial for the to raise the quality of what they did have before trying new things."}
{"text":"Don't expect crab legs Sundays. They don't replenish them fast enough for the rude people who take them all in one visit to the line. I waited like 45 min even after asking for more to be brought out. I was watching the door like a hawk and jumped up as soon as I saw those red beauties but alas I was not quick enough. All It took was one person to empty the entire tray. Then here I was stuck with a 50$ dinner bill for a family of 3 and no crab legs in my belly, not a happy Sunday."}
{"text":"Best buffet ever! Delicious fresh affordable food in a clean restaurant with a friendly staff, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Freshly made food. Excellent temperature, cold items cold and hot items hot. Not heavily oiled, over spiced or drenched in sauce.   I love how they display the buffet food in smaller amounts to keep it fresh. The food is cooked to perfection for a buffet!    The service is excellent with personable, efficient staff.    Thank you for the delicious food and friendly atmosphere.  We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"As Buffet places go this one is really good. They have alot of seafood dishes, my favorite being the coconut shrimp. Crab legs where small but meaty and not over cooked. Dishes were refilled often, everything was very clean. The sushi was pretty basic but tasty. The only negative of the night was the bananas on the dessert bar were rock hard. Otherwise every thing was really good at a decent price. Will be back."}
{"text":"Not really all that fantastic rice was dry as well as the noodles, only good thing was the sushi, drinks and ice cream still looking for that Good Chinese Food Buffet. Not worth the $16 dollars at all. Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Oh my god! Worst crap ever! I am angry and feel robbed and disgusted, polluted, sick to my stomach! I am furious that I was subjected to the most rotten dining experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I revisted Red Dragon Buffet and the quality of the food hasn't changed and the service is still very warm and friendly.  I wanted to post an update for those who were interested."}
{"text":"Very good buffet. Orange chicken has a lot of flavor. General Tso Chicken is also very good. good selection of sushi. Really everything tastes good. My favorite is the teppenyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Very clean and beautiful restaurant  Good Service and affordable  food has great taste better than Lyns  and Golden Coreal"}
{"text":"the food was very fresh and hot. and delicious. The restaurant is clean and quiet. the staff is very helpful."}
{"text":"Gorgeous, clean, bright and great food! My husband and I visited here, and after the long car trip the hot food, tea and service was just what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Food pricing. Great food. Loved the desert. Great service. Nice place. Clean friendly. Definitely come again"}
{"text":"Good food not crazy over priced either and also a friendly staff. Came in around 8 and they were a little busy but still working hard awesome place to eat also nice clean inside"}
{"text":"Just ate there. Food was really good. They had a steady stream of people coming in after the lunch hour. The place is super clean. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese eveeeeer because it is sooooooooooo good and I'd soooooooooo tasteful"}
{"text":"Another great after church dinner. Fresh stuff hot and ready for us. Nothing tasted old or cold. Another great night"}
{"text":"been going here for 2 months. food is good. crablegs are very small. waterlogged. have to wait too long to refill pan. only put out a few legs. wont be returning. not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great selection of food! The lemon chicken was really good!!! Very clean restaurant too."}
{"text":"This place has really good Chinese food have been coming here for a few months now and the food is dread hot tasty when I first came here the sushi was one of the best in the area for a buffet, but in the last month or so they are using less seafood and more vegetables and cream cheese, so most places use the crab salad in the Center they us veggies and lots of cream cheese. I knew they would not keep the high quality of food sushi forever but thought it would be longer then they did so for regular Chinese food they get 4 stars but the sushi dropped to 2.5.   So sad."}
{"text":"The red dragon buffet has the best Chinese food in town! This place are very Clean ! And the services are Amazing ! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Usually very weary of buffets but decided to give this place a try. Place was very clean, had a large selection of food and the food was absolutely delicious!!! They even offer a variety of sushi which was very tasty. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"We just finished lunch & we are very disappointed.  Since it is buffet, we tried almost everything & we found nothing to be acceptable quality. Only good thing we can say is the price is responsible."}
{"text":"Just opened 3 months ago. Wanted to wait for it to get broken in before I came.   Wednesday during lunch time not packed at all. Cozy environment and cheap prices!!!  Sushi to me was good but wife thought it was a bit ugly.   To me definitely making this a once a month place to eat!"}
{"text":"Wonderful new restaurant in Avondale! All the usual Asian buffet selections were done very well! Soups, General Tsao, crab legs, and teppanyaki beef were great. Mongolian grill and desert bar were wonderful as well. Multiple selections of fish, shrimp, clams/ oyster, sushi. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been through a few iterations.  I think this is the best one yet.  It's not PF Changs. So, don't go there expecting that.  It is a buffet, and it is a really good buffet.  They have a mongolian grill, which was great.   The food at the buffet was excellent.  The staff was not too much speak english, but they speak enough to be helpful and offer great service.  (I hope they come to the US of their own volition.  I'll assume they do).   Everything was superb.  It was everything I could hope for in an inexpensive Chinese food buffet.    Wait a minute....Is that a dessert bar with self-scoop ice cream?   OK.  Now you get five stars!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and the food is okay, but the service is horrible.  After being seated, the waitress never checked on us just once if we needed refill on our drink. Had to even ask them to pick up our plates because it was never picked up. Then asked if we can get our drink refilled, waitress said yes then never came back. Won't be back again. Save yourself the money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had lunch there this afternoon and was impressed.  The food was delicious. A lot of different items to chose from.  Place was very clean and all employees we encountered were friendly and helpful. It is across the parking lot from Sam's Club and had never stopped in before today. I was extremely impressed.  I recommend you try it. I will definitely go back. Great price for a buffet. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent selection but everything had a sweet taste.  Food was warm.  Not hot!  Would not return.  Crab rangoon was soggy.  Egg drop soup was too salty and too thick"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese buffet I'll go to now. The restaurant is very clean, nicer decor. I really love having a large selection to choose from, especially veggies. All of my choices were delicious, hot and fresh! Some buffets have either food that's been sitting there for a long time and is therefore overdone, mushy etc or sometimes it's not hot enough which can be a health concern. No worries here... great food, flavors and fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Our new go-to for chinese!!! I've been to quite a few chinese buffets in the past and usually the food is mediocre. We stopped by here for the first time today in hopes of finding some decent grub and we were extremely impressed! The quality is much greater than normal buffets, great flavors in their food, polite service, and they have a wide variety of items. I normally love orange chicken but theirs has just a tad too much orange so its a little strong. The chow mein and teriaki chicken were amazing!!! Large dining space and its nice and updated. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. Food is good, sushi is good, area is clean, not to crowded, a bit over priced, customer services is decent."}
{"text":"Really good food! Lots of selections, also includes a teppanyaki station, sushi bar and soups. Dessert is limited but still very good especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated & very clean.  A wide variety of very delicious food.  Good service.  An incredible Sushi Bar.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped here the other day, the variety of food and the taste of the food was very good.the only complaint keeping this from a higher score was the dumplings as there was no cover on them so they were very dried out. We will be back again though.   Since the last review have been back many times the food is still great but the issue on the dumplings remain. Oh well."}
{"text":"This building has housed several different Chinese food buffets over the years...and I have tried them all!  This one is the best.  They have a bbq window, ice cream bar with 8 flavor a, sushi and all the normal favorites.  Impressed that food was not super greasy like most buffets.  Could actually taste layers of flavor in items like coconut shrimp and lemon chicken.  Restaurant is clean, not dingy at all.  Good service although not much English.  Prices were great.  Usually go to Pacific Seafood Buffet in Arrowhead. This place was just as good but cleaner and way cheaper.  Please stay open Red Dragon!"}
{"text":"Sushi was very yummy. They don't have a lot of selection. They do have ice cream of different flavors that is a plus :)"}
{"text":"My grandfather loves to go to Chinese buffets, we tried here and it was pretty bad. There were maybe two things that tasted good. They have a lot of variety but everything has a strange flavor including the king pap chicken and orange chicken. They do have a good fruit and dessert selection tho."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting and not fresh I ate 3 bites and I made a complaint and the manager told me 20% off and to never come back. He was very argumentive and needs to learn proper customer service. I will never recommend this place or no problem with me ever coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a quality all you can eat style buffet.  The Asians that work here seem to have the gig figured out pretty well.  They offer great service, fast waters, and quality asian food that you can dine on until you feel like you're going to pop."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this restaurant a 4.5, but can't so I'm giving them the round up at a 5. I came here expecting your typical buffet (sub par food to fill me up) but was pleasantly surprised from the moment I walked through the door. As I walked through the door my mouth began to water in excitement for what was to come. I was greeted nicely and sat down immediately. I must say the food was equivalent to the quality of a 4 star Chinese joint but with unlimited quantities and way more options. I wouldn't recommend it as a first date, but who would go to a buffet on there first date anyway? 4.5/5, best part = free fortune cookies & you can even grab a mint on your way out the door."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times since it opened. It is what you would expect from a Asian buffet. Nothing really to set it apart from other Asian buffets, except the cleanliness, customer service, and the price. The restaurant appears to be very clean and well maintained. The staff are always very pleasant and inviting. The cost is very reasonable for what you get from an all-you-can-eat. I would recommend the Red Dragon Buffet."}
{"text":"Was expecting better  We were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided to stop in at Red Dragon Buffet. The staff at Red Dragon were friendly and it seemed to be a very popular spot.  Red Dragon Buffet offers a fair selection of entrees, however, I did not care for the taste or quality of the food. The seasoning level was non-existent and most items were overcooked or luke warm at best. Our meals just weren't very good.   I love Chinese food however, I would not recommend Red Sragon."}
{"text":"First off let me just say wow! This Red dragon buffet is hands down and I mean hands down the best Chinese buffet I have been too and let me tell you I eat Chinese food like you breath. They greeted soo warmly I thought to my self this is how you make someone feel welcome. Let's get to the food cause I know that's what y'all here for imma just put this  come on bring all y'all friends and family it's delicious and affordable that's all I gotta say!!"}
{"text":"Really clean buffet and great food,  would give 5 stars but the customer service wasn't the best!! Other than that I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I have been looking for a good Chinesse buffet for a long time and I think we found . It's just like any other Chinesse buffet but the food is fresh the restaurant is clean, good variety.Sushi not to good but you don't go to a buffet expecting to eat good sushi unless you go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is very good for a buffet. I usually eat the different seafood . Soft shell crab is very good. Good selection and always putting out fresh food. Service is great staff always friendly . Keep the place very clean unlike a lot of other buffets."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place. It surprised me. They have sushi, ice cream, and some seafood. But what really sold me was the grill that you can choose the ingredients to put into your very own stir fry."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious here! This is one of our \"go to\" Chinese buffet restaurants. My kids love being able to pick out their own food. They even have ice cream for dessert. Prices were reasonable but a little more on the weekends because they serve crab legs."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday and the sushi sucked! If you are going for Chinese food and maybe some mussels, and other seafood you're good. But don't expect even basic quality of sushi."}
{"text":"Great selection of food. The food was super fresh and the service was excellent. I didn't give it 5 stars because the eggdrop soup is not a recipe that I'm accustomed to. Otherwise, everything else was delicious and the restaurant was immaculate."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. Very clean, food was alright, sushi was alright. Thought I'd try it off the reviews."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the west valley that we've found so far. Lots of variety and everyone will find things to eat. Good variety of sushi. Crab rangoons were good. Sweet and sour chicken not the greatest but many other entree dishes were better than you find around the west valley."}
{"text":"This is a top-notch Asian buffet. The place is immaculate. Cleanliness obviously matters here. The food is good, the lemon chicken is excellent, and they have crab rangoon on the buffet! That's always worth an extra star in my book. And the tables have the most delightful designs own them!"}
{"text":"I concur with the majority of postings here. Very clean. I'll go back."}
{"text":"It was okay, food was par.  It had the same options as the previous two or three buffets that were their prior.  Very clean & waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"Ample food selection, comfortable dining area, but seemed super cheap with the sushi. Paper thin slices of raw fish sitting on top of a dense clump of sticky rice... Not good! Hot  dishes were tasty, well-seasoned, not too salty. Wide enough selection of varying dishes. Would visit again for a quick dinner for $11.49."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant ever. It's even better than Panda Express. The food is so amazing. They even are open on thanksgiving day. I strongly recommend the sweet and sour chicken with a side of fries. It's the best Chinese food I've ever eaten in my life. If you are looking for good service, good quality and open almost everyday, this is the Chinese restaurant you should go to. My folks and I love going here after shopping at the Sam's Club right across the road. It's so convenient."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese buffet.  The food is fresh and really good. A great variety of choices.  Also, real ice cream. All my children love this place too."}
{"text":"Not sure how long this nice buffet has been open and I haven't noticed, but, I found it and gave it a shot today! Wow, was I impressed.   It was clean!!!!!! Also the renovation or the construction was nice.   The food was pretty good. I liked the orange chicken and the general tsao chicken. Both were uniquely seasoned and tasted great.   Nice ice cream bar.   Was a little disappointed with the crab legs but hey who has crab legs on a lunch buffet anyway?!  Just thought they tasted way over cooked.   We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean, yummy. Probably the best buffet in the Goodyear surprise areas. Only 4 stars because they don't have soft serve machine, only regular ice cream. Super yummy tho"}
{"text":"This buffet was definitely one of the better ones that I've gone too. This place is really clean and the food was great. None of the food that I tasted was cold, it was just right. The only section I didn't get to try was the grilling station where you can pick out your meat and veggies so they can cook it for you. They didn't have many deserts but the ones they had were really good. They have ice cream flavors like vanilla, strawberry, butter pecan and a couple other ones that I can't remember. They also have sushi, which was pretty decent. Over all I had a great experience here, the is price alright, it came to around 12$ dollars per person. I would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"So far bedst Chinese buffet I've had since we moved here from California they have a big selection of different things to get and the ice cream is really good. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great Mongolian BBQ ! The selection is very good! The staff is very friendly and the cleanliness is a"}
{"text":"I've never expected 5 star service from a Chinese buffet but I ALWAYS leave a tip because they do their job. This was the worst I've ever experienced at any restaurant and i am not a difficult person. We ordered our drinks, then went to get food, we came back and our drinks were wrong except 2. So I walked up to the cashier (who was also our server) and told her our drinks were wrong. No response or eye contact. Then I asked if we could get the right ones. No response or eye contact again. Then I asked for 2 two straws. She shooed me away. The rest of our stay I had to refill our drinks myself because she would completely pass us up and refilled everyone else's. She brought our check while we were still eating our first plate of food. I did not leave a tip this time. I don't know what her issue was with us but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Based on the four and five star reviews we took a 50 mile drive to Avondale to experience the Red Dragon.  We found it to be very clean with a relatively pleasant decor and a polite staff.   After a liberal two-plate sampling of as much stuff as I could cram onto two plates, I have to give this place the three star \"average\" rating.  After all, it is a buffet and most of the entrees could have come from many of the buffets in the valley; there was nothing outstanding here. I am beginning to suspect that the vast majority of Chinese buffets get their food from the same central supplier... this is only a suspicion... I have no empirical proof, but everything at the Red Dragon looked and tasted like the food I have eaten at numerous Chinese buffets -- from coast to coast.  I don't mean to sound disparaging,The Red Dragon was the equal of most of the Oriental buffets I have experienced; no better - no worse.  I would probably eat there again if I were close to Avondale but after experiencing I-10 and Avondale town traffic I doubt I will be in the area in the near future.  On the plus side, the prices were very reasonable.  If you're pretty hungry and you need to fill a void, this place will work."}
{"text":"I was really impressed.  they're pretty new so on waited a few months to try it out.  we went for lunch.  reasonably priced 8.29.  food was delish and fresh. the lemon chicken was my favorite.  Good stuff"}
{"text":"I wanted to go somewhere new so we tried this place. Lots of food choices. Everything looked fresh and hot. I tried lots of new things. I even tried various sushi rolls and was vert happy. I only had sushi a few times ever and found myself going back for 2nds.Very clean and inviting. Quiet atmosphere"}
{"text":"First time coming out to this buffet. I expected an Asian buffet to have crab legs on Saturday. I even called to confirm they had snow crab legs and not the little stone crabs. I was assured they had the \"long crab legs\". Upon arrival we walked the buffet and saw stone crabs but no other crab legs. We asked the front cashier about the information received on the phone. She again assured me they had the \"long crab legs \" and walked us back to the buffet where there was an empty spot. We were told they would be bringing out crab legs but nobody seemed to know how long it would take. I'm not willing to wait for a few crab legs and compete for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  we go here alot.  not bad for buffet.  i just hope to get a new cd.  it is always taylor swift.  but other then that it is very good for our area."}
{"text":"There is a nice selection of food available, Mongolian, soup and salad bar, two buffet bars, sushi, dessert, and soft churned ice cream. The only things we felt were \"eh\" were the fried chicken (very dry) and the black pepper chicken (slimy and probably had been sitting out there a while). The crab Rangoon were very good. Potstickers were decent."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a meeting so we stopped here for a working lunch. We should have kept driving and gone somewhere else, anywhere else. The place is clean and the service is good but the food is horrible. I had a piece of each of the following items: Broccoli beef (it tasted boiled, as it it was cooked in the sauce from frozen); General Tso's chicken (again, bland and soggy); Orange chicken (you are going to need to drink a gallon of water after this dish, the MSG is obvious); cheese wonton (it was OK but again, how can you mess up a fried bit of cream cheese in phyllo doe); baked salmon (holy crap! Was it boiled in oil?); stuffed mushrooms (the flavor was... just good but they were overcooked and this is after I waited for a new tray to come out); lemon chicken (if you've ever had a milanesa, this is what this basically is. I enjoyed it.); pepper chicken ( badly seasoned and mushy). In short, if you pass by this restaurant, do just that, pass it. You will be happier going to, well, just about anywhere else."}
