{"text":"If the food is impressive enough, I'm always willing to pay for it. The food they offer is not worth the money at all. 5 bucks is not a big money, but given what you can get there, it's way too pricy."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try and ordered the #1 house special beef bun. First bite, the beef texture felt soft and mushy. Then there was an overwhelming wave of spicy-ness from the numbing peppercorns. Then I waited to see if I can taste anything else, nope. Could not taste any of the meat, just spicy-ness throughout. Finally, the there was a disappointing amount of filling (see my picture). Sorry, but compared to the Xian-Chinese hamburgers that I've had, this would have been a 1 star. I will give you an extra star in hopes that you can improve."}
{"text":"Concur with the other reviews that there is a value issue with some of the items. The portion sizes are good (in terms of how large a meal should be), but the pricing is wrong.   Their signature buns are less than 10cm in diameter and 3cm high, with a small amount of filling. An angus burger from McDonald's is twice the size for the same price. At $5.95, this is Chinese bun is not fair value. If the filling and size were equivalent to a shawarma or falafel pita, this would be ok, but this bun should be 2.99...maybe 3.95  Their dumplings are average size, but at 8.99, again, too much. Their dumplings should be 5.99.  On a positive note, the taste for both items were spot on - not spectacular, but good and competent.   The noodles at $10 is fair and one of the tastiest I've had. Would recommend this item and avoid everything else until their pricing is fixed."}
{"text":"I think the negative reviews are a result of not understanding how Chengdu food is supposed to taste. I'm from there (the capital city of SiChuan, China and home to numb & spicy food) and I ordered the Fen Zheng beef Guokui. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MUSHY. It's a cooking style from SiChuan where you season the beef with starch and a multitude of spices, steam it, then serve. It's mushy but very flavourful. The Guokui left my mouth numb & spicy, which is what I missed from food back in my country. I agree that I expected a bigger portion for what I paid but I've definitely overpaid for food before. Giving it 4/5 stars because it's good but not the most authentic-tasting SiChuan cuisine I've had. I'll probably go back to order some other things and try them out. It's really hard to get SiChuan food right."}
{"text":"I mean, cmon bro, this is the worst Guokui I have ever had in Toronto, the owner looks like I own him million dollars, the dish like WT*, it is not worth at all, even a subway sandwich is much much better than this. I am really sad about the experience here, trust me, avoid with all costs, please, I am begging you guys."}
{"text":"For the price you pay the portion size is meagre. I've checked out this place twice and the value of your meal is very disappointing. For a couple bucks more you get a much better deal at any of the other restaurants in emerald park.   I've ordered the hand sliced cold chicken noodle and its served with a tiny portion of shredded chicken with an abundance of noodles.   The second time I went I ordered wontons, and again the portion size is disappointing. The taste is average. You can better spend the $7 elsewhere or towards a better \"meal\" because you will not feel full.   I keep mentioning portion size because I do not think the taste is anything special, which makes it extra disappointing because the taste does not offset the price. I think the owner should review the menu and consider pricing and portioning at a more competitive rate or else make the food mind-blowing. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I was so excited to try this place and the owners seem very nice. However, the amount you get is very small for the price. The beef tastes mushy (not sure if this is what it is supposed to taste like?). The bread is alright. Seasoning is alright though a bit spicy. I like the combination of parsley with beef. But overall did not feel satisfied with the portion and I wish the beef shank was chunky like what they have behind the glass counter."}
{"text":"The vegetarian leek/egg crepe/pancake is delicious and healthy! Not much egg but mostly leek.  though it was different each time I ate it. first time was not spicy, second time was spicy."}
