{"text":"These stars are for the service. which we just experienced like 5 mins ago, this Friday, 10/01 at approx 2:45am.  The pizza was good.  Rude, lazy delivery chick.  She couldn't come up to my hotel room despite the 20% tip included in the online order.  I was resting in my undies and had to put clothes on to go downstairs.  Pizza is good and I would order again."}
{"text":"Their cheese sticks and wings are amazing! The staff is top notch and very friendly, highly recommend coming down and having a bite to eat. 10/10 you won't be let down."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town and open late! Try the BBQ chicken pizza. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best bar food in town! Try their wings and fries they're fried to perfection and extra juicy! What separates BIG8 from any other business, their staff is very fast and friendly. Thank you guys for filling my tummy up right and the awesome service :)"}
{"text":"Very good customer service. Our order took awhile but they had just opened up the kitchen, so that was on us. We ordered buffalo chicken pizza, which I would recommend if you reallllllllly like Gorgonzola ( blue cheese). Not spicy, but drizzled hot sauce on top and the chicken was good. We also had regular hot wings: good but could've used more sauce, however I prefer really wet wings. The mozzarella sticks were also pretty yummy! Can't wait to try the other pizza."}
