{"text":"I ordered some take out from Silver City, and the food arrived cold. We only live 5 minutes away, so not too sure how far ahead our food was prepared. The food was also sub-par. The chicken fried rice had a weird burnt taste to it, and the beef and broccoli wasn't as good as I was expecting from the other review."}
{"text":"They recently change new owner. Good food and service. Very authentic chinese food now. Must try."}
{"text":"I like the Canadian Chinese food, Ginger Beef Chicken Balls, sweet and sour pork or chicken Fried rice Lemon Chicken ect.....
all i have to say is WOW, the food is fresh and it dam good,  the Gingerbeef is nice and lightly crispy, the chicken balls HAS CHICKEN in it, not just dough. The take out dinners for 1-10 are a great value."}
{"text":"The last order we placed was in 2012 and were really disappointed with the food but even worse was the staff they were beyond rude. Now 5 years later we thought we'd give them another try as they're close to home. We placed an order for delivery that included their combo dinner for 2 with an extra order of Beef Ho Fun. The combo had 2 spring rolls which were overcooked and below average tasting, the won ton soup was ok but lacking flavour. The chicken fried rice was slightly burnt and extremely greasy. The ginger chicken was burnt, tough and had more dough than chicken. The garlic spareribs were literally burnt black with no seasoning and hard as rocks. The Beef Ho Fun had nice soft beef and noodles but had no flavour. We called to complain and the staff was extremely polite and replaced 2 of the items, the ginger chicken and spareribs. Upon recieving the second order we again felt the garlic spareribs were unseasoned and overcooked and the ginger chicken although a little softer was still stringy small bits of chicken with tons of burnt batter. Everything we received had an after taste of old stale cooking oil. After our replacement order arrived we got a call from the restaurant asking how the food was and by then we were simply so disappointed we lied and said fine. But we ended up throughing out the $60.00 worth of food and baked a dellisio $4.00 frozen pizza for dinner which was 100 times better. One compliment goes out to the delivery driver as he was extremely pleasant. It will be another 5 years before we order from them again if ever. There are way to many Chinese restaurants out there who take pride in their good and products they serve."}
{"text":"Solid, standard westernized Chinese food.  Very friendly staff & the chef will often come out to make sure you understand what you are ordering.  They make great ginger beef.  My favorite dish from our last visit was the chili sea bass.  It was deep fried which I found surprising but it was very good.  Oh and it was HOT (not surprising because it was covered in dried chilis).  I will definitely be ordering it again!"}
{"text":"Absolute crap, no flavor at all there was no enough soya sauce in the bag to give this crap a hint of flavor.  Took my order back the next day to get my money back and they accused me of eating all the ingredients that the meal came without. Chicken fried rice was steamed rice with soya sauce on It to make it look brown, chop suey was ordered but got chow main that tasted like paper pulp. Do NOT order from this dump!"}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good!  The service is very friendly as well!  My only wish is that they had interac for their delivery!  But other then that we go back often!"}
{"text":"Today we celebrated my dads Birthday by checking this place out. The food here was totally not a disappointment. This restaurant was taken over recently and the menu has changed. The food was fresh and tasty. The first dish was a cold jelly fish with shredded chicken salad and that was a very interesting take of this dish. Refreshing and perfectly seasoned. We also ordered salt & pepper eggplant and salt & pepper pork chops. Braised pork belly with taro root of course Peking Duck 3 course and fried green beans finishing off with complimentary chinese dessert soup taro and tapioca. This is a great place to come for some great dishes. This place is small 10 tables only, 3 lg tables and the rest are tables for 4 to 5. Its quite hidden. This is a must visit for some great Chinese food. #yyceats #yycfoodie #chinesefood #yycrestaurants #calgaryeats #travelalberta #calgaryfoodie #love #sharefood #sweet #delicious #eating #foodpics #tagblender #hungry #foodgasm #instafood #amazing #instagood #photooftheday #fresh #instafood #yum #yummy #yumyum #delicious #eat #dinner #food #foodporn #stuffed #hot"}
{"text":"This was pretty decent western Chinese food. We ordered right around dinner time on a weekday. They quoted us 30-45 minutes and it was closer to an hour, but the food was still very hot when it arrived and everything seemed fresh. The ginger beef was really good. There was nothing particularly amazing about the food, but it satisfied the craving."}
{"text":"We were happy to finally find a restaurant close to where we live that closed at 11pm.
We walked in at around 845pm Fri night. Family run for sure. The kids were running around bored, no customers at all, husband was reading the paper at a table, delivery man was smoking outside the door, the wife was counting the days' receipts at the till and the older female child was helping her. Not overly friendly by any standards, speaking only when spoken to.
We knew the menu from on line and placed our order. We were told it would be 15 min, took almost a half hour. Brought the food home and we really wanted to like it, it would have saved us a drive to Chinatown when we felt like Asian food.
Dinner for one - the small cup of wonton soup was half full and was pure salt. And we like salt. Inedible. Spring roll, not bad - that and the fortune cookie were the only \"passes' for this meal (I do not like when they give 1 cookie for 2 people as they did! I do not wantgto share my fortune!!!). The fried rice was overcooked and the chicken balls tasted off. We also ordered my fave dish, Singapore Noodles. It was a nice portion and initially tasted OK. After a few bites though, my tummy was turned off by something in it and the whole thing now sits in the fridge about to meet its fate with the garbage can. Hellloooo Pepto!"}
{"text":"Food portion is quite large and tastes very good too. Owner is very friendly, but does not speak Mandarin. He speaks mainly Cantonese and English. This restaurant also offers take out. Overall would recommend this pace."}
{"text":"I love this Chinese restaurant! Their food is very authentic and it's soo delicious and mouth watering. The price is just right for what you get. They serve the food quick and the quality is really good. They have a wide variety of food choices and their servings are very filling and it's always good for sharing.

The owners of the place are always very friendly and accommodating in every visit! The woman owners takes time to chat and makes you feel very welcome. She also recommends their specialty and other food you might what to try! They offer pick up, take out, & dine in. I think they might also have delivery but I'm not entirely sure! 

I'm so glad that this place is just 7 min drive from our house. It always busy during dinner time both dine in and pick up! I think Symons Valley area's favorite Chinese restaurant for a quick dinner weekdays / weekends! 

I wish though that they'll expand their restaurant space in the future to accommodate more people."}
{"text":"I have not been to this restaurant for years.  The last time I was here, I remembered it as a struggling small restaurant that catered to the take-out crowd that didn't necessarily care about the authenticity of the Chinese cuisine.  After seeing a few good reviews recently and the fact that this is under new ownership, I thought I might give this place another try.  

We came on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't busy as expected for a weeknight.  The busiest time saw four of the eight tables occupied, which isn't bad for a weeknight.  The service was friendly and we were looked after quite well.  We only have four people with diet restrictions so we weren't able to order too many dishes or try some of the more unique meat dishes.  The food was decent and portions were large except for the 'Oyster Cake', that I thought could be thicker.  Otherwise everything was food.  I will follow up with a more in-depth review on the food once I get to try other things here on future visits.

PS: if you want to come here for dinner on a weekend, I highly recommend that you call ahead to reserve a table.  We tried to come here once but was turned away because all tables were booked."}
{"text":"Family wanted Chinese for dinner tonight so I ordered through SkipTheDishes. Meal arrived hot and fresh. Ginger beef was great as was the sweet and sour chicken. The salt and pepper squid was decent but not my favourite. Batter was a little soft and I fully believe that was because I ordered delivery and it was not the restaurant's fault. I would order here again for sure"}
{"text":"Came here quite late on a Monday; 45 minutes before posted closing time. Even at that late an hour, they were super accommodating and friendly. The restaurant is small and cozy, perfect for our impromptu meal. I'm often deterred from going to Chinese restaurants as my recognition of Chinese characters aren't that great. Often times I'm left guessing and hoping that I ordered the correct item off the menu. I had no fear here!

The server greeted us in both English and Cantonese, and actually asked what type of tea we wanted to drink. That rarely happens! Often we are just given jasmine tea without a second look. The menus also have English no them! Just reflecting on their menus gives me joy!

The server was super helpful in helping us pick out dishes, and also telling us what the specials were for the day. I found it extremely helpful that she told us what veggies were available for the day, this helped us to narrow down our choices as well.

As per the server's recommendation, we got half a honey garlic crispy chicken, house special fried noodles and stir-fried yu choi with garlic. All the dishes we got were delicious and not swimming with oil :D They came out hot and super quick as well!

We ended our meal with complementary sweet soup (which is another perk some restaurants neglect to provide us).  The taro sago was a perfect end to a fabulous meal.

Looking forward to bringing friends and family here in the near future."}
{"text":"Silver City is your pretty basic Peking and Cantonese cuisine restaurant.  Their menu is available for dine-in, take-out and free delivery within a five-km radius on orders over $25.  See, pretty standard.

What makes this place exceptional is the wonderfully enthusiastic and friendly staff.  As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a woman who seems genuinely delighted that you walked into her restaurant.  She greets you with a huge smile and a loud, \"Helllllo!\"  

Their menu consists of pretty basic food like, chop suey, different fried rices and an assortment of beef, chicken and vegetable combinations.  My favourite has got to be the Beef with Broccoli.  I love the sauce that they use and the ingredients seem to be fresh, not like they've been sitting around waiting to be used.

Silver City is a great local restaurant!  They offer delicious food for a reasonable price, and are sure to put a smile on your face with their kind demeanor and odd yet funny jokes!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and they are not closed as reported. We've ordered the past 3 months and in restaurant it is busy with customers eating in."}
{"text":"It was a quiet holiday for us this year, minus the big family get together -I had a hankering for some Chinese.  Silver City is close to where I live and never really noticed it till trying to find something open on Christmas Day.  

We decided on picking up since it would be quicker and ordered some ginger chicken, chicken fried rice, beef and broccoli, spicy chicken and veg and beef chow fun noodles.  They offer a free option if you spend a certain amount but it was a disappointing selection, we opted for stir fried veg.  

The place itself was cleaner than most Chinese places but the food was mediocre, the only redeeming dishes were the beef and broccoli and the beef chow fun, the rest were no fun at all!  The rice was not fresh and the chicken chunks were dry and bland.  The chicken and veg dish was also bland and the chicken tasted off to me; the leftovers of this dish the next day were inedible.  The free stir fried veg dish had these disgusting gelatinous chunks throughout which I pray was undiluted cornstarch--ewe!  

The kids loved the ginger chicken because they were essentially huge chunks of nuggets breaded beyond recognition and suffocated in the sweet sauce, I was happy to see that most of the chicken meat was white meat, though, and the kids did gobble it up so I give them a plus for that.

Their prices are about the same as most Chinese places but I did find a few of their containers smaller than others so you don't get the same amount of food for the price.

I probably would give this place another go, since it is close by...but my quest to find authentic, clean, and unambiguous chinese food (not downtown!), continues."}
