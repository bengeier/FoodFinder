{"text":"Excellent food and you can even bring your own bottle of wine. I went there with friends from Cameroon and everyone like it."}
{"text":"I am married to a Senegalese and travel to Senegal quite often so I am in a good position to review this food.  From the onset of communication, the owner was beyond friendly.  He really went out of the way to make us comfortable.  The food was delicious but I would say that it was prepared in a healthier manner than typical Senegalese food. Senegalese food is the most delicious I have ever tasted but tends to be cooked with excessive oil.  This was not full of oil but somehow managed to hold on to its taste.  I can say it was not exactly the same since it was made with more healthy ingredients but I can say that the trade off was well worth it and the food held on to as much as the authentic taste as possible.  If you want authentic Senegalese taste with a healthy spin, this is your place. The one suggestion I could make would be to offer bread while your customers wait for their food and to serve larger portions of juice in a more professional looking container.  100% will return here if I ever visit this city again."}
{"text":"On a visit to Montreal from Texas and was delighted to find and eat at Diolo! It was Sunday evening before Thanksgiving and the restaurant was very quiet when we arrived at 7:00 pm.   Edmond the proprietor was very warm and welcoming. As the restaurant did not serve alcohol- we brought our own beer- and were graciously provided two very nice glasses and a bottle opener.  We let Edmond choose our food as we have had very little experience with West African cuisine and wanted to eat what he thought to be the very best dishes from Le Senegal.  He selected the grilled fish with couscous for me, and the braised lamb with caramelized onion and brown rice for my boyfriend. He also provided us a side of the Mafe sauce (a rich savory peanut sauce) to try and made on the spot a delicious hot sauce to satisfy out Texan need for hot spice.  The grilled fish was terrific. It came whole with a type of mango salsa topping. It was fresh and very tasty. The cassava couscous (which I have learned is called Attieke) was out of this world good with a rich garlic and citrus flavor and unique and intriguing texture.  The lamb shank was also delicious. Rich and hearty, the sauce had a braised onion and meaty depth that was delightful. The brown rice was not \"brown rice' per se- but more rice tossed with a pan drippings and molasses. It was not sweet, nor sticky, but rather well rounded and a wonderful accompaniment to the lamb.  The Mafe sauce was killer good. Though Edmond did not recommend this for a dinner item, owing to the dishes inherent heaviness on the belly. So if you go for lunch give it a try!  All in all a excellent experience with an exemplary host and exciting and exotic food. Tip: skip the apps and just go for the entrees and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Humm j'aurais mis 3 étoiles si je n'avais pas attendu 2 heures (oui oui 2 heures)  pour recevoir l'entrée et une autre heure encore pour recevoir le plat principal. On était un groupe de 10-11 personnes et il y avait 1 seul serveur pour tout le restau ! La nourriture est super bien, j'ai pris un Yasa, par contre, l'entrée ne va pas vous rassasier. J'ai pris des crevettes et je ne m'attendais pas à recevoir 3 crevettes sans épices. Le pauvre serveur était épuisé à la fin. Le décor .. sans commentaire et il n'y a pas de parking. Sinon, le Bisap était bon."}
{"text":"Living in Toronto does not give an opportunity to taste West African Food. Hence I wanted to try Diolo  Traiteur which offers a variety of West African dishes especially Senegalese ones.  I am Senegalese and was in a position to judge whether the food was good and authentic compared to what we have in Senegal. And I was not disappointed at all. The food tasted amazing. I could find all the flavors and tastes I was used to seventeen years ago.  Edmond the chef and owner of the restaurant is such a friendly guy and really took care of ourselves, giving us a full description of the dishes we ordered and counseling us as well.  Edmond you should open something in Toronto.  All the best"}
