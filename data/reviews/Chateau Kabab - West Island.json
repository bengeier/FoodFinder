{"text":"Amazing authentic food! Great service and good value for your money."}
{"text":"We made it to Montreal late at night, so we googled for places for us eat and this place was on the list, we ended up going there, very poor customer service, the waitress took our order without writing it down and of course they made a mistake in the order. My kids were excited that we finally made to Montreal so they can have their favorite dish *The Poutine Dish* and of course they couldn't eat it because it tasted very bad and the rest of the food wasn't that good too. I am going back to Canada very soon and will not go there again and I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came in here not expecting much as it didn't look very appealing from the outside...but I must tell you I was mistaken!  The waiter was very friendly and funny.   We ordered the two mixed grills...$50 each approx...for 6 of us  We started with a lentil soup and pitas that tasted fresh and refreshing...warmed us up on a cold montreal afternoon.  The mixed  platter came with an assorted variety of meats and rice/fries.   The meat was tender and juicy..and we had a lot of food left over.  Will definitely be back next trip to MTL :)."}
{"text":"The food is good and the servings are generous. The staff are quick, friendly and very accommodating. I have tried pretty much all the kebab and shawarma platters and they are always delicious. Always juicy never dry. The prices are great. I came with a group of four and we all are for under $100 including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Brought kubeh not completely fried - frozen on he inside...found out when we had a bite! We had to ask them to replace it... Otherwise not bad ! Intend to go again ! Tables can be cranny and service a bit slow!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurants in Montreal's West Island. I order from here weekly and the food is always consistently good. The staff are quite pleasant too.  If you're getting take out, I highly recommend the 'special plate', which gives you one brochette, rice, and your choice of soup or salad for $8, tax in."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve 1 star. I got food poisoning and so did everyone else from my group . Apart from that , it wasn't clean when we got there and super rushed . Super unorganized.  Horrible experience ."}
{"text":"Worst service ever for delivery. Took them 1 hour and 30 mins to deliver my food. By the time it got to my house, it was completely cold. Oh and this isn't the first time this happened, the previous time they messed up my order and they were super late. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"heard a lot about this place. it was a bit hyped by my wife. i got the half chicken and half beef platter. came with some rice. beef was pretty good. not particularly flavorful but pretty juicy. the chicken was a bit dry. not so great.   the waiter put some pita bread and butter on our table. we waited for plates but ofcourse we had to ask for that. then we had to ask for water another time. at this price point, do i really have to beg for everything? the waiter was nice, but a bit goofy. joke around with me only after you have provided stellar customer experience. no probs. also, there were dirty dishes on tables lying around. restaurant was empty, so why wasn't this picked up. not appetizing."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for supper at Chateau Kabab, West Island location, because it looked appealing  - but don't let the looks of the place fool you - we were not welcome in this restaurant - maybe because we spoke French or English or perhaps we were just women - I don't know. I felt like a second class citizen. We were ignored at the door waiting to be seated and had to call someone to finally seat us. The food took a very long time to get to our table and it was mediocre at best and scanty. The owners of this place should do a better job. I would not recommend this restaurant nor will I EVER eat there again. I have never been treated so badly, ever, at any restaurant that I have ever been to. The one star is there only because I wanted to say my two cents. I would not give this place any stars what so ever."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and can't believe I've never reviewed it. This is now my go to restaurant for Persian food after Tehran started cutting portions and raising prices. The food is great, the portions are large (never able to finish mine) and I like that your main meal includes your soup or salad and a tea, all for a reasonable price.   I highly recommend the chicken koobideh, it's super juicy and flavorful as well as the Mirza ghasemi appetizer (roasted eggplant dip).   The interior is nice and clean but could use a refresh. I've always had great service whenever I've gone and have even catered from here with my guests raving about the food."}
{"text":"The service is a bit shaky out here but the same old kebabs from the downtown joint was more than compensation enough. The Koobideh is the best!"}
{"text":"When you walk in the restaurant is beautiful. Full of rich colors. The service Is friendly and fast. Now the food. Everything was superb!!! I felt like someone's grandmother was in the back cooking. We ordered a plate for two. It's started with a lentil soup which has to be one of the best I have ever had. The meat platter was delicious. Each piece was tender and perfectly cooked. The rice was fragrant and appetizing as I don't like rice. The hummus was delicious. I have nothing bad to say except I wish this place was closer to home. Great food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best oriental restaurants in Montreal. The food always fresh and the service  excellent and friendly ."}
{"text":"Chateau kabab is our fav middle eastern restaurant, be it the downtown or west island location we are always satisfied. The variety (heavy or light plates) is definately there, the owners are very humble and grateful, they always go an extra mile to satisfy all your needs. Iranian and lebanese food under one roof makes it the best place for taking friends and family out for a dinner - we are positive that everybody will find a meal to their satisfaction! The complimentary tea is always fresh and tasty and keeps the conversation going on the table :) Highly highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and owner is absolutely fantastic. He treats his customers with respect and makes you feel extremely comfortable.  I have been to this restaurant several times, and was never disappointed. I highly recommend this resto to anyone who loves a taste of Persian food."}
{"text":"TLDR: Flavourful food that looks exactly as depicted on the menu.  My friends and I went at the awkward time between lunch and dinner on a Friday, so we had the entire place to ourselves.  The of us went to hungry but wanted to try the food, so we got the sharing menu for two. As we waited for our food some indulged in the pita, which oddly came paired with butter.  The appetisers came around with our two soft drinks. We received a crunchy and refreshing salad, delicious hummus with a generous dose of olive oil, and garlic sauce. Weirdly we only received one lentil soup, despite the meal being for two, but we didn't complain we went that hungry as previously mentioned. The soup was smooth and tasty, but a little on the salty side.  Our main course arrived with a bowl of fluffy saffron rice, crispy French fries (like the ones from Costco), and a good plate of meat. It consisted if a row of juicy chicken, tender shish kebab, spicy kebab, and regular kebab. It was topped with pickles, salty turnips, raw onion, and two roasted tomatoes. The deliciousness laid on two pitas which absorbed all the juices.   There was no point of taking pictures, as all the food looked like it jumped out of the menu. It was delicious but we couldn't finish it because it was so much food! We ended the meal with tea.  Overall it was a good experience. The service was ok, and the food was yummy."}
{"text":"I love to review this place ' i always know its a 5 star restaurant before i even enter it ... I have visited the downtown and west island locations so many time in my life and not one time have i felt that the food or the service lacked any type of love ' we had a mix grill plate for 2 ! I honestly recommend this for 3 people its allot of food ! Allot of quality food, the meat are always tender and moist .. The fries are always hot and crispy the rice is always hot and silky :)! This time we ordered for the first time a mix mezza plate as appetizer ! Definately worth it .. The plate comes with 2 kibbeh, 4 mozzarella sticks and 2 mini samosas with patatoe filling ... The mozarella stick are to die for ! So tasty ! Again all fresh !  For catering or a date, or a party or a quick dinner ... You will get the value for your money !"}
{"text":"Peu de monde et une grande attente avant qu'un serveur vienne prendre la commande. Dans le restaurant,  il ne fait pas très chaud. Le seul serveur présent est gentil et cordial.  Les plats sont bons, cependant les plats chauds ne le sont pas assez.  Attention. Le restaurant applique d'office et de façon obligatoire 15% de taxes.   Expérience mitigée."}
{"text":"Love it here. The people are so nice, and the food is delish. Best hummus in town. They do fantastic family style platters, or you can have shawarma in a pita with fries for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Still the same great Quality service!  My favourite place in Montreal West island for groups, family gatherings, and casual dining.  They serve Lebanese, Iraqi, and Persian food. They have both shawarma and skewers from the three cuisines, in addition to meza (appetizers), soups, and deserts (baklawa) and free tea served with the meals.  The kabab koobideh plate comes with two meat skewers and fluffy basmati rice and a salad or soup.  There are different family plates that you can choose from depending on the number of people that include various skewers of meat, filet mignon, chicken. It also includes salad or soup, basmati rice, and beverages.  They also serve burgers, poutine, and homestyle plates.  All food served is Halal. No pork on the menu."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, this place doesn't look that amazing from the outside.  It's in the commercial/industrial area of sources.  But, when you walk in, it looks pretty fancy shmancy!  We were in town so we stopped in for lunch.  There was not much action around 1pm.  Which is too bad because if this place was in Chicago, I'd go once a week.  Hard to find good Mediterranean food over there.  But I digress. The one benefit to having nobody around was we didn't bother anyone.  Well by we I mean my 18 month old daughter.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  Since we were the only ones in, she stopped by a few times and played peekaboo with my daughter.  They didn't have milk but she did offer to get us some from the coffee milk.  That was nice but we declined.   They have a huge menu.  They have the combinations that are good for larger groups.  They had the whole chickens.  They had kebabs.  Ground meat kebabs.  Pita sandwiches.  And the prices were pretty reasonable.  I think the sandwich itself was about $4 which in my opinion is pretty cheap for Montreal.  The food was delicious.  I had some lentil soup.  And chicken legs.  With some rice. Also had some falafel and hummus and various veggies like pickles and pickled turnips.  Some salad was served with my wife's chicken shwarma.  All in all we were stuffed, and took some food home.  I will definitely come back the next time I am in town."}
