{"text":"I had to submit a review to this local Parma bar with great wings since none existed here yet.  I lived right behind this place for 3 years, and their Parmesan wings were some of the best Ive ever had.  Meaty, covered in cheese, and cheap - what more can you want?  

The waiters/bartendresses are always nice and cheerful, and the food comes out pretty quick.  Drinks are cheap, and their daily specials like heaping tray of Muscles over marinara are well worth it.  

Bar-wise - the venue is large enough for a huge group, since it has a basement and a billiard room as well.  Pool tables are well kept, and the place is clean as you would expect from a local watering hole."}
{"text":"For being a hole in the wall bar.. this place serves pretty good bar food! I've had their steaks before and they are a little on the dryer side but their wings!!!! Their wings are to die for!!! I don't know what they put in their seasoning but it's so delicious I cant stop eating the wings!! Have you ever over ate so much you start to feel uncomfortable because your stomach expanded so much you felt like you were going to pop... yup that's what their wings do to me... guilty..  They have specials every day so be sure to look at the sign to see what it is.  They have a decent selection on beer and liquor... but I usually come here to watch Cleveland sports.  They have TVs all around the bar so you're able to see the game in every angle.  The only reason why I bumped it down a star is because the women's bathroom is in the basement and no one is usually down there unless they are playing billiards which gives me goosebumps with how quiet it can get down there. Also the bathrooms are not always the cleanest.  So if you're looking to come up for a drink, definitely get the wings to accompany it!"}
