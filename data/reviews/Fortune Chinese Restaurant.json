{"text":"This restaurant is in the Asian part of Las Vegas, just a few minutes from the strip. From the outside, it appears to be a run-of-the- mill Chinese restaurant in a strip shopping center. The ambience is basic, but the food and the service is top notch. Although there are many dishes familiar to American Chinese restaurant patrons, they are prepared in an authentic, Chinese style. There are also numerous Chinese  dishes that are not available in most Chinese restaurants. My favorite is dungenss crab with farlic and pepper.

Everything is brought to the table and set on a revolving tray so everyone can dig in and eat. Among the dishes we shared was mandarin pork chop, by far the best I have ever eaten. The servers  are constantly at your table attending to every need. Prices are reasonable. If you want real Chinese food, go a bit out of the way and eat at fortune chinese restaurant. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered food to be delivered. The delivery driver called and just angrily yelled my address at me.  Every time I tried to get him to clarify he just yelled it louder, then told me he was trying to find me to deliver my \"furniture\".  I had another call on my business line and asked him to hold, and he just hung up on me.

I called the restaurant to tell them (and to make sure I would still get my food) and they didn't apologize.

20 minutes later, I got my order from a delivery driver that didn't speak a word.  I ordered one entree and two sides, got two entrees and neither were the correct one.

I decided against calling to complain again and ate one anyway.  I was going to leave a 3 star review because at least it was delicious but within an hour my stomach was very upset and it's been upset for two hours..  I just threw all the leftovers in the trash.

Not ordering from here again.  Beware."}
{"text":"Lets say, there salt and sugar usage must be high because oh boy they used a lot, in every single dish they had made... Lol If you have high blood pressure or diabetes.... beware ! LOL 

By recommendation by my mom's coworker, this is the first time I had been to this restaurant since it was sold to a new owner from the previous original owners of Diamond China. 

Mild renovations including moving the cashier's area to the back corner and adding a wall to possibly a private room? Chairs, tables, carpet, d√©cor, paint are all the same from previous owner with exception they may have changed the light bulbs (lol)...

Waiter speaks mandarin and waitress speaks Cantonese... everytime we used the wrong language to start LOL 

We had a party of 7 people. Ordered a special lobster with e-mein, steamed chicken, miced garlic with snow pea leaves, preserved vegetable with large pig intestine, lamb strew & dry tofu hot pot, pork chop with mandarin sauce (is that really what its called... lol), 

As mentioned before, overlying consistency is over salty/sweet. 

the house soup was a bitter melon with pork neck bone and some other ingredient soup. Overall it tasted fine. Done well except for the fact it was salty. 

The special lobster was really small. Barely enough pieces for even the party to have 1 piece each. The noodles were severely overcooked and didn't seem like real e-mein. Very wide and thick. Salty overpowering sauce

Minced garlic with snow pea leaves didn't seem it was picked that well. Some pieces seemed a bit \"old\" and hard to eat. One of the not so salty items

Pork chop with mandarin sauce was overly sweet. Otherwise fried well. 

Lamb stew & dry tofu was smaller than normal in size, with minimal iceberg lettuce. Salty sauce.

Preserved vegetable with large pig intestine.. Typically not much flavor in sauce is needed because the preserved vegetable is sour itself, if anything, its to add a little flavor to the pig intestine. Was salty as well.. 

Steamed chicken was good. Because its a plain steamed free-range chicken with a side of ginger/green onion sauce on the side. Lol Luckily they didn't put too much salt in the sauce. 

Not saying this as a racist remark but considering the demographics of the area and probably the greater majority of the people who dine here, they tend to want their food more salty/sweet. Quite the few people like to use a good amount of soy sauce for even plain white rice. For an Asian, as mentioned previously, oh man things were salty/sweet.

Definitely better places in town for Chinese. This is not one of them. Previous owners of the restaurant did much better. Its like night and day on how much its changed (in terms of food)"}
{"text":"Did this as a delivery. Was told would come in 45-60 minutes. Actually arrived 80 minutes later. Food was cold, as you would think. We ordered 3 different entree meals plus a soup and received an order of 4 potstickers for free. Okay. To accompany this was one small serving of rice (for all 3 people to share). One of the entrees was Moo Shu Pork. This often comes with 4 \"pancakes\" therefore we always ask for 4 additional ones (from every single restaurant we order this entree from). Doing this we realize there would be an additional fee. This usually amounts to a quarter for each additional pancake so an extra $1.00. For this restaurant they charged an extra dollar for each one so $4.00 total. Then to add insult to injury the portion is so small you barely needed the original 4 (and again- ice cold). 
Needless to say there are many places and choices of food venues to order from in Vegas. We will NOT be patronizing them again. For what was paid out- food was late, cold, and small portion. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I was a bit apprehensive about coming here because of the remodel and new management, but since my wife wanted to give it a try I finally agreed. It took a little time to figure out what was new on the menu and what was just a new name for an old item. Once that got straighten out and all members of our party ordered, things went smoothly. The staff was friendly, though we worked through a bit of the language barrier. The food was delicious, such as the pan fried noodles. We ordered it with extra sauce which is three dollars extra. The price on most of the dishes increased by two dollars from when this place used to be Diamond China Restaurant. Before the renovation and new management, we had gone to this particular Chinese restaurant since 1988, so we were are very familiar with the old restaurant and used it as a measure for this review. So my opinion is that some things have changed for the better and some for the worst, but overall it's still a good restaurant. I'm looking forward to trying out their dim sum or as we like to call it back home, manapua, which they say will be made fresh to order starting this Friday."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was skeptical when they served our soft drinks in a can instead of a fountain drink and then no soup well I was sure it would be a disappointment but well then the entrees came and proved me wrong.  My S&S pork was great even the bell pepper was eaten, my daughters Chow Mein was great the best we have had here in Las Vegas in over 3 years.  My wife thought the pan fried noodles would be the big ones like we are used to but oh well now we know.  The only reason this is not a 5 is the soup."}
{"text":"Food was very average, spring roll was still frozen inside, dumpling looked like someone step on it, flat  and no taste, previous owner Diamond china was far more superior. Service was average, nothing spectacular to warrant 18% gratuity. This is not a good suggestion for the owner, I guarantee they would be out of business in next 12 months. The place had one other customer, that should have given us a hint before we sat down. I would not recommend this place. Food express on Decatur and Sahara is also very bad since the new owner took over.Both businesses with old owner was excellent. They were in business for over 25 years."}
{"text":"We ate here last night for dinner. I have eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants in town out of town and out of the country. This was the best Chinese food I have had yet. My husband had the chow fun without sauce and it was amazing. I ate the lobsters with green onion and ginger. It was cooked perfectly, sauce was excellent and just the right amount. The service was fantastic. I am defiantly going back. Best Chinese restaurant in town hands down. If this is the food you want this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Should have known this wasn't the place to order from. Called before ordering from Grub hub to ask how many fried oysters came to an order...10 for those who are curious. Made the order to be delivered. They called 10 minutes later saying they are out of oysters. After I threw a fit over the fact that I had just called, and they said nothing about being out of them, then they came back saying they had one more order of them. When the meal came, it was mediocre at best. I've had better tasting Chinese food in my small home town. This is Vegas...step it up or get out!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times before and I've never had bad service or some of the food problems some people have spoken of. Granted I've always eaten in so I can't speak to any delivery issues. Tonight was the first time I came back when they had the Dim Sum on menu. Not sure if it is only supposed to be 11-3pm because they went ahead and made it for us regardless. The shrimp har gow was delish as was the steam dumplings, and the calamari was fantastic. Actually the hot n sour soup, which I always order, was prolly the best I've ever had here, the entrees were great too. We had a beef dish and a chicken dish and it was all incredible. Not sure if the kitchen staff changed but I have to admit it was the best dining experience I've ever had here and I've probably eaten here 20+ times. I would definitely recommend it if you are in the area. Don't mind that it is usually empty,  that means your food will be fresh and quick!"}
{"text":"FINALLY a place that doesn't put the little onion guys in fried rice. Ordered with grub hub and I'm happy I did! I'll definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered through grubhub and it took nearly 30 minutes after the estimated time to deliver. And it never got delivered because they couldn't find the address. Even though I had called, texted and even sent current location to the drivers iPhone."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. If I can give ZERO star I would!  We ordered 5 dishes and it took 45 mins for the food to be done. The food was cold and it tastes bad!!!

Honey Walnut Shrimp - for a $12 dish, the shrimp is like a nugget size. It came in a small box with 8 small shrimp and with lots of lettuce. They put the honey/mayo sauce on the side. So you're basically like dipping the shrimp in a mayo with no taste at all! Panda Express Honey walnut shrimp tastes so much better. 

Deep Fried Squid with Salt and Pepper was the worst one we've had. The squid are all tails and just full of cornstarch. 

Orange Chicken taste like straight from the freezer. It's soo hard and they basically gave you a ketchup tasting sauce to pour into the chicken.

This restaurant was used to be called Diamond China. They have better chef and selection of dishes. This restaurant should close. Don't ever eat here."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. I was going to have Thai food for lunch in this same strip center and noticed the grand opening sign. Ater looking inside and seeing a good amount of patrons - we decided to eat here instead.

Ordered several orders of dim sum on the request form and was going to order lobster but unfortunately they were out and had not received their shipment that day. Ended up ordering the live fresh fish that was amazingly good. I was pleased with the taste and quality of the dim sum which they just added recently. I usually avoid in Las Vegas since I really haven't had much luck finding a decent place - that is until now. The Asian waitress was on the quiet side but the manager here was friendly helpful.

I would surely return here again in the future."}
{"text":"Ordering was easy, but a better menu with descriptions would be even better.  They have a lot of items!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here. It used to be Diamond China and changed ownership a while ago. I was in the mood for beef stew hot pot (what I only know as ngow nam) and couldn't get through to Diamond China. I was driving by and saw the new name, Fortune. I stopped in to see if they made it and they do. Their order size is smaller and price is higher. The food was still delicious and I will be back, but not often. I didn't get a friendly feeling from the staff. Perhaps because I'm an ABC?"}
{"text":"The lady that took our order sat on the phone for 10 minutes talking while our food got cold along with some near by patrons food as well. Horrible service. The only thing hot was the white rice."}
{"text":"Abalone's on special now ;) yehhhh. Unfortunately I have to have dinner by my own tonight.......    It was perfectly made with reasonable price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We always enjoyed the great food there. We ordered  the crispy skin fried chicken and it was delicious. The shrimp walnut is very light and the shrimp very fresh. The wait staff are friendly. Amy is the best waitress,  we will definitely return and tell out friends to go there,  we live not far at  the Turnberry Place , we have a group of friends there that  go to eat out a lot...."}
{"text":"Excellent little place!!! Staff are well mannered and helpful. Nice atmosphere. Huge menu and great tasting food. Me and my family have been here a few times and we're always impressed."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've been here since the new owners have taken the helm.  We've been coming here since 1990 and was disappointed when this restaurant changed hands twice in as many years. 

So let me cut to the chase: we'll be back. 

We ordered the Wor Won Ton Soup to begin.  The chicken rich broth was good but I think the chef added soy sauce to the broth. The result was a darker broth (rather than a nearly clear broth) that was a tad salty.  The vegetables,  shrimp, fish, broccoli,  carrots and won tons were cooked perfectly.  The won tons were good and the small piece of shrimp in each one saved the flavor.  I think the Pork inside could have had a touch more flavor. Overall,  I would order this soup again.

My wife ordered the half duck.  It was cooked to perfection and delicious. I ordered the Shrimp chow mein.  The noodles were cooked the way I remember as a boy growing up in San Francisco. We shared Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce.....again, very good. Finally, I ordered the Pork Egg Foo Young.  I know this is peasant food, but I like it!  The 4 generous patties were covered with succulent pieces of BBQ pork and smothered in a tasty gravey. ....delicious.

The portions were all large so you'll find value for your hard earned dollar.  Service was outstanding and the waiter was able to explain all the dishes clearly.

The only thing that keeps me from rating Fortune a 5 star restaurant is consistency.  If the consistency is there when I come back in a few weeks, I'll change the 4 star to a 5 star."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Chinese food in the whole valley. Be sure to try their hot and sour soup, and some of their great seafood dishes. Very low key but classy place, bring some friends!"}
{"text":"Had dinner twice after their great lunch special.  Each time, we ordered 8 different dishes for 5 if us.  All selections were delicious !  We tried the Hot and Sour soup one day and the Seafood and Chicken rice soup the next.  Both were great.  The Salt and Pepper and Beijing Pork Chops were outstanding!  The Tender Beef was really tender.  The Ma Po Tofu was spicy and good.  All the vegetables were great.  And on and on, you can't go wrong."}
