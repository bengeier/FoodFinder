{"text":"I had the chicken chimichanga burrito it was tasty and flavorful.  The beans and rice are pretty good not a lot of seasoning but simple and not bland either.  My husband had the chili relleno burrito which was flavorful and delicious.  The chips werr ok and the salsas were fresh but a little on the bland side."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   Two carne asada tacos with Pico and guac. Sounded good but meat was cold and flavorless.  Pico and guac were flavorless."}

{"text":"I went there because of the reviews and I have to say I am totally disappointed I asked the guy behind the counter what the special is or what he recommends and he said Mexican food he was no help in selecting my dinner. The chicken enchiladas the sauce tasted like chicken gravy the rice  was like Uncle Bens  box rice  and the fajitas were as bland as his advice."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer here. Recently, I stopped in for lunch. The only employee present was the cook. She was chatting with a friend at the counter. She ignored me for five minutes before taking my order. Since she made me feel like a nuisance, I will be taking my business where it will be appreciated. Que lastima...adios."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. The fire department loves it that's always a good sign!"}
{"text":"Been to Don Jos√© 10 times.  Super good food.  Love their beans, chimichanga and chips.  On orders to go call and food is ready in 7 minutes. Great prices.  Not a fancy place so I'd order to go if you can."}
{"text":"I eat a lot, I mean A LOT, of Mexican food. Don Jose's would be my only choice if I lived/worked closer. So amazing! The green salsa is the best ever!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing Mexican food! Jose is very nice and always smiling and ready to help you! If your looking for excellent food, service, and a all around good place to eat this is the place you want!!! Family owned and operated. Tell them Chris from Peoria Kia sent you! You won't regret it!!"}

{"text":"I am a gringo so I usually have a problem with Mexican food. But Don Jose's is perfection. I usually have the Carne Asada  and it is delicious every time. The fish tacos are huge! The wait is minimal and the staff is friendly. When I crave Mexican food I go to Don Jose's. Some day I might have the guts to order #20"}
{"text":"Really great food for an even greater price! Food came out quick and was delicious!! Cute restaurant that's as authentic as it gets :) manager was super friendly as well! He had a ghost chili/Trinidad scorpion pepper extract that was a sort of challenge, and one toothpick tip dipped in it had me in intense pain but I won a bet with my friends! Was pretty neat and do the challenge at your own discretion :) definitely gonna come back again! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Love Don Jose's!  I eat here as often as I can when in town visiting my mother.  Love the breakfasts!!  But everything is top notch.  Great salsa bar!"}

{"text":"Delicious, authentic, friendly. Love this place. Will definitely be back. Had the steak rancheros. Flavorful. Love the pickled carrots and peppers at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Not much for decor, but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican meals I've had in the Valley. Really flavorful rice and beans and enchiladas. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Five stars for the delicious food.  Less for the interior but we don't really care about that when we are enjoying our food so much.  Their flour tortillas are the best ever (and I've made my own tho not as tasty as these),  We had tacos, tostadas, beans, and enchiladas and all were very good.  Don Jose's is one of the best values with great flavors.  Kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. The only thing I don't like about this place is every time I order (I order the same thing every time) the price is always different...I don't think I've paid the same price more than once! The food is great though which is why I keep coming back but definitely peeved when he gives me the total"}

Been going here for years and always stop on the way back from

Combo specials and great homemade salsa's

{"text":"BAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


This place does not deserve a review.  But seems how someone reported me and had my original barf review removed here goes.

The inside is tacky.  There are ads on the tables, a dirty fish tank in the corner, and junk all over the walls.

I ordered adovada and my wife ordered a taco and enchilada.  The adovada came with two huge tortillas that were pasty and gross.  The adovada had a decent flavor but was not fresh, reheated, and stale.  The beans were runny and not worthy of consumption and the rice was plain as day.  All three of the salsas were disgusting.  The chips were stale and tasted like old cooking oil.

My wife said her food was disgusting and asked why would anyone serve this to another person.  She also said yelp did us dirty again with the four star reviews average.  Looks like a lot of them are fake to me.  But yelp has no way to properly filter them out of their system.  

My wife also asked why have three salsas if none of them are any good.  I said zero salsas are better than 3 horrible ones.  I don't know what is going on in sun city.  We were only out here on business and this place came up on her phone, but this is maybe one of the worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life and I have had a LOT of bad ones.  Even the horchata was disgusting and it came out of a machine!  

This place should be shut down and Don Jose should get into another line of work.  No idea how this place is in business.  It is pure taste bud and intestinal torture.  He should serve this slop at GITMO and would get more info out of the terrorists than waterboarding ever could.

Something tells me this glowing review won't make ROTD but it's how I feel after regretfully eating here.

BAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I visited Don Jose's, the food was actually pretty good!  My order was the carne asada plate, that and a bottle of Diet Coke was just over nine bucks, a little pricy I thought, but I grabbed some of their salsas and sat down.  My order arrived quickly and the portions were big, I left STUFFED and I couldn't even finish everything.  The beans were a little looser than I would have preferred but tasty nonetheless.  The carne asada was well seasoned, chopped up into chunks with no mystery gristly fat pieces.  Came with a good scoop of guacamole, rice, beans, and a steamin' bundle of tortillas.  My only gripe is that they don't give you chips to go with the salsas-you have to buy a bag.
I enjoyed everything and would certainly return when I'm in the land of the blue hairs :)"}
{"text":"When shopping at Sun Vally Quilts we often stop at Don Jose. The restaurant is a part of a rather dismal strip mall and the inside of this place is pretty much what you would expect. 

But it is inexpensive with decent food and a lot of it. 

The guy taking orders is very nice and concerned for his customers. He deals with the older crowd from Sun City very well. Helpful does not say enough.

It is too bad they can not control the other customers conversations as we had the luck to overhear about eight bovine brained men making fun of the now married gay folks in California and the current situation."}
{"text":"After five visits, we are convinced that Don Jose's has the best value in Mexican food in the Sun City area.  Today we enjoyed a taco salad with pork, cheese & onion enchiladas, and rice. All were hot, delicious, and with ample portions. Free salsa bar with good selection of seasonings. 
Wide selection of regular and adult beverages. 
The owner is usually present to ensure quality food and service. 
We'll continue to come back. 
Sincerely,
Karen & Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ"}
{"text":"Our go-to Mexican food spot. By far the best beans I've ever had, we get them to go sometimes because they are just that good. Everything we've tried has been wonderful and their pricing is great. The owners are always super friendly also."}
{"text":"Only been once. Got a Carnitas Burrito. It was quite good, but also quite expensive for the size. For the size, it realistically should have cost half of the $6 they charge, maybe $4. Good food of what I tasted, just need bigger portions or a price reduction."}
{"text":"First time coming to Don Jose's.  I've been looking for another good homemade mexican restaurant to go to, but there are a few things I was looking for.  BEANS...is one of them.  They were soooo Good!!! Kinda like the one's Nana used to make.  I cant wait to go back to try the menudo, chorizo, machaca breakfast, sopes and tortas."}
{"text":"Who goes to a Mexican food place, asks for a carry out and then gets NO salsa in their order? I'll leave this one star here until I go the next time and I get salsa with my order. Grrr"}
{"text":"Delicioso! Fast and friendly service at a family restaurant. Fresh. Most of the food is cooked from scratch when you order.  Standard decor, but the food is tasty, and excellent. Nicely spicy, but if you want flame-thrower hot, Don Jose's is probably not for you.  Try one of the combination plates.  Don Jose's is the real deal, and it will probably become among your favorites, as it is mine. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Non chain real Mexican food in Sun City? Wait, what? 
Is this fancy pants? No.
Is this blow your mind creativity/complex flavors? No.
Is this a place that puts decor/ambiance above the customer service and food? No

What this place does have is:
Good quality home made food.
An owner who not only cares about his customers but works with what they are in the mood for.
Has daily specials.
Has a fast turn around.
Has a salsa bar.

Is a family run, family feel good food in a crappy location. Prices are more than reasonable. Know that your busy time will be lunch hour and then the 4:30-6:00pm Sun City dinner dining timeframe. 

Say hi to Jose'. He's the real deal."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite Mexican restaurant. Are you still always go to Caramba is but try Don Joses after reading the reviews. Nothing like supporting small businesses! The food was fresh and warm and tasted spectacular."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant out here.  The food is excellent, the service is quick and they don't put tomatoes in their guacamole which is great for me because I have a tomato allergy.  It is a family owned business and they are really great people.  I eat here at least once or twice a week."}
{"text":"This place needs some yelp love! I think they get jipped cause none of these old folks in Sun City use smart phones. Definitely a top Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Great food, good salsa and cheap."}
{"text":"Took off a star for using styrofoam and plastic. Authentic Mexican soda and food. Salsa bar is free, up charge for chips. This is a good, inexpensive  place to stop if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The owner is very friendly and the green sauce is the best I have ever had. We have had a few items and they have all been delicious. The tamales are top notch and the burritos are filling without being overly large. Everything is fresh and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"If you find yourself near Sun City and craving some solid Mexican food this the place. Great customer service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went into this restaurant with some good expectations. Unfortunately the food find not come close. I ordered the combo plate tostada, taco and taquitos. Definitely nothing special. I also got the chile relleno which I was very disappointed. The flavor was lacking, very blan and basic. The only thing worse was the flan. No flavor at all. Not up to my Southern California standards. The prices were rather high for the quality of food. I also am not a fan of styrofoam plates and plastic forks when in a brick and mortar establishment."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Truly a diamond in the rough. If you are in the lower Surprise/Sun City area and have a hankering for great Mexican food, you NEED to stop by. Try the shrimp and steak burrito (I think it's called Tierra y Mar). You will not regret coming here. The rice and beans are some of the best I've ever had as well and the owner is SO pleasant."}
{"text":"Food was perfect can't say enough about the service. Dealt directly with owner . Great people."}
{"text":"This place would have 5 stars from me if it weren't for the tacky interior design.  I can't do half stars so this place will get my 4...  

I was visiting my father-in-law over the weekend for his birthday.  We stopped by Don Jose's before starting our day.  I was recommended the chorizo and the chile relleno burritos.  The chile relleno sounded really good, and was going to go with that until I saw the lengua burritos.  I LOVE lengua.  Could not pass up the opportunity so I went with the lengua burrito (which defaultly *is this a word?*) comes with onions and cilantro.

I ordered the lengua burrito with sour cream and guacmole in it.  It was SOOOO DELICIOUS.  I'm salivating right now thinking about how good this burrito was.  The burrito was a pretty nice size.  Bigger than a 1/2 lb burrito from Taco Bell, but smaller than ones at Chipotle.  The flavor.  The texture.  The combination....  It was heavenly, and filling.  The lengua was cooked perfectly.

The service here at Don Jose's was very attentive.  I believe the owners is the man himself and his wife.  They have about 4 sauce selections to choose from.  There was a dark red, a regular tomato/pico de gallo salsa, green salsa, and I forgot what else.  I loved all of them but I'm a huge fan of the green.  The burrito could go without the sauce, but I'm a well known sauce bandit so it was pretty saucey.

With the order, we ordered a California Burrito, Chorizo Burrito, 2 Ham and Egg Breakfast Burrito, and a Sausage and Egg Breakfast Burrito.  I took a bite out of the Chorizo Burrito, it was pretty good.  Greasy like how a chorizo really is, but the burrito packs a (heavy) flavor punch.

When I come back to Arizona to visit again, I will definitely have to make a stop to Don Jose's.  Not sure if I will go with a new burrito though.... Lengua has been on my mind since then."}
{"text":"Great Place! The owner is super friendly and the food is always fresh! Try their chorizo!"}
{"text":"This Mexican food restaurant is a gem!  My cousin that lives near us recommended it to us years ago, why we did try it until recently is beyond me because we were missing out!  The food is cooked to order.  My husband loves having their breakfast burrito for dinner.  I enjoy the quaint dinning area and how the owner remembers not only our order, but who we are and some little facts about us.  We will be customers for life!"}
{"text":"Very nice little family owned. place.  A few items I have issue with.  The guacamole needs some real intervention, (Green goop that looks nothing like avacodo) and not a fan of the stale pre-bagged chips.  However, the things that are great make up for it.  The shrimp tacos and enchilada are FANTASTIC!  I would eat those everyday.   Also love the burros and beans. 
And.... IF you want HOT! this guy has it.  I dare you to take a toothpick dab of his insane hot sauce.  You will be in tears for an hour.  I think there is potential for some serious food challenge here.  Not sure even Man Vs Food would win this one.  ;-)
Check it out, it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I love to support small game places. Very friendly owners and make you feel so welcome. Fast food service and always delicious!!!  The breakfast burritos are  excellent and my fiance loves the chorizo burrito.....Highly recommend and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Don Jose's is a small restaurant but you feel welcomed the minute you hit the door. I had 3 rolled tacos with rice and beans. My thoughts was the food was good but very bland. So first time Mexican food diners would love it, and probably because the location is in Sun City the bland is in demand. The next time I will order something more authentic."}
{"text":"Real deal Mexican, check what you think at the door and enjoy the heart of all great Mexican dishes is the love put into the food and my friends let me tell you I will drive from Mesa too Don Jose's and back get the #17 w/corn tortillas. Then get back in the car and drive all the way back it is that freaking amaxing.....OH and just so you know this is like all great Mexican take a ways you have too get your own damn salsa, so don't be a jerk and leave a one star rating because your not wise enough to get your own. . But with all seriousness best no frills serious great Mexican homemade food, oh and try the tortillas when warm and chewy with the refried and rice some of that steak shrimp and o ions in that sauce... Oh wait I have more in front of me bye. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for a order at the counter type of place. I have eaten here several times, many different things from the menu, and never disappointed.  Servings are ample.  The owner is always there, taking your order with a smile.  Special mention are the beef tacos, and the Green Chile patter"}
{"text":"Very Americanized Filibertos level Mexican food. Everything is absolutely drowning in cheese to hide the rather bland flavors. Prices were average for cheap Mexican food. The salsa was terrible: tasted like tomato sauce poured directly from the can and mixed with way too much oregano, absolutely bizarre. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I tried here, as I'm always looking for a great Mexican food restaurant. On a scale of 1-10, I would give them a 7, our group had chicken tacos, and a steak burrito, all was fresh and homemade, and the salsa bar is a nice touch for different kinds of sauce. 
Owner works the front, and the wife does the cooking, just ask him, he's a little overbearing, but a nice man and just wants to please. I will go there again, as I still haven't found my 9-10 place in west valley yet, and the 7 will do. 
Has seating inside, and parking is plentiful, 
But you can get it to go also.
They are so much better than the fast food places, give them a try, my 7 might be your 9."}
