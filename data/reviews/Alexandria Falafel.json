{"text":"It is sad how oblivious some restaurant owners are to how bad their establishment is. This is a perfect example.  1. It smalls like an old dank basement in the place. 2. The food is more expensive than most Shawarma places.  3. The Shawarma platter is very limited, does not include bread. 4. The guy serving it has to be one of the slowest guys on the planet and does not complete your order before starting to help someone else. The logic escapes me completely.    I am writing this review because It is not worth even trying this place.   DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh-made falafel, in my experience. Better than Ali Baba's and light years better than Pita Hut's premade falafel pucks."}
{"text":"Average middle eastern food joint, great for catching a quick bite after bar hopping in Parkdale. Greasy food, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such low reviews, they make delicious food into the wee hours of the nice and the portions are beyond generous. Sometimes there's a wait, and the customer service is on par with other fast food joints. The chicken shawarma plate is my go to at the end of the night and when I don't feel like cooking, and it feeds two!"}
{"text":"woah woah..so in full disclosure, this is one of my local haunts for shameless late night eating, and bachelor hood cook-free evenings.  I can't idly sit by and read these reviews, contorting the local charms into negative 'misses' by the restaurant.   1) the staff is awesome.  super friendly, and avid FC fans.  From the smaller bald guy, to the bigger jovial guy to the average nondescript character, they are all engaging without trying too hard. 2) there are free newspapers while you wait (current, and with a broad selection). 3) The price is $4 for a Shawarma, and is a meal unto itself (and tasty) 4) the sign shamelessly evokes 1992 sentiments from The Beer Store..goodwill out of the gates."}
{"text":"We were going to have a shish taouk, but the kebab photo on the menu looked good and better than the chicken on the spit. The meat looked a little like a pressed sausage tube, more than a ground tube patty we thought it might be (like a lula-kebab or something). Anyway, this was placed on the grill, sliced up, flipped and fried - with onions! - and the pita was prepped with all the usual stuff, hot sauce, garlic mayo, iceberg, tomatoes, pink pickled turnips. Once wrapped, our host pita artist gave them a light press to heat the outside and bagged our lunch to go. Two pita kebabs for just under $14. We took these to the skating park just next to the Duff-Queen underpass and dug in.  These were terrific sandwiches. The meat was more like gyro meat, and it was tasty and plentiful, lacing the sammie from end to end. The sauces were generous and spicy, and evenly doused from top down - so the pita was properly messy, testing the heft of the wrapping paper once you got down to the bottom, and sending some drips to the ground. Pita construction was great, lettuce was fresh and tomatoes were red, not pale pink, green or yellow. Nice, unassuming place with yummy grub."}
{"text":"My favorite schwarma in the area. Good price and you get a pretty fair size wrap with lot's of topping."}
{"text":"run, don't walk to eat this falafel/wrap/whatever -  hint; have the fish plate 'basa' -  i have the fish each time i come - 10.50$ for fish and fixins..... just great !   no other shawarma place i know that  serves fish-    freshly squeezed mango juice is a treat too !       lots of family members"}
{"text":"i am on a quest downtown right now, for a good falafel place.  i believe that, likely, if there's good shawarma, therell be good falafel, so i change it up...maybe i already expect the worst and just dread tasting a dry falafel...so i ordered shawarma here.  The most exciting thing about this place is the colour of the sign.  They seem to have lots of space, where they might put a few more tables and such but it remains pretty barren.  Perhaps it was a doctors office before.  Everything is white.    The food seems to lie somewhere in between fresh to slightly encrusted with the breath of a dreary days work in this eastern part of parkdale.  I had a shawarma on a suede pita, and the meat was mildly spiced with flavour but not juicy in the least.  All the juiciness had to do with the bombardment of sauces and condiments i had him tackle on to the beef itself.    it was passable.  thats it.  no more no less.  their dolmados (grape leaves with rice in side) were better in that they were firm, slippery with oil and a little tart."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try out Alexandria after a good three weeks of craving falafel. It's crazy that I went that long without giving in, but then I saw a young man walking by with a falafel wrap he clearly got from Alexandria and I knew I would have falafel that very night. This is a much better joint than the place at queen/gladstone. The toppings were incredibly fresh and delicious, and the service was friendly. My only qualm was with the falafel itself, which perhaps was not the freshest, especially in comparison to the other ingredients. However, it was still overall quite awesome. My friend had the chicken shawarma plate and damn it looked good. She loved it and almost ate all of it even though she's a tiny little thing. I will definitely go here again for a falafel, but the reason I'm not giving it higher stars is the place itself is rather divey."}
{"text":"I actually liked this place. I was really exhausted this evening and it dawned on me that I hadn't yet had dinner. \"Self,\" I said, \"you need deep-fried chickpea balls in you, STAT!\" And then I was like, \"wow, self, you should really think before speak... to yourself... because that sounded kinda dirty.\" Then I was like \"Hey, hey self? Why am I talking to you?\" And before I could reassure myself it was totally fine because I was in Parkdale, I found myself standing in front of Alexandria.  I was pleased. Fresh vegetables, bland but not-too-dry falafel, decent pita, done quick and with a smile. There was also a beautiful black woman speaking french flirtaciously with the young bald guy, which I enjoyed watching and listening to. An overall pleasant and satisfying bite for $4!"}
{"text":"tried it it's not authentic prices cheap for cheap food the falafel has way too much garlic inside the mixture the shawarma chicken shawarma good flavor not fresh in my opinion this is the worst shawarma Falafel joint I've ever been to and I eat a lot of shawarma"}
{"text":"Come on, 9 bucks for a huge plate of shawarma. This is one of the best shawarma joints in the hood and to top it off the owner is super nice! If you're lucky, sometimes he adds a slice of roasted eggplant which can really take your meal to the next level. Highly recommend the garlic sauce too."}
{"text":"To be honest I'm surprised to see such low reviews. We love this place. The shawarma is always fresh and really tasty and the portions are huge. We always make a trip out of the way to eat here even though we live literally beside another local shawarma place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and was encouraged by the fact that there were about a dozen people there. Had the chicken schwarma with no onions. Hot sauce was great, very fresh through and through. I will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Not very clean, customer service was sub par. My friend ordered a chicken wrap and had to wait forever for it. They had a huge line up and not enough people to service all those people. His order was forgotten and they didn't really do anything about it. Then they started messing up everyone's order. It was a big hot mess. Wouldnt recommend. But if you are drunk and need something and don't care then I guess this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"A very average schwarma and falafel place.  There is absolutely nothing I can say about why you should go to this place except for if you are really in the mood for schwarma and you walk past it then go for it.  It is pretty much the only reason I have ever gone.  Prices are standard, food is standard.  I would not recommend eating in here as it is pretty grimy inside.."}
{"text":"Last night I ordered a mixed gyro/shawarma plate with a bottle of pop. Ended up being charged $17.22 for it. The menu said $1.49 for pop and $11.99 for a plate combo ($1.49+$11.99) * 13%HST = $15.23  Got ripped off by $2. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is the nearest falafel and shawarma joint to my house. Needles to say, I've been here many times. It is by no means my favourite in the city, but the price is right and it's decent. The staff is very nice and they are generous with the usual toppings and follow sauce directions very closely. Yep, yep. I'm an annoying shawarma orderer. So what?"}
