{"text":"Wonderful. This is a restaurant when the kitchen truly cares about their product. Everything was first rate and the staff was engaged and attentive. Wasn't inexpensive but worth the top dollar."}
{"text":"Réservation pour 15 pour un lunch, un vendredi.  Le restaurant était vide, mis à part notre groupe.   Au niveau du menu, un choix correct pour la table d'hôte du midi.  Malheureusement, La soupe de courge en entrée est arrivée tiède, à La limite de température pièce. Un potage salé, trop salé.  Le risotto aux crevettes est déconstruit. Le plat ne présente aucune harmonie de saveurs et encore une fois, extrêmement salé. Les 3 personnes ayant commandé le risotto sont uninames, ce risotto n'est pas de niveau restaurant.   L'agneau braisé est correct, quoique la portion est très petite.  L'expérience général chez ikanos aura été une déception de l'arrivée au départ."}
{"text":"Our best meal in Montreal!  We spent a week in Montreal on business and ate at several restaurants, but Ikanos was our favorite.  The food, service, and atmosphere were just right.  We ordered several small plates and shared them.  This is the way to enjoy the menu at its fullest.  My favorite was the grilled octopus.  You order by the gram so you can get double orders on the things you really like.  Our server was fabulous.  I wish I had gotten his name.  He had great suggestions about what to order and how to pair it with wine and other things on the menu.  We closed down the place - it was just fabulous."}
{"text":"Tout simplement une classe supérieure! Cuisine précise, inventive, gouteuse. Oui c'est cher, mais comme tous les restos à Montréal. Ici au moins la qualité est au rendez-vous! On y retourne, souvent."}
{"text":"This was unfortunately, a disappointing meal. Maybe we didn't order well, but the starters - artichokes with buffalo mozzarella, and asparagus were ok but nothing special. The main course - sea bream was uninspired and served with a tasteless bowl of rice. The grilled vegetables were tasty. We didn't stay for dessert.  The service however, was excellent and attentive. The three stars are a tribute to the service."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Greek restaurant we've ever been to, ever. We've been there 3 times now - and it's consistently excellent.   This time, we had saganaki to start, and shared a grilled seafood platter - with a chocolate mousse and homemade donuts for dessert.   My lord, every bite of everything was so succulent, so perfectly cooked. The portions are smaller, as all fine dining is, but you feel full at the end of the meal.   Ambiance is amazing, and service is on point. The wait staff are incredibly professional and knowledgeable of the menu items.   Price-wise, it's actually not bad. We had 1 bottle of wine, 1 appetizer, 1 platter (for 2), and 2 desserts - costed us $210.00 CAD including a 25% tip.   This is always a stop when we visit Montreal, and will always continue to be."}
{"text":"Delicious food, extremely friendly staff and an overall excellent experience. We ordered many small plates to share and the only downside was we ordered too much! The Scallops with Foie Gras was delectable and the Greek Salad was phenomenal. I stuffed myself too much, but next time I would like to try desert..."}
{"text":"food 4/5 decor 5/5 staff&service 4/5 This restaurant had been on my radar for a while so we jumped on the ocasion when we saw they came back with a MTL à Table menu: 41$ per person for tapas style dishes and an extra 8$ per person for the full sea bass. The kitchen is located right under the dining area so when walking in you can see the chefs doing their work. Our reservations were ay 8:30PM on a friday and we were seated immediately. All cocktails are 13$ and an extensive wine list, but with limited 'per glass' options. The presentation and flavours of the tapas were exquisite and very fresh. The sea bass, unfortunately, was slightly disappointing. The fish was soaked in olive oil and the presentation wasn't as beautiful as the tapas (see pictures included).  Fig smash cocktail: 13$ Hella Cobbler cocktail: 13$ MTL à Table menu: 2 x 41$ extra for full sea bass option: 2 x 8$  Total bill including tip and tax was 164$.The service for the food was quick, despite the full-house they had but we found to have waited a long time for our drinks and for grabbing the check. I noticed they have a 22$ fixed price 3-course menu for lunch so I intend on coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, mouth watering fresh seafood and genuine service.  Fresh and fulfilling salmon, calamari, octopus and scallops.  Excellent, charming and hospitable service.  Ended the evening with a OliveOil desert that left me wanting more.  Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Went here on a saturday night to celebrate a special occasion with my girlfriend. This was my first time here, and I was really excited to see how it compared to other high end Greek restaurants such as Milos and Elounda.  I must say the service is top notch, I have never had such amazing service at any restaurant before.  Many expensive restaurants have this \"snob attitude\"...this place is the exact opposite, the staff are all very polite and do not try to push any extra drinks or dishes.  Be warned: this restaurant is expensive. I only recommend that you go here for special occasions (or of course if you dont mind dishing out for fine dining). In my opinion it is in the same rank of food quality as Milos and Elounda. The location is great, the inside is beautiful, they have a very polite somelier who is very happy to explain the history of Greek wine and explain the different types of eine they offer.  Our order: (2 people) Entrés: - Salmon crudo (very tasty, but portion was a bit small) - fried zucchini chips with tzatziki (very good) - grilled octopus (was a bit hard...not chewy at all but not tender either. However it was very tasty since it is charcoal grilled)  Main plates:  - sablefish plate - american red snapper plate  We ended the meal with loukoumades for desert, about 10-12 loukoumades with a mix of greek yogurt and honey for the dip, which made for a very good desert to share.  As a Greek, I must say I am very happy to have a new restaurant that is this good to showcase what our culture has to offer in food and wine. I highly suggest that you try this restaurant the next time you are looking for high end Greek (seafood) cuisine."}
{"text":"I went there for a business lunch when it had just opened. Great service and good food. It wasn't 100% Greek, just like all Greek people who tried it are saying but you'll still find some greek items like saganaki cheese with ouzo. The interior design is very nice. Great wine list including several Greek options -please make yourself a favor and pick a Greek wine. I tried Domaine Mercouri, it was perfect! Worth trying for lunch, not sure I would prefer this option over Mythos or Milos for dinner."}
{"text":"I had an amazing culinary experience during my last visit to Ikanos, with plently of dishes full of thought and flavours and beautifully presented. Every dish was composed of multiple ingredients which I never would have thought of putting together, but Ikanos prepares everything so well that it all comes together in wonderful and delectable dishes. My favorites were definitely the ricotta cavatelli; one of the best pasta dishes I've ever eaten. I loved the trio of sauces too, served with homemade pita bread. The grilled calamari were excellent. The lobster and scallop mezzes were delicious and full of complexity.  I also enjoyed the service which was very attentive; our cutlery and dishes were changed after each service. As well, the waitress who served the majority of our dishes was very nice and explained very well everything that we ate and the composition of every dish. I highly recommend Ikanos to any Greek food lovers out there, looking for something better than a Marathon souvlaki kind of experience. Ikanos prepares amazing modern Greek dishes, full of different flavours and freshness!  For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"Ikanos... des mélanges de saveurs à vous faire tomber par terre.  Un vrai délice, le poisson, le magret, la purée, les entrées. J'ai mis un check sur ma liste de restaurants, mais c'est sûr j'y retourne bientôt!!!! Il le faut c'était trop bon!"}
{"text":"Clean resto. Was greeted with a smile. Food but good but my only complaint was the Greek salad had too much onion in it and the octopus was a little chew to taste but then again it's hard to get good octopus in Canada.  My waiter was very knowledgeable and he actually pulled off making me a Greek coffee on point (like what I make at home)"}
{"text":"Went there for MTL à table. The service was very nice. My friend and I enjoyed eating there and the food was designed for sharing, which was very nice. We added $8 for each of us to enjoy the see bass I think. The fish was nice but I felt it's a little too oily, and I personally don't like Greek salad. My friend did not Greek salad either, but he said the Greek salad at Ikanos was better than those in other restaurants. Overall it was a great experience, we wanted to try the dessert but we were too full. Nice environment also, very Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Went to Ikanos for MTL à table. They offered a 41$ menu. To be honest, for some weird reason, I wasn't excited at first when I read the menu. But when I tasted the food, it was a whole different story!  So many flavours all at once. Everything is prepared so delicately.. whatever is on your plate, the flavour is there, full and delicate at the same time. And when you mix the different elements of the plate in a same bite, just wow! Everything was well prepared (the veal was melting in my mouth, the fish was perfectly cooked,...). It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"OMG ! Une découverte incroyable dans le vieux port de Montréal! C'est simple, il faut absolument que vous essayez ce restaurant ! A peine une semaine après ma première visite, je suis retourné pour gouter à d'autre plats!   Le restaurant est magnifique et le chef sait mettre en valeur la cusine grecque de façon plus que remarquable   Ce restaurant ce glisse maintenant dans mon top 5 des meilleures restaurants à MTL !   5"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, with generous portions. Extremely caring staff, who checked many times to make sure the food was up to our standards. Couldn't ask for a better experience."}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable, un peu cher par contre,  beaucoup de choix de fruits de mer."}
{"text":"We chanced upon this place almost by luck, and what a find it was! Ikanos serves \"Modern Greek Cuisine\", which is to say Greek-inspired French food. That might sound weird, but the food is fantastic. This is a perfect location for a date. The portions are small and a tad on the pricey side, but for fans of tapas, dim sum or sushi you will appreciate the quality and marvelous flavours of the dishes and the ease of sharing with someone special. Located in Old Montreal, the place has a modern loft look and feel. Staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The wine list is weighted with quality Greek wines and may be difficult to navigate for those unfamiliar with that terroir, so don't be afraid ask Eric for assistance. He helped us choose a terrific bottle. How terrific? We ordered a second, that's how good it was. The grilled octopus is fantastic - full of flavor and tender, not rubbery. The grilled shrimps are marvelous - perfectly cooked, and the creamy polenta cakes help sop up the juices. The grilled whole shrimp are (do you see a pattern here?) fabulous - juicy, falvourful, it's hard not to lick the plate. In a night of high note after high note, it's hard to pick the highest, but it might have been the seared scallops - nicely flavoured, perfectly seared, I must confess that I finally relented and licked the plate. I don't care, it was that good, the heck with table manners. The snow crab salad was a gastronomic exercise in floral beauty - perfumed by the melon and light. The rabbit was expertly cooked so it retained it's moisture and tenderness while perfectly accompanied by the morels. The olive oil cake and the chocolate cremeux verged on excess (did the second bottle of wine have anything to do with that?) but they were so good it was impossible to stop. People looking for traditional Greek food of souvlaki and keftedes will be disappointed. Here traditional Greek food is a starting point for elevating the palate and the dining experience like the Acropolis soars above Athens. Opa!"}
{"text":"Location: In the city's old port. Street parking is available (metered) but finding a spot is hit or miss. You may be able to find un-metered parking on some streets but check the signage. Square Victoria (orange line) is a 5-minute walk.   The place: Nice space, high ceilings. It's got a comfortable vibe and is neither pretentious or overrun by hipsters. There's a bar area as well as the main dining area. My friend commented that she would have preferred Greek music to what was being played, and I agreed.  The goods: We shared a variety of mezzes as well as the main. To start, we had the sauce trio: Tzatziki, Tyrokafteri, Melitzanosalata served with homemade grilled pita. I enjoyed all of them but hold a special place in my heart for the Tzatziki because it was pretty damn good. Were it not for my date's potential judgement of me, I would have dug in with a spoon. While I am not a huge bread eater, I quite enjoyed the pita - it was fresh and tasty. I think four were served but I just saw one - my date downed those things like they were going out of style!  We also ordered the fried zucchini, which I liked, though I did find the batter to be too soft - similar to Tempura but less crispy. Aside from this, this mezze was bursting with flavor. Finally, we ordered the gnocchi, which I found to be lackluster. Beautiful presentation but low on flavor.  As our main, we shared the sea fish. Why am I calling it the sea fish, you ask? Because I don't remember if it was the sea bream or the sea bass. Regardless, it was delicious and served with seasonal veggies. For dessert we ordered the Loukoumades doughnuts. Now, I'm not a doughnut person, and if I'm being honest, I didn't particularity have any room left for dessert.  I was talked into dessert and decided it was in my readers' best interest to take one for the team. These doughnuts are the shit. For REAL. Just order them because you won't be disappointed. My date only had 2 which means I basically ate like, 7 but don't tell my trainer!  Service: OK.   Price point: With taxes & tip split two ways, the bill was $88 each. Not too bad if you want to splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed, having come in with such high expectations. It's a really cool, hip place, so an \"A\" for ambience, and the menu is wonderful. I think what ruined it for us was the service. We had no fewer than 5 different people come to our table throughout the evening, and neither knew what the prior server had already done (for example, last guy took our wine order, and then another comes to once again take our wine order--repeat pretty much for every step of the way). Empty plates were seldom cleared in a timely manner, and our main waiter was incredibly rude and inattentive--in fact, we were a clear nuisance to him, despite the act that we're a relatively low maintenance couple. I actually had to ask to have my water refilled three times. And lastly, although my wife's scallop dish was very good, my lamb was honestly disgusting. It was pretty much a plate of undercooked, unchewable gristle. The desserts were pretty amazing, however. Anyway, I think there are better places for a better experience."}
{"text":"I'd been to Ikanos a few years ago when it first opened and thought it was good but not great.  Had a chance to revisit it when we went recently for a group work dinner, and they have really hit their stride.    Because we were a big group, we took the tasting menu.  Started off with thin slices of fried zucchini , lightly battered and seasoned with dill and salt.  So good.  So, so good.  I think I could have eaten a big bowl of those and called it dinner.  There were also some eggplant and roasted pepper spreads with pita, but I was all about the zucchini.   Next up was a seafood platter, with grilled and fried calamari (fried better), perfectly grilled scallops and shrimps.  All good.  The star of the night was the third course, the fish.  Mediterranean Sea bass, expertly filleted and served whole.  Probably the best fish I've had in a restaurant in years.  Cooked to perfection, it was buttery, flavourful and rich.  Served with a simple Greek salad which complemented it well.  A perfect example of great a meal can be with simple high quality quality ingredients expertly prepared.  Final course was traditional Greek loukoumades, perfectly fine, but anything was going to be anticlimactic after that fish.  Plus I was too full to eat more than a few.  The cocktail I had was ok, but a little sweet for my taste.  The wine list is on the shorter side, and features several Greek wines.  We had a very nice Greek white, and a French red.    Decor is chic and relaxed.  Service was well paced and attentive, and the manager came over more than once to check on our group."}
{"text":"Je suis allée à Ikanos ce midi, avec 2 collègues, et nous avons tous été emballés par la nourriture. La table d'hôte du midi est à 22$, comprenant entrée, plat et mignardises, et je peux vous assurer que tout a l'air excellent et il y a un choix vraiment intéressant! Nous avons pris la salade en entrée, et comme plats, calamars frits, filet de porc et pieuvre grillée. Je dois avouer que la pieuvre grillée est à tomber par terre, un véritable régal, cuisinée dans une petite sauce à l'huile et aux câpres vraiment succulente!! A essayer à tout prix! :)"}
{"text":"Belle grande place, j'y étais avec un groupe de 10 pour dîner. Le menu est intéressant, le personnel est adorable, et les cuisiniers sont ouverts à adapter un plat même pour un végétalien ;). La carte des vins est plus longue que le menu et les prix sont raisonnables. Les plats sont pimpés d'une touche originale et savoureuse sans être nécessairement Grecque comme le saumon de mon voisin servi avec une savoureuse noisette de pesto champignon maison sans ail. Je reviendrai, c'est promis!"}
{"text":"Je me promets bien d'essayer ce nouveau restaurant de mon quartier qui a l'air (marin) très sympathique. On s'en reparle... Je donnerai un nombre d'étoiles plus modéré s'il y a lieu. Laissez-moi votre avis si vous y allez avant moi !"}
{"text":"What a delightful new discovery on McGill Street.  Amazing food, ambience and service.  For two, we were suggested to order 6-7 mezzes. Each dish consisted of the freshest ingredients with very original flair, some Greek and others not so Greek, more contemporary.  Everything was very delicious.  Check out the photos!  We are going back later this week with a larger group to try more!!!"}
{"text":"Il semble que je vais me joindre au concert d'avis positifs sur Ikanos! Je ne connaissais rien de ce resto avant qu'un ami m'y invite cette semaine. Un restaurant grec à la base, mais avec une influence méditerranéenne. Pas le genre d'endroit pour manger un souvlaki pita, plus haut de gamme et définitivement plus cher aussi.  Nous avons partagé un menu \"empistosini\" plat de \"mezze\" servi en paire et en quatre services (plus des amuses-bouches et une surprise). L'accent est mis sur les produits de la mer et j'ai apprécié beaucoup plus les gravlax et huîtres (crues) que les versions cuites (mais en toute honnêteté, je n'aime pas vraiment les poissons et fruits de mers crus, mais ceux-ci étaient trop cuits de toute façon, à mon avis). Le magret de canard était savoureux, contrairement à la pieuvre qui accompagnait ce service.  Notre serveur (très affable et attentif) nous a conseillé un accord plat-vin qui fût apprécié et relativement judicieux, bien qu'un peu fade pour mon palais.  L'ambiance est agréable et il y est facile d'entretenir une conversation. La décoration est moderne et il est possible d'apprécier le travail de la cuisine situé à l'étage inférieur à partir de la rue. Cela résulte en une cuisine visible, mais qui n'altère pas l'ambiance une fois dans le restaurant.  En bref, de bons ingrédients qui résultent en une soirée fort agréable."}
{"text":"Wow this place was amazing! The food and the service was just incredible! I loved the fried zucchini which tasted so fresh and crispy. We shared, for two, a mix sea food platter and it was more than enough to be quite full. The seafood was so well done and so tasty it just melted in your mouth. The experience was quite nice as the waiters were really attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Greek fusion cuisine at its best. This stylish restaurant offers a wide variety of cocktails and aims to impress. This unique take on Greek cuisine gives them a flair that i have rarely seen from Montreal's Greek community. I enjoyed it immensely. Whether it was the fried Saganaki with jelly, the stuffed Zucchini, or the Lam tartar they were inventive at every step of the meal. Both mains were from the sea, and their wine pairings were perfect. Their high prices almost cost them a star, but the food won the day. Great choice for fine dining in the old port."}
{"text":"I was invited to try Ikanos' new peach inspired menu launch this week. What an amazing celebration of the peach!   I've always liked peaches but I didn't realize how versatile this fruit is until I tried this menu. It paired perfectly with savoury and sweet foods.  The fish ceviche bite was bright with citrus and I loved the sweetness coming through from the peaches. They also served a peach mimosa style drink to begin the evening which was yummy and refreshing.  The peach gazpacho was smooth and sweet and paired very well with the matane shrimp. The only thing that would have brought it to another level for me is if some spice would've been added.  Next up was a delicious pan seared fish served with seasonal veggies and grilled peaches. Amazinnggg flavours. The duck course that came next was wasted on me as I do not enjoy duck but presentation was great and others like it.  My fave was unsurprisingly dessert! The dark chocolate and sea salt bar with peach sorbet was too delicious - I cleaned my plate!   Overall, great experience in this beautiful location."}
{"text":"Nourriture bonne mais un peu trop chère. Serveur devait être un novice car avait de la difficulté avec les commandes."}
{"text":"I went to this place after 22h  They have a special where you can share 4 mezzes (tapas size plates) between 2 people for 24$ each (Thursday to Saturday)  It's an upscale modern Greek restaurant with beautiful decor.  We shared the tuna, lamb, snowcrab and the saganaki. The tuna and snowcrab was fresh and tasty. I wasn't crazy about the lamb. The saganaki is a statement by itself. I love love love it.  This restaurant is on the pricey side but you pay for the quality."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner!  We are first time visitors to Montreal and the concierge recommended this restaurant for light tapas type food. The place was so good I had to post while we were waiting for the check!  We went with 5 dishes, each equally amazing. Paired with a delicious Greek wine made this a memorable meal. My wife loved the fried octopus and I had the swordfish. We started with the Saganaki and zucchini chips and mushroom ravioli. The Greek salad was equally amazing.   Place was fairly empty on a Sunday night st 6pm so we didn't need reservations  (apparently they just started being open on Sundays as of today).   Service was attentive but not overbearing. The wait for food etc was much better than other places we have eaten at so far. The ambiance was very quaint.   We highly enjoyed and recommend this place.... now I have to end as my Chocolat dessert just arrived :)"}
{"text":"Came to this place because it was the closest place to where we were walking at the time and my wife is Greek...so why not right? Was a bit nervous at first since it was practically empty on a Sunday night but let me tell you it was the best meal I've had in awhile.   The atmosphere is perfect, the food plentiful and flavorful, the service was second to none and we had the best time.   They cook with a Josper oven and use the same oven for multiple things so the flavors are continuous and complex.   Do go here!"}
{"text":"First of all, we went there for Mtl a table event.  Pro: food was delicious, well prepared and good. Service was really smooth. Cons: portions was a little bit small, so we have to fill ourself with the bread dipped in a really good olive oil... The only thing that seemed normal size was the dessert...  For the event, Ikanos prepared a special menu for montreal a table. As mentionned, don't get tricked by the menu as the menu is for 2. Each dish has to be shared by 2, which was a bit disappointing since the portions are already small. Also, for the event as it might be too late already, but I recommand to not go there in a odd number of guests, since the portions size do not seem to accomodate the extra person.  First service: tataki tuna and fluke carpaccio. Delicious, I will come back there just for those dishes, if they are serving them outside MTL a table.  Second service: scallops and halibut. Scallops and halibut were good, but again, the halibut portion didn't seem to get bigger to accomodate our extra guest. Tzatziki was amazing, one of the best I even tried. It was unfortunate that there was just a little dash of this on the plate...  Main dishes: duck magret with eggplant, ravioli moussaka, red snappers and shrimps (2 pieces). Duck magret was overcooked, eggplant a bit too salty. Beside those two dishes, nothing to complain about, everything was good.  Overall: food was good, portions were small, highly recommended if not really hungry and looking for high quality seafood dishes..."}
{"text":"Belle découverte! Très beau restaurant méditerranéen au vieux Montréal sur McGill. J'ai essayé leur menu lunch à 24$ qui inclut entrée, repas principal et petites mignardises en dessert. Présentation est superbe. Excellent tartare à l'agneau et veau un peu sec avec carottes. L'huile d'olive qui accompagne le pain est très bien, mais ils ne servent pas d'assiette à pain, ce qui peut être un peu salissant. Ambiance relaxe et tranquille. Idéal pour un lunch d'affaire ou un lunch ou l'on veut discuter aisément. L'esspresso est très bien aussi. Service impeccable."}
{"text":"I visited Ikanos for the first time last night. I was the first one in the door for the dinner service so I had the pleasure of having the staff focusing all of their attention on me. The service was impeccable. The staff is knowledgeable and made fabulous suggestions. We ordered the seafood plate (1 tier), the saganaki (fried cheese), greek salad, dessert, cocktails, bottle of wine and a greek digestive called skinnos (mastiha spirit). The bill was roughly $180 each with taxes and 20% tip included. Everything was very tasty however we had to send the clams from the seafood plate back because I got a bad one (ack!! yuck!). I don't know if you've ever had a bad clam, but there is no mistaking it. It is utterly disgusting. blech. It is like an assault on your whole face. They were out of calamari so the seafood plate was lacking - but the price didn't waiver from the original price of $78. The seafood plate consisted of 3 scallops, 4 shrimp, grilled octopus and some steamed clams. For $78 I felt ripped off. I know you don't go to Ikanos if you're picky about spending because it's known for being expensive - and you don't know me so I should explain that I have no problem spending (and I'm amazing at it. It's like a gd talent), however, I am a firm believer in \"you get what you pay for\" and this just wasn't the case with the seafood platter. Value for money was a fail with this platter last night. We could have ordered the items separately from the tapas menu and had more food for less money. The Greek salad was a win, although it really needs more pepperoncini. The saganaki was the best thing I've put in my mouth all week. Seriously - SO so good. So good. The desserts were off the charts. Save room for dessert. Their homemade donuts were out of control good. They are served scalding hot and over an orange and almond crusted pannacotta. The contrast between the delicate pannacotta and fried donuts just worked. I want more of that. Like, now. And everyday. If you go to Ikanos, and you should, my recommendation is to stick to the mezzes, avoid the seafood plates and definitely save room for dessert. Oh, and their wine selection is a win! I tried 3 different greek wines - all of which I would order again. Trust the waiter's advice, they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Super repas ce midi chez Ikanos avec leur menu table d'hôte à seulement 22$ contenant une entrée, un plat et des mignardises ! Le choix est sympathique au niveau des différents services. En attendant on nous apporte des morceaux de pain avec de l'huile d'olive pour calmer notre début de faim. Ma bruchetta avec des tomates confites, du fromage et de la tapenade était bonne, la portion nickel pour une entrée. Bonne entrée en bouche pour le repas. Sur le plat je suis parti sur des tagliatelles avec une sauce aux champignons, du canard confit et des poireaux. Très bien exécuté et la portion était tout à fait raisonnable. Au niveau des mignardises on a eu droit à une mini tartelette au citron et un morceau de brownie. Le service était très sympathique et bien attentionné. Le cadre est moderne et nous fait bien sentir pendant notre repas. En conclusion je pense que cela vaut vraiment le coup pour un repas le midi en terme de rapport qualité-prix."}
{"text":"I love Greek food, especially grilled fresh fish. This place does not disappoint. The grilled sea bass is outstanding.  The grilled seafood platter is amazing. It comprises grilled octopus, calamari, scallops and giant shrimps. It's for two, but we ordered it as one of the starters and shared it among four of us. Truly sumptuous.  Other notable main course at our table included the homemade pasta and grilled fish... all amazing."}
{"text":"Ikanos is a great Greek restaurant in the old port area. They offer a fantastic brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday from 10:30 to 3:00. I've been here several times and I like that the menu changes. The Frittata with duck and mushrooms is one of my favorites. There sauce trio including the tzatziki is homemade, even the bread! They also have accommodations for vegetarians.  They have a nice little terrace in the summer. The staff was super helpful and friendly.  They can accommodate a room for 50-60 people closed off.  In the back 20-30 people for smaller parties. There is a late night menu."}
{"text":"Celebrated a colleagues birthday over lunch at Ikanos. Service was great, they accommodated my colleagues dietary needs. Starter incl two huge grilled shrimp with lobster mayo, a refreshing fennel salad and orange segments- forgot to take a photo! Our main courses: two big cod ravioli served with mussels, chorizo and leek; Fregola pasta with mushrooms and artichokes and the best was grilled steak served with fiddleheads, Jerusalem artichokes and fingerling potatoes. Great meal for $24 table d'hote. Macarons and pear crumble for dessert. Will definately be returning."}
{"text":"Technically we flew to Montreal for dinner, but as it turns out this brunch was the star of the show (ok, both meals were epic, but this place surprised me).   My fiance was in charge of planning the trip and found this spot online had good reviews and oysters, so he was sold, and made a reservation for 11am on the Sunday.  Turns out it was only their second Sunday doing their brunch menu, so I was pleased to be ahead of the crowd lol.   We ended up wandering in at 10:30am right when they opened and were seated immediately, since we were the first customers of the day.  Others did arrive soon after 11am, but it never got that packed, I assume because brunch is new for them.  Two things to note first - the staff was amazing, super friendly, helpful, appeared at all the right times, and the ambiance was great.  Definitely my decor style!   For food, we opted to start with a dozen OYSTERS.  They were featuring 3 different kinds (I think all from PEI) so we did 4 of each.  I found the shucking to be great, and all 3 different kinds were delicious.  Next up, we split a Half Sized GREEK SALAD.  A nice serving size, and very authentic with no lettuce.  Could have used a splash of vinegar or something for tang, but overall it was nice.  We didn't finish it as our entrees arrived soon after.  He opted for the PORCHETTA dish and I went with SHRIMP dish.  His porchetta was perfectly cooked and kept raving about the dish, from the broccoli rabe to the poached egg which was also perfectly cooked.  My SHRIMP dish was awesome as well, and thankfully the sausage wasn't overwhelming and really completed the dish.  The dipping bread on the side was perfect for slopping up all of the goodness here!!   Wow, totally forgot about drinks lol.  He did the Ouzo/Coffee drink which was like a milkshake and he loved.  I did the Grand Marnier drink with Orange Juice and Egg Whites, which didn't wow me at first, but I ended up loving towards the end.    A must do for Brunch if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Had quite a few plates, I don't recommend grilled squid here, its very bland and the chickpeas have no flavor. Shrimp, Greek salad were my favorites along with the hamachi.  Overall, not amazing, but good. Just not for the price really."}
{"text":"Went here with a super good Groupon deal so I can't vouch for the price.  We had a great tasting menu including a very nice apéro. The grilled octopus is the best I've ever had and over a year later I still won't shut up about it. Everything we ate was delicious, fresh and flavourful.  I now spend my life waiting for that deal to reappear because I'm cheap."}
{"text":"One of our favourite restaurants! So much so, that we are having our wedding there this October. Staff are friendly and extremely accommodating and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"I really enjoy stopping by after the sauna a block away. I always get the lamb, the greek salad, and a small plate of duck."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my wife's birthday while on vacation. Nice atmosphere, fairly upscale dining vibe to it. Order the seafood platter for the two of us. The pita bread & zucchini chips were the best part of the meal! Next we had grilled octopus, calamari, shallots, & shrimp; we enjoyed the shallots and shrimp, not so much the others, but that's personal preference. The main course came out, grilled fish and vegetables. Vegetables were steamed, I think, and not very flavorful. Fish was pretty good, though not the best we've had. Going back, I would have preferred the steak, but we decided to go w/ the platter. Red wine we had was really good as well. Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere, which was nice & quiet, and the food was pretty good. Plus, as a bonus, when I created my Open Table reservation, I put that it was my wife's birthday and the staff brought out donuts and a sparkler to celebrate! Totally unexpected and the donuts were fantastic."}
{"text":"Interesting savors, not very authentic Greek having been to Grece, but original, we had the Montreal a Table tasting menu; the hummus with pickled mushroon was very good, i had for main the lamb very crispy was a small portion, the other is a squid risotto, could have more permasan it was a bit blend, needed some acidity to cut with the creaminess. The desert was ok nothing amazing. Would be back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Went to Ikanos for a business lunch. This is a beautiful restaurant located on McGil Stl in the Old Port.  The service was excellent. Prompt and courteous, no complaints there.  The food was excellent as well. I took the salmon tartare as the first course, and the fish parmentier as the main course. Everything was well executed and seasoned.  My only complaint is the size of the portions. At this price level, I would expect slightly bigger portions. The tartare was done in two bites, and the parmentier was not even a half-inch thick. I was definitely still hungry after lunch, and I'm not the hungriest eater in general.  I would still go back because the food is great, but I'm certainly hoping that they will re-adjust the portions a little bit. Leaving your patrons hungry is not a good thing!"}
{"text":"This classic Greek restaurant is situated in the Old Port. The decor and the ambience was pleasant. My friend and I came on a Friday night and the restaurant was fully booked. We ordered five appetizers, cocktails and desert. The food was delicious and very well prepared but they didn't accommodate my food allergies I specified. Service was extremely slow and it took around three hours for the entire service which I found to be quite ridiculous. I'm sure it was a busy night but I'm not sure I would come again."}
{"text":"I ate here several times and was never disappointed. I give it two thumbs up for service, food, ambiance and presentation.  I had a delicious quinoa salad and a wonderful coquille st- Jacques.   If you're looking for a trendy Greek restaurant in the old port make sure to pass by."}
