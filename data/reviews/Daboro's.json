{"text":"Just tried this place out yesterday, because me and a couple friends wanted fast food, but not anything greasy. The staff was excellent and helpful in helping us with the menu options and we were even given samples of the smoothies to try. I ended up getting two pad thai rolls with chicken and the peanut sauce along with one of their orange smoothies. The food and smoothie great! The employees were super friendly and I look forward to coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"We've only eaten at DaBoro's once, although we've tried many times. We've made several attempts to stop in on Saturday afternoons and they were closed every time. The website says they're open on Saturdays and their phone systems says so as well, yet they haven't ever been when we tried.  We've always gone during posted business hours.   The one time we did stop in to find them open, we ordered the Italian pizza rolls. They were AMAZING! But here's the other problem; that's what we've tried to order the umpteen times we've tried to go back, and on the rare occasion that they've been open, they've been out of the Italian pizza rolls. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. They always have pesto available, just never with red sauce. We hate pesto so we end up going home empty handed every time.   We were thrilled to find a gluten free, healthier-styled restaurant, and I hope they eventually get it together. I think the food would be rated 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that finding them open and having what you order in stock is like winning the lottery."}
{"text":"Very helpful and friendly.  I am a new vegan and am exploring my local food options.  It was an informative and encouraging experience (not to mention the food was outstanding.) My husband who is not vegan loved the food as well."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon this place while passing through town-   Ordered a Pad Thai bowl-  got to pick my own veggies and meat...   All veggies were fresh hand cut and meat selection was quality, not the garbage cuts you find in most choose your own style restaurants.  Everything was cooked on the spot and was absolutely delicious.   Ordered a ice tea and expected your normal average over sweetened tea-   Received an awesome blend of tea with no sweeteners but amazing herbal flavors.   Highly recommended, it was the dankest"}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh food. Great alternative to ANY 'fast food' options. Dine in or drive thru, super friendly service. It takes a little time and maybe questions to navigate the menu but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I decided to try something different for lunch today and this looked like the perfect place to step out of my comfort zone. This is a quick spot to grab lunch, and the menu boasts healthy options for salad bowls, smoothies, and vegan dessert options. In other words, it was everything I normally avoid.   The interior was a beautiful shade of green with industrial light fixtures and quirky signs that create a hipsters paradise. They feature ready made lunches and desserts, a bar similar to Chipotle for assembling salad bowls, and an array of healthful smoothies with monikers such as \"green goddess\".   I'll level here - I didn't like the food (brownie and apple slices with a yogurt dip). However, I can't really blame the restaurant for that - I'm not one for the food sold here, so me not liking it is really a reflection of my own taste preferences, not the quality of my food. I brought the leftovers to my wife and she loved them!   If you're into super healthy food, this is definitely s spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Went in looking for soup. Staff was super friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Everything was fresh from her garden and amazing! Even my 8 year old son loved it and wants to go back. I had zucchini noodle bowl, husband and son both made custom soups. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh juices - my favorite is the green goddess. The rice paper wraps are healthy and delicious"}
{"text":"Second time there and it gets better and better. Super tasty and fresh, not to mention GF and organic! The owner took the time to explain all the options; she gave to my son a sample of sliced organic apples (from her garden) with a special peanut sauce. We tried the Pad Thai noodles, chicken broth soup with all kind of veggies, kale chips, jasmin tea with lavander and the carrot/orange/pear juice. Brownies are made with apple sauce, no sugar. Delicious!. Prices are reasonable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent healthy foods. My favorite is rice noodles with veggies. Very good concept!"}
{"text":"Just ate a noodle bowl with assorted vegetables and soy and ginger dressing with avocado. It was delicious. Highly recommend this place for fresh food."}
{"text":"I got a \"smoothie\" here.  This was more like carrot and orange flavored crushed iced.  For $4.50 for a small size,I should've kept my money.  This was the only thing I tried.  The other menu items may be better."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and here are my thoughts. I want the place to do well because there isn't another place like it close- fresh, unprocessed, delicious food! That said I have some constructive criticism. My first time in I thought they had just opened bc there is no overhead menu, a tv on the wall that was shut off, and the cooler was half empty. I didn't know where to look or what to do. They walked me through the menu and it's basically create your own whatever- roll, salad, or bowl. I would've liked some direction, some pre-made recipe choices.  Secondly, having the menu more visible would move things along- it can be a tad slow. For the fitness/health-nut crowd who's always on the go, speed is important. With all the options you can chose, going through them all can be exhausting. Make it more clear cut. Post what the infused water and tea of the day are so you don't have to verbally tell every customer. Have more pre-pressed juices (they last for 3 days, if I remember correctly).  Add some uplifting background music to enhance the good vibes.  Lastly, adding a protein is an upcharge. For example, the lunch special is $5 but to add chicken is an additional $2. It would be better marketing to advertise the lunch special as $6 and it comes with a protein. (I realize my math isn't right, but a lunch special isn't special if it's $7). If you don't want the protein, it's $5. That way you're \"getting a deal.\"  I really really want this place to stay in business because it's a much needed addition to the Mayfield area. Food is delish, concept is great, just smooth out some rough edges."}
{"text":"As an out of towner, I absolutely loved the owner taking her time to explain what they had to offer. I had the rice bowl with her own green beans picked from her garden. I also bought the brownie, pizza rolls and an infused water.  All natural and all GF. If you haven't tried it, you are missing out. Business trips are never healthy for me but finding this place was a rare treat. Keep up the delicious flavors. Their sign is down so it was a little hard to find but well worth it. They are replacing it."}
{"text":"Okay.. maybe I have high expectations because I live in California where health restaurants and shops are top notch.. but DaBoro's is very expensive and there are so very few options of things. I got a salad which was eh... and they didn't give me enough dressing for the size of the salad, and tried to charge me for extra dressing. The kale chips were pretty decent. But everything else.. pretty sub par. Maybe some more options and a little bit friendlier of service would make a big difference here!"}
{"text":"Great alternative to fast food. The house salad was awesome, not your mothers house, fantastic dressing. Also had a smoothie that rivaled the establishment it replaced. Give this place a try, right next door to Five guys in the old Robecks."}
