{"text":"good service?fresh sashimi?the noodle is ok?but not many tables,better have a reservation before u come"}
{"text":"The most authentic and fresh sushi I've had in Toronto. They only have a limited amount of each fish as its flown in daily from Japan. Not cheap but worth the money for a wonderful experience hosted by a family along with sweet servers!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good quality of sashimi that couldn't  find anywhere else in Toronto."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Sushi tastes bad.  Prices are crazy high for what you get!  May be the worst sushi I've had!  Now my husband and I are terrified we may get sick before the night is through!"}
{"text":"We ordered a sashimi platter which was supposed to be $55 but they didn't have Vancouver uni, waiter told us we could add $10 for Japanese Uni. Read reviews on here saying their uni was really fresh and tasty so we decided to pay the extra $10 for the Uni from Japan. 

Their sashimi platter is suggested for 2 people but portion was kind of small...I am
not a big eater but I still had room for dessert after dinner. Fish was fresh ...that's all I could say, nothing too special, their runs sashimi were just meh. Saw pretty good reviews on this restaurant before coming and was expecting them to be as good as Zen but I was kind of disappointed. I had better sashimi and for the price I paid I would say it's not worth it. Don't think I would come Back again, would rather go to Zen instead.  

Small restaurant, servers were all Japanese. call ahead to book a table. For a table of 4 in a Saturday night, I called just a few days ahead (on Thursday) to book the table, was expecting them to be fully booked so was quite surprised when they said there were availability."}
{"text":"This restaurant is situated several stores down from a KFC but don't let the locale fool you.  The place is run by a true Japanese family and the price is fair especially for an uptown meal.  I've had the Omakase twice and both times it was a pleasant experience.  The quality was above average and you could see the level of care that is placed on each dish.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The best and most fresh sashimi I've had in Toronto and Ottawa! 
It's kind of scary how sweet and buttery the fish tasted, but the fact is: it's fresh! The service is great! I called to make a quick reservation while driving there. They said there was a spot available in about 1 hour. Definitely call to make a reservation before going! 

Note to self: Don't eat all cold and raw food. Try their grilled fish too! Your stomach will be thankful that you did. 

Also, unless you like vinegar soupy things, I wouldn't recommend getting the seaweed salad. We thought it was the typical bright green seaweed salad you find at AYCE places. Instead, it was the natural looking seaweed but soaked in vinegar sauce with bits of ginger. 

To end on a good note, I love Aoyama! It's definitely expensive, but a great experience overall! Sashimi here is hands-down amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been this Japanese many years ago.  I love their food even the food is pretty pricy.  A very small, authentic Japanese restaurant.   I ordered a sea bass and some sushi.  $80 already.  Disappointed about the black cod as it is raw in the centre.  The new piece of black cod is too salty"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the suburban strip-mall locale. This is among the best sushi you'll likely have in Toronto.

The omakase is just incredible, and the Asahi Dark beer (which I've only ever seen here) is just right to accompany it.

Need more proof? A relative who's an executive at a Japanese auto maker says when the higher-ups visit from Japan, this is where they want to eat."}
{"text":"Hidden among a line of stores, you will find this little gem! It gets quite busy as they are only open during the dinner hours and the restaurant seats about 30 max. Definitely call ahead and make reservations to avoid disappointment. I've learned my lesson ;)

Their menu has many options. Their dinner sets/omakase looked great but since it was our first time here, we decided to go with a few things we generally get a Japanese restaurants to test the waters. We started with a grilled king crab appetizer that was advertised/hanging on their deal/specials tree (lol so animated and colourful - it drew my attention). It was nicely grilled and tasted great. We ordered the dragon roll, spider roll, and some sashimi (salmon, white tuna and toro!). Both rolls were delicious. They definitely did not skimp out on the ingredients especially the soft shell crab in the spider roll - good crunch. The sashimi was melt in you mouth fresh. Can't get enough of that toro! If we weren't that full already we would've ordered another 10 pieces! Haha we finished the meal off with a slice of green tea cheesecake and sesame mochi. Perfect end to a perfect meal. It was about $115 for the two people which is on par to other fine sushi restaurants. You pay for the quality. 

We will definitely be back to try their various omakase."}
{"text":"Nice and fresh food!  Service is great!  Make sure you call first to reserve a table before you go! Great place is always packed!"}
{"text":"It's not much to look at on the outside and not much better on the inside. But don't let this unassuming restaurant fool you!

What went in my belly:

Sashimi Omakase - 17 pieces of premium assortments of sashimi ($25). ) The platter came with salmon, hamachi, fluke, white tuna, red tuna, scallop, uni, squid and shrimp. Incredibly fresh and really great value!

Uni Handrolls ($3 each) and Spicy Salmon Handroll ($2.30 each). Like the sashimi, the fish was incredibly fresh. What I loved about these rolls was the fact that there was filling up until the very last bite. There's nothing worse than taking one bite out of your handroll only to realize the rest of it is just rice. You know what I'm talking about!

Maguro No Tataki - lightly seared tuna served with garnish and ponzu ($6.50). Good but nothing special in my opinion. The least memorable dish of the evening.

Hokke ($13.50). Served grilled, this fish is similar to hamachi. The portion is quite substantial and while I found it a touch salty, it was still pretty darn tasty.

Spider Roll ($16). It came highly recommended by our server and I can see why. It was one of the best spider rolls I've had. Every bite had a nice crunch from the soft shell crab and was packed full of flavour. Yes, it's a little pricey but like the hokke, it's quite large.

After a meal here, I can see why Aoyama comes so highly recommended. Like I said, don't let its unassuming exterior fool ya!"}
{"text":"I got lucky reading some really good reviews about this place, and saw some nice pictures from fellow Yelpers to convince myself of bringing my gf on our 8th Year Anniversary! This place has one of the 'FRESHEST' sashimi EVER!!! Of course, this comes with some STEEP and not CHEAP price... Great place to dine and say you have no money and wash dishes there to pay back..haha

Smart move I made was making reservation prior to arrival! (ping...I'm a genius!) I ordered for my gf the $65 Omakase just for her. She got their classic 8 course meal.

First Round: Crab martini salad with seaweed. While this is an enjoyable dish, the crab was far and few pieces.

Second Round: White thin slice fish with ponzu sauce. Nice and tender sashimi style fish.

Third Round: 9 Pieces of Sashimi- 3 Salmon, 3 Maguro Tuna, 2 Hamachi, 1 Ebi. This is super fresh for fish, but the shrimp was a bit soggy.

4th Round: Lobster tail chopped into few chunky pieces. Very tender and enjoyable.

5th Round: Tempura Shrimp and Veggies. The batter was light and not heavy like ayce joints.

6th Round: 7 Pieces of Sushi- 1 Unagi (Freshwater Eel), 1 Sea Urchin, 1 Hamachi, 1 that looks like Hamachi as well, 1 Salmon, 1 White Fish (Not butter fish), 1 Tuna.
- My gf was getting full not mainly because of this meal, but because she had some of what I ordered extra as well which I will list afterwards. We decided to just eat the fish without the rice, and it was STILL tender and easy to chew.

7th Round: Seafood Soup Cleanser. The broth was very nice and consist of one baby scallop, one shrimp, one chinese mushroom.

8th Round: Choice of Dessert. Went with Mango Mochi which is frozen ice cream inside, but outside like gelatin texture.

We're going to the judges decision... This place is a Unaminous Winner!!!

I didn't get the Omakase course, so I ordered random a la carte stuff. 

To start, I got 2x handroll of Uni (Sea Urchin) ($3 per order) and 2x Spicy Salmon Handroll. ($2.5 per order)
- The great thing about the handroll is after the first bite, there is still the toppings in there until your last bite. No disappointment there for sure!

I got the Maguro Tataki which is light sear tuna with ponzu sauce with some orange caviar and seaweed which all tasted very nice. ($6.5) per order.

Next taster was their 'Monk Fish Liver' which I read from some blogger that says its real good. I got to say that it was definitely a nice try. Uber tender, and enjoyable, but for $6.50 for two pieces...I'd maybe pass next time on.

I got their 17 pieces of fresh sashimi.($25) Has squid, scallop, tuna, salmon, hamachi, toro like fish texture, uni, and amaebi (sweet shrimp). No complaints to this one, except their shrimp which is a bit soggy.

Had to try this one for myself and gf, so I made one order of their 'TORO Sashimi' which is only 2 pieces for the STEEP price of $13!!! But its worth the try, because this ended to be one of the most memorable fish sashimi to ever be digested by our stomach juices! heh heh heh.

I also got the 'Gindara' which is black cod. Super tender and fresh tasting. But this is steep as well at $16 just for the quarter size fish. Next time I'd try their Hokke which is a japanese fish that is cheaper, but bigger portion size.

Now with all this great food, the pace of the restaurant is sometimes fast, and sometimes not. When we started off they would bring our dish fairly quickly, then there would be a halt for 15 min gap, then we would get dish quickly again and then not. I did notice they would always bring our dish first, then we would have to pass them our empties to make room. The servers' are all Japanese and very friendly, so I was fine leaving them a great tip for a hefty bill for two people. Their space capacity of holding maybe 25 people max.

Without the chef, I don't believe this place would be as prestige for certain. The service is not able to hold it together with the great food offered in this joint. I will still come back to this place, once I recuperate my losses."}
{"text":"Love it here. Sushi was amazing and the side dishes were just great :) try to deep fried oyster and of course the sushi plate"}
{"text":"If you enjoy good sashimi, you have to try this place!  There is a reason why it is always full even it is so expensive. I think the old say \"you get what you paid for\" is so true for Aoyama. This place is like Zen, Michi...tucked in a small neighbourhood plaze, out of no where... but this is where all the good restaurants like to hide.

I went with a girl friend that day, we ordered one of their premium sashimi platter ...i think it was like $60-70 for two people.  I can't remember what type of fish we've got, regardless, they are all very delicious! 

I saw a lot of people getting served with the omakase, and they look so awesome. I regretted for not pre-ordering that..so I will go back to this place for the omakase."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now. This is kind of our go-to place for a celebration. My fiance loves sushi/sashimi and he is never disappointed with an order from here.

There are a few vegetarian options here, which is great. I'm love the buttered enoki mushrooms and usually order one of the soup noodles (udon or soba) while he orders an omakase to share (if we are with other people) or a smaller portion of something else if it's just for himself. The omakase comes with a seafood soup, which is presented in a small teapot, which is quite cute. The omakase itself is good for 2 to share as there are two of each type of fish.

Aoyama is a small and cozy restaurant, so it's best to call in to make reservations. I have been lucky so far with making reservations even on the day of, but I see people waiting at the door each time I am there, even on a week night. 

As the restaurant is quite small, I would go with no more than a group of 6, unless you want to book the restaurant for a private party (which I've never asked about)."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food, the chef and craftsmanship of the sushi are top class. The omakase course for two is the best sushi in town. Only 5 per night, reservation highly recommended. The only improvements they need are their decor and the bathroom cleanliness."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi I've eaten in Toronto. Even better than Zen and way better value. Sushi platter is the only way to go. Hamachi belly is awesome, Dragon roll melts in ur mouth and beef sashimi so good also. Fish is so fresh and tasty.  Been here many times and quality has always been top.  I can't eat sushi anywhere else after here. Wait can't forget the negoritoro roll....drooool"}
{"text":"Good food and service, well maintained and run by Japanese. One of the best Japanese sushi in GTA."}
{"text":"So far I went MIYABI, INAKAYA, MAKISUSHI, ZEN, FIN IZAKAYA.
Those are restaurant run by Japanese or Japanese chef. Aoyama is the Best.
I talked with chef. He explained he goes to buy fish in whole seller in day time so he do not open lunch time. He said he spends a lot of money to fish. I agree. those fishes are fresh and selling price is also high. I think I ate first time HIRAME in Canada in English, Olive flounder or Bastard halibut. If you go there,

If you want to eat fresh variety of raw fish, this place is best choice.
Price is as expensive as other real Japanese restaurant. We spent $100 for 2 including drinking.

If I comment negative things, you might not like chef's English level and tiny space and crowd. 

Always many people, I recommend reservation."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and was told only the VIP section had tables available. It was more spacious and comfortable there than the main dining area, which we appreciated. There were a lot of menus and daily specials to choose from (it was a bit overwhelming at first!).  We ended up going for the omakase sushi set for 2. First, we were served with edamame (not salted), teriyaki chicken skewers, and steamed egg custard. We especially liked the egg custard for its unique taste and great texture. The other 2 were average. We were also served a seafood (scallop and shrimp) soup in a cute kettle to be poured into shot glasses to enjoy, which tasted excellent. After that, the sushi came. All the ingredient tasted fresh, as expected, and we loved the tamago that was made in house. The service was excellent and attentive, and each dish served was explained by the server.  Overall, prices are reasonable and of value, but there are better japanese restaurants in the city to choose from."}
{"text":"Cost: Expensive (top 10-15%)
Quality: Very good - 85%
Decor: Poor - 55%
Staff: Friendly, average service - 75%
Value: 80%

Worth mentioning is the king crab congee!"}
{"text":"Aoyama is a small restaurant, but seemed quite busy when I visited. I noticed that this place is owned by Japanese people. The service was great as they attended to our needs. 

I was a bit disappointed by their sushi rolls as they were pretty plain compared to other places I have been. However, I think the main focus of this place would be their sashimi, which was very fresh. I also tried sea urchin here for the first time and it just melted in my mouth! I was excited to try their mochi ice cream for dessert, but they were out at the time :(. Instead, I just got the ice cream instead, which was flourished with a cute flower petal.

Their bathrooms are located in the basement. As you walk further towards the bathroom, it feels like you're in an entirely different place. The decor is super cute and inviting!! I suggest making reservations ahead of time as this place seems to get quite packed."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC Japanese!  Small place, but here it's all about the food. I'm a sushi snob and trust me - it's the real deal if you don't like the Fu-Fu stuff.  Very friendly and attentive service. Don't hesitate - go for it!"}
{"text":"I can not believe I hadn't heard about this place until only a few weeks ago. Located in an area you wouldn't think an authentic and delicious Japanese restaurant would be, Aoyama is my new favourite sushi place in the Scarborough/North York area. My girlfriend and I had the Akasaka Omakase menu and it was absolutely delicious. It is a bit pricy, but well worth it for a date/special occasion."}
{"text":"Love it. Small and cozy. Fantastic service and authentic Japanese. Sushi is fresh and food is excellent quality. Regular for me !"}
{"text":"Made a trip to Aoyama based on reviews and was disappointed!  I was expecting the likes of Shinobu or even Japango - expecting it to be on par with Zen would just be unrealistic - but our experience here didn't come close.  Ordered the $85 omakase sushi set for two.  The meal started out well enough with the appetizers; fried chicken was on the salty side but quite crispy on the outside and nicely moist on the inside.  The monk fish liver was great, however, the seafood soup had one tiny shrimp and one tiny scallop in it - the teapot was also gimmicky.  
Next, came the nigiri platter.  This was a great disappointment from start to finish.  The toro was chewy and definitely not nearly as great a cut as what you would get at Zen or JaBistro.  I had both pieces of uni sushi (my SO is not a fan); while the first piece was good, the second had a very fishy, metallic taste to it - not fresh at all!  What was most unbearable though was the chef's heavy hand when it came to the wasabi inside each piece of nigiri.  Maybe we've just been spoiled with the freshly grated wasabi other establishments offer, but we both teared up with each piece (and we are spice-lovers) - never had that kind of experience anywhere else, even at places like Sushi On Bloor!  The dessert was green tea mochi ice cream - over $4 for two pieces that clearly came from a run-of-the-mill boxed mochi that can be bought from T&T for much less.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Great & reasonable sushi. Simple place. Very popular among Japanese community in GTA. Not the fanciest place, but we go there for good food. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"A good a la carte sushi restaurant in this neck of the woods? Who woulda thunk it...

This restaurant is nestled in a plaza that is quite diverse but still a shock to see a japanese restaurant (KFC and Bari Hair Designs).

Nevertheless, I'm glad I found it as it has transported my taste buds back to Japan!  Having been to Japan, I was able to experience some of the freshest fish at the Tsukiji fish market and I can attest to this sashimi being on par! 

Decor:
It's a really small restaurant, so with that in mind, know this: Reservations are a must unless you plan on going in at 8:30pm
Probably at most, there are 6-7 tables that can accomodate 4 each.  

Food:
YES, the sashimi, order it!
I didn't get the chance to order the Omakase because I wasn't really in the mood to spend the big bucks so we opted for the Chef's Choice Sashimi Plate (17pieces) for 25$.  Aside from that, we ordered a roll to share as well. 
Now my view on rolls is that I prefer the westernized roll where they shove lots of stuff inside.  Japan has always been about simplicity and hence their rolls are very simple and less \"stuffed\" which I dislike.  I find that they use too much rice in the rolls.  So far, the best place for rolls is YOKO (see my other review).

Service:
Impeccable.  The waiter was so polite and smiled the whole time..even while serving.  It was borderline weird but hey, this is good service.  It's not easy to put on a smile the whole day and I appreciate it.

Overall:
The only reason why I gave it 4 is because of the rolls.  I'm just not a fan of simple rolls.  If I want simplicity, I will eat the delicious sashimi but for a roll, I want complexity in every bite:P Oh and did I mention the chef and staff are all Japanese? No poserism here.

Final thought: \"Japanese people know Japanese food...no exceptions\""}
{"text":"best sushi I've ever had. no I know what they mean when they say amazing sushi \"melts\" in your mouth. and the seafood broth was delicious"}
{"text":"Ordered Omakase Sushi set includes monkfish liver 5 stars, chicken wings yakitori 4 stars, and edamame as appetizers (just like any other Japanese restaurant), a small pot of soup (a little salty) and a big plate of sushi for two person. We also had one order of Toro sashimi, 2 pieces, which is amazing, you could feel the fish fat melting in your month and the special aroma. Honestly, I never had such flavored Toro sashimi at other places, at least not in Boston or Toronto. The total bill is $170. I have to say that the Yelp gives it $$$, meaning $31-$60, but apparently from my bill you will see it is very hard to keep it under $120 for two person.
The next morning when I woke up, the first thing came to my mind is: I must go there again, soon!"}
{"text":"Love their Uni sashimis. Makes me hungry just thinking about it. My favorite sushi place of all time. Everyone I have taken to this place gets a \"WOW\" reaction when they taste the sushi. This place gets pretty packed easily, so make sure if you are coming ub, leave room for waiting in line for a bit."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night without a reservation and we were lucky that there were available tables. The servers spoke Japanese which was a good sign that this is an authentic Japanese establishment. We ordered the sashimi platter, the grilled eggplant, and the atc roll. The scallops and the uni stand out in the sashimi platter, everything else was pretty fresh but not amazing. I found the soy sauce a bit salty and tasted like it came straight out of a bottle instead of the special ones served at other authentic Japanese establishments. The eggplant was fresh off and quite good. The arc roll with spicy tuna and avocado wasn't spicy at all, and half the roll was filled with avocado which we didn't mind since we like avocado. The food was good overall, but after they cleared the tables and we paid, we were told we had to leave, which put a damper on the experience as this was only around 45 minutes after we sat down. If there was a time limit on the tables they should have told us instead of not saying anything in the beginning and kicking us out. Other than that, not a bad place for up north."}
{"text":"The decor is average and the location is not prime, however the food is amazing! That is also how you can tell their true intention is to focus on the quality of food. 

Fresh sashimi with a unique selection (p.s. they have toro!) of both sushi and cooked foods. 

We really enjoyed the assorted sashimi dish, toro and buttered scallops. 

Service was attentive and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Depends on your priorities when eating out. For me, the amazing quality of the fish trumps the poor service. Every time I have been, its been different wait staff, but I can value the authenticity of having Japanese speaking-servers. 

As a Japanese-Canadian, I truly appreciate and continually return to the restaurant despite the poor service (inefficient serving/cleaning, forgetful of refilling tea or serving rice, etc.), simply due to the fine seafood it serves. 

The Sashimi plate is one of its specialities and I highly recommend it. The variety of fish is compelling and all served so fresh! The desserts are also pretty tasty, a big fan of mochi ice cream.

Recommendations:
- Sashimi Platter
- Chiraishi Sushi Bowl"}
{"text":"Have been to this sushi place for many many years.  The sashimi plate that we like to order was about $42 dollars in the olden days (still have the picture taken at that time).  Price for this sashimi plate has been increased many times over the years which is understandable and acceptable.  

However when I went back there last week, I found the price has been increased again to $63.  Well that's alright but the quality of the fish (have to emphasize QUALITY) is the worse I ever had.  The thickness of each piece is so thin that I can almost see through my friends sitting across me.  I can't believe this is coming from a Japanese Chef (who is also the owner).  If he doesn't know the standard thickness of a sashimi, I would suggest he go back to Japan and learn from beginning again.  The standard thickness of each piece of sashimi should be between 1/2 to 3/4 inch depends on the type of fish that they served you.  What I was getting was about 1/4 inch for all these basic fishes like salmon, tuna, yellowtail...etc.

Folks if you are looking for authentic sushi or sashimi, I suggest you think twice before you go.  If you don't know much about sushi or sashimi and don't really care about their quality, there's still hundreds of Japanese restaurants out there way better than Aoyama.

I am so disappointed with them and I would just spread the words to everyone I know not to go to Aoyama.  It is a shame to eat Japanese food with that price and quality."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Aoyama so I was hyped to come try this little gem. Another great hole in the wall Japanese restaurant. Although located in a tiny secluded plaza, this place serves very fresh sashimi. We had a great meal and will definitely be back to try more. 

Food:
Words cannot describe how fresh and delicious the sashimi was. The texture, temperature and taste was perfect. Not to mention, the sashimi platter was presented  beautifully.  I also tried the seafood porridge which was also very flavorful and nice addition to the meal. The broth was very good. Last but not least, i tried the black sesame mochi.  It was good but in my opinion, the black sesame taste wasn't strong enough. 

Decor:
A very small but cozy restaurant. You should definitely make a reservation.  The path to the washroom downstairs is also nicely decorated. Make sure err you check it out.  Great service too, they we're attentive even when it got busy."}
{"text":"Ordered:
Sashimi platter - I would give this platter 5 stars. Very fresh sashimi, had a good assortment ranging from uni to scallops and shrimp
Hokke - didn't enjoy this dish, fish was too salty and slightly dry
Dragon roll and soft shell crab roll - good but nothing special
Assorted tempura - interesting assortment which included different items like scallop and enoki mushrooms. Batter wasn't as crispy as I'd like it -- it was slightly dough-y like with only a bit of crispy.
BBQ eel rice - good and tasty portion of eel provided but a little too much sauce in the rice

Overall, if I was looking for fresh sashimi, this place would be a great option. I wouldn't come back for the other items though as they were nothing special."}
{"text":"We had the Omakase set for two people. The starter comes with chicken skewers, fish liver and edamame. Along with a small teapot of soup. So good so far :) the main has toro, alaskan king crab, uni, scallop, eel, salmon, egg, amaebi shrimp. Mmm so delicious and filling for two people, we've come here twice and both times we have ordered the omakase set because it's just too good. Every bite is so tasty, fresh and flavorful. Will definitely come back for more :)"}
{"text":"I've been to aoyama in the past and when I think about how the sushi restaurants have grown in Toronto/Markham over the past couple of yesrs, I think aoyama has fallen behind the pack. 

Foe a party of three, we order the omakase set for 2 (didn't make a reso and although it says limited quantity of 5 a day, we didn't have a problem), 3 pieces of uni sushi, and then an unagi on rice. 

The omakase set for 2 is decent value. I think it was $89 and came with a good selection of fish from scallops to uni to toro, and the regular offerings. I wouldn't say is exceptional but the price is worth it compared to a yasu or a Zen omakase. 

The uni sushi was disappointing. It was $12 a piece and wasn't spectacular . The picture showed two pieces and a dollar sign for $12 so beware. 

And if you like unagi rice, don't even bother ordering from here 

Service was a little slow but they were always nice and polite. I would consider coming back maybe as a party of two but I don't see a lot of other items I want to try here. They also don't have much of a seasonal menu so it's always the same"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. 

I had Aoyama bookmarked for the longest time and finally tried it out last week! 

We ordered the $65 Omakase for four people, and the dishes were exactly as other Yelpers described. I'm surprised they haven't changed up the menu after all these years. 

The service was exceptionally good, except that the waitresses were not fluent in English. I had to ask them many times to stop serving the next dish so fast, when we're still working on the previous dish. She also tried to bring us the next item on the menu without clearing our already cramped table. I suggested her to clear our table first before bringing us more food.. two times and she still did not get it. 

Aside from feeling rushed, the fish here is fresh! The rice in the nigiri was at just the right temperature and compact/proportional. There was also a generous amount of Uni (sea urchin). The tuna was a little too lean - I was expecting toro quality, but I guess the value of the omakase did not cover that. 

They have a great sake selection, but we tried ordering two types and was advised that they were sold out. They were also out of mochi ice cream too :( 

Reservations is a must. Most people who walk in already made a reservation, so it's probably well-known that you won't be able to get a table without one. 

Although it's great that this place is authentic, they really need to work on the pacing of their omakase. Next time, I'll be going a la carte! 

Note: 
The only difference between the $45 and $65 omakase is:
1. No Sashimi for $45 option
2. No choice of dessert for $45 option"}
{"text":"I am fortunate to live so close to this little gem. And so, it has become one of my most frequented Japanese restaurants. This restaurant has an extensive menu and all of the items are decent. My favorite dishes are fried oysters, sushi and sashimi platter and black sesame ice cream. The sashimi is fresh, but not something to rave about. I can probably get better sashimi at about the same price in this area. 

The biggest problem I have with this place is the inconsistency in the food and the service. I have had amazing meals, but would then be let down in my subsequent visits. I would get a sashimi platter with one or two pieces of fish that was just off tasting and fishy in comparison to all the others. In terms of the service, I had to wait 45 minutes for a sushi roll one time. 

This place is worth trying, but make sure you make a reservation beforehand. On busy nights, they turn away a lot of customers without one."}
{"text":"I was here for the $65 omakase and it was so much food that I was still full the next morning.  The different between the $65 and $49 omakase is apparently the addition of one sashimi dish, which for me included 3 tuna, 3 salmon, 2 tuna belly, and a spot prawn.  This makes the meal a lot of food, so I would have preferred if they had replaced the sushi dish with the sashimi dish, as they were mostly the same fish anyway, plus one sea urchin and one eel on the sushi dish.

Most of the fish was quite fresh for Toronto standards, except for the sea urchin. But the only place I've had sea urchin that I felt tasted fresh was in Japan, right next to the ocean and fish market (very key when looking for fresh seafood, I have learned), and I have to admit, I'm not really a fan of sea urchin even at it's freshest.  I also thought they could have done a better job cutting some of the fish, namely the fluke and tuna belly. They looked a little massacred, but it didn't affect the taste.

The servers were really nice, but I wouldn't exactly call the service professional. Most people probably wouldn't notice, but they kept doing noob things like bringing the next course before clearing the empty dishes from the previous course - so there's no room for put stuff down on the table and they need help juggling the plates around. I'm not trying to be a snob about the service, but having done it before, I could hear my old manager's voice echoing around my head saying, \"Always clear the empty dishes asap and don't ever put the serving tray down on the table!\".

Anyway, I like how you can get some less mainstream dishes here. Definitely need to make a reservation, as I saw them turn away people on a sunday night. I think it's possible to get same-day reservations though, as that is what I did.

Consider splitting the omakase, particularly if you get the $65 one, and order a few other dishes a la carte."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Here for the Omakase Sushi Set for 2 @ $89. Appetizers, soup and 20 pieces. 

Intimate and cozy restaurant, recommend booking reservations ahead of time. Relatively small restaurant, seats about 25 people, definitely a gem of the area.

Ya know when you have one of life experiences, where everything around you just stops. The world just pauses momentarily as you savour that moment? That happened to me just now as the toro melted on my tongue. 

Scallop sushi straight from Hokkaido. 

Overall experiences 4 starts; toro sushi 5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with my boyfriend for dinner. This was our first time visiting and we heard from friends that the restaurant was really small so we should reserve. We called at 5pm and got a reservation for 2 for 7:30pm - so glad we called cause when we showed up there were at least 6 people waiting to be seated. 

The restaurant is really small - probably has 8 - 9 tables only. It has a really cozy feel and the waitresses are super friendly. 

We ordered the sashimi omakase, avenue sushi set, 2 uni hand rolls ($3/each) and the black cod. Overall, I thought everything was really good and fresh. The price for the uni hand roll was pretty reasonable especially for the amount of uni inside. I also really enjoyed the black cod. It was only $16 and again, a great price based on the portion size we received. The flavour was great for me because I find a lot of Japanese places makes the sauce way too sweet but this sauce was more of a salty kind which I prefer. The cod also melted in your mouth instantly - delicious! For the dessert, we got the ice cream mochi in sesame flavour ($4.50) probably store bought but it was also really really yummy, probably my favourite course of the night. 

This place will definitely be my new go to sushi place :) highly recommended but definitely need to book in advance."}
{"text":"I went a couple times quite some time ago so my review will not be detailed. Overall everything we ordered was great. It's such a quaint little restaurant. It's a little expensive but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality and freshness. I'd say it's definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Aoyama 5 stars in relative terms. I have had much better sushi in Japan, however few better in Toronto. Cost is very fair. The chef is skilled and the fish is about as good as you can get in Toronto. 

The downsides are: poor atmosphere, slow service, and strip mall location in North York. And, like the few other good sushi restaurants in town, if it's your first time and you know good sushi you are going to have to really explain this to the staff or they will assume you are the same as the spicy-salmon-roll lovers who undoubtedly inundate them daily. It took me 3 times of asking \"what is your speciality\" before the waitress confessed that the hamachi cheek was excellent - and it really was. 

So, don't give up. Ask for fish using the Japanese names and read between the lines on the menu. There are some gems here. Toshi still is my #1 for overall experience but Aoyama certainly has a place. Perhaps as a regular, it could be a different story."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner at this place!  Was skeptical at first because of the small plaza it is located in, but the vip side of the restaurant (2 doors down) was very nice inside.  We sat at a booth which was comfy and private.

Shared the $89 sushi omakase and it was filling enough.  Great variety including creamy toro, mackerel, sweet shrimp, scallop, uni, etc.  Very fresh and delicious!
It also came with small appetizer dishes (chicken skewers, fish liver, beans).  Only comment would be that everything was portioned for 2 except the skewers which came in 3, suggest they up this to 4 skewers since the set is for 2 ppl.

Tea and dessert is extra, the $4 green tea or mango cheesecake was good, expect small slice though.

Overall enjoyed omakase and server was nice as well, would come back to try their other omakase options."}
{"text":"I won't bore you with the ins and outs of your typical Jap menu but suffice it to say good fresh sushi and sashimi at a decent price - 4 people 200 bucks with sake. One thing to note, opened by a Japanese man who is not in the business to cater to new clientele. You'll need to know someone or make a reservation."}
{"text":"I would have never stopped in this little strip plaza haven't I known there would be such a fantastic authentic Japanese restaurant tucked away the array for shops.

We got lucky and got reservations the day of for two (be sure to make reservations as they get booked up quickly!) We ordered the omakase for two which comes with a soup, three apps and 10 pieces of nigiri. I found that it was the perfect amount for me so I don't leave stuffed. The fish was incredibly fresh and the toro was melt in your mouth amazing!

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ok the deal with this place is the decor isn't anything special and the service can be really slow when busy.

The sushi itself though is amazing. I love the kaiso salad Which is seaweed with some sort of miso dressing. But real seaweed not the neon green stuff marinated in vinegar. Their grilled mackerel and their uni hand rolls are thumbs up. This is also one of the few places I can get black bean ice cream. 

If you are headin for dinner try and make a reservation as they book up fast."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super good. No words can described it. Fresh ingredients, tasty sashimi, traditional sushi. Own by Japanese, small hidden restaurant on Victoria park south of Finch. AMAZING. They have daily special on the tree they designed near the sushi bar. I had uni hand roll and I just want to keep reordering but I Guess it's first come first serve, they have taken off from the Special menu. Place is quite small, so reservations is recommended."}
{"text":"Me and 1 friend spent about 70 dollars. We had the Sashimi Omakase, a Spider Roll(soft shell crab), and another roll I forgot the name. The Sashimi was what I expected; very fresh and a wide variety of different types (Uni - Sea Urchin was amazing and not found everywhere). My favourite of the night had to be the Soft Shell Crab Roll/Spider Roll. It was a generous amount and used large crab leg (could have been king crab) instead of baby crabs.

Great experience and worth the price."}
{"text":"For a small Japanese restaurant and being mid town we do think its a good restaurant. The quality is not always the best or the same however are quite good in general. The price is also very reasonable however advance reservation is a must there since the restaurant is fairly small and always full booked. I personally recommend ordering separate sushi pieces from their menu and not the set Omakase since the options from self combine can be better and even more premium."}
{"text":"Come here without reservation at 7:30 on Wednesday night.  Luckily I was able to get a table for 2 with no wait possibly because they had another unit next next to the original called the VIP. 

We got the aoyama omasake and I love it still. Sashimi is very fresh and the toro sushi is so good that I wanted more!!  The course is enough for 1 person or u can share for 2 with an addition smaller dinner meal. I came out with full stomach at the end. 

Overall, I still like this place with their good service and fresh sashimi on a special occasion"}
{"text":"I can't recall the last Japanese restaurant I've been to in the GTA where there was no Chinese on the menu, the servers were fluent in Japanese themselves, and come to think of it, no AYCE -- so I was pretty stoked for what was to come. We had reservations for a weeknight and while there were plenty of walk-ins, this petite 28-seater restaurant does fill up so calling ahead is a good idea. 

We weren't sure about the portions of the tasting menus; ordered a la carte and the 3 of us were plenty stuffed at a reasonable price too (just over $30 pp):

- SASHIMI PLATTER - a mix of tuna, white tuna, shrimp, scallop, uni, salmon, Hamachi; 1-3 pieces of each. 
- TUNA AND WHITE TUNA SUSHI
- SPIDER ROLL - delicious juxtaposition of crisp soft shell crab with creamy avocado & \"dressing\" (probably a spicy mayo). nicely done.
- SHRIMP TEMPURA - this batter seemed thicker than what is usually offered, and therefore much more heavy. resembled something we make at home, so this didn't seem particularly special
- UDON - fantastically \"Q\" (al dente) noodles with a few nori ribbons here and there. 
- UNI HAND ROLL - i recall my first experience with uni as slurping a watery sac of briny rawness - terrible. THIS, however..this was J.I.M.P. good. so sweet and creamy. there was no skimping either; the uni tunneled all the way down through the roll, its creaminess oozing into the rice to the very last bite. (man! i'm salivating just thinking about it)
- HOKKE - marinated (in miso, perhaps) and grilled. it could have benefited from a little bit of sweetness to balance out the strong umami that lemon juice couldn't even penetrate. what really impressed me was that the fish was butterflied THROUGH THE SPINE. whadeoumeannnn.

Service was slow at times, but honestly the food was so good I was pretty blissed out and didn't mind."}
{"text":"A gem in Scarborough.  I have been here a few times and it never disappoints.  Great service.  High quality of food for the price.  Shrimp sashimi is a must try if available. Can't go wrong with the sushi or sashimi platter if you go with a few friends. Seating is limited,  so make sure you make a reservation a couple of days ahead of time."}
{"text":"Food was alright, the portions were tiny.
Spent money I would've spent at an AYCE without feeling satisfied/full at all... my friends and I walked nearby for some snacks after.
Also, service by the girls were so sweet and nice! Then the dude who served us last was, frankly, really rude. It almost ruined the experience for me :\"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go to this restaurant but they are only open after 5:30pm during the weekdays.  Customer service was okay.  I don't like the hours and the place is small which is why I am giving this place an A-OK rating.  We came there exactly at 5:30pm and got a seat, it started getting crowded at around 6pm, made me a little claustrophobic there.

The food was good.  I didn't like the fact that they did not make Bento boxes but I love the specials that they had.  We tried the sushi platter, assortment of maki rolls, spicy hand rolls and other daily specials like the Kaki fry."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. However, you compare the price and quality you get from downtown Japanese restaurants, Aoyama is more expensive than downtown and by far not as fresh and tasty. I got the Aoyama course hoping it would be good, cause that meal was like 60 dollars before tax and tips. O man did it disappoint me. It was a 8 course meal, including dessert and appetizer. 

Two of the courses was worse than all you can eat restaurants: the tempura and salt soup. They give you small portions of sushi and sashimi portions. I mean for 60 dollars. I expect food for like a king. 

They gave me 7 sushi: 1 uni sushi, 1 eel, 1 red tuna, 2 cheap ass toro, one red snapper, and one salmon. For sashimi, they gave me 12 pieces of sashimi: 3 red tuna, 3 shrimp, 3 butterfish, 3 salmon.

Overall, I don't think I'll come back again."}
{"text":"The Good: The fish was amazingly fresh and every piece melted like butter. Their beef was cooked just right and the seaweed salad was flavoured with just enough dressing without over powering it. Presentation was well done and everything was clean. 

The Bad: We changed tables twice. First time because our table was right next to a baby's high chair. And when I say next to, the baby turned around and reached for our table's soy sauce. Look, if you don't have that much space, don't try cramming people in because that's just going to cause some accident to happen. The second time we moved was because my friend's chair was in the path of the waitress that needed to get in a out. She had to move at least 3 times before our food even arrived to let other ppl get thru. Word of advice, take away 2 of the tables so people aren't crammed in like sardines. Yes, you can get 4 more extra customers (2 seats were still free because it was a horrible spot to be in), but it wont be likely you'll get return customers.

One waitress for the whole restaurant (approx. 20 people there). People at other tables were either waiting for their bill, water (15 min before we even got a cup of tea), or just waiting to get seated. 

The Overall: I would've given them a 4 or 5 star, but the service was unfortunately bad. The food made up for it, but even when there was only around 15 people left in the restaurant and most of us were just eating and chatting, every table had to ask for a pot of tea rather than the waitress coming over to refill our cups. 

Revisit: Most likely not. Service on a Wed evening was subpar. And it's not the fault of the waitress because they were severely understaffed. Change that and it will be a big improvement."}
{"text":"Aoyama is some of the freshest sushi that I've ever eaten in Toronto - it's pricey, but it's not outrageous for what you're getting. For the quality and service that you're receiving, it is actually quite reasonable in my opinion. I've been here a couple times now, their boats and sets are quite decent - but the star of the show are their specials on their little menu that are cutely drawn.

Usually their uni (~$10-$12/piece) and toro are my go to - but if you're looking for a cheaper alternative that is super filling yet high quality and delicious - go for the spicy salmon or spicy tuna handrolls ($3.50/handroll). The handrolls are well made - with the tuna or salmon literally overflowing from beginning to end and SUPPPES fresh. 

Upon my last visit, they have actually acquired the store two doors down from them - (on the right if you're facing their store), and on the corner of the sign is a small \"aoyama vip,\" we had made a reservation for 6, entered their main store and told to leave and go to the aoyama vip and ring the doorbell. There, a lady opens the door and sets you as per your reservation. It is FAR more spacious than their main store. Their OG store is quite cramped, seats very close together; whereas their VIP store kind of seems like a beautiful cigar swag lounge. It's swanky, yet comfortable and nice, definitely gives you more room and privacy. They don't have the sign up with all the specials, just ask the waitress and she'll bring you an iphone with a photo of what they have! Hey, that works for me! 

We ordered the omakase set (for 2 people - around $80something altogether). It's a beautiful sushi set, with appetizers (chicken skewers, liver & edamame) and seafood soup in a teaset style. It came with 20 pcs of sushi and 6 pcs of salmon roll - everything was super fresh. We ordered some items from their special menu off the iphone as well.

We were BEYOND full by the time we were done and satisfied as well! Omakase was a good choice - they only serve 5 a day, worth getting!"}
{"text":"Best soft shell crab I've had so far. A little bit on the pricier end, 3 person fam racked up a 144 bill. 

Ordered Sashimi Platter, Dragon Roll,  ATC roll, and Hamachi. 

Great and friendly service."}
{"text":"Hands down love this place upon my initial visit. Was totally not expecting the decor or level of service or quality and quantity of food. I was surprised to find out there was a separate adult area next door and it was decorated very intimately with reds, warm browns, chandeliers and embellished velvet chairs. MMF! It's the details that really made this place amazing, and the place is well air conditioned and heated!

The food was magnificent, I ordered the unagi on rice and they were very generous with their portions which I am highly pleased with. Their rare beef was definitely to my liking, the udon was a nice and light dish, and the tea was tasty. 

Also our servers and the service was stellar as they kept coming back to make sure everything and everyone was enjoyable and enjoyed their meal. They came promptly and cleared our tables. 

Would recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in North York. 

I really like the omakase sushi set for 2 ($89). This is also a great choice for people who would like to try different kinds of tasty sushi with a reasonable price. 
The uni sushi is pretty fresh and sweet, and it is not fishy at all. It worth to try.

Not much to say, I love this place very much, and I will recommend this restaurant to my friends.

There is not much inside seats, so a reservation will save your time."}
{"text":"Small dining room without sushi bar.  Authentic cuisine made and served by Japanese.  Sushi was very fresh and tasty.  Good variety, including high-end toro.   Service was cute, competent and courteous."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town.

Great value and great quality.  

I highly recommend this place but make sure you get a reservation or else you most likely won't get seated.  This is a very small restaurant with limited seating.

The omakase is a great no hassel meal if you just want sushi without thinking.  The soup in the teapot is pretty damn good.

There's also a daily special menu with items like spicy Salmon handrolla etc.  And it's always priced very reasonably.

Try it out, you won't be diaappointed!"}
{"text":"Finest and authentic Japanese cuisine I have had outside of Japan in decades! It was so enjoyable being able order and converse in Japanese...Well worth the every penny spent!"}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss here. The first time I went, service was great and food was great. The second time was a big disappointment. 
Sushi was so so. Had the kaki fri which was one grease ball of oyster with a strong taste. The tako salad was barely edible. The uni hand roll was a HUGE let down. 
I found the price a bit high, for the over all level of service and ambience you would expect if I'm dishing out 50 per person."}
{"text":"Good prices for the quality of sushi and food. I always get the delux sushi.  Their spicy salmon and uni handrolls are awesome deals. Tried their omakase once, it was good, but I prefer the delux sushi. Grilled hokke is really tasty and juicy as well if you like grilled fish. However, service is very slow, but the servers are very nice. Its a small place so seating feels abit cramped too."}
{"text":"I just want to update my review on my experience on the 65 dollar omakase course (as seen in the pictures). Overall, great food, but for me the sushi and sashimi selection (which to me was the most important) was a bit underwhelming.

First off, Appetizer Salad. \"An appetizer salad made with seaweeds, topped with mountain potatoes and King crab, and seasoned with mayo-sesame dressing. A course special salad!\" I was surprised that this was the most memorable salad ever.

Usuzukuri: Was ok, a new experience, but somehow it was not for me.

The sashimi consisted of salmon, tuna that was either maguro or medium toro or somewhere in between, sweet shrimp, and what may have been kanpachi (forgot). Overall decent, but I sort of expected more exotic variety (some Uni, Giant Clam, or Scallops) like on the omakase sushi set.

Butter fried Lobster and Shrimp tempura were very good.

The sushi was over all decent (see picture), but I somehow expected more exotic variety. This time there was Uni, but still not on par with the omakase sushi set.

The final was a choice of dessert, and I chose the black bean ice cream. It was also good.

The Verdict:
Very good food overall, but I feel the omakase sushi set is in general a bit better in quality (come on, there's toro!)

This visit for this 65 dollar omakase course, 9/10 for quality, 9/10 for the service, 8/10 for the value. 8.5/10 overall (not an average). 

Please see my previous review on the omakase sushi set. I feel that's a better representation of what I feel for this restaurant (since I've ordered a couple more of those since then :) )."}
{"text":"I would say the best valued-sushi in Toronto area. Pretty good bank of the buck. I always order the single portion sushi for $20 dollars or the 50 dollar sushi for two. their uni is pretty fresh and with that price you get to taste TORO!!!!!! Not \"O-Toro\" but \"Middle-Toro\" which is still hard to come by in a place like Toronto."}
{"text":"Good food, HORRIBLE customer service. This particular incident shocked me enough for me to write a negative review. 

I am a repeat customer because I live in the area. They have authentic Japanese food prepared in ways that you do not necessarily see elsewhere, but usually at a higher price than other places too.  I have ordered their Aoyama Omakase set as well as their various rolls. The set was good to try once, but I don't know if I would again due to the price.

I called in to get my usual order for pick up. I asked for a Dragon Roll, the girl who answered said they never had it on their menu. Odd because I always order it and I have pictures of the menu to prove it. I asked what she had then, she promptly said \"there are no menus for phone orders\".  Who says that? I could only order if I knew what I wanted (which I did but she said they don't have it!) Then she hung up on me.

Please ensure whoever answers calls to have some sort of phone etiquette! You do not hang up on customers who are trying to place a routine order. It is very rude and it doesn't matter if your food is good if your customer service chases people away. I will not be returning, there are similar places I can easily go to."}
{"text":"I don't care how good your food is, what horrible service! I made reservations at 8, when I walked in, the waitresses totally ignored me for half an hour before giving me a table as if I was begging them!!! It'll be greatly appreciated if they can at least so hi to acknowledge my presence! The three of us stood there like idiots before hearing my name as we got assigned to our spot!! Thank you! I will not come again!"}
{"text":"I came here twice: first time at their regular seating and second time in their VIP section. It's Japanese owned and they have some cutesy decoration in their regular seating section. VIP area is super quite, you kind of almost feel like you're in Ginza.

Take advantage of their daily specials, especially if you like the uni sushi wrap for $4 (depending on seasonal price). Although, I've heard sometimes their uni is not fresh enough. I'm not sure if their sashimi platter is worth the $$$ price. 

They only serve 5 sets of Omakase daily and incl. tax it's about $100 for two. They serve the same fish type every time, therefore I'm not exactly sure if that's the true definition of omakase. The best pieces were uni, toro, scallop and tomago. 

The appetizers tasted fine, which included edamame, glazed chicken skewers, fish, and seafood miso soup. 

I would come back again, but not for their omakase."}
{"text":"Though this restaurant is on the higher end of prices sushi restaurants, the price is well worth it for the quality of sashimi/sushi. This is the closest place you can get to quality, authentic Japanese food. My table ordered a variety of their dishes which included rice dishes, their winter snow crab congee, sushi platter for 2 and we were all pleased. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of sashimi that came in my sushi, especially the rare sashimi like sea urchin. Their mochi for dessert was also so fresh and flavorful. Definitely will be back. Also love the decor of this place and though small, its quaint and bathrooms downstairs are very uniquely decorated (especially the hello kitty attire)"}
{"text":"One word FRESH!

This restaurant is a bit pricey though, but you get what you pay for.  The freshest sashimi, and the best made sushi. 

Also Fried oysters are mega yummy too."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and sashimi!  The restaurant is small and intimate and you will definitely require reservations as walk-ins are often turned away, or if you are the lucky few and they just might may be able accommodate you.

We started off with the sashimi platter, which offered a colourful array of salmon, maguro, crab meat, uni, scallops, hokkigai, and yellowtail.  Then onto a plate of buttered scallops, an order of O-toro, negi-toro, spicy salmon and spicy tuna handrolls (which are only $3.50 each !).  The meal was finished off with two slices of cheesecake in Mango and Matcha flavour.

Aoyama provided an authentic Japanese dining experience that will leave you desiring more.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  The freshness of the sashimi is enough to bring you back again!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming to Aoyoma and like the past 2 times their food was super fresh. So far I have tried their omakase set for 2, sashimi set for 2, soba noodles and Wagyu beef on the grill. This time I also got to try their matcha cheesecake. The matcha flavour was subtle, but the cake was extremely smooth.

The service was excellent. They explained to us what the sushi were and gave us a short informative session regarding the Wagyu beef. We went as a party of 5, and the food came at a timely fashion, allowing us time to enjoy the food and chat.

The most memorable food was the shrimp sashimi . It had the moist, \"chewy\" texture which instantly reminded me of the ones I had in Japan. Another shout out was that they serve perilla leaves with the sashimi set. You rarely see that at Japanese restaurants in Toronto. The leaves go really well with the salmon sashimi, bringing out the flavour of the fish.

Will I come again? Without hesitation! 

Tip: Remember to book a reservation if you come on a weekend."}
{"text":"This has turned out to be one of our go-to Japanese restaurants in the area! This Japanese restaurant is runned by Japanese people, so you can actually see the difference in the food and the over-all atmosphere.

I ordered the Dragon roll, which was really good! Fresh fish and the portion wasn't humongous! Which is a plus(no left overs, no feeling very full) :) While my Girlfriend had the Tempura Udon, she really liked it and commented that it tasted very clean. Clean in a way that the flavours you get is not too overpowering and not \"In your face\" as she said.

Looking back, we'll definately come back!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with pretty high expectations and for the most part they nailed in, in terms of the food. 

Service was a little iffy although it wasn't too busy at 8:30, server wasn't too attentive and had trouble explaining each each of sushi to us. When it came time to get the bill had to flag her down, same with getting more water/tea when our cups were empty

Food was as expected as I came specifically for the Sushi Omakase set for 2, I called in to make a same-day reservation and also requested that I reserve one of omakase sets as they only serve 5 a day. Everything on the platter was amazing but the uni seemed a little dated which didn't bother me cause I don't like uni anyways lol. On top of the platter we also got the butter scallops which were a little overcooked but the sauce paired with it made up for it! The apps that came with the platter were less than memorable but freebies are freebies I suppose lol. 

Overall, I really enjoyed it and the price point matched the quality of the fish, toro being my favourite it was nice that there was 4 pieces of it. If the service was a little better they would get the full 5 stars but that isn't going to stop me from coming back! I've yet to try other higher end sushi restaurants but I think this was a good starting point before going to Yasu and or Zen. (Nobu doesn't count LOL)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very tiny. We made reservations and was seated in the VIP area which had lovely decor.


We ordered the omakase which is $89 for 2 people. Note: the omakase has limited quantity each day. It's a good price for the quality you receive. 

We also ordered a fluke sashimi which we thought was very fresh and yummy.

The omakase comes with appetizers and soup. It was good but I was not blown away. However, the sushi was great quality. I would say this is one of the better quality restaurant that not located downtown. 

Service was OK. 

Overall, the experience was great but it didn't 'wow' me compared to other omakase that I tried. Great sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has great sashimi! Many special fish that you can't get at your ordinary Japanese restaurant.  I don't like congee BUT this place is an exception... Great soup broth filled with generous sushi grade fish/scallops/crab legs and more.

It's a small place that is closed half the time but it is surely with a trip.  I had their beef bento special is it was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting friends and we went to this place by chance because it was very close to the friends we were visiting. To our delight this place has very authentic Japanese style sushi. The food was very good and the service was very good too. The price was high but with the US to CAD exchange rate we spent just under $100 for two people without any alcohol."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner...food solid as usual. We got the sushi omakase and the sashimi plate and a soft shelled crab. All fantastic and the service is attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent home style Japanese food with excellent service! Price is fair if you're looking for real Japanese food. Many different fish selections and specials. The restaurant is family owned and run. Oksan (wife) does the cooked foods while Masa Endo holds down the sushi/sashimi bar! All of the servers are excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely authentic and my friends think they have the best omakase sushi in the GTA. Prices are high. Quality is good.

The restaurant is sort of in a hidden plaza on Vic Park. You would drive past it without knowing. So it's considered to be a hidden gem although it is always packed since regulars love it and the interior is tiny with limited tables but very cute (fun tip: check out their Hello Kitty everything washrooms for photo ops).

I love the \"double black\" sesame ice cream here. Even asked them where they got it. Good service."}
{"text":"I loved its omakase.  Don't forget to take a look at the daily special items written on the chalkboard!"}
{"text":"Aoyama is another hidden gem in the Scarborough/North York area. This place is a must for reservations as it is very small. However this little gem has absolute great food. Even though they do get very busy, the staff attend to us as much as possible. 

2nd time to try their sushi. We were hand picking our sushi. The server recommended us to try the sushi omakaze. This is absolutely to die for. We added a hamatchi belly sushi. Yummmmmmm! 

Food does get a bit pricey but it is worth it. Atmosphere is busy and casual. But the smell of food is the best aroma after all."}
{"text":"My parents love this place. The Chef and the quality are amazing. The service is great if George is your server, but if not... lol - I hope you have some patience. 

We made a reservation and finally got to sit in the VIP Lounge. They walked us over and rang the doorbell. It only seats 4 tables. It's more quiet and less crowded. 

Unfortunately George was not our server tonight, so I'm docking a star cause the service definitely needs some work. He was fine with ordering and such, but the extra stuff isn't good. 

There was one guy serving in this lounge, while a girl was behind the bar helping with food related things, and our table was the only new one. He had to be prompted to place down plates and chopsticks (even though he put down seaweed to an empty table), as well as clear some plates and fill drinks. 

The Chef Special Sashimi Plate never disappoints. My favourites are the Hamachi, Scallops, Crab and Shrimp. The uni wasn't featured today due to quality! Our server let us replace it with Hamachi Belly instead, but they ran out by the time our order was being prepared. 

Spicy Tuna Handroll isn't as good as the Spicy Salmon Handroll! The Salmon is also $0.50 more - probably better quality?

Beef Tataki is always great as well. Make sure to add the garnishes (carrot/radish) into the sauce - for a full explosion of taste! 

Tomago Sushi is my moms favourite! It's a must order.. no place else will compare - unless you go to Japan yourself!

Grilled Salmon (the one with the longer name) was pretty fatty - very soft though. 

Grilled Octopus was paired with ginger. It wasn't that special, in my opinion. 

Banana Tempura Sundae is not on the menu, but it's my absolute favourite! If you ask nicely, they'll make it happen for you. 

Green Tea Mochi - if you're not absolutely craving, save your $4 and go to TnT to grab a box (I saw them unload the mochi from a box)!"}
{"text":"Finally I got in and try their food. Yes it's very good and fresh. The service is also very good. It is one of the best sushi I've ate in Toronto. The down side of this restaurant is the place. Very uncomfortable and small. If I'm paying couple hundred of dollar to eat I would like to seat in a better atmosphere. Spend a little more time to enjoy it. 4 people took only 50 min for the whole dinner. Although the food and service is good but that's it!"}
{"text":"I am going against the grain by giving this place 2 stars but I feel they really handled an issue With our reservation (their mistake) so poorly, that set the mood for the whole night.

So yes, as it's been beaten to death before two main theme here are:

- The place is owned/operated by Japanese.
- Make a reservation as the place is tiny.

Our food was pretty good, I'd say very authentic specially the temperature, no cold fish straight out of the fridge which was great.

The main problem: I had made a booking and requesting a Child seat. Once we arrived though we were informed that the child seat was already in use (by another family who seemed to have sat down not much earlier) and while the Japanese girl was profusely apologetic and took the blame for making a mistake, this really ruined our experience as we made a long trek to try this place and ended up having to take turns holding on to a squirmy, hungry 2 y/o so each of us could eat. To add insult to injury she took away the extra one chair from the 4 person table we were at so we had no place to dump all our baby gear but the ground!

I expected they would at the very least serve us an appetizer or a small order as an apology but nope, nothing was done to make amends. Needless to say we rushed through the dinner and left feeling extremely let down.

Going back to the trusty ol' Mi-ne in Richmond Hill closer to home with food that rivals this place."}
{"text":"This place is a legit Japanese Sushi experience with an ACTUAL Japanese chef.  We started off with their sashimi platter which is to die for.  It even had fresh sea urchin which makes my mouth water as I think about it. Great cuts of sashimi, well presented.  We also had Shrimp and Veg Tempura, Dragon Rolls, California Rolls, Sake, BBQ Eel. Everything was excellent.

This is by far my favorite Sushi joint in the GTA.  I would recommend anyone to go.  Be sure to make reservations, it's not a big place, so if you have a big group, be sure to plan well in advance."}
{"text":"I am visiting Toronto from NYC for a couple of days, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the sushi at Aoyama. Fresh and delicious are the keywords, but I would add original, friendly and reasonably priced. I wish I could bring this place home with me, but since I can't: Enjoy, Toronto. Lucky you."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem of sushi. Small but very accommodating. With out reservation they made every effort to seat is even though they were fully booked"}
{"text":"A cozy little restaurant in a small plaza.  The fish was very fresh but the portion was a bit small.  We ordered the sushi omakase (for 2 people) and a sashimi omakase (for 1 person) to share among 3 people but it wasn't quite enough.  The uni was very very very delicious!! I wanted to add an order of uni handroll but it was sold out (it was only 8pm!!!!!)  Make sure you make reservations.  We came on a monday night and the restaurant was packed throughout our meal."}
{"text":"I didn't believe my GPS when it said 'Arriving at Aoyama' but as I drove by I did see the white sign.  I guess it's not a place you would normally look for a Japanese restaurant as there is nothing else Asian related in this plaza or the one beside it.  GPS got lucky this time!

A small place that has enough decorative aspects to make the stay pleasing, but watch out for that PLANT thing at the corner of the counter as you walk towards the washroom.  It might look friendly until you whack it and hoping nothing falls from it.

Given 1 menu which has the Omakase and A La Carte menu items while the other laminated piece of paper shows 2 selection of Meal Sets for this Lunch which we made sure it was reserved as I've learned my lesson at Zen before.

Wakame Set(Sushi, Sashimi and Tempura $21) was presented to us in 2 separate bowls and 2 separate timing as well.  The Sushi would come in the latter part as it was very nice with good size and shape as well as temperature and texture with each piece being a mouthful even for my BIG mouth.  It even came with an UNI Sushi as my friend would say, WIN!  

The Sashimi were GREAT as well with the Tuna piece being a bit thicker for a good bite.  The Tempura(Shrimp, Squash, Eggplant) however is standard fare which I wished it was lefted out to lower the cost of this Meal Set.  It came with Edamame which is a nice touch.

I've been on a HUNT for Grilled Unagi($15) which is common in Tokyo, also where they charge you a mortgage for as it is a specialty item.  The menu stated it was grilled as I was able to pick out that character which is Chinese as well.  Better than most too soft pre-cooked Unagi out there.  Even had the charred piece, YUMMY!

I asked Jen K what that Leaf was under the Salmon Sashimi but she didn't know and started chewing on it.  I guess we found out it wasn't poisonous as she was able to write the review.  Jen K will eat anything if you keep telling her you don't know.  That common Leaf offered at Japanese Restaurants is SHISO Leaf or Perilla which I found at H-Mart before.

In a packed lunch hour of roughly 30 seats, mostly of Japanese decent.  1 group of Japanese Businessmen, another group of Japanese women, it kind of gives me a reason to believe this place is the REAL deal.  Not for the low budget crowd but it definitely holds value, therefore I do not regret for once I paid $30 for this lunch.

Shiso Leaf: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perilla"}
{"text":"best sushi restaurant. run by Japanese. sushi and sashimi are always fresh. Place is really small.. and busy. Reservation is always required."}
{"text":"Make a reservation ahead of time, it's an extremely small restaurant owned by Japanese people. In addition, you can check out the times that they are opened as they are opened a few hours a day.

Even with a reservation, we had to wait about 10 minutes due to the small number of seats. The waitresses were extremely friendly and had great service as they introduced the daily specials and took our order.

Although this restaurant may seem slightly pricey, the food is worth it. The salmon, tuna, shrimp, crab, scallop and uni raw platter was delicious and appeared as though it will melt in your mouth. The daily special King Crab was cooked and presented fairly well. though I felt like it was slightly cold. The menu for the daily special was drawn out really nicely with little cartoons hung up on the tree. 

The dessert menu had little embellishments placed on them. I wasn't a big fan of the dessert though because I felt like I was able to reproduce it myself by purchasing a tub of green tea ice cream and  mixing red bean into it.

The bathroom was downstairs and frankly I'm not a big fan of downstairs bathrooms, but it was a hello kitty themed downstairs bathroom with nice soap and lotion for you to clean your hands."}
{"text":"My boyfriend recommended this place for date night on the weekend and we had an overall pleasant experience. The interior has a relaxing/romantic vibe and the food was delicious. We ordered the sashimi platter and it was filling for both of us as it came with appetizers.  
Definitely a popular place, and fairly small in size, so be sure to make reservations. We waited around 20 minutes before getting a seat. The washrooms are a secret gem!"}
{"text":"This place was one of my favorite sushi restaurant. I have to admit I was impressed by the presentation and quality of the food before but the last three times I went there either the presentation or the quality was good anymore. 
 
Btw, although all the severs were very polite and friendly but some of them really need to improve their English and need training on their service."}
{"text":"My partner and I booked a reservation. Given that we love to eat sushi, it's a shock that we've never gone to Aoyama when it's so close. I also went to Jabistro (on Richmond Street West) and here is what I found...

Aoyama is more price effective then going to eat at many other high end sushi locations.
Aoyama is also much more delicious than Jabistro.
Aoyama was incredibly filling. My partner can eat quite alot and he was beyond comfortably full.

We ordered the omakase set which came with 3 appetizers, miso soup and the omakase sushi ($97). The omakase set is for 2 ppl. That's 10 pieces of sushi per person and 3 of pieces of the salmon hasomaki each. I think that this would be sufficient for 2 people.

However, we also ordered the sashimi omakase and it was quite fresh. I've never had fresh red tuna in Canada. Never. But this was fresh. :) I've worked in a sushi restaurant before and had red tuna in many restaurants (including those in Japan). These were the freshest and nicest cuts of red tuna I've had in Canada. I don't have any complaints regarding the other pieces on the omakase set. However, I don't think we can fully appreciate the uni sushi. It's too fishy and sea water pungent for our liking. ( I believe it's an acquired taste.) But that was fine, we just packed that to go and gave it to a friend who actually likes uni. However if you know that you don't  like uni, you can ask the waitress to substitute the uni for something else (aside from the toro). 

We also ordered the omakase sashimi ($29). Apparently, you can eat the shrimp head. It was fresh and delicious. Very value for how fresh the sashimi was. 

Would come back. The ambience was also very nice. They took us to this separate area and it kinda made me feel like a princess :) I liked it there. Would definitely come back.

Oh only down side we came across, the seaweed/Nori o
n the spicy Salmon handroll was kinda soggy and not crispy."}
{"text":"Aoyama is a fantastic place for authentic Japanese food and I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here from start to finish. I do recommend to reserve (and early) as all the tables were reserved when we first stepped in. 
 
We started off with the house special sashimi platter which had a great variety of sashimi. I was told that some of the items were directly from Japan. The items were incredibly fresh and were melt in your mouth. My favourites were the shrimp (huge pieces!), and the sea urchin.

The una-tama (grilled eel egg) on rice was also incredibly savoury and delicious. The egg was just perfectly cooked and fluffy. The eel was great and wasn't fishy at all, but there probably wasn't enough of it.

We ended getting two of the special rolls - the spider roll and the spicy salmon shrimp tempura, and I enjoyed both. You could actually taste the toppings on the inside of the rolls for once because at many places they are over-doused with sauce and mayo, and stuffed with cucumbers and avocado. The spicy salmon wasn't stuffed with breadcrumbs, and there was a ton of soft-shell crab in every piece. 

To finish the meal, the green tea cheesecake was perfect. It wasn't overly sweet and had a great balance of cheesy-ness and green tea.

The prices here were extremely reasonable considering the quality of what you're getting and I have no problem paying a premium for authentic and quality food."}
{"text":"I came here after hearing that the place is authentic. And boy the sushi is pretty legit here.

The chopstick holders are hidden under the teacups and are very cute.

The washrooms have adorable 'kawaii'-type decoration, and have complementary magazines that have coupons for other Japanese vendors around Toronto.

Avenue 246 Deluxe Sushi ~$23
tuna, albacore, salmon, hamachi, egg, shrimp, uni, fish roe, eel
- all pieces of sushi were well made; the rice doesn't fall apart like any all you can eat sushi buffet
- each piece is really fresh, rich in the taste of fatty acids
- savour the fish roe especially

Sashimi Okamase ~$27
shrimp (tail + head), albacore, salmon, tuna, scallop, uni, squid
- again each piece is really good
- they're both equally amazing dishes but imo it's more worth getting the dish above if you want a full experience since this one is mostly albacore tuna and has slightly less variety.
- savour the scallop and salmon especially

Uni hand roll~ 2 for $5
Sea Urchin ~ MP
- It's the only thing I was too hyped for! It wasn't the freshest unfortunately but it's all luck right?

Blue Fin Fatty Tuna ~ MP
- just get it. you will not regret it one bit!!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the most obscure strip of old shops on Victoria park, I would have never found this gem of a place if not for a friend's recommendation. 

The first thing I noticed was that this small restaurant was packed and there's a really legit looking Japanese sushi chef working the sushi bar. Authenticity on first impression - check. 

After careful consideration, we ordered the sashimi and sushi platter and loved them both. The sushi is really fresh and you can tell the difference from the first bite. They don't cheap out on the quality yet everything is reasonably priced. Sweet shrimp, fatty tuna, scallops, uni.. yummm. I'm pretty picky with my fish to sushi rice ratio and they nailed it here. We also got the king crab which was on special but that was just alright.. I would focus on the raw stuff.

It's currently uni season so don't miss out if ur a fan! We all got uni hand rolls - soooo sweet and delicious.. uni goodness down to the last bite. I would go back in a heartbeat just for that.

The restaurant itself is small, I was bumping into people's seats left and right trying to make it through the door.. so definitely is not the most comfortable and spacious area but make a reservation and authentic & satisfying sushi awaits!"}
{"text":"found this little restaurant in here, it really suprised me.
i'm just so lucky that we can have a table right away without any reservation, maybe i'm there early. 
we ordered the uni hand roll, chirashi, eel rice and the toro, everything is good. I see so many people order the sashimi platter, it looks so good to me. For sure will try it next time. 
Everything is great!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is in my neighbourhood and I eat here pretty often (More often than any financial advisor would like).

Aoyama (and Aoyama VIP - right now it seems more for Aoyama overflow than anything else) is a bit of an odd beast. There are really two different food experiences to be had here which deserve different levels of praise.

First, let us talk about the omakase for two, it has gone up a few bucks since I first had it but this in my opinion is why you come to Aoyama. At about 90 bucks for two, it is not cheap but for such good sushi, the sting to the wallet is dulled. It starts off with some simple appetizers, nothing too special, some monk fish liver (foie gras of the sea, so to speak), some chicken with spring onion skewers, and the old adage of edamame.

A nice seafood soup is served inside of a teapot alongside these appetizers. I once read a review that docked this place a star because they found this inconvenient. I have my thoughts on that but writing reviews on reviews sounds like an endless cycle waiting to happen.

What follows is a very solid platter of sushi. This is where the difference lies between whatever else you eat at Aoyama. This is the best of what Aoyama has to offer, this is what is flown in, imported painfully far (sometimes across the country, like the Uni/Sea Urchin from Vancouver, sometimes across the world like tuna and scallop from Japan). The other sushi or sashimi platters I have had here just do not live up to it.

Do not get me wrong, there are some gems here, the Negitoro (think slightly minced tuna in a light dressing), the Una Ju (some of the best eel rice I have ever had - I am comparing this to places in Japan and South Korea), the tasty hand rolls, and the Akasaka/Aoyama courses that offer a little bit of everything are all worth trying.

I know it sounds like I have overhyped the omakase for two here (and maybe I have) but If you do not find the omakase platter up to par, please message me and tell me where you are eating instead because that is where I want to eat."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Aoyama Restaurant. Previously - I've been at Zen multiple times, Sushi Kaji as well as Yasu. My review therefore is reflective how Aoyama performs against best sushi restaurants in town.

Let's get down to the star of the show - Omakase Sushi set for 2 for $89 I believe. Wow. The spread spares no expense. Scallop, sweet shrimp, Toro, Sea Urchin to name the highlights. Each pieces was so fresh and comparable to the best sushi joint in town. I don't think anywhere in GTA, you could get such value for good quality sushi. This is a must order if you are at Aoyama. We also ordered Sashimi Omkase (for 1) at $27. I would rate this dish as good but not stellar. Compared to the Omakase Sushi, this is probably just the slightest step back since it is missing Toro :) Finally, we ordered spider roll for $20. The roll was excellent and arguably one of the best tasting spider roll I've tried. Although, this is probably not a must order if you go Aoyama.

Service was undeniably graceful, professional, and very prompt. Our server was extremely attentive and proficient. The service is comparable to the best in the industry.

Let's face it. GTA is not in shortage of excellent Sushi joint. There are Zen, Yasu, Kaji or Hiro that will gladly satisfy your sushi craving - at a price however. Aoyama represents a great value for a high end sushi. Don't get me wrong, Aoyama isn't a cheap place, but within reason, say within $100 per person, you can satisfy your sushi craving."}
{"text":"I can finally take the bookmark off this place. Aoyama as been around for years. Though the plaza doesn't look inviting as the signage outside, Aoyama is as classic and authentic Japanese it gets.  Recommendation is to make reservations as seating is limited.
Their prices are higher than your average sushi and the quality is pretty good, but I've been to other sushi places that are comparable and are forgiving to your wallet.
Here is quality and presentation over portion. They've got a good selection on their menu with some optional set meals.
We started with a bottle of their sake
Akasame sashimi dish with included sea urchin which I quickly realized I wasn't a fan of LOL. However presentation was awesome and quality was superb. 
If you're coming here for a meal take notice the sign at the front of the door regarding stragglers coming in to use the washroom. It'll crack you up, but you'll realize why."}
{"text":"Walked in for dinner for two on a Wednesday night, we were the first ones there at around 5:30pm. All the tables already had the \"reserved\" sign.

My friend ordered the Akasaka course and I ordered the Aoyama course.  Food came very quickly, and the presentation of everything was great!

The usuzukuri was delicious. My friend ate it without realizing it was raw, and he never eats sashimi.

The butter fried lobster was disappointingly bland. I tried to eat them the way it was cooked without dipping condiments, but could barely taste a hint of salt in any pieces. May be good in a way for those who are health conscious.

The tempura was really fresh and the amount of batter was perfect.  I was happy to find 3 pieces of shrimp!  It would've been nice if there was the option of eating with different salt, but it was never offered or introduced by the restaurant.

The sushi was nicely presented and really fresh. I was glad that my uni was sweet and wished I had ordered more.

Overall, the restaurant is worth the splurge.  

However, 3 instead of 4 stars as customer service needs to be improved.  I understand we walked in without a reservation, but they shouldn't need to think twice before saying we could stay and eat before their customers come.  If they had politely suggested us to make a reservation now and come back tomorrow, I would've felt better. The only reason I stayed was because my friend had a bad day and really needed this treat.  My plate on the table was dirty with what looked like salad dressing, too. And although food came quick with superb presentation, we felt rushed to finish and leave. There were two other dishes waiting for me to devour while I was still working on my first dish.  I think that was rude and not very professional... it's a course that I ordered, right? Something for the restaurant to think about!"}
{"text":"We arrived here for my girlfriend father's birthday one humid Monday evening in late June.

I was the last to arrive in this small party of 5 so I do not know how enthusiastic the greeting was if any. 

My first impression was how small and cozy this restaurant was, tucked in a small plaza on the edge of western Scarborough.   I would wager that this place could seat no more than 26 people at most.

For a weekday, all of their tables were filled and a small group or two waited outside as the evening progressed.  I noticed that there was only one sushi chef working the sushi bar, and perhaps one working in the back kitchen.  

Reviews on other Internet sites recommended the omakase sashimi plate.  At the price they were asking, one would expect the high quality ingredients to be used.  

We also ordered the omakase dinner, thinking the omakase sashimi plate would supplement our group.

The small bits and pieces of the omakase dinner - at least, the cooked portions arrived quickly.  Nothing quite stood out as we were looking more forward to the sushi. 

We noticed that it was taking quite a long time following the last plate delivery from our omakase dinner.  We had just finished the chicken yakitori skewers and it would be another 20-25 minutes before the next plate would arrive.  

The fish looked fresh, but what struck me most was the use of tube wasabi, and pink pickled ginger.  Please allow me to explain:

1. Tube wasabi as sushi enthusiasts would know is actually powdered horseradish with green food coloring made into a paste and sold in tubes for easy mass consumption.  It has a very strong dry tickling of the nose taste whereas root wasabi is grated directly from the stem and has a more sweeter aromatic taste that does not overpower the senses.

2. The pickled ginger, or gari when traditionally prepared,  typically has a pale yellow to slightly pink hue from the pickling process. Only very young ginger will develop the slight pink tint. Many brands of commercially produced gari are artificially colored pink (often by E124 and/or beet juice), either to intensify the color or because the ginger used is too mature to turn pink upon pickling.

For an omakase sashimi plate that has a market price of $78 at this restaurant, one would expect they would use rooted wasabi and yellow ginger.  You need not to look too far where this is done properly, such as JaBistro which I have written a very detailed review base on my visits there.  One of their starting sashimi plate is $50 and uses rooted wasabi, grated live and on the spot and they also use fresh pickled yellow ginger.

Back to Aoyama.

While the sashimi was given in good abundance, including 4 nigri of toro (tuna belly), I can say that I've had much fresher fish before and found that the wait time of almost an hour for this plate at $78 just did not justify.  

During dinner service, we also ordered a few drinks of pop which took more than 10 minutes to arrive. As well, requests for additional water took the same amount of time to be refilled if not longer.

Clearly, they were short staffed or inattentive as there were times when the supposed 3 wait staff available was reduced to just one that was visible to diners.

The worst insult comes at the end as we wanted to order additional food.  We had only wanted to order an additional rainbow roll - but our waitress politely said it would take a long time and suggested we ordered something cooked instead.  We had already perused the menu in detail and we wanted nothing else but the rainbow roll, however.

Instead of pushing for our order, we decided to ask for the bill and leave instead.

For a birthday celebration, this was quite a disappointment.

To sum it up, slow service, food taking a long time to arrive because of one sushi chef working the sushi bar who was overwhelmed by orders and we could not order additional sushi because the waitress seem discouraged at the pace the sushi chef was working at.

I would think twice about returning to this place - unless they hired additional staff, especially for the sushi bar.  I would hate to think what happens on a weekend, where it would be a lot more busier.  This was a weekday, a Monday no less and it took nearly an hour for sushi at a sushi joint to arrive to our table!

Tread carefully if you're planning to visit, or the least, come when it's not as busy so you get your food reasonably on time!   Too bad, I wanted to like this place but it just fell short of my expectations."}
{"text":"Come here when you want fine Japanese dining, but don't want to pay a fortune.

Out of the competitors (Zen, JaBistro, Le Cafe Michi), Aoyama is probably the one with a bit lower price point but manages to keep their food at the high quality point.

I always get their sashimi plate and nigiri DX offerings. I wasn't as impressed with any of their cooked kitchen offerings.

They have daily specials, which are illustrated on cute, hand-made signs on the counter, hanging from branches.  You can usually score spicy salmon/tuna hand rolls for under $3. Sometimes, they even have uni on special!

It's a tiny restaurant, so be sure to make reservations!

Lots of free parking in the plaza.  If you're a broke student, eat the Tuesday special at the KFC next door before going into Aoyama and just feast on their specials ;)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

This place is great! It is a really tiny and busy restaurant with about 30 seats, so it might be a good idea to make reservations.

Aoyama is definitely quality over quantity. For dinner, we ordered the Sushi Omakase ($85), the Beef Tataki ($15) and a bowl of Chirashi ($23). There were four of us, and we were actually all satisfied by the end of it. However, the omakase is only intended for two people so there are only two pieces of each type of sushi in it; except for the six pieces of salmon rolls. The Beef Tataki was recommended by the waiter and we enjoyed trying it. The Chirashi was really delicious (if it had a little bit of uni in it, it would've been perfection)!

The basement/washroom is like a mini Hello Kitty gallery, super cute.

Happy to know I don't have to go all the way downtown to get good sushi anymore!"}
{"text":"In terms of value, taste, freshness, and ambiance, Aoyama is definitely my #1 recommendation for sushi. The only reason why I wouldn't recommend it is because I want to still be able to get a seat when I want to go, since it is a fairly small place. They recently expanded next door with their \"VIP\" section and added 5 more tables or so- great decor. 

They have seasonal specials on top of their regular menu, such as toro hand rolls for $4 (what a steal!) 
I've tried the 7 course menu - it is good but I would recommend Miku or JaBistro if you are going for that sort of experience. My go to with my partner is to get the $85 omakase for two, which comes with chicken skewers, monkfish liver, a really nice broth soup, and premium sushi including toro and uni."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and sashimi. I would come back here for sashimi. The service was a bit slow but good overall."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi and omakase places to visit that's outside of the downtown core, Aoyama offers great sushi for a very reasonable price. That being said, what blew me away the first time I visited was the omakase. At $55 it was loaded with seafood goodness and home-cooking love, combing cooked dishes as well as sushi fare. 

The decor is pretty blah, and the service is really slow sometimes, since it's a family-run business and the few times I dined there, it was the chef's family who were waiting tables. But it was kindly and friendly service, so I will definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place north of the 401. The sashimi is incredibly fresh and they take reservations!"}
{"text":"4 star is based on the eel on a bed of rice I had.  Although the eel is great, really it's just eel on top of white rice, pretty standard anywhere, lacking vegetables.  I don't eat sashimi but I heard good words about them here. 
Small restaurant but packed."}
{"text":"We were sent to the VIP lounge for our table this time, apparently they expanded the restaurant. The lounge was more spacious and the seating were more comfortable. 

Food: The food was just delicious! We ordered the weekend special omakase for 2, but the portion was very generous that we think should even be enough for even 3 people. The sushi was all very fresh and the lobster bites were super delicious! We also ordered the assorted tempura, fried eggplant and the tuna (can't rmb the name of the dish), and I have to say everything was delicious! This is a place that I will definitely come back, but if you are going during the weekends, make sure to make reservation first, it's always full."}
{"text":"Aoyama is usually fully reserved on weekends, and reservations are highly recommended! I would suggest reservations on weekends as well. Their quality is consistent at every visit, and their chef does not disappoint. 

They have good sushi or sashimi sets for dinner that offer a decent variety of fish! In addition to the regular menu, I always go for their specials - they have good handrolls and a la carte sushi/sashimi on there!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi. A bit on the expensive side, but worth it. Similar to downtown's Imatei. Try the buttered scallops and grilled cod.. Very tasty. Recently also had their coursed meal where one course was a butter fried lobster. Probably one of the best lobsters I've ever had!! The $50 coursed meal is absolutely worth it especially if you're going with a group."}
{"text":"So let's start from the moment I sat down.  After around 5 minutes ish I still didn't get the menu, so I decided to ask for a menu.  This isn't the first time...Last time I grabbed the menus myself.  Staff should be a little more attentive.  We ordered food and water... For the water u need to ask twice as the staff seems a little lost.  Let's get it the food.  The sashimi was fresher previous times that I came.  The spicy salmon roll was a disappointment as it just seemed like salmon rolls...  The dragon roll was Nice.  The crab porridge was VERY good.  The porridge was the highlight of the whole meal.  I've been here several times this time...Experience wasn't as great I guess because sashimi wasn't as good as before. service here never improved.  Washrooms are clean and nice with a hello kitty theme.  I don't know...With my last experience I think I will just go elsewhere next time.  Food is alright, service was not.  Place is a little cramped.  I would give a 2.5rating for my last visit."}
{"text":"Alright, I saw some mixed reviews about Aoyama. Let's get some things sorted out. 
1. this place is authentically Japanese owned, and run therefore the food will be similar to that found in JAPAN. 
2. if you're use to eating ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT sushi, this place might not be for you, because it's not about quantity here, it's about quality - which is always excellent. 

I go to Aoyama when i need to treat myself or on special occasions. I absolutely love this place. They will not serve anything that's not fresh. It's comparable to Japango (on Elizabeth st.), but a tad bit cheaper in price and they also have really delicious cooked foods. 

Reservations are highly recommended as it is a small restaurant (can seat maybe 30 people?). I suspect that the circumstances of the small space makes it hard to have more waiters/waitresses working at one time which can lead to slower then average service, but that's a trade-off I accept. The waiters/waitresses are always very welcoming and very pleasant."}
{"text":"Since we didn't do any research prior to coming here (only picked it due to proximity to the mall), we were not expecting such an upscale sushi restaurant. As a party of two, they were able to seat us right away, but only if we ate within an hour. Reservations are a must, as many other yelpers have noted.

We ordered the Aoyama course, which is said to be an individual portion, but we found it to be a decent amount of food for two people. Due to the higher prices here, it may be beneficial to simply split some of the combos offered. I was thoroughly impressed with the variety and taste of the dishes. I especially appreciated that they spread out the timing of the dishes, allowing us to focus on each item that was brought out. However, given the time crunch, I had to finish the dessert relatively quickly while paying the bill, as the next party had already arrived.

The restaurant space is cozy, but the decor is much nicer than many other Scarborough places. I'm not sure I would pick Aoyama over more affordable sushi places, but it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Had omakase meal. Not bad, but I find Shinobu's omakase meal better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Best sashimi that I've had in Toronto thus far! I would recommend making a reservation as the restaurant is small and only can accommodate approximately 50 people. Also, when I went to have dinner there, they also didn't have their AC on which made the dining experience a bit uncomfortable but the food made up for it. We ordered their house sashimi plate and it was literally the ocean on a plate. They had shrimp, blue fin tuna ( that night's special), salmon, uni, white tuna, red tuna and I'm sure I am missing something. Their sashimi was fresh and the shrimp was sweet. They also gave plenty of uni. Yum! Their sushi was also delicious, the rolls were tight and had the perfect balance of fish to rice. They were also generous with their portions. Their staff were attentive and checked in on us consistently to make sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, good service, food was bit better than average. Price a bit on high end"}
{"text":"It was authentic Japanese sushi place. Very small but cozy inside. Very fresh sashimi platter. Probably the best sashimi I had in Toronto. They were very fresh and melted in my mouth. Their dragon rolls were really crunch,sweet and smooth. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and fresh. My only criticism is that it's a little too expensive. But good food overall."}
{"text":"Usually my dinner here with my husband is more than pleasant. The chef always makes me food off the menu and service is top notch! 

On Friday, I went with a group of my close friends (5 including me) because I wanted to show them this amazing restaurant. I must say, all of us were unimpressed with the service that our male server was providing us. 

1. Server did not speak English so his explanation was in Japanese. 

2. We asked for an explanation as to why more than 2 people can't pay with the debit/credit machine. (Reason: restaurant rules; so you essentially can't split the bill and have 2+ people pay with the machine) 

3. Didn't cover the basics of serving etiquette. (Water and tea was never refilled, didn't ask how our food was, etc...) 

The server was just rude and ruined our entire experience. Thanks for making me look bad for recommending this restaurant. I don't know if I will go back now... Too bad because the food is really tasty."}
{"text":"There are several reasons why I'm giving this place 2 stars. First, they're very difficult to reach on the phone - despite being open at 5 or 5:30, they do not pick up until 6. Their voicemail isn't even activated so I can't even leave a message. Second, we read a lot of good reviews on this place so my expectations were pretty high. 

We got the omakase for $65 each and was pretty disappointed with respect to the quality of fish and sushi we had. The flavour and freshness of the fish just does not match up to other top sushi restaurants in Toronto such as Zen. I had the sea urchin and it was horrible! It left a very strong aftertaste..! 

For the same price, you can get better quality sushi at Zen. Sure you get more variety here because you also get cooked Japanese food opposed to just sushi but for me, the sushi is very important and this didn't live up to my expectations. I don't think I'll return as I found the service quite slow as well."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant so make reservation ahead of time. 

The hand rolls are good and sushi platter is good! We got spicy salmon, spicy tuna and uni hand rolls! It was delicious! 

Didn't like the green tea cheesecake through, both my friend And I thought there was a hint of wasabi which we didn't really like."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and everytime I would order the omakase sushi set.  There is only 5 sets available each day and i find this great value as well for two people.  The highlight of this set is the ootoro (fatty tuna), uni, unagi and alaska crab.
Usually these are the four that taste the best in the set but uni this time didn't taste so fresh.  Also the crab is seasonal so not everytime they will have it available.  The restaurant is rather small and reservation is a must.  I came in at 6 and it is half full.  They also offer take out.  The server are also nice.  I will definately continue to come but again the quality of the fish is hit or miss."}
{"text":"After our so-so first visit, we came back to try out different items off the menu and our experience was so much better this time around.  

We ordered sashimi platter (excellent quality, including good uni this time), some negi toros (super yum) and tuna tataki (just ok) which were both on the daily special board.  We opted for some Asahi and Sapporo to accompany our meal on a steaming hot day and it was just perfect.  

We also tried the hirame with house made yuzu/soy sauce and their house special salad with 3 kinds of seaweed.  The hirame was good but I didn't particularly enjoy the change in texture from the yuzu citrus.  The seaweed salad, however, was the scene stealer with what was possibly the best sesame dressing I've had the privilege to experience; perfectly creamy and savoury.  This salad will be a permanent fixture in my future visits to Aoyama for sure.  I just hope they don't take it off the menu.  

Although we were pretty full after our initial order, we wanted to try some more a la carte sushi and ordered hamachi belly, kanpachi and mackerel.  All the sushi were just excellent with the mackerel being the stand out.  

Aoyama offers a great value and experience for sushi lovers like me and my husband who are still hungry after eating at joints like Yasu but don't want to go to other Japanese restaurants with less varieties and inferior quality of fish. 

Oh and what we absolutely adore about Aoyama is that they're so quick with their food that it doesn't take long to start eating right after you place your order which is a big plus especially when you arrive hungry.  

Will be back....probably too soon.  :)"}
{"text":"Don't even bother coming here without a reservation. This place is TINY. A handful of tables is all this place holds, but the fresh sushi and the great quality of the food means that it's always packed. I have never, ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered, whether it's been raw or cooked. That being said, there isn't a vast selection of cooked items on the menu - some noodle soups, tempura and some desserts. But hands down my favourite place for uni hand rolls."}
{"text":"This place is located in a strip mall in the middle if nowhere.  I hear that if you go around 5:30-7:30...you can easily get robbed or kidnapped by really bad people...hahaahahahaha....ok....enough with the nonsense.  This place is awesome...I just wanna deter all you foodies out there because I don't wanna have to fight you for a seat to get me some of the best darn sashimi and sushi in town.  

The food here was just great...I didn't see none of that cheese sushi or Philadelphia barf rolls that many of those other joints are selling.

Although it is crowded...worth the wait.  Came here on a Friday night with the fam and we all left completely and utterly satisfied.  Pricing is totally decent and you can tell this so called hidden gem has it's share of regulars.  

Staff is awesome and although it is crazy busy...never saw attitude or anything short of a great smile from the wait staff.  I will come here again and again :)

People say that it was really slow service but I experienced the contrary...fast and efficient with the food...they just forgot our tea but the sheer deliciousness totally made up for it."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night based on the reviews here. We ordered their sushi platter ($89), green tea, tempura and some sake. First and foremost, the service was fantastic. I would go back here based on that alone. The tempura was meh. The batter ruined it for me.  But the fish was pretty good - it had some good o-toro and chutoro, and Hokkaido scallops! The uni from the platter was Chilean which had a bit of a metallic aftertaste; it looked like Japanese uni but wasn't quite the same. I enjoyed it nonetheless.  And the crab sushi was actual real crab! Previously frozen but good nonetheless :)

The rice was a bit mushy for me and just barely seasoned (if it was at all). This was in stark contrast to a recent visit to Shoushin where the rice was very noticeably grainy (not to say it was bad but I could feel every single grain of rice while I was chewing it). I think i would prefer something in between. And I tried to eat the sushi with my chopsticks initially but decided to wash my hand again and use my hands instead - holding and dipping just the fish in the soy sauce was much easier with your hands. The rice absorbed just too much soy sauce.  

I would come back and try their sashimi only and skip the sushi - even if the o-toro was delicious and it was a great value. The rice annoyed me that much. And order the o-toro sashimi in addition :)

But yes, come here. I would come back!  I also wish i knew what this mysterious Aoyama VIP room is two doors down from this main room...  Oh and since I didn't see it mentioned, the washroom area is kind of cute with all the hello kitty images and how it evolved through the years. I haven't seen that before and it was interesting :)"}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5 Stars

Came on a Wednesday night with my girlfriend to celebrate our 6 month anniversary. I realized (last minute) on Monday that they were not open Tuesday or Wednesday during lunch, so I scrambled and called and managed to make a reservation (for Wednesday evening).

The place (as in previous reviews) is small, and upon arriving, the place was completely full (~7:30 PM on a Wednesday night). Luckily our reservation was set and a small table was in the middle of paying.

This is definitely one of the best Japanese cuisine experiences I've ever had. We each ordered the Aoyama Omakase that included several dishes:
- Seafood Su No Mono (Seafood Salad)
- Sashimi appetizer dish (9 pieces - salmon, maguro, ama ebi, hamachi)
- Hirame Usuzukuri (sliced Fluke seasoned with garnisha nd ponzu viniger)
- Butter Fried Lobster
- Tempura (shrimp, eggplant, yam)
- Seafood soup (with shrimp and scallop - served in a small teapot)
- Sushi assortment (7 pieces - salmon, toro, bincho maguro, uni, unagi, hamachi, kanpachi)
- Choice of dessert (we chose the green tea mochi, and the mitsumame)

The meal was simply amazing. Some of the items listed above are only available with the Omakase course.

The biggest highlight from the meal was the pacing and ordering of the dishes. It worked very well, especially ending with the sushi assortment.

I found the sushi to be just so extremely fresh - it was very tasty.

To drink, we ordered a bottle of dry sake (Hakkaisan Tokubetsu Junmai), for which they let you chose your sake cup from a nice assortment.

The only criticism I could provide is that I was perhaps expecting more from the sushi. The fish was nice but I thought the rice could be perhaps warmer or softer.


Would highly recommend, and I'm not surprised that many people do not know of its existence. Again, reservations are highly recommended"}
{"text":"The first thing about Aoyama, you need to know is that reservations are a must. The restaurant itself hold about 20 people or so MAX, so make sure you call ahead for reservations. 

I have dined here twice, and I have seen them turn walk-ins away, because it was full and they're booked solid.

My most recent visit happend over a month ago, I took a friend there for his birthday.  We ordered 2 of their Omakase, (Chef's choice) set; one @ the higher price point; and one @ the lower price point. 

Aoyama offers two versions of the Omakase menu, the pricier one (by about $10 or so) that includes an extra sashimi course and your choice off their dessert menu, but other than that, there is no major difference from the cheaper one. 

The pacing of the food was relaxed and it didn't feel like they were rushing to get the food out to you, despite being fairly busy. The service was attentive. 

I was tempted to order more food outside of the 6-7 courses we had coming to us, however I'm glad I didn't. As the omakase was enough to fill us up to the point of sastifaction, but not the point of gross satisfaction.

For most of the meal, the food was pretty good, until we got to our respective sushi courses. At which point, I have to say the fireworks went off, and the food went from pretty good to excellent. The fish is very fresh, and in some cases, the fish was melt-in-your-mouth good. It was so good, my friend almost fell off his chair, needless to say I let him have the rest of my sushi course, since I was getting full and wanted to save room for my green tea ice cream.

Aoyama, also, serves alcohol, in particular sake, sadly the sparkling sake they were advertising was not avaliable, during our visit. So no alcohol for me.

Overall, it was a memorable experience. Food & service was excellent. The fact that Aoyama is Japanese owned and operated is an added bonus."}
{"text":"The good: ugh their sashimi platter was so good. Couples that with their special unagi don, it was amazing. Spicy salmon and tuna hand rolls were good! The spider roll was on point! Their Japanese soup dish (as seen in picture, forgive me I forgot the name) was actually pretty refreshing! Never had something like that before. 

The bad: if I had to take one thing away is their dessert, it's not good. They had a sake sorbet, it sounded better than it tasted. Their matcha ice cream (even though they say it's made from rich matcha) just didn't have enough matcha taste to it. So avoid dessert unless you really crave and have no where else to go.

The ugly: place gets booked up fast and due to its small space, if you come during dinner time rush, you won't get a table.

Neutral: good service, special seems to be updated pretty often."}
{"text":"We just got deny service because they didn't pick up their phone to take our reservation. Also, they put up sign that they don't give a shit. Well thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I had the Omakase meal tonight and it was fantastic.  It is an 8 course meal: 

**My meal was fantastic...until the end.** 

Course 1: Seaweed salad w/ crab
This salad is served in a martini class that consists of three different types of seaweed and bits of fresh crab that is topped off with strips of radish.  The sauce is a sesame mayo.  I'd give this a 3/5 only because I'm not a big fan of that crisp type of seaweed but such is life! 

Course 2: White fish w/ ponzu sauce
I enjoyed the presentation of this dish as there was approximate 8 slices of thinly cut fish garnished with ponzu sauce.  I think a fellow Yelper already mentioned this - but I also feel that although the fish was great, it was slightly over-powered by the Ponzu sauce.  

Course 3: Lobster tail
This is a fried lobster tail with low fat garlic butter.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I love lobster tail and when you put butter and lobster together, it's pretty epic.  

Course 4: Sashimi platter
This was a delicious platter featuring a variety of fish: salmon, hamachi, tuna, and whitefish.  Very fresh - you definitely get what you pay for. 

Course 5: Tempura 
A selection of shrimp & vegetable tempura.  By this point, I was already getting REALLY full.  Still delicious but started to put aside some for my brother.  

Course 6: Seafood soup
This is a rich seafood broth served in a teapot.  It was a great compliment to the tempura.  

Course 7: Nigiri platter
I usually love nigiri and albeit it being extremely fresh fish again, I was very very VERY full at this point and was ready to just skip to dessert.  I ended up packing up some for home for my brother as well...

Course 8: Dessert
I chose deep fried banana with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  It was absolutely delicious but again, how can you go wrong with dessert? 

Overall, my evening was absolutely fantastic until a lady in her 50s decided that it would be convenient to slam her plate of bones and chewed up food on my table while I was still sitting down.  We were just about to leave but she didn't even wait for us to leave...just decided to slam her rejects on the table.  I got up very quickly and slipped out, \"That's disgusting\", at which point her friend looked quite embarassed.  My mother had shot her a dirty look and she had the nerve to shoot one back at both of us.  I was very tempted to say something very nasty to her but I decided that I had more class that that and this moron was clearly not worth my time.  But lady in your 50s, if you are reading this from your iPad, shame on you.  Your mother clearly didn't teach you proper table manners.  You. Are. Disgusting. 

Originally 4.5/5 stars - Disgusting Lady ruined my night so now I have to chop 0.5 stars off.  Sorry Aoyama - your food was FANTASTIC, one of your patrons...not so much."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Yum. That's all I can say.

I'm a sushi fanatic, as you can probably tell (lots of sushi reviews in my account). I've been to Zen before and really enjoyed the restaurant. However Zen was too far from where I live, so I decided to go here instead for authentic (literally authentic) Japanese food for my birthday. Reservations, as mentioned several times here already, are necessary before 9pm, especially on weekends.

Some items I ordered include the tako su, beef tataki, tempura, house special sashimi plate, and the avenue 246 deluxe sushi. Can I just say the sushi and sashimi, despite the steep cost, tasted significantly more delicious than any other sushi bars I've been to that's not Zen? The fish to rice ratio was perfect for the sushi, and there was an abundance of toro fish for both sushi and sashimi (as advertised). The beef tataki also tasted very good (not too cooked, not too raw), the tempura was lightly battered but delicious, and the tako su was just okay (fresh, but lacked taste a bit).

We also brought a birthday cake to the restaurant and shared it with some of the employees. They really appreciated it and gave me a free birthday gift, which was a Japanese engraved mug.

Total bill only came to around $150 for 4 excluding tips, which was much lower than what we expected. Sure it's a little bit more expensive than a typical Korean run Japanese restaurant, but that extra $5-10 is really worth it!"}
{"text":"In the hart of the Scarborough at Vic Park and Finch area, located in dingy little run-down plaza, you would not expect to find a gem like Aoyama! My Japanese gentleman friend and I always visit this place and we totally fall in love.... with the sushi here, of course(lol) 

 I think sushi quality is one of the best in GTA and this comes from Japanese person who KNOWS sushi! ;) I would given them a 5 star with an ease, except were forced to lineup for 20 minutes when we already had a reservation and we were rushed to be done when we were just enjoying the dinner, other then that, it is absolutely fantastic and price is fairly reasonable for what you are getting. (Ok, higher end prices, but for the quality, we will not hesitate to pay for it!) 

The only thing I would like to ask to the restaurant side is, please educate your wait stuff little better as I've found some of the manners slightly unprofessional and unknowledgeable.   

I will definitely go back again for the best sushi and sashimi in town!"}
{"text":"Mains:
Omakase Sushi Set - $85
NOMNOM.  I knew it was gonna be good when the apps came, the chicken yakitori was absolutely delicious and seasoned/grilled perfectly.  I also liked the fish(?) liver as part of the apps, and they put the miso soup in a teapot which made the experience unique since we were drinking out of tiny teacups :)

The actual sushi set had a couple of everything.  The eel was my favourite.  The famous toro was also in the set, and the chef explained to us it was basically bluefin tuna belly, which was one of the most expensive cuts.  There was also sea urchin, shrimp, crab, salmon, etc. I thought all of the sushi tasted very fresh, and the sushi rice was seasoned nicely except some was a little warm.. which I didn't really like.

Recommended for two people since most of the sushi came with two pieces each, but I shared with 2 others and we still got to try everything despite some funny attempts at dividing when sharing the food

House Special Sashimi Plate - $50
Included scallops, crab, tuna, salmon, tilapia, sea urchin, and a couple other kinds of sashimi.  My lease favourite was the sea urchin as I just wasn't a fan of the grimeyness and overall taste.. The shrimp head also tasted a little funny, but the rest of the sashimi were deliciously fresh and really melts in your mouth.  A+ :)

Tuna Special - $10
I forgot why we decided to get the tuna special since I'm pretty sure it was in our mains... regardless, Aoyama's sashimi is fantastic and I enjoyed the tuna

Desserts (each around $5)
Mochi Ice Cream (Green Tea) - Comes with two mochi's each cut in half.  I wanted to eat all of them but then my friends would hate me.  My favourite dessert of the night and I could eat these everyday :3
Banana Tempura with Chocolate Sauce & Ice Cream - Typical but still yummy.  Highlight of the dish was the resto's creative spelling of sauce on the menu
Cream Anmitsu - This is a Japanese dessert comprising of sugar jelly cubes (apparently made from red algae or seaweed), red bean all put in sugar water (or maybe regular water..) The jelly cubes tasted nothing special and we only ordered it to try.  Won't try again

Service
We weren't in a rush for time, so the waiters being slow at getting our bill didn't bother us at all.  The food also came at good intervals, and we sat right near the chef who was preparing sashimi the whole night.  He gave us a history of bluefin tuna and was really friendly, the waitresses and waiters were also all Japanese which validated the authenticity of the resto for us :P  

In the end, the bill racked up to about $70 per person among my two friends and I.  It was really filling for all of us and I think the next time I go, I'd try the Aoyama course which they list in the front of their menu :)"}
{"text":"Really recommend to make a reservation before you go to this restaurant. I attempted to go to this restaurant the first time with my friend without a reservation and the waitress would not even seat us even though there were empty tables.

So the second time, we made a reservation and we were seated swiftly. Ordered the Omakase Sushi Set ($85), the day special toro sushi roll, and udon. The fish was really fresh and the sushi set had a great assortment. If you want to eat good quality sushi with fish flown from Japan and don't want to pay a hefty price, come here. You will not be disappointed! 

And on a side note, the service here was mediocre because the waitresses kept forgetting our requests but the food was too good so I would come back regardless."}
{"text":"Food is decent and nice. If you are looking for quality sushi and sashimi, this is a place you could consider.

Tried the crab congee, taste good but not wow. So i am not going to order that again.

Omakase sushi set is impressive with delicious Japanese steam eggs (but it is cold appetizer)

Omakase sashimi is also nice.

Restaurant is very small, so reservation is strongly recommended."}
{"text":"A neat Japanese restaurant tucked in a dim plaza strip next to a KFC. I went there on a Monday night after 8 and it was all filled up. They invited me to dine at their expansion \"VIP room\" next door and it was fantastic! The interior is comfortable and the seating area is much larger.

The food there is quite good for the price point they command. The cherry on top is their excellent service. The staff is patient and friendly, which really added to the experience."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriend's birthday. The service was really great. The staff were well informed, they sang happy birthday with a yummy ice cream mochi, and even gave him a small gift. They went out of their way to make our night memorable which I greatly appreciated. We had a young male server that helped us decide what to order. Our two favorite things were his recommendations. We ordered the sushi omakase for 2 (limit 5 per day-$80ish), fluke in ponzu sauce, salmon and tuna hand rolls (specials), and sashimi omakase ($27). 

Long story short: the sushi omakase was delicious. The meat skewer, fish liver, edamame, & seafood soup appetizer portion was nothing special. However, the sushi quality and taste that followed suit was worth it. This alone filled us up but we decided to try other items since we were already there. We loved the sushi in the omakase set that we ordered the sashimi omakase after. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with this. The sashimi was cold like it just came out of the fridge and the taste was no where near the sushi omakase set despite some being the same kind of fish. I deducted a star for that (even though the quality is still better than many places). 

The fluke in ponzu sauce was our second favourite item as recommended by the server. The ponzu sauce was acidic and was a nice contrast to the fish. The hand rolls were generously stuffed with fish and had a good rice ratio. It was fresh but the overall flavour is more on the bland side or we were super full by then.

They also have a hello kitty themed washroom and some live jazz at certain times in the VIP section!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Well prepared sushi
Great service

Cons:
Prices are on the high side

My wife has always wanted to come here because she has heard great things about Aoyama.  So naturally for her Bday, I took her here to celebrate!  If you're thinking of coming here, always make a reservation.  We came on a Wednesday and every table was reserved when we got there.  Chances are you will be turned away if you don't make a reservation in advance.

Aoyama has a wide assortment to choose from on their menu.  We settle on the Omakase sushi set.  According to the menu, they only serve 5 of these per day so we were in luck when we ordered it.  We ordered a salmon for teriyaki for our little ones as they don't eat raw fish yet. 

The sushi set comes with an appetizer which consists of edamame, an egg dish and some chicken yakitori skewers.  All three were pretty good and a nice setup into the sushi after.  The omakase set came later and it was laid out beautifully.  It also tasted as good as it looked.  You don't need to be a sushi expert to know the taste is a cut above your ordinary all you can eat variety. The meal itself was very enjoyable.

Price wise is the only gripe I have.  The omakase set was $89.  So it's 20 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of a salmon roll for almost a hundred dollars.  Value wise, it's a little off putting for me.  I probably won't be ordering it again if were to come back.  The sushi was excellent, but the big eater in me thinks what other things I can get for $100.  The salmon teriyaki was $13 and didn't even come with rice as well.

As with all Japanese owned businesses, the service was fantastic and always on point.  I'm never disappointed by service by a Japanese owned restaurant and Aoyama keeps up with the streak.

I would totally recommend Aoyama for a special event for sushi fans.  I wouldn't go as my daily go to as the prices are on the high side.  All in all, when you do go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Compared to the Japanese restaurants I've been to in downtown, this place is really nothing special.  Really just your average sushi place.   But compared to what's around in midtown, it's a little better.  But not the best.  

The $55 sashimi platter was ok.   Normal types of fishes but they were fresh, so that's a plus.   

The cooked foods we ordered was horrible.  Enoki buttered mushrooms, I could make at home better.   It was soggy and all they did was soaked it in butter.   Their buttered scallops had a weird coating starchy taste to it.  Last but not least, the fried oysters was just as it sounds, fried, and that's about it.   Basically, there was no thought put into the cooked dishes I ordered and they were indeed overpriced for that reason. 

This place is really not the best for \"traditional\" Japanese sushi.  And it's slightly overprice for the location.   

I don't mind a restaurant being small, but definitely it was poorly cheaply decorated and quite uncomfortable to sit in with the setting of the tables.  I thought they had undergone renos?  The chairs were still old and grimy, as with the tables.  I guess they only did the pink hello kitty bathrooms downstairs? 

Really, I don't get the hype for this place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi offered in the North York/Scarborough area. Considering how much they charge downtown I would say this place is rather reasonable. 

Their sushi platter is good as a starter, the fish is fresh and artfully prepared. It's melt in your mouth goodness. Tempura needs some work as it wasn't the fluffy crispy texture I was looking for. 

The food is so good I can seriously overlook their service - which was none. It took 20 minutes to get our order in, but the food did arrive rather quickly. Our tea was never refilled and it took another 30 minutes to get our bill.

Make sure you have reservations or else you would be waiting for a very long time outside as the standing area in this restaurant is rather limited."}
{"text":"After looking for a place I settled on this place only to get here and be stared at. No service even before their hours of operation. I refuse to support businesses like this."}
{"text":"If you're hoping to come here for dinner, definitely make a reservation. I decided to listen to other reviewers and made a reservation for my SO's birthday on a Friday evening, and every table had a reservation sign on them. 

The service is welcoming and professional, and we were seated quickly after arrival. We ordered the sushi omakase for two ($89) and a fried fish. The fried fish was good, but it paled in comparison to the sushi omakase. The sushi was fresh and the fish perfectly marbled, and the uni is flown in from Japan. The omakase also came with appetizers: steamed egg with fish, salted edamame, a shrimp broth served in a teapot, and three teriyaki chicken skewers. We were both satisfied but still had room for another small course or dessert. 

It was a great meal, and I certainly hope to come back for special occasions! It's a good place to go if you're hoping to have quality sashimi without completely breaking the bank. Still a tad pricey for portions (-1 star), but it was good food and good service."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh sushi! Don't love the rolls though. 

Prices can be a little cheaper due to the portions of the meal 

Waitresses were friendly 

One of the best sushi places I tasted in Toronto"}
{"text":"Lovely place with super friendly service. Food are fresh and good, but they are not too expensive.
A friend of mine wrote an essay criticizing their wasabi and pickled ginger. The bottom line, I'm there for the sushi, sashimi, and selected hot plates. I wouldn't care less about the side stuff.
If you want to evaluate them based on those cheap AYCE places, don't you dare complain about their price because that will be an insult to the restaurant. They take pride in the quality and presentation so they SHOULD be paid accordingly. If you go downtown for the same standard of food, you would be paying double or so."}
{"text":"Kinda hit or miss. Been there three times and found it better than your ten dollar bento and definitely better than your standard sushi buffet. But not excellent either for the price. Was expecting it to be a bit better. I'll have to give it another try for a final decision."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night, and made reservations 3 weeks in advance for the Aoyama course. 

The restaurant was a bit hidden to find, and upon arriving, we were greeted by a kind woman who showed us our table, which wasn't too far from the door. Our reservations was at 7 and all the tables were occupied. My guess the restaurant could only hold around 25 people at most. Although, I believe they expanded the restaurant, but it wasn't side by side, it seemed like it was on the other side of the restaurant (not too sure, because every time someone came in and said that they made reservations, the waitress would go outside with them and point them out to the right direction). 

Time for the food and it's corresponding rating: 

1) the seaweed salad - it came in a martini glass with a mixture of seaweed and lettuce, a piece of white cucumber, a piece of crab meat and seasoned with a light dressing. I love seaweed in general and the dressing was light and not too creamy. I wish it came in a bigger portion. 9/10 

2) the fluke fish - each slice of fish was garnished with some green onions and flying fish roe and drenched in soy sauce. This dish was way too salty for me. 6/10

3) a plate of sashimi - the plate comes with 3 slices of salmon, red tuna and white tuna. And one shrimp. I'm not a fan of raw fish, but if I had to choose, tuna and salmon would be the one raw fish going into my stomach. Apparently, they were not fish, but I couldn't tell...7/10

4) fried lobster tail - this was definitely the one thing that caught my eyes on the menu. When it arrived in front of me, it smelled and looked amazing. However, i think it was way too over cooked. The meat was too chewy and tough to eat, which then caused me to bloat afterwards. Again, I was told it was not fresh...7/10 

5) tempura and soup - another plate of fried food came right after, a variety of fried tempuras - 3 pieces of shrimps. 1 piece of yam, green bean and egg plant. This was just too much for one person to finish. I like tempura but I don't love it. Due to the amount of oil used to fry and the grease stain they left behind on the paper while waiting to be eaten  in the basket, my stomach could only intake 3 tempuras. 6/10 

This also came with a soup filled in a teapot. The soup had a piece of shrimp and ginger in it. I'm guessing this was to wash down all the greasiness. I wasn't a big fan of the soup as it was too gingery for my liking but it was nice to clean my palette. 6/10 

6) another plate of sashimi - as mentioned above, I'm not a fan of raw fish. More tuna was served and an uni sushi was added to the plate. At this point, I was extremely full and couldn't finish all the sashimi on my plate. I would have rather they served us something else other than sashimi. 6/10 

7) last but not least, the dessert - if you choose the Aoyama course, you have the choice of anything off the dessert menu otherwise you are stuck with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Because we got the Aoyama course, we all went for the mochi - Black Sesame. I wasn't impressed, the glutinous rice was very thin and the ice cream was just okay. I've had better ones before. 6/10"}
{"text":"Service was good. We liked the black cod. Sashimi fish were generally fresh. The sea urchin did not smell or taste fresh at all. This place's price is close to that of japango, but I don't feel quality is quite there in comparison."}
{"text":"Had dinner here after Black Friday shopping
We had aged tofu 4 pieces for 7$-taste is average 
Uma-tama in a bento box 16$- this one is sooooooo delish! The portion is good for two to share! Highly recommend!
Sashimi platter- 27$ there's like more than 10 kinds fresh fish with 2 pieces of sea urchins 
Sushi platter- 25$ the egg roll here is too good to be true 
Green dragon roll-14$ we asked for no tobiko(fly fish roe) the ratio of filling and rice is awesome! I am not a tempura-lover but this roll definitely gave my taste buds a great treat!
We were too full to try the premium green tea ice cream here, which gave us a reason to come back again!
Last but not the least, they have a HELLO KITTY washroom! 
Atmosphere 4/5- cozy and small tables, typical Japanese restaurant 
Food 5/5- authentic and their food portion is larger than other places 
Price 4/5 - the price is reasonable"}
{"text":"Aoyama is a small mom and pop kind of Japanese restaurant and it's a gem of Scarborough. This restaurant serves sushi, sashimi, maki rolls and udon among a few other things.

We tried their sushi, sashimi, specialty rolls and hand rolls. All of them were really well made and more importantly very fresh!

The Avenue 484 sushi platter contained 10 different pieces of fish and all were extremely fresh. Some notable pieces were the different types of Toro, Salmon, Unagi and Uni.

The sashimi Omakase also contained similar pieces of fish from the sushi. Again, I cannot stress how fresh the fish was.

The only roll we tried was the ATC roll which was avocado, spicy tuna and tempura bits. This was delicious and if you're a fan of either avocado or tuna then this is recommended.

In terms of desserts we tried the green tea and mango ice cream Mochi (not a mix in flavour). Also tried the green tea cheesecake.

The Mochis were OK. Green tea ones were good, the doughy exterior was soft. The mango on the other hand I would stay away from. The outer shell was hard and too thick. Definitely not what a Mochi should be like. 

Green tea cheesecake was a highlight for me. Topped with some gold flakes, this wasn't too sweet but rich enough. Recommended.

The restaurant is a little beat up in furnishing but don't let that deter you from the quality of food Aoyama serves. Their washroom is also pretty interestingly decorated. Recommended!"}
{"text":"\"SOUR\" tobiko and smells sour too! On top of dragon roll = it's our taste... Fine! That's their explains toon. I don't like the tobiko at this restaurant"}
{"text":"1 word \"awesome\"
2 words \"fresh sushi\"
3 words \"best in Toronto\"
4 words \"I will be back\""}
{"text":"A place I would often want to go back. Every time I go back, I would order the Special Sashimi plate (about $55). Their sashimi is so fresh and yummy. One special sashimi plate is probably good for 3 to 4 people."}
{"text":"Great sushi joint! It's a small joint so plan accordingly to avoid the long lineup. I've been twice and found the food to be consistently good.

So far, I've had their sashimi platter, the chirashi, and various desserts. It's definitely a step (or two!) up from your typical sushi restaurant (not AYCE), so be prepared for fresher fish and longer wait times. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good value. Friendly staff. Very limited space so I recommend to make reservations first. It's definitely a hidden jam in the area."}
{"text":"Aoyama is a small, wonderful hidden gem located close to Finch on Victoria Park. I have been there multiple times now and their quality of fish is ALWAYS super fresh. I get the $25 sushi dinner and every piece of sushi is so good I always try to take extra long to finish it so I can savour every bite. Their udon isn't bad too. The only thing I would say is that their rolls are mediocre and way overpriced for what they are. I would also prefer their sushi dinners to come with soup and salad but it doesn't. Also, if you're going to go, make sure you make a reservation, especially if you want to go during prime dinner time! :) Verdict?: Yes, I am a returning fan."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night.  It has been a few years since we last came here and it looks like they have updated the decor and I don't remember the fancy hello kitty washrooms.  I recalled that I wasn't too crazy about their omakase (a selection of dishes) set course meal so we just ordered a la carte.  We ordered some of daily specials, maguro  no tataki, negi toro, and from the menu the deluxe sushi set, and spicy salmon hand roll.  Overall, the sushi was very fresh but the two best dishes were the negi toro and spicy salmon.  On my next visit, I think I'll just get a plateful of negi toro!"}
{"text":"Really, reeaaallly small place in a small and hidden plaza... but food is great :) Make sure you call ahead to make a reservation because if you don't, you may get turned around. Yup; that happened on my first visit. The waitress said we should come back another time with a reservation because they were packed for the night. Disappointment, especially when we weren't from the area... but we made sure to reserve the next time.

There is a very limited number of seating here; but in a way it's good so there's less noise and the waitresses can actually pay attention to you. Having said, customer service was also great. 

Sashimi was really fresh and presented nicely - there's not a specific one to recommend; pretty much all of them were spot on. It is a bit on the pricey side but you do get what you pay for. 

Check the opening hours too as they are only opened a few hours a day, with a few breaks in between. Not exactly recommended for group visits because of the size (unless you rent out the place) but do go with your significant other or a few friends."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in toronto, I think. (Might be corrected after I try Taro) There is a price to pay for it though.

They usually have hand roll specials for $3. Usually try to go when its Uni hand rolls for $3. Not bad."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprised that this small sushi place has such amazing and fresh sashimi from Japan. Ordered the omakase ($89 for 2) and it was amazing. They also have daily specials that you definitely shouldn't miss out. Make reservations before going because it gets really busy"}
{"text":"Okay, so my sister and I treated my mom to a Mothers Day dinner and let me just say, everything was eye-rolling orgasmicly amazing. Writing this review doesn't even begin to do this place justice because words can only go so far as to describing something that great. You have to -TASTE- it to know what I'm really talkin' about and even then you'll be at a loss of words. 

Also, the service can be slow since there is only one sushi chef, but grab a few friends and gossip or something because it is well worth the wait. I gave it 5 stars because it's really hard to find authentic and fresh fish that actually MELTS in your mouth for this price.

So, let's begin.

S a s h i m i  P l a t t e r w/ sake  ($63)          Best. Thing. I. Ever. Ate. Ever.
(Every single piece of fish was fatty to the point it just meshed in your mouth perfectly with no veins and you can taste the freshness with no bullshit in your mouth. My favorite was the hamachi and salmon. This is some next. level. shit. Fo' real.

S u s h i (Variety of: hamachi, toro, salmon, unagi, toko)
My favorites: ALL OF THEM. GO TRY IT NOW. 

D r a g o n  R o l l 
Jam-packed with nice pieces of unagi (freshwater eel), hot shrimp tempura and of course, the magic that binds this whole baby together, AVOCADO. Deee-freakin'licious. It was literally an orgy of flavours sexing in my mouth. 

T e m p u r a   S o b a
Nothing special for me. It was just a bowl of the dark coloured soba noodles in a warm broth and 2 pieces of shrimp tempura. Wasn't a huge fan, but my sister loves noodles. 

B a n a n a  T e m p u r a w/ I c e - c r e a m + I c e - c r e a m  M o c h i
First time trying banana tempura and this is officially one of my favorite desserts of all time. I am a big lover of bananas. I mean it's -the- easiest fruit to eat. Least messy. Lovely creamy texture and so fragrant and pungent when it's at its' peak ripeness. BUT imagine.... take that perfect banana....DEEP FRY IT.  then serve it with a nice contrasting element of vanilla ice-cream. Bitch, just TRY telling me that does not sound good.... 'cause honestly a bite of the banana + ice cream is simple perfection. 

Overall:  This does not even begin to describe it. Go try it yourself. Seriously. Go. Like now. Turn off your computer, drive to Victoria Park & Van Horne.  And after your meal, you can treat me to lunch because that'll be the only way to thank me."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST Japanese restaurants in Toronto!!!  Their Sashimi is SUPER FRESH, especially their UNI, SCALLOP SASHIMI, AMAEBI and GRILLED BLACK COD!!  Make sure you make reservations though b/c the restaurant is really small!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner, and each got the Aoyama Course. For $70, this set is pretty inclusive and you get some great variety. Each course was tasty and the service was prompt. Even though the restaurant was full, the wait staff took the time to see that we were fully taken care of. I also liked that before each course, he would explain what we were eating, where it came from, and how best to eat it.

The sushi is the last of the courses and the fish tasted fresh. However, it felt like they went a little heavy on the wasabi, so if you are not a fan you may be in for a bit of a surprise. Also, while it's a charming idea to serve the soup in a teapot, it really was a bit of an unnecessary extra. I think I would have preferred to have all my soup in a bowl vs having to pour it into that tiny cup.

The food is good, and while a little pricey the quality and service made it worthwhile. The place is also quite small, so making a recommendation might be in your best interest."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for our Valentine's Day dinner.  We got there on time and was promptly led to their new expansion area of the restaurant to be seated which was pretty cozy.  Way more intimate than their main area.  Despite reading reviews from others stating how the food service is slow in their new area, that wasn't the case with us.  Food came quick and service was pretty good.  We were hungry so we ordered 4 items.  We got the omakase set , sashimi set, beef tataki and grilled squid.  The food was alright but the reason I give it 2 stars was that later on in the evening, I had to run to the washroom and destroyed my toilet bowl at home! TWICE!!  I know it's disgusting to bring it up but that  was fact! Good thing I wasn't in a public  setting or I would have been  SOL , literally! Looking back in hindsight, I  think their uni wasn't fresh.  It tasted a little \"off\".  Different from what it usually tastes but didn't think too much of it at the time because everything else was alright.  Not mind blowing but edible.  Oh yeah, we also ordered their dessert which was just ice cream in its basic form or in a mochi.  

I wish I can give it a higher rating but the fact that it made my stomach turn, I wasn't too happy about that so 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"Aoyama is a really small restaurant located in a strip plaza in Scarborough runned by Japanese people.. One of the places that you can drive by everyday without even noticing it!

Make sure you make a reservations for dinner ok or even lunch if you want to eat here! This place can only accommodate max 30 people and with only 2 waitstaff and 1 sushi chef. So sometimes the services can be slow, food takes time to arrives and table spaces are limited.

Yes they do have lunch specials.. (sushi, sashimi and tempura) $21 and (sushi, beef teriyaki and tempura) $24 Bento box. Good value when you compare to just the 10 piece sushi order that includes in the bento set cost $19 if you order it separately.

The fish here is really fresh and with the right temperature! I especially like the selections of Sashimi that includes the scallops.. which has this melt in your mouth feeling. Of course I love the uni that includes in the sushi set.. hmmmmmmm

The tempura I find it a little bit oily (just look at all the oil that was on the paper underneath). 

We also offer grilled whole eel ($15) and Cold Soba Noodle ($9.50). The Eel is really good... still have good texture and the sauce that comes with it has this little bit of sweetness. The Soba Noodle though is so so... definitely not cold enough... but it is hard to give it a good judgement since the taste of Eel is so overpowering after eating that everything taste a little bland.

Aoyama for sure it is a great Japanese restaurant. I would love to go there more often but the price is a little pricier than others for lunch with limited lunch options. 

However, I would definitely interested in trying their Omakase dinner which is $45 and $60 which is quite inline with other Japanese restaurants or I can say even cheaper than some!

They accepts all credit cards including AMEX!"}
{"text":"Very good, very traditional sushi for a reasonable price.  All of the clientele in the 2 hours we were there were Japanese, so that's always a good sign.

The house special sashimi for 2 was excellent and had a good variety for $53.  It included uni, tuna, salmon, king crab, amaebi, scallop, mackerel, and more.  If you have a decent appetite, it's not going to be filling enough for even 2 people, however.   We also ordered raw squid in ink, some rolls, and a few other options. Nothing was a miss, as everything ranged from good to excellent.

The place is small, with maybe 10 tables, so reservations are recommended.  The sushi bar is manned by one person so don't expect speedy service, but that's okay because it's a bit of an art form.  If sushi isn't your thing, they have a pretty large menu so you have other options."}
{"text":"Not often that you find a Japanese restaurant outside of the downtown core that is run by Japanese people! Great staff that are extremely polite. The food was fresh, delicious, and very nice quality. It is a little pricey though especially for the location but the diversity on the menu is also very impressive."}
{"text":"After trying and enjoying Gonoe sushi couple of weeks back we thought of giving this place a try since it's even closer to us. Guess this place isn't for us with all its nice reviews on yelp. We ordered grilled squids which were pretty lame. The dragon roll was ok and the tempura shrimp spicy salmon roll was nothing great. The black sesame mochi cake was decent. Unagi sashimi was good though. Service is great but food was a bit of disappointment."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars to this restaurant i would. This certainly wasn't our first time here, in fact my bf and family frequented this restaurant quite a few times over the past as it is close to our home. But after this experience we would never come back here and i warn all the other guests as well, that if anything goes wrong with the order, they have no responsibility. The female manager/owner here is a joke and absolutely has 0 customer service skills. I came to this place for my birthday dinner, the young server girl got our order wrong and clearly did not understand english very well. Communication was through pointing and simple english. The server ordered the omakase set dinner for 2, plus the sashimi platter, soft shelled crab and atc roll. We only wanted 3 items on the menu, the sashimi platter, soft shelled crab and atc roll. The sashimi platter and soft shelled crab came, then they started bringing the appetizer of the omakase meal to us - we told the young server, we didn't order this and that they got it wrong. She took it back...i thought we made it clear, and this was resolved but boy was i wrong. The female manager (forgot her name) brought out the 2nd course of the omakase meal, a large plate of sashimi, we were shocked. Told her again we didn't order this. She denied it, insisting that we ordered it. We told her, how is it possible that two women, could possibly eat the 2 people omakase meal plus 3 other dishes? We already told her they made a mistake bringing the omakase's first course, why would you even have made the 2nd course?? Here's the ridiculous part, she starts blaming us for not taking the food, shouting and yelling at her staff and finally said to us \"we have a lot of pride, this is excellent sushi, we are not going to make the rest of your order anymore, and flatly told us to leave\". (note: at this time our final ATC roll, which was what we originally wanted did not come). As if we weren't angry enough at this point, but for her to be blaming us and giving us so much attitude for their mistake. Crazy! I've never encountered a restaurant owner like her. If you made a mistake on your customer's order, other places would apologize and make the order right. She did the complete opposite. How's it our fault you kept making the 2nd course of the omakase meal when we told you the first time around we didn't order it?!?! Ridiculous, and to be so rude to our faces in front of all the other guests. Till the end she wouldn't admit she was wrong for handling the situation so poorly, disrespecting us, spoke to us so rudely and thinking there was nothing for her to be sorry about. To add more fuel to the fire, she said to us \"this is not an all you can eat place\", what the heck is she trying to imply here?! To make matters worse, she said \"i have done nothing wrong, we don't need you to pay and don't come back.\" We paid what we ordered, cause sure as hell we aren't letting her think we came for a free meal. By the way, when we said we came here several times before and we were appalled by this behaviour, she literally said \"this must be your first time because i don't remember seeing you here\". Wow,...just wow...... 
Anyways, I warn everyone here, you better be clear with your order because otherwise, this is what happens. WORST ATTITUDE EVER."}
{"text":"Went here to try out the omakase $49 level with a friend to see how it would compare to others.

The odd thing is the meal was actually listed on menu.  This is strange from my previous experiences as I usually do not know what is on the dish.  Maybe they got tired of saying what the dish would have (though that sort of ruins the fun for me)

Anyway I remembered to give my criteria.  Nothing spicy and no uni.

Our meal started with a lobster salad in a martini glass. very flavourful. The radish gives it a bit of texture without hiding the taste.  This is probably the best appetizer I had in any omakase run by far.

The second dish was some sashimi in ponzu sauce with a few edible flowers.  The dish was a bit meh for me, the ponzu sauce was just overpowering the taste of the dish.  The fish is just standard texture so nothing really special, so this part of the meal for me was a bit of a flop.

The third dish was something like deep fried lobster.  Either I haven't had deep fried lobster before or this is the best deep fried lobster I ever had.  Actually it's the best deep fried anything I ever had.  The lobster taste was just so much enhanced by the deep frying and the best part was there was no need to pick it off.

The fourth, fifth and sixth course came in close succession, but they were served on our table at the same time.  Not normally something I like to see on an omakase; at least not in the ones I have experienced as they usually just serve us one entree  at a time and not pile on our table.

Anyway we had some tempura, but it is just standard fare tempura and I have had better.   It's a cheap and common dish I was surprised it even came into the omakase.  In comparison to Jyo-san's, he does not make this into the omakase to my knowledge because it is such a cheap dish.

We then had some nigiri sushi.  I have tried to eat it properly with my fingers, but the thing just kept on falling apart when I flipped it upside down so that wasn't really too good.  The fishes were also of standard fare so nothing really of note especially for omakase.  In comparison to Jyo-san for $55 we got ootoro (tuna belly) which is generally a more expensive fish or uni (though I don't like it).

We also got some seafood soup.  However, it is prepared in something like a tea pot with a very small cup to pour it in.  However, it was a very good mix of flavour and preparing it that way we got to savour the soup better than normal because if they just served it to us in a normal bowl I think something would've been lost.  So this is another bonus point for the omakase there.

Finally we just got some standard fare green tea ice cream for dessert.  However, I think mine was old as it had water crystals already in the ice cream.  Not something you would expect in an omakase meal.

In the end, I would say that though I may try to eat here again for their normal fare for take out only, I would not do nor recommend their omakase here even if the service quality is still above par.  If you want to do Omakase go to Solo Sushi Ya at Newmarket when the chef is around, for $55 it is much better."}
{"text":"The isn't much choice for set meals. We got the dragon roll and the spicy Salmon tempura roll and a regular spicy Salmon roll. The dragon roll was good. The eel in the dragon roll was amazing. The spicy Salmon was very plain and not spicy really under whelming...  For $41 for 3 people... Not so worth it. Plus we waited 30mins when the restaurant which seats 20 only had 6 other customers.  Not bad I guess... But not good for rolls. Or spicy Salmon. The fish was good but... Sadly how can a spicy Salmon roll not be spicy and be so very boring... No taste... Sad :( good service though. Nice for a date night( expensive date night)"}
