{"text":"Ok Beijing Peking duck in the area . Service was decent , the food was a little bland . Nothing too special overall ...  prices were fair i suppose but make sure you check your bill - they calculated my bill wrong twice and then after finally getting the bill right , they gave me back way less change than what it should've been ...if they hadn't don't that I would've given them 3 stars"}
{"text":"Peking Man is a favourite spot for my husband and I, when we go out with his mom for dinner. The Peking Duck here is absolutely fantastic. Skin is crispy as you'd like, the meat moist and juicy and not at all greasy. We like to order the lettuce wrap second course for the duck.  Another recommended dish is the Sizzling Beef, which comes on a hot plate, quite literally still sizzling. The duck plus the beef dish is generally enough to stuff the three us to the gills and barely able to walk.  Okay fine, the decor is as atrocious as everybody says, but I see no reason to dock stars when the food is so very excellent. This is an underrated, very excellent restaurant! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this place for gatherings - birthdays and other celebrations - it's been a norm for the past few years. The place has always been very reasonable with its quality and service. However, management has definitely changed. Portions shrunk. Service terrible. Truly disappointing.  Being a regular we forgave the 10 minute delay to be seated with our reservation and the lack of tea service. However, we noticed that the portion of roasted duck was smaller than usual; and the distribution of the flour wraps likewise. There used to be six cylindrical bamboo steamers per order. It was cut down to three this time.   As the dishes arrived, we noticed everything seemed downsized. The second serving of roasted duck (which is usually the one with lettuce) was not specified on the menu as being something that required an extra charge/order. Instead, we got a dish of a handful of duck pieces with more bean sprouts. It looked half eaten. Never before had we had this issue.   The final straw was perhaps the fried noodle dish, pictured here. We saw the dish placed on the table and it looked like a deflated, leftover plate of noodles. When the waiter finally came to our call, he could not hide the evident and obvious portion issue. He said he would give us another serving of the noodles (guilty perhaps?). And indeed, he LITERALLY gave us another serving of plain fried noodles.  In the end, I don't think I will return to this business. The interior decor has always been one point of interest to visit it. But with the food and service as such, I'd take my family out to better Chinese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Last time I was in this restaurant was when I was 14!    Funny they did not change the d√©cor at all!    Peking duck was OK  - My fav in Toronto is still Asian Legend."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be our go to place for peking duck. Their duck was crispy, and with only one duck, it used to feed a family of 4 comfortably. However, today was a disappoinyment and I would not go back.  We went today and ordered 1 duck,because that was enough every time we came. Today's duck was way too tiny and very different from what we usually had. Because of the small portion, we ordered another dish - sizzling beef. Before it was delivered to portable,i saw a waitress pouring water in the dish and stirring it. That was obviously the biggest turn off. The owner explained that they pour water in before serving because the plate is sometimes too hot and it will burn the food. She also said that this is a \"common\"practice but I have never ever seen a waitress in another Chinese restaurant doing that. Ok,i understand that part about the plate being too hot and it sometimes needs some cooling down process; however, I want all cooking done in the kitchen and I want a cook/chef to cook my dish. Seasoning, changing the temperature of the dish - that's the chef's job and it should not be altered by a waitress. What's the point of a cook/chef to perfectly season my food when a server is gonna pour water over it? As a result, the beef was drowning in water and it tasted really bland.  In terms of service, we were the only one in the restaurant but the service was extremely slow. They wouldn't give us wraps and vegetables until 5 minutes after they served us the duck. The servers were very difficult to get hold of. The price point - i remember it being in the low $30 range a couple of years ago but now it is $41. And like I said, the duck is so tiny.  Overall, that was a very disappointing experience and I was literally so pissed at this place -for the food and the service. I seriously have better food and better service for a lower price at Manchu wok. Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Never dissappointed, service can be hit and miss with duck being served before the pancakes and green onion and cucumber being served sparingly.  Other than that a go to favorite!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's been around for a long time but this is the first time we've decided to try it out. Can't say we were impressed.  I'm not a picky guy and either is my family but not one of us had anything good to say. We ordered one of the set dinners for six people and it took forever for the food to arrive. On top of that, it wasn't busy but not once did anyone come by to clear the dishes, asked if we wanted refills, or checked to see if everything was alright.  Ultimately, the food isn't anything to write home about. Even the Peking duck they are supposedly known for is mediocre. We definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with my family after hearing that the Peking duck there is very good. We reserved a table and while the place looked like it was stuck in another era, we didn't mind as long as the food is good. The duck took about 20 minutes and that was fine. It came out and they sliced it in front of us. The wrap for the duck was good but the cucumber and onion looked like it was prepped days ago and just kept in the fridge. They were dry and not freshly cut at all. We also ordered a few more dishes. A seafood eggplant pot and beef hot plate. Both were disappointing, especially the beef. It was served on a hot plate that was wrapped in tin foil (?) Really? We're not eating at home here. There was too much colouring in the dishes and just not very good. We ordered rice that took forever to come and our tea pot was given to another table.  Service was slow and inconsistent.  In the end we were given tofu dessert but the tofu was not very fresh. So overall the Peking duck was all right but there are others in the city that are just as good if not better. Everything else was below average. 20 years ago, this restaurant would have been something but while other Chinese restaurants improved and changed, this one choose to stay there."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. Been coming here on and off for like 10 years. It is authentic. This is a different type of Chinese restaurants it's dished is more like Asian legend kind. The decor is dated but the food here is good. Come here on Monday or Tuesday (all you can order for 12.99) you will be impressed. But their regular menu can be pricey."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese restaurant ever!! Yak!!!!!!!!!!!!   I feel like throwing up, YES, just came back from Peking Man Restaurant on Sheppard Ave.  I didn't give One star just because of the food, it's the whole combination, the decor, service etc...  We arrived around 5pm, the place was empty. Only one table at the corner with a non-Chinese couple keep on staring at the kitchen, hum..I was wondering why? I found myself doing the something later.   There were four of us, some Chinese and non- Chinese    We ordered  ONE two course Whole BBQ duck (presented and carved duck in very thin slices at the table, comes with crepes(?) and stir fried duck meat with lettuce)  FYI: you make a wrap, sliced duck with crepe or stir fried duck with lettuce,   One Chinese style chow mein One shrimp fried rice One Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce And tea  The hostess informed us it will take 20 mintues for the duck. Ok that's fine, we weren't super hungry!!  5:30 ........ 5:50 ........did we order anything? 6:00 ........nobody works here!!   We waited more than an hour to get our first food. I complained very gently with a big smile but \"..................\" no response. Ok maybe she's having you know what!!  Duck with crepes, actually duck was not bad but  cold, crepes were cold and dry. We wanted to ask for hot sauce and more tea. Hello(((((((((((((((((((((((( I was keep on looking at the kitchen to call somebody....ummmmm...  Finally got hot sauce and tea, but tea was cold..... Then there were other dishes, Fried rice, was grease and cold, Chinese broccoli was good( But how can you go wrong with the most simple dish) but COLD! Cantonese style chow mein was salty, the noodles were soggy not crispy at all and did I say COLD!!  We tried to make an eye contact with our waitress or who ever were near us at the time, Haha no way!! Except for a short hair waiter with glasses brought us everything we wanted...5 minutes late.  We only ate about 1/3 of the food.   We left the place exact @7:10pm. The bill came to $85 call me cheap but they charged us for the tea!! Is this normal for a Chinese restaurant? FYI: BBQ duck $43 ($36: sliced duck with crepes $7: stir fried duck with lettuce)  I felt really bad for my friends because I've been here before with my in laws and it was pretty good back then ( a year ago..i think) prompt service and excellent food. What happened? Ya the decor hasn't changed, dusty x- mas lights, mix matched wall papers, I didn't mind at all since the food was great! and with awesome service!!  Now the place is on my black list... I will never ever go back!!!"}
{"text":"Sheppard and Leslie Location is my go to location. The interior is dated and starting to show its age, but the food is great especially the Peking Duck dish!"}
{"text":"been here a couple of times.  It has never impressed me but they recently added a quick facelift.  ie. paint.  The food is not impressive.  the duck is supposed to be their specialty however it is bland when compared to other restaurants.  What really did not impress me was that the service was very poor.  When the family mentioned a peanut and nut allergy and asked if they could be careful to ensure that the chef ensure no cross contamination, the server said it was a hassle and too much effort.  In addition, the service was overall poor in that they did not serve the soup as most chinese restaurants would or take away done dishes in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I'll admit I was surprised with the current average rating (2 stars).  My wife's uncle took us here.  I think that since he knows the owner and the staff, we had a good dining experience here.  The food was great overall and I would rate it 4 stars.  However, as others have stated, the decor is very dated and odd.  As a combined experience, I felt 3 stars is appropriate.  The Peking duck was excellent.  Crispy, tasty, very well prepared.  You make your own roll.  The sliced cucumbers and green onions were not finely sliced/chopped like you see in other places.  But once you put them in a roll and take a bit, it doesn't really matter.  We had a great white fish (not sure which one, I didn't ask).  It was topped with a sauce of minced pork and preserved vegetable.  We also had fried tofu, lettuce wraps with minced pork and nuts, and gai lan with garlic.  The staff were prompt and efficient.  The only complaint was that the backs of the chairs were sticky, which I attributed to old chairs with a worn paint stain in a humid environment (it was hot and humid in Toronto that day)."}
{"text":"Peking Man is famous for its Peking Duck and it did not disappoint.  The server carved the duck near our table. We did get some very crispy skin pieces as well as pieces with both skin and the right amount of duck meat.  I will give it 4 stars for the Peking Duck but only 2 stars for the rest of the dishes.  The restaurant's decor were dated.  Servers were polite and prompt.  However, I probably will only order the Peking Duck if I ever come back again."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the better Peking duck places in the city. The skin is crisp, meat is tender and juicy and each piece carved with just the right amount of meat. Some of the wraps were a bit dry, probably because they give you so many that by the time you get to the last few they've cooled off! A suggestion would be to serve the wraps in 2 rounds, especially for smaller parties. The Peking duck set course is also a great deal, around $40 for 2 courses depending how you get the second course (the remainder of the duck) prepared. Other dishes I've had here are authentic and on par with most of the better Chinese places in the city.  The decor is gaudy and dated, with pink and other mismatched wallpaper, plants growing out of random places, a broken down mechanical ride at the entrance and a bar that's never open. The decor and set up definitely needs refreshing. But seating is spacious and comfy as the place is huge and service was friendly. The service is rather slow, but they never attempt to rush you to leave, so this was a great place to relax and socialize in the comfy chairs, as long as you don't look too carefully at the wallpaper...  Overall, the food is great and good value, seating is reasonably comfy and spacious so it gets 4 stars. This is not somewhere you would go for fancy decor or a full bar anyways."}
{"text":"Peking duck is delicious! Thin soft wraps, tender juicy duck with tasty sauce. We only order the Peking duck wrap with the second duck dish prepared with stir frying with bean sprouts. The lettuce wrap dish is also yummy.   Would not recommend their other dishes as tried 3-4 and it wasn't good, bland or just didn't taste good. Stick to their specialty, the duck.   Their decor is out dated and in need of an update."}
{"text":"It's the New Year Day and expected that normal menu may not be served.  We order one of the 10 people banquet menu for Christmas and add on top some dim sums.  The Lazy Susan on the table does not work and the waiter has his trick to make it move again very smoothly.  It seems like they are experience in this kind of issue.  The service is average as there may be lots of customers there. Not all of the customers are Chinese, I can say half are not.  The restaurant has been there for 1 or 2 decades.  There must be a reason for it to survive that long.  The soup is very salty. Some of my friends though they like it. The Peking duck is average.  The duck is quite fatty.  But I need to mention that the Peking duck wrap is one of the best that I can recall.  It is big, not sticky, elastic and not easily soap through with sauce wrapped inside.  I can say it's one of a kind.  The double fried lobster the tail has lots of meat. The dessert is very good.  If you like the Chinese look decoration and a little courtyard with plants, it's the restaurant you can try.  I know quite number of Chinese as well as non-Chinese like to go there.  I usually go for Peking dim sums and noodles here, especially after doctor's appointment as it is on the ground floor of 2 medical buildings"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere north to have Peking duck. Worst dining experience ever! The restaurant was the ugliest decor I have ever seen, the bathrooms were utterly filthy and the food cold and very unappetizing. In addition there were families there with loud children running around the place.  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"With Peking as its name, anyone who drives by this restaurant would think that they must have the best tasting peking duck in the city! however, i am not too sure about that.  The decor of the restaurant, was very chinese fusion buffet style, you got purple walls and random chinese/western/dated decor here and there. But i was there for the food, so that didnt bother me much  As for the wait, the lady told us there will be a $20min wait for the peking duck which was reasonable bcuz atleast you know they are serving you freshly roasted ducks. But the wait turned out to be 40min! we were starving by the time the peking duck arrived and wasn't too happy that they werent honest about the waiting time...  In terms of taste, the duck was crispy and decent. it didnt have much flavour on its own, so you have to rely on the sauce provided to give it flavour.   after you eat the skin, there are multiple options on how you want to eat the rest of the duck meat, you can serve it with garlic sauce or you can add more $$ to eat it diced with lettuce or other options available.   I would not recommend the option with the garlic sauce which is additional $2, bcuz it was simply chopping up the duck with some sauce on top, this method was hard to eat bcuz there was barely any meat left on the duck, so you would be spending most of your time nibbling on bones lol but i wasnt very willing to spend an additional $7 to have them debone the duck and give me a few pieces of lettuce either lol"}
{"text":"We came here to try the Peking duck, after all, the name of this restaurant is Peking Man!   My friends tell me that they have been open for a long long time, so their dishes must be legit!   Parking was not a problem, there's plenty of empty spots. There was also plenty of empty tables so we were seated quickly.  We ordered the Peking duck - with flour wrap and with lettuce wrap. The duck was not carved at the table to my disappointment.. The skin was carved with most of the meat attached. To my knowledge, the authentic carving style is to have as little meat attached to the fat as possible. The flour wraps were stuck together - we had problems separating each wrap.   The lettuce wrap was delicious - the lettuce was fresh and the filling was perfectly seasoned. On the side, we ordered Szechuan shrimp - which was pretty bland. The egg whites stir fried with crab meat was interesting with the vinegar - it was my first time trying this!   Overall, I wouldn't come back specifically for Peking duck and I can't comment on the authenticity, but there may be other items that I didn't try that's more of a home run!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Christmas Eve by chance as many restaurants in this neighbourhood had been affected by the ice storm, nothing was open and we were starving.  When you walk in to the restaurant it's like you've travelled back in time as the decor is super dated.  Service was decent.  The peking duck was ok and it was the first time I've ever seen it carved right at the table.  We also ordered the lobster, house special fried rice and broccoli.  The menu seemed somewhat limited and the types of dishes offered seemed more like Manchu-Wok/Canadian style Chinese food.  Little did we know that the take-out menu was more extensive and had more authentic dishes!!!  We didn't realize this until we saw the table next to us ordering from it.  We were never even offered to look at that menu.    Our meal ended up costing $144.  I get that duck and lobster can be pricey but for the overall quality of the food it felt like a total rip-off.  I would say the quality of the food was on par with The Mandarin.  I gave them 3 stars because the servers were nice and work hard, and I enjoyed watching the duck carved at the table.  No intention to return though as there are many other Chinese restaurants that offer better value and better food."}
{"text":"It's hard to describe what this restaurant means to me. It's like a pair of long, forgotten, but great-at-that shoes; When in season I would wear it everyday, but once the hype had passed, the shoes are stored away collecting dust, with a once-in-a-while-pull-out.  Well, Peking man is that pair of shoes. I used to come here often in my younger years (like single digit age) and the dumplings and Shanghai noodles were THE BEST. It was really the only acceptable restaurant where you could eat dumplings and white bread with condensed milk. Now, with Ding Tai Fung, Asian Legends and the variety of restaurants serving dumplings at First Markham, Peking Man has almost been forgotten. For those who have frequented here often, the dark, pink wallpaper still exists, as well as the cloth curtains collecting dust, faux plants and Christmas lights decorating the ceiling, and yes, that one Arcade machine with the motorcylce priced at an 1980's inflation rate of 25 cents. It really hasn't caught up with the times, but to its credit, it is still standing.  Food is still as good as I remember. Some of my family members came here for dinner last night and I had a craving for meat dumplings and Shanghai noodles with crunchy vegetables. However, that is the lunch menu. Dinner options are much more extensive and we had an extra large bowl of Hot and Sour Soup. Now, I normally don't like that soup, but at this place it was SO TASTY. I had 5 bowls of this jolt-in-your place liquid and the flavouring was delish.  Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings (but no meat). All good.  Reservations aren't really needed, although as soon as we came in, 3 big families came in and turned our quiet area into a zoo.   I will always love this restaurant as a place of my childhood, but the food is great too. It's not fine dining and the service is off and on, but I hope Peking Man will stick around for my children to enjoy as well."}
{"text":"The mighty Peking Man proves again that the best Chinese food in Toronto is found in the suburbs. It's a bit tricky to find your way but well worth the trouble. At first, we were worried about the slow service, but as if by ESP a waiter magically appeared with menus to take our drink orders and make recommendations.   We ordered four dishes (spicy garlic eggplant, lemon chicken, beef with black bean, and noodles) to split between the four of us, plus spring rolls and sweet and sour soup.   In a single word the food was \"magnificent\" and the service was efficient and friendly. A quick look around told us we should have ordered the Peking Duck which everyone else seemed to be having but we agreed that trying the duck would give us a great excuse to return soon."}
{"text":"The atmosphere can definitely use a face lift, but the duck is worth the wait! Not a fan of the cabbage wraps, but had a full and satisfying meal :)  Staff was really friendly as I asked for more sauce about 3 times and they brought it out quickly !"}
{"text":"Thought would try out this restaurant on our way to MEC. Our first impression was this is one of the older style restaurant. Ordered nothing out of the ordinary, dumplings, chive pancake and noodles.  The night after going to this place, I got violently ill from food poisoning. Not sure which entree it was but will not be going back and will not be recommending it."}
{"text":"How should I put this? After this visit, vivid memories of why I haven't been here for the last 6+ years start to come back to me.  Off the bat, expect your food to come in reverse order. Why we came?  Had craving for some good duck and this place for some miraculous reason came to mind.  What we ordered and this is the exact order the food came out (for a table of 7 people). - a small plate of hoisin sauce - deep fried onion cake:  looks decent, but no taste - pork slice in garlic sauce: the meat looks a bit raw as it's pinkish color with loaded chopped garlic (not really minced as one would have expected) - marinated pig ears slice:  this is actually decent, and seriously hard to screw up - scrambled egg white:  how come there aren't any broccoli???  And I can't taste anything but egg white. - deep fried chicken with 5 buns:  this is actually delicious - seafood delight with crispy rice:  not bad.  Was told this one tastes better than the one with beef - fried fish in sweet and sour sauce:  this is ok  Finally what we came here for...  - Peking duck (3 course):  the duck skins are quite crispy; the number of pancake that came with this.. not enough, maybe only 2 per person; the lettuce wrap came with very tiny portion of duck meat which other places I have gone to before easily could have double if not triple the amount of duck meat; the soup... peppery...  Last item... complimentary dessert - purple rice with coconut.  Would have been a good way to end the evening until you get to the 3rd spoon and wonder why it tastes so  Overall, dishes here are small portions."}
{"text":"Service: 1/5   If you want to be served by people that act like robots with no emotion,  no speech come here.   Wait time for food: 1/5  Peking duck took 1 hour to come out, when I was told it would only take 20minutes.  Food: 1.8/5   Peking duck is good but when I ordered for the 2nd part. oh my god.   Feels like they robbed and stripped away my duck's meat for another table. I ordered the chopped up type. literally  I was given left over bones.  Had I known I would not have ordered this version, I assumed that it would be like most places which have atleast 4-5 pieces of duck meat attached to the bones.   Be aware !!! prices raised. Peking duck now costs $44.00    Will not be back. Poor service, long wait time and  price is over the board for what is given."}
{"text":"For years and years my sister and I laughed at this place. What kind of name is Peking Man? It seemed like some cheap Chinese restaurant loaded with MSG.   So this place is called PEKING MAN...that means you come here for the Peking duck...at least my sister and I do.  We ordered the 2 course peking duck meal for $39.00. To have the second course cooked in beansprouts, it was $2 extra.   It was about a 20 minute wait for them to prepare everything.   While we waited we talked about how cute the decor was. It was so adorably dated.   The waiter came out with the peking duck and sliced it right before our eyes.   We were given 12 paper thin spring pancakes for the two of us, a plate of scallions and sliced cucumber and hoisin sauce.   The first bite was bliss. The duck was a little fatty but that's what made it so sinfully good. The skin was super crispy. My sister is repulsed by skin on meat products and she happily ate it. The translucent but springy pancakes were able to hold the weight of the scallions, cucumbers, duck and hoisin sauce. Impressive.   The duck with bean sprouts was surprisingly delicious. I was expecting the duck with wraps to be the star of the meal but the second course was amazing."}
{"text":"I came here because it was a closer Peking duck restaurant in North York.  The interior was dingy and interesting. I can't think of a word to pinpoint my feelings towards the mauve patterned walls with oriental dolls and fish tanks as decoration. Additionally, my friend made a reservation for us but they didn't seem to have it in their books - possibly because she made it in English. You could say we started off on the wrong foot.  Once we got seated, she asked the waiter if we could get chrysanthemum tea. He agreed and to our disappointment, we were served green tea instead. I wish they didn't agree to giving it to us if they didn't have it/didn't understand English. Throughout our dinner, I felt as though we were ignored for the rest of dinner compared to the other tables because of the communication barrier. I'm sure it will be a better experience if you can speak Mandarin. This could also have been because it was very busy night.  The duck was good and food itself was fine. Unfortunately, the service we had ruined our experience."}
{"text":"Yes, I know this place has a decor that reminds me of a run-down Cuban restaurant. Yes, I know the broken arcade games at the front can throw you off. But, this is probably the first place that will pop up in my head when I think about Peking duck.   They have so many choices for eating the duck. You obviously have to get the traditional Chinese crepe, green onion/cucumber duck wrap. But then you will have a hard time choosing what to get after. You can choose from the lettuce wrap + minced duck w/fried vermicelli noodles or my recommendation of the Chinese styled pancakes + minced duck filling. Heck, you can even get a duck broth if you're still hungry.  The portions are big, and you could probably feed 3-4 people with one duck. However, some word of advice: Stick to the duck, it's what this place is good for.   I know you see the table next to you having some stir fry vegetables or general tao chicken, but trust me, don't stray from the duck!"}
{"text":"I've seen this mysterious place, the restaurant on the hill, my entire life. My family has never gone here, so I decided to go with some friends.  The place looks like all Chinese restaurants did in the 80s/90s. Pastel walls and carpetting. It really took me back. We ordered the peking duck with the flour wraps and lettuce wraps for the second course. The first course was very good, and I loved how thin and stretchy the wraps were. The second course was fine, but I found the duck a bit overcooked. We also ordered stir fried noodles and greens (there was just four of us). The food was fine, nothing spectacular. I likely won't be back as there are tastier options in the newer Chinese areas of Toronto."}
{"text":"Went to Peking Man for birthday dinner after hearing that it had the best peking duck in town, and sure enough it did not disappoint. Ordered the peking duck 2-course special and it was amazing, the duck was cooked perfectly, the skin was crispy, the meat was tender with just the right amount of fat. They supplied us with more than enough wraps to last us for two meals! We ordered a few other dishes like fried fish in sweet and sour sauce and deep fried pork chop which was average at best was a little too salty and slightly overcooked. We also had shanghai noodles which was also actually very good.  The service was to was also not bad, had reservations and was seated immediately. Was served tea, new plates provided during meal, there was a slight wait for the peking duck but that was to be expected but the waiter also did advise that there will be a wait, so no big complaints.  The decor was a little dated and outright weird to say the least. Pink walls, pineapple wallpaper, christmas decorations (its april), and a plane hanging from the ceiling randomly with a weird doll sitting in it definitely makes you wonder, but the peking duck is definitely one of if not the best in the city and I would definitely go back for seconds. Just enjoy the duck and don't spend too much time looking around at the decor."}
{"text":"When we first walked in it was like going back in time. Decor was really really old, signage was out of date and the staff was really rough around the edges. The seats were comfy though. Food was OK but I was expecting a bit more from the portions. The main reason for coming... The duck! It was pretty good but I was expecting a bit more. Decent pricing. Only down fall was the server took down a wrong order and they made the food. He tried arguing with us that we did order it when actually we didn't. Made me feel uneasy afterwards. Probably would come back if I have a craving for duck."}
{"text":"This is my parents favourite spot. The food is actually quite good, and they have dim sum on the weekends. The peking duck is very good and fairly decent priced. However.....  the decor is HORRENDOUS. it's pink, with plants growing everywhere. There is a bar to the side where it's always empty. The place has not changed since we've been going there 20 years ago. At least they got rid of the smell. My high school friends and I have a theory that the place used to be a strip club, especially with the brass railing in the bar area.   Really, if they took some time to renovate I'd be more willing to come here, rather than only after a doctors appointment.   yet, it's a staple among my parents and their friends. They feel right at home!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place for the family to go to for a dinner out with decent food at reasonable prices, this would be a good choice.   If you are looking to bring a new date, however this would not be a good choice to impress someone. Though the food has not changed in quality over the years, neither has the furnishings and decor. The place is old and it shows.   The restaurant is not the cleanest venue, nor very nice to look at. When I went last for dinner at a normal dinner time around 8pm it was nearly empty there. I would imagine the look of the place would turn away people that weren't recommended to go there for the duck."}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped by here for a late lunch/early dinner. We came at an odd time so there were only 2 couples besides us. I know this place is known for its Peking duck but it was just the two of us so we decided against ordering it and ordered other dishes instead.  We ordered soup dumplings, green onion pancakes, boiled dumplings and a beef soup with glass noodles. The food was okay, there was nothing special about it. The service was nonexistent though, we had to physically get up and look for an employee to place our order and again afterwards to pay the bill.   Will I come here again? Most likely not."}
{"text":"I don't have a problem with the pink walls, but I'm not a fan of the east-meets-west decor. Had I walked in and not seen the Chinese signs or the Chinese statues, I might not have thought this was a Chinese restaurant.   The food was okay. Nothing really stood out. Had the Peking duck too. The crepes were the thinnest crepes I've ever seen. Lovely. The duck, however, was probably the driest, blandest Peking duck I've ever eaten. I'd rather have a good duck that good crepes. Tofu flower for dessert. Brown sugar syrup, not ginger.  Biggest gripe of the night: We thought they had a light that was constantly flickering. It turns out there was nothing wrong with the light. There was a fan that had blades, and when the blade blocked out the light, it gave us the impression of seizure lighting. It was super annoying."}
{"text":"We ate duck in steamed bun and duck. the crispy skin was a good combo with the bun. The duck tasted good."}
{"text":"I had always been intrigued by the name as I drove by. A couple of weeks ago, while I was driving by I was driving by, I decided to have lunch there.  My first impression was that I had stepped back into time and that I was in the type of restaurant with a decor right out of the 70's. A traditional Cantonese restaurant decor.   The food was promptly served and was delicious. Unlike the decor, the food is 'updated' and their lunch special are delicious. I had a Sweet and Sour Soup which was delicious and General Tao chicken which was extremely tasty and well prepared  I could not help but observing at other tables that many people were ordering the Whole BBQ Duck. This was presented and carved in very thin slices at the table. It was interesting to see.  I would like to return, for dinner as they still feature the old cantonese cuisine. I love Shrimp in Lobster sauce, and it will be nice to return to go down \"chinese food memory lane\". If its good enough for Anthony Bourdain in New York to do that, its good enough for me....  And before I forget, they have Fried Apples that are plunged into iced water....a treat!"}
{"text":"4/10 peking duck, nothing special. Only 1 plate of cucumbers/onions for a group of 8.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  The service was absolutely terrible, im writing the review from the restaurant as i eat because its this terrible. Unattentive waiters/servers that purposely avoid eye contact.  I would never recommend this restaurant, even to my sworn enemies.  Leafs also blew a 3-1 lead, terrible."}
{"text":"Prototypical Chinese restaurant Peking Man has been around for a long damn time, even before I started coming to the area as a kid for dental appointments, even before the condos and the Sheppard subway line existed. They had a kitchen fire in 2014 that forced them to close for a period.  You'd think they would take the time and invest in updating their interior when they were fixing their kitchen. But nope, the place still looks like a dingy 90s cruise ship dining hall. And yes there's also the displays of plastic knick-knacks and pink walls to take note of (damn right, hipsters), as well as the unused 'Flamingo' bar section by the front, and the broken motorbike arcade machine at the front. The restaurant is big though, and opens every day from around 11 to around 23h.  Most of the food is okay though. You can taste the soy sauce used in their cooking is more of the phoney Maggi/China Lily variety. Big portions for relatively cheap to relatively pricey. Apparently MSG is a secret weapon, and you have to specify they not use it if you don't want it in your food (that's what it says on the takeout menu).  The service is generally decent, although there was a moment of laziness (you're not going to set my side of my table cuz you couldn't reach over?). Our server was pleasantly informative in explaining their 2-course Peking Duck meal ($40 circa 2015). Yes they'll carve up the duck as they should before you, and it's pretty alright for something they rave as the best Peking duck in town since time immemorial. And then they take what's left of the duck and turn it into the 'second course' serving of duck scraps, which you can have in a variety of ways, most of which costs extra $$$. Not enough egg roll pancakes served with the duck.  Being practically the only Chinese restaurant within a couple miles radius, management probably lack the incentive to improve on the quality of their food, never mind the decor. Then again, there's hardly anything to eat at Sheppard and Leslie--aside Peking Man, there's Ikea and McDonalds. That's it. But should you come to Peking Man, you'll walk out feeling like a 1980s caveman. It's quite the kitschy experience."}
{"text":"A pretty quiet place I never knew existed until a few days ago. Food was not bad.  Their peking duck was delicious and good priced. The owner was very kind and inviting. We had a family birthday here and it went down without a hitch. If you are craving peking duck check this place out."}
{"text":"Been there 2 times...1st time was dine in and the duck was ok but other foods are not to any standard compare to Congee Queen.  The 2nd time was take out.   I must warn you this restaurant Cheat on us.. they put all the left bones from previous customer on our overPeking Duck take out...2nd meal was supposed to be meat cooked etc from the duck but we only got the bones in 2 boxes.  Bad people who did this...will never go back again."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant when I was still in elementary school and the decor hasn't changed a bit. You can tell the interior hasn't been really been updated over the years.   We were here for lunch, and we ordered a lot of appetizers to share. We had the rolled onion pancake with sliced beef. The pancake was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The barbecue sauce was the right amount of sweetness to accompany the thin slices of beef. I just wished the portions were a tad bigger.  The salty soybean soup is seasoned with slices of fried dough fritter, pork floss and pickled veggies. This was a large portion but it didn't wow me. The fried pork chops that came with the soup noodles were fried to perfection. It was fried to a rich golden yellow and seasoned with chinese all-spice. However, the soup dumplings were a big disappointment. The dough was thick and dry but the filling was still juicy. Finally, we had a chinese taro pastry for dessert. You can tell it was fresh out of the oven because the pastry was piping hot. The whole thing just melts in your mouth. I definitely recommend ordering that."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now, the food is reasonably good, the service if you dine in can be fairly slow and the atmosphere of the restaurant isn't t as relaxing as it could be due to the decor, like walking into a 70's movie..  They offer all you can eat from a select menu on Monday and Tuesday nights. I usually go on Tuesday night because that's the night chicken balls are offered and they are really tasty! unlike most Canadian Chinese places who all seem to use frozen portion packed chicken balls that are hard and all batter with straight up ketchup sauce here is different. The chicken balls are very soft and have a \"fresh\" taste to them and the sauce is sweet and doesn't taste like ketchup.   There is always at least 5-6 ducks being served every time I have been here, I have not tried the duck but it is craved at your table and in thin slices, always interesting to watch. I will for sure try it one day."}
{"text":"Firstly, this is a hard place to find! The address is 1110 Sheppard Ave east, but you must look up as it's on top of a hill. Best way to get to head west on Sheppard ave east, turn right on Ambrose and then right on Eunice.   We ordered a 6 people meal package that included the Peking duck.   We had a platter of tofu, cold pig ears, pork belly, veggies, Peking duck two ways (wraps and lettuce), fried rice, and lobster.  My fave food was the pork belly and Peking duck. The pork belly was nice and tender and fatty. The Peking duck skin was very crispy. The meat itself was flavourful. It looked dry but when I ate it, it wasn't. The wraps were super thin.  Everything else was normal. Nothing special.  Dessert was sweet tofu soup. I liked that!   Overall, the Peking duck skin was good, but it wasn't the best or memorable. It was good and probably one of the better places to go to for duck, but not a must go to place, you know? Thou, you won't be disappointed if you do go for duck!"}
{"text":"Speed Read: 1) Great: Peking duck and Egg white with crab 2) Bad / under average: Everything else 3) Plenty of sitting  First off, Peking duck is one of the best.  I would say it's better than Dayali.  Sitting is comfortable. This place is huge, and usually there's no waiting time even on weekend.  We went on a Friday.  Egg white with crab is another good dish here.  However, the complement stops here. Other dishes are only so so, or below average.  For example, The baby bean sprout is way too old, and they are not trim properly.  This is an example restaurant who failed to do the basic Chinese dish correctly.    It is disappointing to see such a long standing restaurant failed the basics."}
{"text":"Yes this place is still pretty good after all these years! It is one of the oldest place in the city to get your Peking Duck. The restaurant is welcoming and the staff is top notch. A lot of people dislike the decor of the restaurant. I think it's quite quaint and family oriented. It's actually a refreshing place especially after every restaurant and even food courts becoming more glam. Wait is that a tree growing in the middle of the restaurant? Everyone that does come here must order their Peking duck. The guy who carved the duck by your table got some skills and strong forearms. Props to him. The skin on the duck was crispy and delicious. I'd recommend this place if you're from Ajax, Mississauga, downtown or even out in Maple. Check it out and say hello to Joe the waiter."}
{"text":"Despite the fact this place hasn't been renovated in over 20 years (I've been coming here for that long, since I was a very young child), the food here is always good. The service isn't always great, but the food does make up for it.  The Peking Duck is always a good choice if you have 3 or 4 people, then you can order some other dishes on the side.  Dumplings are great too and so are all the various rice and noodle dishes.  If you're just going in for lunch they have bowls of noodle soup, or even lunch specials at a very reasonable price. I like to come here with my mom on my days off and enjoy a lunch together. It's reasonably quiet in here and nice to have a conversation in.  If it's lasted this long with this decor, you know the foods gotta be good!"}
{"text":"Okay seriously, not the best interior but at least this isn't congee queen dressed up as \"fancy dining\". The food was pretty good. Bang for your buck and good portions.   The duck was so good. So much better than Dayali (which was pretty bad actually, didn't live to the hype at all). The crepe portion was a little small but ey, whatever, you're here for the duck.   If you want to go for \"fancy\" Chinese dining then this isn't it. But if you're just looking to have some good Chinese food and awesome duck, then this is the place."}
{"text":"We came for Father's Day celebration.  We had a reservation, so we were seated promptly in a small section on the side.  Something was off: our table shared a semi-circular sofa with another table.  Aw, one sofa for 2 tables?  Awkward.  Okay, I gave them that it was Father's Day, and the place was packed.  But why would there be a pile of storage paper boxes nearby?  The wet bar was an organized mess.  The vibe was not celebratory.    We ordered a combo with a Peking duck. Soup came momentarily.  But it took a long, long time for entrees to arrive.  Food arrived in wrong order.  The duck came last, after the vegetable and the steamed fish.  In fact, we got our duck after a neighboring table got theirs, who arrived later than us.  Good if they rushed us a good duck.  Nope.  The duck was stale and at room temperature. The skin was not crispy.  The meat was dry.  It was obviously pre-made and sat aside for a while.  Humm, what took so long to deliver food that was sitting aside then?    The services was inadequate.  Other than taking orders, delivering food, closing the till and cleaning the tables, the servers didn't enter the room.  I tried to find someone to get a new set of chopsticks and to chase down the duck, and I couldn't find one.  Maybe diners in the main section got better services, but this section with a messy bar and paper boxes got next to no love.    Our experience was bad: from venue to food to services.  We felt embarrassed to have taken the elderlies here for what supposed to be their occasions.  The fathers in the group, especially the one who loves Peking duck, didn't enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"The signage really does catch your eye as you drive by on Sheppard Av. PEKING MAN in large, faux-Asian font on a bright red back drop. That's definitely a holdover from the 70s or 80s. After struggling to find an actual entrance (you see, it may be listed as being on Sheppard, but you have to turn on Ambrose to actually get to the storefront. If you're heading east and miss Ambrose, there's no chance to U-turn til Leslie, unless you want to run over city-owned flowers in the median.), we finally parked the car in front of some convenience store in the same strip mall/mini-industrial park building area. Given the PEKING MAN sign is all you can see from the main road, I don't know how other businesses can persist here.   The moment we went past the doors, we were greeted with a motorcycle arcade machine. What is this, Chuck E. Chan? Ah ha, ha., there's a Chuck E. Cheese down the road. A waitress came up and we were promptly seated and presented with these ghastly menus, with cartoon depictions of, presumably, a Peking man in various states of labour (labour as in work, not Chinamen giving birth!).  On to the food! A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef. I'll spare you the details, because there are no details. It was all bland. It was as if everything was frozen for Walt Disney's first meal after being brought back to life from his cryogenic sleep. The soup wasn't watered down, but it tasted like it was. The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges. The duck was somewhat of a saving grace. First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper. Spare yourself from attack of the living bland and eat the duck straight up without the wrapping. Second course, stir-fried duck meat. More meh. Basically, anything these guys actually cook gets turned from gold into lead.  Ariel G. may want to take that trip down memory lane, but this meal was a memory I'd rather repress."}
{"text":"Came here a few times and most recently last night. Overall the dinner is good. Everything we ordered was delicious from the peking duck to the vegetables to the lemon chicken. Loved the fried string bean and beef too. Honestly my knowledge in Chinese food is below average so most of the time other people order and I just eat so I don't know what the dishes are called. But since everything tastes good, you can't really go wrong.  I like the peking duck here. The skin is nice and crispy and cut thinly. The meat is juicy but not fatty. It's fairly lean. It's not fancy but it's very flavorful. The second dish with lettuce wrap and stir fry duck was very tasty as well.   Now all they need is a face lift and it'll bring the restaurant out of 1990."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try Peking duck it's average not worth the price won't come back here"}
{"text":"You know what I hate about Peking Man? They have two menus. One for the Chinese clients, and one for the rest. They don't even pretend."}
{"text":"The Peking Duck dish is a must try, not only for the duck but also for the wraps. The peking dough wrap was probably one of my highlights. If you like delicate wraps that are almost as thin as a peel off face mask, this is the place to be.  The peking duck platter comes with a decent portion of duck meat, with some crispy skin and broken up shrimp chips in the middle. The wraps are served fresh and warm in bamboo steam containers. I found that since they are less floury and thick, it can be hard to peel and separate when stacked together. But once you get the peeling going and have that wrap ready, it does taste so good. One down side is that the peking duck did not come with scallions and cucumbers. But none the less, the hoisin sauce combined with the nicely roasted duck and delicate wraps tasted great."}
{"text":"Excellent Peking duck that is likely the best in Toronto. Tried a few other dishes that were also good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Peking duck is very good, better than Dayali. The only con is waiting so long every time."}
{"text":"I compare all General Tso chicken I try anywhere to Peking Man's.  The service is slow and the decor is delightfully/wildly tacky, but I seriously drive from Etobicoke to have the Shanghai fried noodles and General Tso Chicken. Unique recipe, quite spicy too.   The Peking Duck looks cool to get, lot of effort put in table side.   So, long and the short of it, fantastic food, brutal everything else. But I still go."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and sister. Ordered Peking duck, steam fish and beef with broccoli.  All these dishes were exceptional, and I can't recommend it more. Only problem i had with this resturant is the wait time for food. It took around 30 minutes to get the food.  The dessert they give is also really delicious.   The decorations in the resturant though, remind me of 1930s China, especially the wall lights.  Hence why I give the resturant 4/5 stars, mostly due to the wait time."}
{"text":"$36 for a 2 course Peking Duck dinner. Not the best Peking duck I've had in the city but I still enjoyed it. Look out for the undercooked, gooey dough wraps, they are gross. I ended up just eating the duck on it's own, avoiding the wraps and dried up/stale cucumbers that came with the meal.  The additional $7 for the lettuce wraps - If you are a group of 3 or more it is a good option as part of an add on to the Peking duck meal. It sure beats the fried noodle dish that the dinner comes with.  The star dish of the evening was the Szechuan Beef. I was pleasantly surprised and would not have ordered this on my own but my friend raved about it. I ate this more than I had the duck! It's definitely worth a try.  Now I must discuss the decor. As you sift through the reviews, you will notice plenty of comments around the appearance of the restaurant. Yes, the food speaks for itself but unfortunately the food had nothing to say here so the pink walls don't help. You can see the lack of effort in maintaining a suitable ambiance and cleanliness here. I avoided the bathrooms.  Lastly, if you want a good laugh, check out their website, it's as dated as the furniture! Apparently you can \"order online\", hilarious!"}
{"text":"Had their peking duck with fried rice, chili chicken, and another fried rice. Their food was clean and they fut the duck infront of us. You gotta wrap it with green onion and the sauce. Soooo goooooddd. Their chili chicken qas a little salty for me tho."}
{"text":"New Year's Day dinner with fam and the place was not too packed. The Peking is the speciality here and it was good but not above and beyond any other place.  The parking is weird (angled parking out front, two rows) so you have to do some work to get a spot).    The service is good and they have a good mix of clientele that were there so it's not a pure Chinese only type place if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Took my MIL here for her birthday lunch. It was busy when we came in but soon emptied out. I liked that there was lots of parking available near the restaurant & not too many cars coming in & out. In my opinion the decor is ugly & needs an update. Pink walls and cheap ornaments on the walls doesn't spell pretty in my book.   But the food was good & plentiful. Prices were cheap for the amount of food you get. The wait staff seemed kind of distracted at times but responded to requests promptly for the most part. We had lots of leftover food so ended up taking it home. There were 8 of us at the table with room to spare. Dishes we tried: Vegetable fried rice, Scallion pancake (so yummy!), Chicken balls, spare ribs, vermicelli with chicken and more. Note: you have to specify no MSG if you don't want it in your dishes.  Pros: -lots of parking -big portions -deilicious food -good for big groups, spacious  Cons: -ugly decor -must specify no MSG -distracted waitstaff -washrooms cold & need updating but clean"}
{"text":"The absolute best place to get peking duck. I am obsessed. The duck is perfectly roasted every time (the crunch factor for the skin is 100%), the wrap they give you is thin but still has the \"doughy\" taste you're looking for (which is great because it let's you taste more of the roast duck), and when you finish it off with your cucumber, scallion, and hoisin sauce, you have perfection! The price is also hard to beat with the quality and quantity you are getting! Their peking duck is 5/5!!  I also love their duck lettuce wrap. It's very well made. You can pretty much expect anything you order that has roast duck in it to be delicious. For all their other dishes (scallion pancake, beef noodle soup, egg white with crab, etc) they are average--nothing to obsess over about.  Decor (as others have mentioned) is pretty outdated. I actually wanted to leave upon entering the restaurant the first time I visited. But their peking duck was life changing, service is decent, and I have been returning ever since."}
{"text":"Their Peking duck is very good although not sure if they are best in Toronto as we have heard. Our duck was skinny when it was presented to us before serving so we were a little disappointed. It tastes great but nothing to race about.  Our family friend swears by it so we will try them again.  One great thing is that they sell their Peking duck wraps to go, very useful when we want to host Peking duck and don't want to make out own wraps."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on Sunday for a late lunch with my extended family. There were 12 people in our party and we ordered A LOT.   We first started off with 4 of the duck. It was kinda creepy because four waiters and waitresses surrounded our table with the duck and started cutting it up. The duck is really good with the pancake things and a little bit of cucumber and sauce. It is a little oily so hard to eat on its own.   Next, we had some beef with a type of bread. It was really delicious when the beef was stuffed inside the bread. Otherwise, it's also really good in the lettuce. At that point I was pretty full.   However, we had even more food. We had some fried rice with and without egg. By far the best fried rice I had. Not too oily and not too dry.   We also had black bean noodles but I didn't have any so I can't say. Since we had a lot of dishes the bill came up to around $300. We had a really nice meal and the service was pretty good since one server sticked to us the entire time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cool kitschy place, this is it!  If you're looking for a somewhat quiet place where you can converse, this it!  If you're looking for a relatively cheap food that tastes amazing, this is it!  If you're looking for a .......  Well, you get my drift; this is an amazing place to be (in a kitschy way)"}
{"text":"I think the food is fine although not five star level. The customer service is good. I enjoyed the lunch there with many relatives."}
{"text":"Peking duck is a must have if you come to this place. The duck meat is cooked perfectly. Crispy skin and tender meat almost makes up for the slow service and disappointingly small portions. The duck is fairly cheap, 1 whole duck with 2 courses being $39.   Our duck platter came within 20min or so, but our second course didnt come until almost the 1 hour mark. And it was served with stale \"crispy\" rice and veggies. We had to constantly remind the servers to bring us sauces and onions, even though the restaurant was pretty much empty when we got there.   If you dont mind slower service, or just want your weekly fix if peking duck, then come to this place. But dont expect to be full after 1 course."}
{"text":"We've only ever ordered take-out so not sure what their place looks like. Probably THE most timely delivery I've ever experienced and consistently too. We're vegetarians so can't comment on the duck and such. Not too greasy, very tasty, affordable. Usually we call in but recently found their website - which is cute and easy to maneuver."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get all the negative reviews! This place has been around forever and my family and I have always had very good experiences here. The food quality has always been reliably, dependably, consistently good, ever since I was a little girl. Whenever we crave non-Cantonese Chinese food and don't mind making the drive out/are in the area, we know we can count on a good meal here.  Superwoman and I once shared a Peking duck between the two of us. It was sinfully delicious. Literally one of the most satisfying things I've ever done. The duck had a crisp skin that wasn't too oily, and the meat was perfectly juicy. The wrappers and condiments were standard. To be honest, the wrappers weren't the best I'd ever had*, but they were just fine - nice and thin, didn't get hard/crusty like a lot of other places. The cucumber and green onions were julienned very thinly, like they should be - I've been to places where they were sloppy and made them thick, which takes away both from presentation and the balance of flavours. So Peking Man does the condiments right.  An absolute must-try that I might even place above the duck is their red braised beef noodle soup. Best beef noodle soup in Toronto, hands down. It's uber flavourful, doesn't give us (me and Superwoman) MSG headaches, it's so rich (but not oily, the way Japanese ramen tend to be, which I also love), the beef is SO tender you barely need to chew...it is one of the best noodle soups I've ever had. In fact, being the Taiwan enthusiasts that we are, Superwoman and I have been to a couple super well-known beef noodle soup joints in Taiwan and - *gasp! - we still think Peking Man's version is better. So do what you will with that piece of information.  We also like their tantan noodles - it's nutty (because of the sesame sauce, not peanut, which a lot of people mistake it for) and creamy and rich. Their soup dumplings and potstickers are also on point (though when we crave the foods in this paragraph, we often go to our local neighbourhood Asian Legend, because it's closer and they do a good job). The faux crab made of egg whites is good. Ditto the Chinese chicken noodle soup, with house made chicken broth and bok choy.   The service and decor aren't the best, but I always prioritize food over these things. We really like this place and we'll keep coming back!  (*That honour belongs to an upscale restaurant I think up in Richmond Hill on Bayview - I think it was called ?? - they made their wrappers super thin but they didn't break and had green onions steamed into them - they were incredible. Sadly, that restaurant no longer exists.)"}
