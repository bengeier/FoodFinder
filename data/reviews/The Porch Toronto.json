{"text":"This is bullshit. Making us wait for an hour when there's a birthday dinner we are attending. Ridiculous !!!"}
{"text":"Nice Patio, but that is about it. Food is not worth the money, bathrooms are usually dirty on the patio and service isn't the best either. This place has a lot of potential to be great with better operations and management."}
{"text":"Absolute shithole. DO NOT GO HERE, EVER, NO MATTER WHAT. I don't do reviews but after going here I had no choice. Stopped in for a beer. After 'walking' up 6 flights of dirty, filthy, dark stairwells, I got to a cheap patio furniture rooftop filled with half dressed servers and hardly anyone around.

We ordered 2 sol beers. \"2\"!!! The bill was $19.48. TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! for 2 beers! This shit hole won't be around long. We work hard for our money, sometimes, don't go and throw it away to these losers that dont give a shit about the quality of thier shithol establishment. I don't give a F**K where it is or what city it's in. One day soon someones gonna level it and do it a favour."}
{"text":"Great rooftop patio right in the middle of downtown. The view is nice mostly because there aren't any high-rise buildings immediately beside it, so you can a 360 view of the city.

I've been here a few times and would honestly say it's one of the better patios we have in Toronto. Come here to soak in some Summer (however short) weather while it lasts! The food is so-so, come for the drinks and the chilling!"}
{"text":"This afternoon my friend and I walked into The Porch, sat down and it started sprinkling.. The group of 5 waitresses standing around staring at our table directly at me and did not come over to ask us if we wanted a drink or to tell us they weren't serving people anymore due to the weather. Waitresses then walked by our table multiple times and nothing was said to us... 
So needless to say, we left without any of them saying bye."}
{"text":"Never have I had such bad service and an horrible experience in my life. I'm not one to complain but I felt the need to have my review known by management. As a server myself along with the 10 other females that were with me at the time. We are pretty understanding and patience people because we get the service industry. When we first arrived we waited 15 min to be greeted and asked for our drink order (which is fine) but when the first thing the server says to us is she is putting it all on one bill (that is not ok).   We kindly ask for the 11 person table to be spilt as we had no intention of ordering food just 2/3 drinks each. Which is not a unreasonable request I might add. She then proceeded to say that then she would need a visa from each and everyone of us if we wanted separate bills. We said no and we would just pay as we ordered them if that was easier for her. Finally we ordered our drinks and after a 20 min wait for everyones drink except one which was forgotten and had to be reminded twice to be received. The server never came back to bill us for the first drink so we continued on and a few ladies ordered one or 2 more drinks. When it was time to make it to our game we asked for our bills and she brought us one all together. Not only is this completely unprofessional and not to mention aggravating after explaining from the beginning that the bills would be separate she proceeded to ask us to spilt it amongst our selfs. Finally we told her what everyone had and she wrote it down and she said she would spilt it. Then came back 15 min later with her phone and the one bill and said she would minus of each item everyone had with her iPhone calculator. Are you joking me. By the end we were late and left very disappointed. The poor girl probably lost money to cause she wasn't adding the tax when she was telling everyone what they owed. I blame management for improperly trained staff. The 11 of us won't be returning."}
{"text":"3.5 stars really because I can't decide between 3 or 4.0.  The stairs.... oh. so. many. stairs!  I honestly can't imagine how drunk people would manage to get out of this place....unless that's the point :)  The view and the atmosphere is amazing!  Beautiful view of the CN tower and it's a great place to hang out and enjoy some drinks with friends.  I didn't try the food here, as was meeting for drinks for a friends birthday.  There was a 15 minute wait, but no cover, to get into The Porch.  This was slightly lame, as our friends were there already, and there was plenty of space for us up there.  When we got in, we saw many people with these little pails, drinking very fruity looking drinks.  Of course, I had to have it.  Upon receiving it, I realized I just bought a $10 slushy...but it was fun all the same.  Very little alcohol in a very large drink!  This seems like the perfect place to go and enjoy drinks with friends, however there are no beers on tap.  The only beer sold in a bottle is Sol, and the rest are in cans.  Not a fan of beer in cans, so I ordered the Sol.  Beyond that, there wasn't anything else I would have been interested in drinking.  The wine was being served in plastic drink cups, not wine glasses.  I realize it's a seasonal venue, so maybe that's why.  I would return, as I did have a really great time.  Our waitress was hilarious, and I enjoyed her running commentary."}
{"text":"You really only come here for the view, not the food and definitely not the prices.

A bulldog was $16.50, and a plastic cup cocktail was $14......

After hiking up 4 storeys I arrived at The Porch. 

The view was lovely, and the music is great. 

All I had were nachos and that was probably enough for 3, maybe 4 people. The drinks were ok, and service was a bit slow. 

Trying to find a shady spot was difficult, so bring lots of sunscreen. 

Beware that people will also hog the patio chairs...

The staff was quite snobby and looked like they hated their job. 

Overall, this place was ok."}
{"text":"Good view, but other than that its pretty awful...
First of all theres a $6 cover fee and then overly priced booze and food.

Once we got up to the Porch, my friend and I found a 2 seater which was great. But.. waited over 25 minutes and NO server came to say hi, let alone ask us if we wanted anything. Eventually we got up and went to the bar to order our own drinks because of the awful service. 
Once we ordered our drinks and paid (they only take credit too) we sat back down at the 2 seater and sipped our $19 Bulldogs... they were ok but not worth the price. We sat there for over an hour and still NO server came to us at all or acknowledged us. 

So overall, good view, overpriced food and beverage and TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!

Wont be going here again.."}
{"text":"Came for the view, left running for the toilet. 

If you are just want to have an overpriced drink and sit in the sun with a view of the CN Tower, then it's not a bad choice. I must say the vibe of this place it pretty cool. It is a great place for young people to go to sit on a rooftop patio in DT Toronto, just don't expect great service. 

Also stay away from the food. It took us over 20 minutes to get a waitress to come to our table. Once we order it took another 45 minutes for us to get our burgers. After we ate, we moved to a different part of the deck because of the sun. From there we had a view of the kitchen and we were blown away. Food was sitting out directly in the sun for over 20 minutes. We thought it was just sitting there left over and then we saw a waitress bring it over to a table.  About an hour later I was very sick from food poisoning. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"Beautiful view but horrible service! Would not go back. Took forever for someone to take our order and forever to get the bill! I came being excited for the pail margarita drinks but it was super overpriced for the amount given to us. The food was good but slightly overpriced as well."}
{"text":"This place is definitely racist. I came here the other day with a couple friends and was not given the time of day until 30 minutes later. We finally got the attention of a waiter and asked if we could order. She stared us down and said she'll be back. She didn't come back and huddled in a group with other waiters; occasionally staring at us. Looking around, the staff was entirely Caucasian and didn't seem to notice that we were there. When our server did come, he didn't seem to be focused on us. The only person who provided decent service was the bartender. All the waiters and waitresses were rude to us. Classic case of Asian and South Asian discrimination and racism. Overall the service was horrible. The view is great."}
{"text":"Visited the porch yesterday with my 2 friends. We luckily found a table as soon as we got in - we were sitting for about 15 mins with no server in sight. We stopped a server who was just walking by and at this point we were pissed about being ignored for so long. Skye (our server) went above and beyond & turned a crappy experience into an awesome one. She definitely was the reason we ended up staying for as long as we did!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friends birthday. There was a really long line up outside but once you get in, after paying cover, you get seated on the second floor where you can order food and drinks before going upstairs to the porch. Once you get to the porch you seat yourself anywhere and stand in line at the bar. The music was not the best and there is no dance floor, its a place to just hang out. However, they had a creative drink served in a sand pail to give you a \"chilling on the porch\" type of vibe. You are basically paying for the outdoor vibe and a bit of the view."}
{"text":"$10 cover to sit on a patio. We were promised by the girl who collects the cover charge that there were TVs that had been added to the patio (we wanted to watch the Raptors game). There weren't. My friends ordered the bulldog which was $18.75 and comes in a beach pail. You would think a drink that expensive would be filled to the top and actually taste like alcohol. Nope, the bucket they serve it in came 1/3 full and tasted like watered down slushy.  I've been here last year and the thing was full to the brim. When brought to our server's attention (we showed her a picture of what our drinks looked like the last time we came), she said that the bartenders were \"switching things up.\" So pretty much they jacked up the prices and reduced the volume.  The beer I ordered was warm. So I asked for a new one which was also warm. Food is overpriced. The view is nice, but I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Left feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"-Extremely crowded 
-horrible service 
-dirty bathrooms 
-overpriced alcohol 
-overpriced food
-cover $6/person 

Went there with friends. Firstly, they charged cover of $6 per person. This was on a Friday 6pm. Extremely crowded and loud. You have to find your own table. Food and alcohol was overpriced. Our waitress was snippy and slow. Took her half an hour to get our bills. 

Don't recommend at all."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy. Drinks were pretty cheap and the view is gorgeous. Relaxed atmosphere. I would recommend ordering their bucket drinks!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little secluded roof top pub. AWFUL and expensive food. Waitresses were super sweet and nice. 
Would not come back here for anything other than to grab a drink and see the CN tower"}
{"text":"Went here on a summer afternoon to see what the hype was all about. Beautiful view of the city. Service was confusing because it was a different person each time somebody came by the table to drop off our drinks, food, etc. Ordered the infamous porch bulldogs. Pretty cool how they were served in sand buckets( $18.75). The porch burger- stale, microwaved burger with cold soggy fries. $17 bucks for this bad boy which supposedly had porch sauce, cheddar and bacon. There was no porch sauce, barely any bacon and a slice of singles cheddar cheese on it. Had to drench it in ketchup to be able to swallow because it was just that dry.

Gave it one star for the view cause without it, I'll probably give -0."}
{"text":"Picture perfect but highly over rated. Would not recommend going unless you're there strictly for pictures. The food menu is fairly priced (13-20$) but the food is extremely mediocre. Nothing special- of course they're known for there drinks here, served in cute buckets. But ONE drink will cost you 14-17$. Insanely expensive, and while there \"Porch colada\" is impressively tastey, I just can't justify the price. Yes it's served in a cute bucket but it doesn't mean you get a larger serving of the drink- just cute pictures really. Service was also very mediocre. Vibes and scenery were wonderful but I have no interest in going back whatsoever. They also seem to have a 6$ fee at certain times and perhaps days (I think it's after 5pm they charge)."}
{"text":"This place is way too overpriced. 
I wanted to visit this place a long time ago, so on my bday we decided to go there with my friend. we were charged 14 $ at the door, and it was only cash so we need to use the ATM what they have in the building ( which charges more 3,50$) I wasn't sure this place gonna worth 14$ already, when I saw the menu online and its super pricey. 
We ordered the margarita bucket which is 17,50$. It was Ok, but I was expected something better for that price, also I couldnt taste alcohol in it at all. It was more some kind of juice and ice. A lot. 
We also ordered coconut shrimp, which was really tasty, 6 piece for 14$. 
I think if they have these prices they should not ask for cover fee. I had one cocktail for 17,50 plus the charge fee 14 which makes my cocktail super expensive. 
Id not go back again, because I can see nice view somewhere else too."}
{"text":"Been coming here since last Summer and as much as I love the Patio space everything is just a rip off.

If they are not charging $5 for entry during busy periods they are charging $20 for chicken strips! 

It is still a great patio which I recommend to friend's all the time with the warning that they do charge \"Club level\" prices and to consider Croc Rock as an alternative."}
{"text":"About time someone thought to open up a patio with an awesome view of the CN tower. The staff are also super friendly. Came here with a bunch of friends for some drinks and apps, and we all loved it. The nachos were definitely the highlight. Lots of topping on it, and was such a great sharer. The pizzadilla was also really yummy but it's not a shareable dish. My friend tried the veggie wrap and said it was really good. We're definitely coming back to this gem!"}
{"text":"Very young and very \"party\" atmosphere. Great location on a very exciting street. A coworker and I stopped in on a business trip - she is younger than me I felt a little out of place as I'm almost 30. Bartenders were wonderful! Gave us shots and chatted us up. We were up on the open roof and the weather was beautiful"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in the downtown core that actually has sun during the after work hours.  Great place to meet new people since you probably have to share your communal table with another group.  Good luck getting service at the table though - I suggest going to get your own drinks from the bar.  I recommend getting your drink of choice in a bucket (totally reminds me of Thailand).  Also, look for the footprints in the centre of the rooftop - if you place your feet there it is the perfect selfie spot with the CN Tower."}
{"text":"The scenery was so amazing! The vibe was great and everyone around us was so incredibly nice and welcoming. It was my first time here so I was a bit confused about the ordering process (you have to order everything at the bar) and even though we had to wait outside in the line for about 20 mins, when we got up to the rooftop, we still has to wait to find a table. Thankfully one of the security members flagged a table for us!!! The food was good, really liked the mac and cheese Popsicles, the burger was average. Would definitely recommend though because the experience was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous view but terrible service, overpriced drinks and food. We came on a Tuesday evening and the service was already SO slow, I can't even imagine coming here on a weekend. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to go on a nice breezy warm day! Don't go when it's blazing hot because you will melt (like I did). Gorgeous rooftop with a beautiful view of the area. There are a bunch of lounge areas, high top tables and a bar. 

Once you enter just grab an available seating area there is no one there to seat you. It's has plenty of room for large groups of you can find seating. It was packed when I went but me and 6 other friends were able to sit and order food. 

Our waitress was so so so nice! She had great hospitality and always checked in on us! LOVE that! 

The food was good I had typical chicken fingers with French fries. The food was typical \"bar food\" as they say. They serve great drinks and one of my friends ordered watermelon slices, very refreshing especially on that hot day! 

It seemed like a very popular place to go since there were so many people. They also played good music. There is an indoor area downstairs but everyone was on the rooftop. Also it's a walk up! No elevator just warning you now. Definitely would go again on a cooler day."}
{"text":"I like the concept of the restaurant, it's pretty unique and hip. I love how the larger drinks comes in a playful sand bucket which is pretty cute. The only thing is you get this huge slushie with no content to very little alcohol which was a little disappointing. The alcohol level should be equivalent to having 3-4 drinks, but you feel like you are having one big drink watered down"}
{"text":"$14 cover per person for the patio because the Jay's game is on?!?! Does it cost extra to use the bathroom too?"}
{"text":"So. Many. STAIRS. Good news is once you make it upstairs it will all have been worth it. Gorgeous view of the city and really nice set up overall. We arrived at 9pm and had to wait in a line for about 15 minutes, but there was no cover.  It was packed upstairs so I can see why there was a line up. I didn't get to try the food, only the cocktails which go for $14 for 2oz. cocktails. I recommend the Porch mojito. They also have small cans of beer but not a big selection. My friend got the bucket margarita which looks fun but only comes with 1 oz. of liquor. No thanks. 

Our server was lovely, and had some good suggestions for drinks. She was very attentive and friendly.  

My only complaint is they need to revamp those washrooms and have a proper ventilation system. It's so muggy and disgusting in there especially when it's so hot outside. Ugh!

I'll be back again to enjoy more cocktails and give the food a try!"}
{"text":"Disprganized and terrible service. Management has miracously squandered one of the better rooftop views of the city. Advice would be to train servers to be passionate about the drink and food menu and timely in delivery. Why have them at all? Maybe have people go straight to food truck themselves.

Front door people were on point in managing entry and crowd.  DJ and music volune was on point as well."}
{"text":"Came up here around 5 with a group of 9. They seated us no problem. There was a $6 cover because the summer season has started. Food is small and insignificant in taste but you come here for the experience. All beers are $9-10 and food is $14-20 or so. Most of our table got the shrimp and they were good but small. A cool place to hang out. They have popcorn and games downstairs. Ping pong and darts are free to play. The deck is way up the stairs, the building looks smaller than it is!! Our waitress was a wonderful human and was very attentive. Something that I found is not one of Toronto's strength was service so it was refreshing to have someone who cared."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave bad comments unless I am really really upset. 
I went on a Thursday night with a whole bunch of friends. They saved a seat for me on the patio, but the security guy told me I still need to stand inline for my turn. The lineup was ridiculous. My friend came down to get me. No luck! You HAVE to wait in line. Finally I got up on the patio, it wasn't even at the full capacity. They just kept people downstairs waiting online to make a scene. 
Asked for an extra glass for about 5 times. Later on we went to Oasis 2 blocks down, had a much better time."}
{"text":"First of all when entering the restaurant you need to complete a full leg workout of 6 flights of stairs before even reaching the porch. The waiters didn't even acknowledge me and my friend when we had already seated for more than 20 minutes. Before we ordered the waitress carded my friend and I, however the waitress was not able to do simple math and thought my friend was underage, but mind you that we were born in the same year. Ordered a pina colada drink which only tasted like rum and nothing like a pina colada it also was completely overpriced total came out to $19. The porch is nice to relax and has good views but everything is terrible other than that."}
{"text":"I went here one evening after dinner with a girlfriend for 28th birthday drinks. We were by far the oldest people on the patio! We felt we didn't belong at all. Definitely a place with a younger crowd. 

There is a $13 cover. Honestly we thought the guy was kidding when he told us. Cover for a patio? Why?! The stairs! There is so many of them. Good luck to those who drink too much and have to come back down. Wonder how many people have fallen down them...

The place was packed, but we were able to find a table with an awesome view of the CN Tower. Honestly, it's worth a visit just for the view. Breathtaking at night. 

We ordered our first round of sandpail daiquiris from the bar. We barely had to wait for service at all and the bartenders were extremely nice and worked quickly. 

Love the strawberry flavour. Sweet, but refreshing. I love the addition of the watermelon. It's a nice touch. Second round we were served by a waitress. It took awhile for her to come around, but we didn't have to wait too long for the drink. Mango this time. Good, just not as good as the strawberry. The waitress seemed to have too many tables to handle on her own. She seemed to be the only person manning the patio. She was extremely friendly despite the chaos. Definitely gave her a good tip. 

The bathroom is NASTY! Do you best to not use them in any case. There was what I'm hoping to be water all over the stall floors. The floors were extremely dirty. The garbage was over flowing and there was toilet paper stuck to the wet floors. 

The drinks were average priced for downtown Toronto. I believe they were around $12-$14 for the sandpail? Overall, fun evening."}
{"text":"Only go there for the view. Food was crap along with the service. Not friendly at all and not helpful with selecting menu items. For a patio you would think they have umbrellas like every other patio. Drinks were very watered down and below average. All it is worth it for a picture with a bucket and cn tower"}
{"text":"Part of a three level building capped by the Porch Rooftop patio this place is great, the staff are friendly, drinks and food are good. Not a big fan of the cover charge and Yes the prices are a little higher but what can you do. The Music and DJ's here are also always on point. I live around the corner and intend to become a regular here. See you there!"}
{"text":"Great view of the city skyline at night! Good alternative if the line is too long at the other establishments nearby. The climb to the rooftop (3-4floors) is a small workout, but you can always use it as good excuse to reward yourself once you get to the rooftop bar. Cover varies by day, usually $5-10 on weekends."}
{"text":"Honestly not sure why there are so many negative reviews for The Porch. I came here around sunset on a summer afternoon with some friend, and I loved my time here. We split a bucket of strawberry margarita -- so delicious and so worth it. Having just come from an internship in NYC where a single fancy cocktail costs about the same ($18.75), this bucket got all 3 of us noticeably more tipsy and tasted 10x more fantastic.

We also split the nachos, which were alright but food isn't the priority here. Definitely recommend anyone in the city during the summer to spend some time at the Porch. The view is amazing, the ambience feels beach-y and relaxed, and the staff does a great job of servicing everyone no matter how busy it gets."}
{"text":"Loved the view and decor. They had string lights - so pretty! 

I didn't have any of the food when I was there but their drinks were good. I do love that their sangria has option of white or red. I don't like red wine and a lot of places only make sangria with red. 

Great atmosphere and view. 

Haha just so many stairs but that's what you get with older building and to get the great view."}
{"text":"Not a fan: I find it pretty excessive they charge a cover ($6) just to go have an average dinner on the patio. I mean, the patio area is very nice, but self serve. This can get very annoying, especially when you pay a cover, only to walk around the patio for 15 mins waiting for a table to free up.

I will give them some credit- The staff are very nice here, and I really enjoyed the margarita bucket drink on a hot summer night. The view is also a plus, but still not worth the hype in my opinion."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love buckets?

Let's face it - we don't come here for drinks, we come here for instagram photos, because that one friend in our social group keeps suggesting this place, and for the view. Although the prices are a bit steep, the Porch is definitely worth a stop or two.

Their signature buckets make for a cute pic, and although their cover charge can sometimes put a damper on things... let's face it - you would have spent the same amount of money on a fancy iced coffee you would have gulped down in 5 minutes.

When you think about it that way, I'd take an overpriced bucket over an overpriced iced coffee."}
{"text":"We heard about this new Margarita Tower being served and we though this was brilliant.. we must try it. So the same day we heard about it, we went to try it. 

When we got there, we had to pay a seating fee of $6 (not a big deal but it wasnt busy.. didnt make sense to be charging a seating fee when it was not busy, imo). We got seated pretty quick since it wasnt busy (it was kind of cold and windy for patio). Staff was friendly and served us fairly quickly. They offered blankets for their customers because it was kind of chilly out. 4/5 for their customer service.

We wanted the margarita tower but since it was new, they didnt have it updated on their menu.. but we asked a waitress and surely enough, they had the towers available. They had 3 flavours available.. Strawberry Pineapple Sunset, Lime Curacao Splash and Cranberry Campari Classic. The waiter suggested the Strawberry Pineapple Sunset so we took his advice and we chose just that. 

Each tower fits roughly 80oz of Margarita which is approximately 10 cups. They are made with Patron Tequila so we expected it to be pretty strong. We got a tower for the both of us to share (yes..both of us..2 people.. about 5 cups each..) and we were prepared to be LIT. 

The waiter informed us that because there is a lot of alcohol, and that he wasnt supposed to serve this to tables under 4 people but he did anyways and told us to be safe.. (thumbs up for caring about your customers). 

Now as for the Margarita.. I would rate it 5/5.. for taste.. but 1/5 for the cost.. and let me tell you why. The drink itself tasted excellent.. but $175 for a tower... I think the **** not. We had exactly 10 cups each.. we filled each cup to the brim.. so that makes it to about $17.50 for a cup.. the price is beyond overpriced.. not even their regular drinks cost that much.. This does NOT include the $6 seating fee and tips.. 

The bill came up to approximately $95 per person (including seating fee and tips; no food or anything, JUST the tower). Just a ridiculous price for drinks..

Not only did we finish the tower between the 2 of us.. we werent lit like we were expecting to be.

This would be our first and last time ordering Margarita Towers here.. unless we see some changes.

We do understand that this is their new products and maybe theyre just testing the waters.. so no hard feelings.. we just wanted to get our opinions out."}
{"text":"As long as you go to The Porch with realistic expectations, you'll have a great time. As all the reviews say, the drinks are all overpriced and pretty watered down. However, this isn't the first bar to overcharge for drinks; welcome to life downtown. And to combat the slow service, why don't you just walk over to the bar and order a drink for yourself, rather than waiting for the server to come by? There are about 3 flights of stairs that you have to climb in order to get to the bar, but it's hardly worth complaining about. Honestly, the view was absolutely incredible and probably one of the best you'll find (if not the best) in Toronto. Although it isn't a bar that I would go to on a regular basis, it's definitely worth going at least once or twice. I had a fantastic time!"}
{"text":"I went here with a few girlfriends on a Thursday for some drinks. There is a $10 cover fee from Thursday to Sunday. Those days get busy, so they take full advantage of it. After walking up a few flight of stairs, we were greeted by a stunning patio and a breathtaking view of the city. 

The patio was quite busy and it was up to us to find a seat. Let's just say that service is non existent. It took us quite some time to get a servers attention to order. No one looked in our direction. The meatballs were a joke. A handful of meatballs served with ranch sauce and a pinch of hickory sticks. I got the chopped salad and it was an atrocity. It was covered in a blue cheese shaving, overdressed, and the lettuce was wilted. I had about two bites before giving up on it and sliding it over. Another friend got the steak tacos and they were alright. We had our food for about 10 minutes and still didn't have our three bulldogs, yet. I finally got up ask someone about our drinks. Somewhere along the way, our drinks got lost in communication and were sitting at the bar for quite some time. Our server was very nice about it and had her manager take it off our bill. The bulldogs themselves were good. Except they are served with Sol, not Corona, and aren't blended. 

I guess you go to The Porch for the view and vibe. Eat at one of the awesome places around there before going in and expect to be there for a while because service is very slow."}
{"text":"I would have considered giving this place 3.5 stars but since that isn't possible I have to settle on 3. I came here on Saturday night for an event at 7pm. I walked right in the and all the way up several flights questionable looking stairs to be greeted with a lovely, large patio with a great view of the CN Tower.

I was somewhat concerned about coming here given that so many reviews mentioned bad service. As it turns out this didn't impact me at all because we didn't see any servers and just ordered drinks at the bar. I didn't order food however some of my friends said that it took a very long time to come.

Given that I was at an event I stayed here all evening until almost 1am. The place stayed a comfortable amount of full until around 11:30pm or midnight when an influx of drunk, 19yo 905ers started to flood the joint. That definitely changed the vibe significantly and I bounced soon afterwards only to encounter a very long line up on my way out.

Pros
- nice spacious patio with great CN tower view
- quick service at the bar
- plenty of seating/standing space and even some couches
- nice downtown location
- they serve Grapefruit Radler
- large frozen margaritas that are served in a plastic beach pail with a big slice of watermelon (novelty factor)
- they placed decent, current music that was at a good volume - added to the ambience without being too loud
- stylish overhead lights once it got dark
- casual dress is fine during the day and early evening

Cons
- very expensive drink prices. A margarona/solarita (margarita with upturned beer) is $16.50 and it wasn't even a Corona it was a Sol. All of the other cocktails aside from the regular margaritas were also very exxy. Given that they don't use glassware paying megabucks for a fancy cocktail in a plastic cup kind of cheapens the experience.
- no draft beer, only cans (and a generic selection at that). I know they don't use glass but they could still serve draft in plastic cups given that they consider them adequate for cocktails
- inconsistent drink sizes when it came to the beach pail margarita. Some bartenders made them half full and others the whole way. I was drinking these because they seemed better value for money.
- cover charge. At 7pm I got in for free but my friends who came later paid anywhere between $10 and $14, not sure if it went up further later on.
- I didn't use the washrooms but I was told by several others that this was a horrifying experience

Would I come back again?

Yes. I think this place would be great for afterwork drinks, day drinking or earlier in the evening. Also good for out-of-town visitors who would appreciate the nice views. I would not be willing to pay a cover charge to get in given that the drinks are so expensive and the late night drunk people kind of kill the laidback yet sophisticated vibe."}
{"text":"One star for being a great place to take a selfie with the CN tower in the background... other than that... terrible service... no one paid us any mind for a while... then one server told us to move basically because they needed big tables for bigger groups, which I totally understand but not sure why the first server didn't tell us that when she dropped the menu, and there were other couples taking up big tables too... once we moved to another section the Waitress there was MUCH more friendlier... she was cool... anyway the menu was super limited on a Saturday at 2pm... only breakfast was available but we wanted lunch foods... after being attacked by bees we decided to go inside where they say a full menu is available... walk inside and sit... 20 mins go by and no one asks us anything or provides menus or any information so we just leave and go to another restaurant lol didn't know it'd be so tough to get some lunch but oh well... again nice view but I'm sure there are other places to go where people will be more attentive"}
{"text":"My most recent visit to the Porch was actually my second time. The first time (last August) brought me here for a brief visit; however, my second visit allowed me to properly review the Porch.

It's on a rooftop in the middle of downtown. You enter from Adelaide Street and climb a few flights of stairs to get here. If you have mobility concerns, definitely give this place a call as I'm unsure about the availability of an elevator. 

My friend and I went to a rooftop restaurant in New York the week before so we wanted to relive this memory in Toronto. Unlike the place that we went to in New York, the ambiance here was very relaxed. Sitting on a picnic bench, you feel as if you're in your backyard (with a number of strangers sharing this space with you). The views are quite breathtaking. You can get the perfect shot of the CN Tower (what says Toronto more than this landmark?). Additional views are that of random condominiums; it might be strange to say, but looking at these buildings are equally interesting. 

Now on to the food. It's quite mediocre. You can find your average pub grub so don't expect to eat a fancy dinner here. I had the house salad (generous portion) with feta cheese. I noticed that some reviews mentioned that this place was expensive. It's about on par with other restaurants downtown. The service makes up for it though. Staff were very attentive and came around often to ask if we needed anything. The night that I went, it was very humid so I must have asked for a refill on water about a hundred times.

Anyway, I give this place a 4 star (3 for the food and 5 for the overall experience).

Good for: tourists, summer, patio, drinks"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday with a few friends. The view and patio was amazing-- great spot to hang out with friends.
I ordered the Bulldog Margarita and it was super refreshing especially in the 35 degree weather. Lots of options for the margaritas however they were a tad pricey.
For my main meal, I had the cobb salad with grilled chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed it as it was not too heavy. 
Food and drinks were good however I paid $40 for a salad and a drink which is a tad pricey. But then again, you are mainly paying for the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"We went to the Porch after having dinner downstairs. It was so packed and no seating was available so after an hour of standing around we just left. The view is gorgeous and it seems like it would've been a good time if we had gotten a table to relax. I'd come back on a less busier day to enjoy the view"}
{"text":"It coud be 3-4 stars but lets say it this way, why i have to pay a fee to go to a rooftopbar when i wana go drink anyway. and serious guys why serving all in cheap shit plasticcub. 
rooftop is nice but overpriced, the downstairsarea not my style at all, sportbar with too many tvs"}
{"text":"This place was okay, but definitely a one time only visit

The highlights:

- the view: you can get a nice photo with the CN tower and it's a third floor patio which means you overlook everyone walking 

And that's about it

Drinks were overpriced - $9 for a corona? Other beers hovered around the same price point and the pitchers and pails were a small size that hovered around the $12-16 mark. The servers looked unamused with their jobs. I wouldn't say my standards are over the top but we had to wait for the menu, him to come back with the tablet, and more waiting for the food. He was polite and just doing his job but service definitely could have been more attentive. 

All of the apps and mains were priced well over $12 each so coming here, expect to drop at least $25 per person. Cover for last night's visit was $6 

Spend your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Their drinks are crazy overpriced, but the margarita are served in cute little sand buckets. The view on the porch is really nice and a great place to have drinks with some friends and just chat."}
{"text":"The line was crazy ... A block but when got up on the rooftop was not busy plus you have to pay $15.. They should not charge if your party is having dinner."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Wednesday at 4:00pm to kill an hour before a gig. The place was empty so we found our seats and sat down. Server asked what we would like, we asked for 2 pints to which the server replied smiling \"Sure I'll grab you guys a pitcher to save you some cash\" and we said that sounded great. We received our pitcher and two small plastic cups (which was ridiculous but that's not why I hate the place). We finished our drinks and asked for the split bill. Then and only then was the price revealed to us. 30$ for the pitcher! \"For a bloody pitcher\" is how I replied to which she laughed, smiled and said \"Yeah we are a really expensive bar I suppose\". 

I think it was the smug-ness of the server that pissed me off most, aswell as the price of coarse. I'd like to add that no prices for beer were on the menu at all and yes you might say it is my own fault but to me that price would warrant a warning from the server just as to not swindle people. But she didn't care one bit, she just smiled."}
{"text":"The food is terrible.  Its overpriced.  The servers dont give a shit about you; in fact if youre not buying a 20$ drink comprised of a corona upside down in a watered down slushee they will ignore you.  The bathrooms (male and female) have piss everywhere.  Its so loud you cant hear the person beside you.  The ONLY reason to go here is the view, and guess what, you can get a better view from almost any other rooftop joint in the entertainment district.  I cant wait until Mirvish-Gehry builds their condo and blocks their view so this shithole of a bar has no reason to exist and closes down."}
{"text":"Loved the margaritas in a bucket ! Not bad for $10 
I was disappointed with the limited food menu. The only non appetizer on the menu was a burger or 3 chicken sliders. That's all you got to choose from. ANOTHER thing that was of great disappointment was the s'mores. My friend went a month ago and got graham crackers (like how real s'mores are), I go and I get walnuts and other stale chewy nasty I don't know what it was crumbs :( so that ruined the experience."}
{"text":"The view and atmosphere are great. But that's all I'd come here for. The beer selection is really limited and food is dismal. The nachos looked like they were covered with vomit and the chicken wings were steamed? I don't know how else they would've gotten that texture. Ultimately, this place is good for a few after work drinks before you go some place else for food. I would also leave before by 10:30PM before the clubbing types get there."}
{"text":"Overpriced alcohol, over priced food. The view is nice but the bar has nothing else notable to offer"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and vibe was great. But you need to pay a $6 entrance fee & Drinks aren't cheap either. We got a porch colada $15.95, and a lime margarita $14.75. You're pretty much paying for the novelty bucket."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe and setting. Age group is mid 20-30s. Good service only downside is paying cover when you might not even get a seat or if you just want food. But for pre drinks or causal drinks it's perfect. Have come a few time times and will defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who was visiting the city as this is a very popular \"touristy' Toronto spot. The view is great, and the food was decent and the drinks were cute. That being said I was shocked at the pricing. We had already paid to get in, then our 1oz drinks were almost $20 each. All drinks are also served in plastic cups -which is fine but definitely not at that price point. We came in and had 2 drinks and shared an app and our bill was $100 not even including what we paid to get in on a casual week night. You definitely don't get what you pay for here. I added an extra to this rating because we absolutely loved our server Michelle."}
{"text":"\"cool! I love the vibes.\"

What time we arrived/Wait time?
We made reservations on a Tuesday at 2pm. When we arrived, we requested a table with an umbrella because the sun was blazing hot! They didn't have any so we just took one of the tables around the perimeter of the patio. It was pretty busy considering it being a weekday afternoon. 

Atmosphere?
We loved the vibes of the place! Very chill and the music wasn't too loud or obnoxious. You could see the CN tower from wherever you are sitting and it was just so fun to be there. I felt like like I could be in my bathing suit and no one would notice! 

Service/Staff?
The service was very fast. Our server kept looking away when we were talking and did not smile much - granted it was super hot and sunny so we understood it might not be so fun to work under those conditions.

Food/Menu?
We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the shrimp sandwich! The pulled pork was just OK. It was really sweet and the flavours got a little overwhelming the more I ate it. It was good for the first few bites- but I wouldn't get it again. The shrimp sandwich was good though. It was simple and tasted like coconut if you're into that!"}
{"text":"Low quality drinks, super expensive. Witnessed a guy trying to party get kicked out. Stay away."}
{"text":"I think we came at a perfect time.  Sunday afternoon.  It wasn't too busy at all and the weather outside was gorgeous for enjoying the patio.  You do get tanned and melt pretty fast when you're out in the sun up there though.  We had to show ID upon arrival and climbed probably 6 flight of stairs to get to the top.  If you plan on getting wasted here, think about the flight of stairs you will have to endure at the end!!

Plenty of seating for us to choose from and to get a good view of the CN tower (for picture purposes of course lol). They currently don't give drink menus because they're making some changes to the drinks.  So the waitress needs to read off all the drinks for you.The margarita pails are pretty hefty in price, so we decided to get one mango margarita and a red sangria to share between me and 2 girlfriends. 

They came out in a timely manner and they also give you a pitcher of water for your table which is GREAT on a hot summer day!  The mango margarita is SOO good!  If you drink bubbletea, think fresh fruit mango bubbletea!  It's so good!  However, they only fill up the pail one third of the way.  I was expecting at least half the bucket when I'm paying $15 for it.  You probably get the same amount at a restaurant for cheaper.  It's like we're just paying for the bucket, which doesn't even cost much because they're a dollar at dollarama.  The sangria tasted very basic, like they threw some red wine and soda water together.  They also had apples and a lemon wedge in there.  It's like they tried to get the cheapest fruit possible to throw in and call it a sangria.  They could at least but some berries in there.

Anyways, we got our bucket drinks and some pics which is what we came for.  I'd come back if I was around on a Sunday and had a craving for that mango margarita."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are unremarkable, but the view is spectacular. Came here on a Tuesday afternoon with a friend, and it was busy but not crowded. Ordered the maple chipotle chicken poutine, a Porch Punch, a Porch Colada, and a pitcher of red wine Sangria. 

Maple Chipotle Chicken Poutine: Not that good. Tastes like a poutine you can get anywhere, but with chipotle sauce added to it. Very little maple flavour and had a few pieces of chicken. It had an abundance of green onions and sour cream though, so it kind of felt some nacho-poutine hybrid.

Porch Punch: I don't really remember what this tasted like, which goes to show how unremarkable this is. Pretty much just tasted like juice. Not much alcohol in it.

Porch Colado: Basically a pineapple and coconut slushie with a slice of watermelon stuck in it. Not much alcohol either.

Sangria: Standard sangria. Can definitely taste the red wine and fruit. Was fairly sweet, but not overly so. Probably the best drink of the three.

Would I come again? Probably, because the view is fantastic. I'll probably just get a beer next time though."}
{"text":"Came at Saturday at around 7:00pm to celebrate a friends birthday with dinner and drinks. Not really impressed with the place considering other options downtown.

Pros:

-Drinks taste awesome
-Music was decent and place has good layout

Cons:

-Long lineup to get inside
-$14 cover just to go up and eat 
-Horribly slow service, they brought our margarita tower with no glasses and then took 30 minutes to get the glasses
-Expensive 


Overall: Wouldn't go back but I do recommend to visit once. I didn't eat any food so I can't comment on that! Also the margarita tower is a rip off! $175 for just 6 drinks! If you want to show off to other tables go for it but you're better off getting normal drinks."}
{"text":"This is like a pub on a rooftop. Unlike pubs it has a 5 star view.

Everything else well...food is pricey for what is is, and is just okay.
 A burger fries and a wrap will set you back over $30 plus tax plus tip.

This after you kindly waited in line to visit this business and paid maybe a $5 to $15 cover charge. 

No beers on tap. A few basic cans of beer only.
No beer pitchers - if you were hoping to sit on a  nice patio and share a pitcher with friends. 

Good washrooms on patio. 

Will not be back without a good reason."}
{"text":"Paid cover on a Saturday at noon.. Food was subpar and drinks costed an arm and a leg. Not giving 1 star because the view is amazing up here.
Wouldnt recommend, even if its just one time."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday at 3:30pm.  I made sure to come before 4pm because I was told they have a cover fee of $6.  I went to the Porch because I wanted to check this rooftop patio out.  The service was slow, considering that it was not very busy at the time I arrived.  The waitress provided me with the food menu, and apparently there was no drink menu.  I ordered the Porch Bulldog for $18.75.  This consisted of lime margarita and Sol beer in a bucket. This tasted good, however it is overpriced.  The only good thing about this place is the nice view.  I would not come back if I have to pay a cover fee."}
{"text":"Note: you have to pay cover ($14) ????!?!! Not very appealing. However, the view and vibe is very cozy! Good for a date (romantic but casual)."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and great place to hang out but honestly the worst bar service I've ever had. There was a $6 cover, for what ? No waitress serving the tables and no dancing. Every time we went to the bar to get a drink it was literally a 20 min wait. It's unfortunate management doesn't get more servers or bartenders or see how bad the service is because the venue is amazing. Never again !"}
{"text":"Really awesome view of the CN Tower. The place is also known for its bucket drinks which are pretty darn exceptional but pricey....the food is your typical bar food so don't have too high expectations. On a hot summer night, this is the best spot. The patio is huge and can be a really fun time if you go with your friends!"}
{"text":"This place isn't ideal for an intimate date or dinner for two. It really is more of a social gathering, meeting new people type of place. My boyfriend and I were the only asians, everyone else was white, and they played a mixture of jazz and country music, which isn't really our scene. The drinks were amazing however. They serve them in big portions in buckets with watermelon slices which is pretty cool. And the view is awesome too. The CN tower is clearly visible and the string lights above the patio create a cool atmosphere. I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy this place to mingle and get drinks but I'm not really the loud social type so I didn't like it too much."}
{"text":"We went here last Thursday. Waited in line for 1.5 hours at 5:30 pm because the place was at capacity already due their official launch. The wait was not too bad as we made friends with people in the line and the weather was ideal for the outdoors. The place is essentially a terrace with a view of the skyscrapers and the CN tower. It is a good casual after work spot  to hang out in and take advantage of the summer weather. The place is a fair size, with tables and a bar. They have a limited menu for food, but includes standards such as nacho's, fries and burgers. I am not sure how the music is regularly but last Thursday the playlist was hits from the 90's, 2000, and some new songs. I loved the songs that they were playing!"}
{"text":"Came on Sunday May 17 of the Victoria Day long weekend. 

1) there was a lineup - so I thought it'd be good but the wait was annoying and even if you save a seat for your friend, they would still have to wait in line. 
2) there is cover - $5. But this is a bar, no other places have cover.
3) the staff were rude, and look like they hate their life or just snobby.
4) the space on the patio was small and if there is a line then you have zero place to sit.

I left and went to the Ballroom instead."}
{"text":"I understand the mixed reviews here. We were looking for a roof top bar in the area and this was the only place open. I was charged a $6 cover before entering, which would have been fine if the drinks were very cheap, though they certainly would not. In fact, the drinks were extremely expensive! The food wasn't too good either, though generous portions and the prices were just okay. The view was pretty good, though I wasn't happy about walking up all the stairs with no accessible way to go up."}
{"text":"Came here on a monday evening so luckily, it was crowded and there was no cover cost.  We ordered nachos which were mediocre.  The mango margarita was delicious,  but quite overpriced.  Basically,  you come here and pay for the view, I wouldn't recommend their food or drinks."}
{"text":"This place has a gorgeous Patio area. If the weather is good consider yourself lucky because it's a great place to eat outdoors. They allow you the freedom to sit where you like. It's pretty first come first serve basis. 
The food is ok. They have very common foods like burgers n fries, chicken fingers & you can even order something as simple but refreshing as a plate of watermelon! 
Our waitress was super friendly. She was attentive and very up beat. She had no problem giving us to go plates and getting water or anything extra we needed. 
Great place overall to unwind have a bucket margarita and call it lunch or din served."}
{"text":"4 star rating is for day drinking on a Thursday. The place wasn't crowded, there was no line, and it was a great day to be outside. Jesus christ those are a lot of stairs to walk up. Not sure if it was the weather or what but there were a bunch of gnats in certain areas. Sounds like a huge scene at night so I'd stick to day drinking."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this out because a lot of people mentioned about so thought I'd check it out. Omg wayyy over priced for their specialty drinks.. Food was ok. Music could be better. Crowd was ok. Overall, probably won't be going back again.. Whomp whomp whomp"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto with a couple buddies and had the absolute BEST time at The Porch rooftop bar.  Great vibe, friendly staff, food & drinks all excellent. A HUGE thank you goes out to the manager Cam.  Cam treated me and my friends like family, made us feel so welcome, just took such great care of us. If you are looking for a fun, trendy, awesome rooftop bar with delicious food and great drinks, go to the Porch. And be sure to ask for Cam!  I will come back to this place every time I return to Toronto"}
{"text":"Went here for an Elite yelp event. It's a nice spot with patio furniture everywhere. The view is chill enough to visit after work for a few drinks. Like the food truck concept for munchies. Dry rub chicken wings were amazingly flavorful and crispy. The meatballs on a stick with mayo dip were also a big win. Beware the endless flights of stairs you must defeat before you reach the entrance to this Porch."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was very packed. The main feature of this venue is the great view with a nice chill patio. Aside from that the food is pretty average and the drinks are quite overpriced and taste noticably watered down. The crowd is very lively and the venue can get quite packed. While there is lots of seating it appears that they may quickly get filled up. I will try to come back again on a less busy night to try out more of the food."}
{"text":"Very nice patio with a gorgeous view.  Very comfortable ambiance and quite a nice hidden gem in Toronto.  Food was creative and modern.  I especially like the steak dishes.  Service was very friendly and we had a great time.  Do expect to walk up a few flights of stairs to get to the venue though.  That was not a big deal for us but some people may not like that.  Definitely worth the trip though."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. We got there at 7 and there was no line up to get into the place. There was a $14 cover charge which is super steep. It's not really worth $14 for a view of the CN Tower and for pricey drinks. We had to wait another hour to finally get seated. The drinks and the food were about $20 each which is quite expensive.

While the experience was enjoyable, I would only return if I was bringing a tourist to Toronto."}
{"text":"Blatant cash grab. This place was empty on a Friday lunch when we went, and now I know why. I ordered the $9 glass on Sangria, which came in a plastic cup, with some chopped up apple and 3 ice cubes. My friend ordered a shot of scotch. Also came in a plastic cup with no ice. $14 thank you. The food menu is uninspiring and overpriced. We ordered The Porch burger and Kale salad. What came out from the kitchen confirmed to me that there is no chef on premise, just a kitchen hand, and a lazy one at that. My salad was literally some kale on a plate, some chopped green apple, and canned black olives, mixed with a tiny amount of dressing, I couldn't even taste it. I sent it back and we opted to share the burger instead, which was mediocre at best. When it came time to pay, they wouldn't accept debit. Makes absolutely no sense, but did not surprise me in the least. This place is a blatant cash grab over summer, and the owner clearly thinks we'll all be too sidetracked by the view to notice. Enjoy the good times while they last buddy, we won't be seeing you next summer."}
{"text":"The view on a June evening was amazing.................drinks way overpriced though.......i guess you're paying for the setting plus there is a $6.00 cover charge on weekends anyway."}
{"text":"Cameron is Amazing!!! My friends took me to The Porch to get a sneak peak at the CN tower and chill at a Toronto vibe bar. However, it was so much more. Cameron went above and beyond. I truly can't imagine The Porch with out him. Best night out in Toronto ever!!!! Thank you Cam!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely roof top patio. Though expect to climb about 5 flights of stairs. 
Servers are lovely.
Vibe is great
View of the city is great
Nachos are fairly pricy and can probably feed 4 before going soggy.
I would go back but not for the Nachos."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to hang out. Went there for a company outing so not sure of the prices but the staff seemed nice and the food was mostly good (some was not.)

View is really nice on the top floor. Recommend you try that spot first. The lower floors seem nice too but was only there for a bit."}
{"text":"Yes, their drinks are crazy overpriced. Yes, the service is average. 

However, the view is unbeatable, the patio has a nice vibe (especially on a Monday night when it's not as busy and there's free cover) and their margaritas that come in the perfectly instagrammable sand buckets are delicious. 

So while it's not a cheap place for drinks, you're paying for a premium view on a chill patio and I think it's worth it every so often."}
{"text":"If you live in the heart of the city and are looking for a patio with great food, service and atmosphere you will find it here. A \"Muskoka cottage vibe without the drive\" complete with a food truck dining experience.  This place is as real as it gets. It's casual fun and friendly and a great place to entertain friends or a date and the location is within walking distance to all of Toronto's major attractions. It's a great pre or post patio to grab a drink and a snack. If you love a spectacular view, tasty food and cold beverages along with great service, make sure that you check this place out, you will be glad that you did :)"}
{"text":"The Porch! 

The hype about this patio in Toronto is absurd. I understand it as it's a rooftop patio, has amazing views of the CN tower (great for photo op) and has drinks and food! Well well well. Sounds great doesn't it :) but to be honest, that's what the porch is for! A great summer day. 

I came here to take one of my girls out for her bday. And we ordered \"The Porch\" drinks (drinks in a pail) & nachos. The drinks are a little to a lot overpriced for what it is. But we definitely paid for the atmosphere. 

It was tough because it was really sunny but there were only a limited number of seats in the sun. If it's really hot, try and find a shady seat otherwise you'd burn!!!

Overall decent experience. Would take someone here from outside the city but wouldn't necessarily come back for the drinks Cus it's too overpriced."}
{"text":"Great location, awesome patio that is always in the sun and friendly staff. Great place after any sports events or concerts in Toronto."}
{"text":"The drinks were strictly average. Their most popular drink is the bulldog. It was quite underwhelming. The only good part of this spot is the view from the patio. It's a good place for a one time visit."}
{"text":"Great location and spot, very nice to see the city from here. Service was very friendly and attentive. Went after work so wasn't crazy. Did not try the food, and felt he drinks were overpriced for the overall experience, however if you have cash to burn, not completely a write off, more close to 3.24 stars but our friendly cocktail waitress gave it the .76 bump."}
{"text":"It was the perfect weather for a rooftop Sunday brunch, so we went to try out this place for the first time. A perfect view of the CN tower, otherwise the view was pretty underrated during the day with a 6 storey view of the entertainment district.  Noise level was perfect with a good beat in the background but just enough so you didn't have to shout at your company. 

We ordered one of the beers on tap and were shocked at how small it was. For half a pint it was $9.07 not including tax! The food menu was pretty limited as they only serve brunch on the weekends before 3pm. The only non egg item was the parfait so we ordered that and I had a Benny. The parfait was a standard one you would get at any grocery store except for $9. The Benny was uniquely made on sourdough bread and the combo of roasted red peppers and hollandaise sauce was a refreshing change to the usual sauce. One of the eggs was a bit over done with the yolk entirely cooked. Otherwise the flavour was great. 

Lowered star level due to small servings for the price and lack of selection. May return for the night view and vibes."}
{"text":"Do it for the view. They have only 3 beers on tap and one bottle, plus super sweet cocktails, such as small margarita buckets, so not much to draw a person in. But dayum that sweet view. If the weather is nice, climb dem stairs and get on up there for a drink or two. We were just walking by and happened to see it. It broke the walk up nicely and scored us some solid photo ops. Score."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place twice, for the first and last time. The first time was decent.. it took us a little while to find seating for the two of us and we ended up sharing a table with another group. The drinks we ordered - a white wine sangria and the \"selfie sweet tea\" - weren't bad, but served in plastic cups hence overpriced. 

Now the second time: if it weren't for the good company I was with, I would've left and suggested we try someplace else. We wanted to order nachos for the table, but our waitress informed us that the kitchen had \"run out of\" nearly half of the food items on the menu. So we settled for some overly salty pizza rolls with crappy fries. 
All 5 of us ordered a margarita, and they were listed on the menu for $14.75. Already a steep price for a premixed slushy in a dollar store bucket, but anyway..  when the bills arrived, they were $17. When we asked our waitress about this, she said \"Oh, the prices JUST went up today.\" what?! How sketchy is that! Nowhere was this sudden price change listed on the menu, nor did our waitress warn us beforehand. 
And going back to the aforementioned lack of nachos - after an hour and a half of us being there, at least 4 other tables had ordered and received nachos.. 

I get that this place has nice views of the skyline, but based on what you pay for and the quality of service offered in return, I'd give The Porch less than a 1 if I could. Also, the bathrooms are disgusting. And a cover charge on the weekends plus overpriced drinks?! C'mon. There are plenty of other places in the city that'll give you good views with better service and food/drinks."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I just don't think I really get the hype. I won't deny that it's a nice, spacious patio with a good view of the city, but if you were to ask me if it's worth lining up for like an hour to get in, then I would definitely say no. And definitely make sure you eat somewhere else beforehand, because while the food here isn't terrible, it's nothing to get excited about and doesn't really come cheap.

On my first visit with a friend, we luckily didn't have to line up and just went up, but found it hard to find a seat - ended up sharing a table with another group, which was fine. It seems like servers here have a hard time keeping track of their patrons, because no one came around to give us menus, and in general the service the entire evening was extremely lacking. Maybe because it's more of a bar than a restaurant, but I feel that you really have to expend the effort to request service here, since it just doesn't come to you AT ALL otherwise. It really had me questioning whether this place is meant to be self-serve or not... maybe next time I should just order from the bar/food truck myself. Our waitress, while not exactly unfriendly, didn't go out of her way at all to try to provide good service, on those rare occasions when we managed to grab her attention.

My friend ordered the fried mac & cheese (6 pieces for $12) and the watermelon Greek salad ($13). To be fair, the mac & cheese sticks were pretty decent and I actually thought the salad was good and refreshing, but still too expensive for what we were given. I originally ordered tacos, but then was told they were all out (of which ingredients, I will never know) so on a whim I ordered nachos ($18) expecting them to be a one-person portion. Definitely not, share this with at least 3 other people because it's big and now I can't even look at any more tortilla chips without feeling a bit sick. The drink prices are as you would expect i.e. $9.75 for a margarita in a bucket that tastes pretty good but is also very watered down, given the slush and all in it.

In general I would skip the food here but MAYBE come back for drinks if nothing else is happening."}
{"text":"The view was pretty cool, but I'm not sure if the price tag is worth going back again. 
$6 for cover 
$13 for a regular grilled cheese and fries
$14 for a 2oz. drink, which I could've easily gotten for $3 at the bar down the street!
We were in the line for about 20 minutes since there were only 2 groups in front of us. The waitress took 20 minutes to bring us menus, another 30 minutes to take our order, and another 30 minutes to bring out the food. 
There were a few tables that had dirty cups lying around, and the bathroom was boiling hot!
The ambiance is pretty nice so I'd say it's worth checking it out once, but I wouldn't expect too much."}
{"text":"Good service on Sunday afternoon, great drinks, did not try the food here. Love the music, nice, chill kind of vibe. 

Cons: it's a hell of a hike up many flights of stairs to get to rooftop porch! 

The ladies room bathroom is really scuzzy. Scuzzy as in no TP in dispensers and dirt on the walls around sink and drying area. (Kind of scared to touch the faucets.)

Cocktails range from 9-15 depending on what you get."}
{"text":"My experience was very average - fun but not special.

I went with one friend so we found seats pretty easily, although bigger groups could have a difficult time. Although we arrived when there was a pretty long line, the wait was short and we were able to move quickly. The decor was adorable and the rooftop had a fantastic view - perfect for instagram photo ops or chilling after work in the summer. I also expected the place to be jam packed and roaring with noise, but I felt pretty comfortable and had no problem chatting with my friend! 

However, the service wasn't fantastic. The servers had so many people to keep up with and no order in which to split up the space, so we had a different server everytime. I felt very pressured to continue to get drinks (sometimes I just want to take things slow and enjoy myself!!) or food. They gave us the bill when we weren't ready to leave and it felt very very rushed. The drinks and food themselves also weren't great. They were extremely overpriced for such small portions and mediocre quality. 

If you're looking for a new experience, a place to meet with friends after work, or something to do before a game, this is a good idea. I'm not sure if I'll return too soon though."}
{"text":"Really cute place to hang out with friends or go on a casual date. My friend and I got slightly lose while getting here since we didn't realize the bouncer checks all IDs at the stairs where there's other pubs. This place is definitely not accessible, be prepared to walk up about 4-5 flights of stairs (if you had a couple of drinks this might be difficult....) before actually getting to The Porch. There's no AC on the walk up so just be aware. 

When you finally get to the top, the view is worth it. You can choose anywhere to sit and someone will come by and give you a menu. It's a really carefree and fun environment. You get a nice view of the CN Tower and the new condos surrounding it. There's fairy lights strung across for ambience. 

The food is okay, your average pub food and drinks but we all know the view is what people come for. I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich and my friend got the Burger. I've had better fries and they were a tad dry but the pulled pork sandwich was really nice and saucy. 

They serve large margaritas in buckets! Like sand buckets you used to use to make sand castles as a kid! The margaritas are good, not much alcohol taste in that, it was more like a slush. The white sangria was really good. 

We came before the sun set and were able to see the beginnings of the sunset which was great. 

I would definitely come again and bring more friends too!"}
{"text":"Expensive drinks but so worth it for the best patio view.

I had several round of the $14.75 margaritas (comes in mango, raspberry, strawberry, and lime) that definitely had quite a lot of booze content, had a huge slice of watermelon, and came in cute buckets!  

I liked the lime flavour the most on a hot sunny day, super refreshing!"}
{"text":"Too often people come into this area and are looking for something specific. Things that ain't my deal, things like: bottle service, dress codes, tinder in real life, etc. The Porch is a breath of fresh air from that usual Richmond and John bull shit. 

This rooftop haven is open seven days a week, with no cover Sunday-Wednesday. Their drinks are reasonably priced, the staff are kind and unpretentious, you can wear whatever you want and soak up the sun. It is the perfect place to get a selfie with the CN tower and have a few drinks with buddies after work. Admittedly, I haven't had the food yet... but it comes out of a food truck they craned onto a roof, so I'm fairly certain based on adorability alone it'll be fine by me. 

Full disclosure: I am planning an event with these folks, but the above review is based on a completely organic experience at another another event held at The Porch. Normally I'd be worried people were thinking I was blowing smoke up the business's bum by writing this review so close to hosting a party here... but the other reviews just seem so harsh and different from my experience, I had to chime in."}
{"text":"The drinks are definitely overpriced but the view and atmosphere of this place makes it worth it - perfect for a nice summer day! The sangria tastes absolutely disgusting so avoid it at all costs (I mixed mine with beer to make it more bearable). The food is surprisingly good! Easily the best nachos I've ever had! The service is painfully slow, you're better off getting up from your table and walking up to the bar."}
