{"text":"So I went here on a Friday night after work just looking to eat something quick before heading out that night. I got a burger, fries and drink and it came to like $15 lol. Ok so with that price I'm hoping this is going to be a really good meal. Wrong. I got a some kinda bacon cheddar burger and it took 15 minutes to make. Employees didn't really seem to care. Then it turns out the smart cook mixed up my 4oz burger with someone else's 6oz. Then the sandwich lady said she'll just switched the patty's and rubbed a bunch of shit off the burger with paper towel even though I told her not to (YEAH, SWEET).   Overall, it's just another burger joint that thinks they're hot shit but they're not"}
{"text":"Best Customer Service in a restaurant EVER!  One burger in our initial order was going to be delayed, and as the server was telling me this disappointing news she handed me two coupons for two free 4 oz. burgers for our next visit.  Impressive...and given the fact that she seemed very young I was impressed that either she, or someone else on staff, made a split-second \"executive decision\" to comp the next two burgers.  After several minutes the burger came to our table by a different staff person, who presented it with an EXTRA order of fries...also comped!  I am beyond impressed that South Street Burger had empowered their servers to make these kinds of decisions to turn a potentially unpleasant experience into one where I'm now taking the time to write a review on Yelp.  Bravo Management, bravo staff ;)  We will return to this location."}
{"text":"Great staff! My wife has a number of allergies. She asked for guacamole on the side. The manager got it from a container in the fridge to avoid cross contamination. It was very considerate."}
{"text":"Love nyf poutine. Their burgers are not bad either. Good place to come with a group of friends for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I love that they serve NY Fries, and the onion rings are really good. The burger has a nice, smokey flavour. I just wish the meat were bigger in proportion to the bun."}
{"text":"South St Burger replaced A&W which was at Bayview Village for as long as I can remember. There is a long line up at this place - probably because there isn't a food court at Bayview Village.   I ordered a burger and fries to share. The fries were okay; they obviously taste like your regular NYFs. But I really didn't enjoy the burger. The patty was too dry and not juicy enough compared to other burger places I tried. I ordered small burger which is slightly smaller than their regular one but the portion was enough for me.  South Street Burger also sells alcoholic drinks - beer and wine. I didn't order any alcoholic drinks but I thought it was interesting."}
{"text":"I've tried to stay away from burger joints for a while now because I've always been let down in the past.  Last week I thought I would try one again.  And again, I was let down.   Here are a couple fast simple reasons why.   -The server/cashier, is always either overly-exuberant or real bored oozing attitude,  -The burger menus are complicated and I always end up paying more somehow -The burgers are sloppy and quickly slapped together, no love, very salty and stinky -The aftertaste is very strong and takes 24 hours to wear off I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a burger chain i don't hate.  Most are disappointing.  They have a nice topping selection.  Compared to anything at bayview village, this place is \"reasonably\" priced for what you get.  Good burgers and poutine."}
{"text":"Good burger done well with good buns and toppings. Had the salad instead of the fries.  The only issue I have is that even though it was empty they had several dirty tables which is really disappointing."}
{"text":"Have now been a couple of times. Both times the burger was not great but the fries were good.  I'd like to see the basic burger done right before adding all the unusual/gourmet toppings.  Music is cranked way up.  Cashier and I had to scream at each other to be heard."}
{"text":"We tried the vege burger with mango chutney and various sauces it was treat. They something for everyone."}
{"text":"So.. all these guys have done is put some fancy toppings on a frozen burger patty and over charge you for some beer.. not good  Probably never going to this chain again."}
{"text":"Adequate food and the cashier was nice.  I was having a treat by going to the restaurant. I ordered the True North combo (~$12.50) which I had last year at Cross Iron Mills location (and it was awesome there). This time it was... adequate. I brought it back up to the counter because I thought they made a mistake with the burger - it turns out it was the correct burger (note: if a 4oz burger patty can hide the bacon, you might need more bacon). The cheese was a half slice of real cheddar (I think). The grill cook brushed me off when it appeared to be the correct (anemic) burger. Her right to do I guess, but I docked a star for the poor customer service. Apparently my burger was harder to make as others that were in line after me, were seated and eating before I got mine (not sure why). The restaurant was pretty steady,  so I doubt this review will make any difference to them, but I would recommend spending your hard earned money somewhere else. I won't be back, and I will be choosing to spend my family's restaurant dollars at a different business. I have *never* been disappointed at Smashburger (for the same price, better food and service). Even the McDonald's Angus  burger would have been a better use of my money. So to summarize, adequate but there are much better values out there."}
{"text":"Do not order the Veggie Works poutine.  Be cautious about ordering the large sized poutine.   It comes in a palm size bowl with only a few deep fried potato droppings.  You'd be better off ordering a small order of fries and smothering it in all the free condiments to save yourself nearly half the cost.  A large poutine perfected \"Veggie Works\" NYF poutine carries the same amount of fries as a the hand-cut NYF regular fries.  It needs to be labeled on the menu under mexican fries .   They should address the costumer that they have no veggie gravy and instead will throw a quick squirt of processed cheese over your frites and plaster it with a white thick mayonnaisey substance and then top it up with diced tomatoes and green onions.  This was not very New Yorky and was ultimately a disappointment.   I was really enjoying my walk-in-the-rain with my new wife until we made the wrong decision and stopped in to try the new spot.  I would rather prefer the trek to Queen and Dovercourt in soggy trousers for the vegan/gluten-free gravy at Poutini's. My craving has not been satisfied so I will be going there tomorrow to fill my tummy and reclaim my smile."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch at 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  I agree that they have a nice location , inside Bayview Village  with nice ambience   But once we lined up for the food , we realized that there are some foundamental problems   1. Insufficient staff at the counter 2. Slow service (again inexperienced cooking staff) 3. Insufficient staff to clean up the restaurant  4. Bad tasting food  We ordered the two burger combo which ended up to be $26 (2 burgers, onion rings, a soft drink and a green tea soft drink)   Wen I tried to look for a spot to sit down, I realized that the tables are dirty. The customers have to clean up before we can sit down. The metal round trays were all stacked up at the cleaning station but obviously the staff just has no time to come and clean up   We found a spot and I cleaned up the table with serviettes . It was still a bit sticky .  My partner brought the food over after 15 minutes of waiting . The burger was overdone and  tasted dry. The onion ring was a bit better as they used the purple onions.   While we were eating , the \"cleaning\" person started to clean. She is the cashier who came out from behind e counter with her gloves. So I thought \"great they do care\"  She managed to clean up the  metal trays which by now counted to 10.  But she never used the spray bottle of cleanser  on any of the services which include the dirty stacked up garbage area,   She looks like the little rich girl who was forced to help out by her Chinese daddy so was working his butt off behind the counter. She has a perfect spa look and pouty demeanor when she was cleaning.   This is a place for people who want to eat at bayview village but have no time to line up for O and B or other places. The food is edible for fast food crowd and hungry family , but not for people who care about food or clean places.   Suggestion: hire staff, train them about food handling ...please ..before the Toronto food inspection gives you a yellow pass !"}
{"text":"Two words: raw hamburger. Yes that's right, not pink, but raw meat. That's what we discovered when we got our very overpriced hamburgers home - raw. We shall never eat here again, sorry there are far too many other choices for good hamburgers that are not far from this location and they know how to cook the meat properly. (Ex. Five Guys)."}
{"text":"For burger fare, it does the job. A plentora of options and selects and they have a liquor license which makes this place a great and cozy burger joint in the very pretentious bay view mall."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. The bread was a bit stale and the burger patty didn't impress me in the least. For a similar price, Big Smoke Burger or Hero Burger would've been much better.  If you're going to be a specialty burger take-out place, get the burger right. Also the amount of fries received in the combo was quite skimpy."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars  Parking: Plenty of parking as long as you're willing to park farther and walk.  Service: Hit and miss when it gets busy. Sometimes there's a bunch of ladies working during the lunch hours and they're really nice. I'm not made to feel bad asking for extra guac or specific toppings, to create my ideal burger, which I appreciate. The restaurant is usually clean and tidy as well.   Food: I come here maybe once or twice a week during lunch hours. The food has been consistent every time I'm here. The burger is juicy, beefy and flavourful. It's obviously not the best burger I ever had, but pretty good for a chain brand. My personal highlights are selection of toppings, such as mayo (garlic, wasabi, Dijon horseradish), different types of onions, tomato salsa and of course guacamole free of charge.  I like how the fries are New York Fries, fresh cut potatoes and the gravy is the same as well.  Impression: I'm a regular customer for convenience, consistent food quality and service. So yes I'll be back again :)"}
{"text":"The food is same as any other South Street . As for theirs location it's not clean, nor are the bathroom. The servers are really nice and friendly. Apart from a man who should only work in the back. He kept on rushing us and insisted that we should get only sauce first before asking for anything else. My little niece who is 5, was told she can not get catchup as now he has already put on the tomato and pickle. So she was sad and we ended up going back home."}
{"text":"Pretty much your average burger joint. Not amazing but not terrible either. If you're hungry and in the area it will probably do.   The portions are not huge so keep that in mind. Found it a bit overpriced compared to other burger places I have been to since other places are a little note expensive but you get significantly more."}
{"text":"Came here two times. First time I ordered a Mac Burger and the second I order the Chicken Club. Burgers were alright though nothing particularly special for the high price they charge."}
{"text":"Great comfort food with my favourite new york fries.  Choices are abit limited though!"}
{"text":"Dropped by last weekend as we were in the neighborhood. Canadian Burger and fries; fries very good if a small portion, burger okay - way overpriced for what you get. Location was overall quite dirty and unkempt - had to wipe down table and seats ourselves. Biggest issue was staff - there was a young woman who appeared as though she knew all the working staff (perhaps she worked there as well) - and kept up a dialogue with staff as they were taking and preparing orders. This went on the entire time we were there waiting to order, waiting for order and while we had lunch. Other customers were as irritated as we were  - not any way to run a business where customers come second or third to social conversations about weekend plans, what happened last night and whom was hooking up with whom. Disappointing overall."}
{"text":"Sadly this chain has gone through alot of changes due to the explosion in the number of locations.  Nice to see more places but unfortunately the burger has taken a big big hit.  I used to sink my choppers into a noticeably juicy slightly pink burger that tasted fresh and way above average.   Now you get this spaghetti looking patty kinda like the ones you get frozen from the store.  So... loosely packed and it looks like the strands you get from a grinder.  I just had a fairly dry and tasteless (except for the condiments_  still good)  combo burger for the whopping price of  $11.50 before tax... so you are buying a freakin burger and the smallest size fries you can buy plus a fountain drink for 13 bucks.  The fries are still good the drink I had was pretty watery so that is not worth anything to me.  The burger itself is $6.95 for the 6 oz... People... I would rather spend a bit more and buy a steak at Loblaw right next door ... forget the fries and drink.  Now if I were starving I might knuckle under and pay their pound of flesh.   I hate to say it but I have had better burgers from the chain that sells burgers out of gas stations... you know the ones with all the ads on TV.  I found those fresher tasting as long as you forego the seasoning salt ... and you know those fries are pretty decent as well.  I think South Street is much less value for the dollar in my minds especially since it is just a burger. And the new replacement patty is laughable... like grey matter.  Even the good lettuce and tomato cannot save the burger portion.  Mediocre patty."}
{"text":"Horrible service, overpriced fast food. Very very very disappointed.  Will never go back again.  Save yourself a shitty trip and go somewhere else for a burger"}
{"text":"South Street Burger is one of my favourite low/mid-end burger joints in the city with delicious burgers and a relaxed feel.  AMBIENCE/SERVICE: Order fast-food style over-the-counter, wait for your burger to be made with your favourite toppings. Quite a large seating area with a couple flat-screens. Kept pretty clean too. Nothing special to say about the front-counter workers. 2/2.5  FOOD: Had the a 4 oz True North ($6.85) and a 4 oz Mushroom & Swiss ($6.85), both of which I really enjoyed. Buns and beef were ok but the on-point sauces and fresh toppings stole the show. They also offer New York Fries poutine and fries as well as ice cream and milkshakes so they definitely have something for everyone. 2/2.5"}
{"text":"Consistently good quality food.   They have a new burger called \"The Aussie Breakfast\" which has a fried egg and bacon.   Delicious"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. The line ups speak for themselves. So much character compared to Hero and they don't charge an arm and leg for extra toppings (except for cheese). Love the idea of guac on a regular burger. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what I was expecting. I called ahead to speed up a take out experience, that I think was the first mistake. The woman who answered the phone was either on auto pilot or multitasking something fierce. I repeated my basic order at least 5 times and guess what! Wasn't right when I got home although confirmed when I picked up. No surprise there.  Also left hanging at the cash waiting for my receipt as the counter staff were frying and flipping and building burgers like no tomorrow. Although they were also messing up the two orders in front of me. Remember - multitasking is just doing more than one thing badly!  We had enjoyed this as a easy option in the summer. Maybe there is some skill needed to flip a burger.  Oh yeah the food, well the fries are nice. Chicken burger is a good option. My partner orders two burgers and puts them together as they don't sell a two patty option. Buns are nice. Okay in a pinch but I echo they other guy, why?"}
{"text":"I usually pass this place and it's always busy but when we went, there was hardly any one there.   Love the vast selection of toppings...makes up for the price of the food. A tad expensive if you just want a quick bite to eat, but it was quite satisfying (got the regular burger size; small was too small for its price). The onion rings were pretty large in size (I expected a bit more in quantity, though) and were light and not greasy.   Seating area is open, clean and inviting. You can people watch while you eat"}
{"text":"Just had their Nacho Burger... Yummmm... And love the New York Fries.  My husband had the Mushroom Swiss Burger and our son had the True North Burger. All dellicious. Burgers are so juicey and flame broiled. Will definately come back again."}
{"text":"The last time we went here there was a HUGE lineup. To get ahead of the line, an employee was taking orders and handing them to the cashier. Unfortunately some members of the staff barely speak english so the order got mis-translated and the two burgers we ordered became 4 burgers at the till. The cashier took of the 4 burgers, added one but failed to add the second burger.  After only receiving one burger, we went back up to the till. Instead of getting another burger on the fast track so we could eat together, we are prompted to pay for the remaining burger and wait in the huge lineup while the first burger gets cold. BAD SERVICE!!!!!!!  I went to complain to the manager but there was none on that day.  Not going back. Five Guys are pretty close to this location and they make a superior burger."}
{"text":"Wow, I donate this one star to the poor staff that have to provide this horrid excuse for food, I'm heading to emergency now to ensure I don't die..."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst South Street Burger location I've experienced.   Burger was overcooked, not well done, burnt.   Service, they forgot my friend's burger in the order and they made him wait in line all over again instead of putting him in line where he should had been."}
{"text":"South St. Burger does make burgers better. you do have to pay more to get more though.  some of the distinguishing features are:  hormone free beef patty - thicker and juicier than McD/Wendys bun choice of white or whole wheat toppings from gourmet ketchup, mustard, mayonaise, cheeses accompanying fries are NY Fries  Cost is ~$10 for a regular burger meal (burger/fries/soft drink) but the taste is more satisfying than McD/Wendys  something of this higher caliber class is like Hero Burger  The space is well lit, building is a corner unit with variety of seating to suit your fancy, a choice of rounded booths, to conventional tables and bar seating along the windows edge.   I've visited a few times at this Steeles location and I would say it's been consistently good most of the time. I recall one time the bun was burnt and I requested that I get another bun re-toasted. This was done no questioned asked.   Franchise experience should be consistent, the environment, food all has been predetermined, it's usually the staff that can make it or break it for a location."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. The sales person was upset because we were a large group. They should put more emphasis on the experience of eating not just sales"}
{"text":"Bring cleaning supplies if you are going to eat in. Food is good, like any other South St. However the cleanliness is lacking. I wiped the crumbs off the cleanest looking table and its chairs. The table top was still a bit sticky. Next time I'll bring some water and vinegar solution. :-/"}
{"text":"Great burgers.  I love the healthy topings you can chose.  It's set up like Harveys.  I go here quite a bit.  If your looking for a burger, this might be your place."}
{"text":"My neighbourhood burger joint. I go here allot out of convenience. This rating is based on multiple visits. Overall wildly inconsistent from great to very poor.  Generally speaking, the burgers are    Very good.   The onion rings are the best on some visits and dripped in grease, chewy and stale food n some cases. My guess is this is all based how old the oil in the fryer is. Service goes from good to great based on staffing level which always feel one person light.  Last nights visit brought a more problematic issue, the smell of stale beer and bleach. We Need to my be as far away from the bar as possible and it still reeked.  If this issue keeps up I'll need to find a new burger place."}
{"text":"The Burgers are great with fresh toppings! The poutine is awesome - real squeaky cheese and a nice gravy. Shakes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Good food, but service is very slow. While the staff is very friendly and caring, they could use more training in efficiency. Also, one person was making hamburgers while holding an iPad in their other hand. Even if he was holding it with a glove, it's still very unsanitary.  There is no consistency in the way they take orders and make the burgers. Plan ahead because it will take about 30 minutes before you get your food from the time you've ordered on peak times. Also verify your takeout orders before leaving, I was given the wrong order."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Simple burgers with an array of toppings. I did mine spicy and sweet with pineapple and spicy aoli. Veggie fries (sour cream, cheese sauce) are pretty darn good. Attentive service. They have table service or you can have sit down service. TV's to watch the games if you are a sports fan."}
{"text":"food is good .  my burger was under done and they fixed it right away and offered a next burger free.  the poor kid cooking was being given a hard time the entire time we were there. That started long before my burger was cooked it was a bit uncomfortable .  reviewing the food not the staff."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  The management here is a disaster, so don't expect a better experience just because it's located in Bayview Village.   Why I would never come back: 1. One person making the burgers. The poor girl looked so distressed, I wanted to jump behind the counter and help her.  2. The middle-aged Asian man working at cash, continuously processed orders when the line clearly was not moving. Seriously, go help out that poor girl and stop taking orders.  3. Tables were uncleaned, you'd have to wipe the crumbs and ketchup off it yourself.  4. Cold hamburger buns. I do love that they have a choice of whole wheat and gluten free, but if it's served cold, it just ruins the taste of a nice burger.  5. $2.00 extra to make your fries a poutine. They really only put one scoop of cheese curds on your small fries - not worth it.  6. Person making the fries kept messing up the orders. You had one job mister, one job.   The only thing I liked was the condiments offered at South Street Burger. They're one of the few burger chains that don't charge extra for guacamole! Pile that goodness up!  Would I return? Maybe, but to a different location."}
{"text":"Better than McDonald's. Nacho burger the best! Poutine is a must! Gets busy during lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"King East, after walking by and hesitating. I was a skeptical adventurer ordering the double six ounce patty, because by all appearances this could just be another cheesy cash-grabbing pricey 'gourmet' burger chain with a corporate Sportsbar look.  Not to fear. The burger delivered was surprisingly substantial and juicy with a decent bun and good flavourful toppings. It did not seem excessively salted and I didn't notice a lot of filler junk as I did the last time at Burger's Priest.  But I will say there is some fat in these patties, and they seem fresh and two six ounces by itself is a lot of food. The deal was surprisingly good. I have no complaints about the food.  The bar felt like a weird place to sit and not particularly comfortable. The ambiance was just OK and the youthful staff were friendly. Clean new place. There are some really bogus gourmet burger chains in our big cities but the time I ate here was good and a do-again experience.  I would say sure, try SS if you like some simple craft beer options and un-fussy solid burgers. All I had was Perrier for a very fair two bucks, leaving me with ample change to leave a solid tip and on my way happy with a full stomach.  ^ Points definitely added for exceeding expectations of category and price."}
{"text":"This burger joint is located inside of Bayview village. South Street burger is more of a high end burger place that serves New York Fries. This was only my second time at the burger franchise but both times have been good with the service being quick as well.   I ordered the 6oz Nacho burger combo which is 12.99 before tax. The burger combo included a medium drink and a small New York Fries. The fries themselves were good, crispy and lightly salted (you can always rely on New York Fries to be consistent with it's fry quality). The Nacho burger had a six oz patty (you could choose a whole wheat or white bun) topped with guacamole, tomato salsa, lettuce, cheddar cheese and jalapeno sour cream. The burger was moist and tasty, it hit the spot with a Mexican twist to it, the guacamole was a nice touch. Overall I was full and satisfied with the combo.  This is not a bad place for a burger."}
{"text":"Meh, this place is aight, I think if you're going to over-pay, you should check some of the other burger joints instead."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal and the staff was wonderful. Their attention to gluten free needs really was appreciated. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A regular burger joint in my opinion. Nothing too special, very comparable to other new burger joints popping up around Toronto.  Food was good, no complaints but prices were steep. If you're looking for a burger in the area, then go for it. If you want a fancy burger, then move on to one of the other restaurants in the plaza."}
{"text":"Kind of pricey but you get what you pay for--the burgers are some of the best we've had. Unfortunately the sides need work. Onion rings were way overcooked (inedible) and the fries are average."}
{"text":"South St. has delicious burgers, so if you want one do yourself a favour and go to the Cross Iron one. I ordered the Hawaiian burger, asked for sour cream, the lady didn't put any on my burger and was overall very abrupt and rude. She was in a perpetual state of rush and didn't care to enunciate at all, I just gave up trying to pick condiments because she was so rude. As for the burger itself, 2/10 - I didn't ask for ketchup or mustard but she put both on there. Never get fries from this location because they are tasteless and a waste of money - absolutely no flavour, no salt. You're better off picking up a potato from superstore for a few cents and eating it raw like an apple."}
{"text":"Hmm  The burgers are good.   The fries are tasty. They taste freshly cut and made.   The onion rings were gross! So thick and doughy. Probably the worse onion rings I have ever had. Maybe just this batch was off. Not sure. But ew!  I asked for a lettuce WRAPPED burger. Is this not common nowadays? They just put my burger on top of lettuce and threw a small piece on top. Um K. I had to eat my burger with a knife and a fork. Come on it's 2016.   The gluten free bun my daughter had was a nice option. She liked her burger.   Ample seating. It was handy to stop in after shopping in the area. But I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Mhmmm one of the best burgers I've ever had. The beef patty was well seasoned and bun is toasted perfectly. Paired with chipotle sauce and garlic mayo is heaven! Their fries are so good too!   I don't recommend their milkshakes. I got the mocha shake and after 30 minutes, it condensed in nasty layers which looks very unpleasing."}
{"text":"Like the concept. Pretty decent burger and awesome local craft beer list. Unfortunately all the wine is cheap international. Really wish they had some local wine options. Service was just okay."}
{"text":"Better than most burger places in the area. I had the Nacho, and in IMHO, guacamole on a burger is awesome. The service was good and Burger was cooked well. They even have a Gluten free bun, which was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Service: not particularly enthusiastic. Looked tired and I felt like an inconvenience to them. not good  The place: Dusty. Tables either dirty or sticky looking. Eeks.   The burger: The only reason why this is getting a two star as opposed to one. The meat was good, cooked properly and tasted fresh, which was good considering everything else there seemed to suck. A little small and flat though (kind of like two small mcdonald's patties put together.) The condiment options are fun to play with, and I'm sure there's something for everyone here. The bacon crumbled when I poked it (McDonalds has better bacon, seriously guys...) and the cheese was falling all over the place and not not particularly good.   Worth it to go once, maybe, to see for yourself, but nothing exciting."}
{"text":"I came here quickly to grab a bite with my bf and was pleasantly surprised at how warm, cozy and chique the place was! It's got the signature woodsy-communal table with salt and pepper shakers, dim light, and a condiment station to boot.   We just got the regular burger with a pile high of additional toppings: mango chutney, guacamole, blue cheese, Cajun pepper etc...You can tell this is gourmet when you can add chutney to your burger! The meat was pretty sizeable so you will be full after. Combo comes with New York Fries and a drink for around $10 and change so in Toronto, this is average pricing for some meat.  There is red and white wine, beer and cooler which makes it the perfect lunch/dinner. Sometimes, you just want a glass of vino with your burger to step it up a notch and take your McDonald-like experience to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Good burgers although a little pricey and they can be a bit stingy with the toppings unless you watch and say something, or at least the girl who made mine was.  Really good onion rings too."}
{"text":"They do make a good burger and have a good selection of toppings. Taste of the food I would say is good.  Expensive, though. But my biggest beef with the place is that it is dirty. I couldn't find a clean table to sit at, and only one table in the whole place had a customer at it. And don't look up. The lights over the cash register have foot-long cobwebs hanging from them. The light fixture over the toppings has a thick layer of dirty dust on it. How much of that ends up in the food? The ductwork over the soft drinks is covered in dust too. Come on, South St Burger, hire a cleaner!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend since we were at Costco and wanted to have lunch in the area. I am not familiar with South St Burger but do know it's a chain.  The place is clean, spacious and busy since it was prime lunch time. The concept is, you order at the counter, pay and then move along the line where they make your item fresh. Love that. Not a fan of places that have things pre-made and sitting under a heat lamp. Watching something made in front of you is the way I always like to go.  I ordered a basic single cheese burger and fries. Found out the fries are NY fries which is great. Watched my burger being made, got to add all the toppings I wanted. They also have different ketchups and interesting selections.  My burger was really good and so were the fries. My friend ordered a veggie burger and she wasn't a fan. She said it lacked taste and was dry. Which is too bad since she suggested this place.  The cashier was friendly however the staff making the food seemed a bit over whelmed. Not sure if it's because it was busy? They were nice, no complaints.  Will be back when again when I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm a Normal customer there, me and my friends hang out there once or twice a week and over the time we've had horrible customer service, the employees look like they don't want to be there , and it's very overpriced and today we've had one of the worst treatment ever . Me and my friends we're hanging out there as usual and we bought some fries and shared it all because we just wanted a quick snack and I went to buy my little sister a burger to take home and the cashier said that he won't serve to us because this isn't a social gathering and we took condiments for fries and that's all we bought !!  We rushed out and we're never going back  It was a horrible experience"}
{"text":"Best fresh burger joint in the area....way tastier than Golden Star. A little pricy but you get what you pay for. Onion rings are freshly made and good alternative than fries."}
{"text":"Visited this place a year ago when I was in Toronto for a couple days. Was having dinner with the team of a startup that has their offices on the opposite site of the street. Really enjoyed the meal though. After ordering we were lucky to find a table that was offering enough seats for all of us (we were 9). Burger was great, so were the fries. The staff was friendly and fast and I really enjoyed being here.  I would never consider this place as a wrong choice when looking for good food, but it´s not a place where I would go for in particular."}
{"text":"South Street Burger is one of my favourite burger places to eat.  There is always plenty of seating and the service is nice and friendly.  The unlimited amount of toppings you are able to put on your burger also helps and being able to have any topping as a side is a big plus.    For the same amount as an extra value meal at McDonalds, this is much more of a better option.  The burgers and fries (although frozen) are delicious and I have never had an issue with anything being over or undercooked.  Staff is friendly and the place always looks spotless.  I always make sure to come in for the pineapple burger when I get the chance and I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this particular chain before as I was getting treated for lunch I ordered the 4 Oz burger and a small fries which came to around $10. The restaurant was clean and the staff what there was of it ,polite and attentive. The meal was cooked to order so it took a while, no problem. Staff kept disappearing after we were served and by the time we left there was nobody to be seen behind the counter for at least 5 minutes. Just teenagers running the place so what do you expect. As for the burger and fries they weren't the best nor the worst I've ever had. Ive had better for a lot less money elsewhere so I wouldn't recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Good burger but not much variety though. I got the burger with mushrooms. and it was good, but not the best I've had. Their prices are good though - make sure you season them with some cajun spices and enjoy it!  I'd still eat here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice when I'm craving a burger."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. A little pricey, but well worth it. Ingredients are fresh, burgers made when you order - no heat lamps here!"}
{"text":"The burger I got was good.  I wouldn't say it was the best thing I've ever had, but it was good. I got the veggie burger, with the mushroom and Swiss toppings. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the patty was done well.   The fries tasted more of potatoes. Which is not a bad thing, I generally like my fries to be a bit more crispy. The Chocolate smoothie tasted more like milk, didn't have much flavour and definitely don't recommend.  For an okay burger, the price was ridiculously high. My bill altogether was 16$, for burger fries and a drink. My drink was 2.25! I've never seen prices that high for a combo, I was pretty surprised.   The atmosphere of the place was nice and cozy, a couple of high desks to sit and eat. Nice bright decor."}
{"text":"I'm an avid fan of burgers and this was my first time at South St. Burger.   I ordered a 6oz mushroom and swiss cheese burger and it was great! The 6oz patty was moist and tender, and it was big enough to really fill me up. My favourite part was that they had a wide selection of complementary toppings to choose from, INCLUDING GUACAMOLE! If you've read my previous reviews, you'll know that I absolutely love guac and considering certain franchises charge up to $2 more for it, it's such a steal that this place offers it for free. Just beware that this burger gets a little messy - the sauteed mushrooms are quite watery and the burger wrapper will definitely not hold!   I'm not a big fan of hot dogs but I ended up trying a bite of one anyway and it was fairly good - the sausage was juicy and smoky. It was a bit smaller than I imagined lengthwise but it definitely makes up for it in width!"}
{"text":"I haven't been a huge fan of South St. Burgers but I come here on occasion for a quick bite to eat for lunch.  It is quite the journey when it's busy but they take their time to make their burgers. The only complaints I have are, I wished they seasoned their meat and better buns. The meat is quite dry and doesn't have much flavour, but I mainly come for the fries and gravy. The toppings a unique but the bun soaks up all of the condiments adding to the dryness.  I've been to a couple of different areas in the city but this place seems to have fallen in quality. I can tell that the gravy has been watered down a bit and the fries are a bit too crispy. Maybe using a cheaper oil or something, I can't seem to pin point it.  The staff seem a bit frazzled and mechanic, making the environment a bit cold and dull. You can tell they don't like working here and just going through the motions to get your order out.  My last visit there may be the last time in a while that I would consider coming back here."}
{"text":"Close to home, see this place all the time, thought we would check it out. Turns out, we will never come back.  THE BAD Server - a grouch! And stop texting! Put your phone away when on the floor! The food was very pricey and if you ask for just water, they charge you $2 for a bottle so keep your eye on the till calculator! The wait took forever to get a cooked burger even though the place was anything but busy. Food was cold and honestly, Burger King does a better job of burgers. These were sub-par. Even the NY poutine was cold. The curds should be warm and melted from the gravy right? Cold. The place was dirty - honestly, from the tables to the napkin area to the booths to the floors. $1.80 for extra cheese and bacon on a burger seems excessive to me for a place that boasts free toppings.  THE GOOD Parking at the plaza never an issue I like the location I do like the free toppings that they do provide. They are fresh and tasty.  From what I have seen, this place needs to be managed better and the prices lowered."}
{"text":"To me, burger places are all the same. South Street is no exception. This comes from my philosophy that burgers and fries are not \"real food\". Real cuisine would be something like pasta or most Asian dishes that requires seasoning and a cooking procedure more complicated than putting it on the grill and wait. I don't think South Street even marinate their chicken...  I've been to South Street 3 times with a groupon and all I can say is that the quality of the food depends on the person making it. On my first try, the cook severely overcooked the chicken. Of course, I didn't know until I came home. It wasn't burnt. It was just overcooked so it tasted really dry. The second time it wasn't as overcooked. The 3rd time the burger was just about right. Their fries are New York Fries, meaning it's not like McDonald's shoestring. NYF has a bit of skin to it. I like it but it's more of a personal preference than an actual indicator of quality. I had the poutine once and it's not bad. I don't think poutine can ever taste bad. It's a comfort food. Though I think the portion is a little small for their price.  Speaking about price, I think if they chop $1-2 on everything, it'd be more reasonable. Their burgers are nothing special, and I believe I've said this about every burger place I've tried."}
{"text":"I was first  cautious to  try this place, I check out menu prehand and I thought 10 buck for 6oz was a bit steep so there had to be something special.  So I went for the combo for the 6 oz of the true north which topped with maple infused onion, extra bacon and cheddar cheese. Should been maple bacon too but extra bacon is good.  The burger patty itself was lack luster like a store bough patty, it had no juicy and little favour, when i try to take off a piece just to taste the meat, it wasnt easy. It was solid like store bought patty. The toppings are what save the burger, thou options are limited.  The onion rings i had with my combo was disappointing, at first they look like it was chicken batter rings but it was far from it. It was probably the worse batter i have seen and didn't like. The tip that said they were good is a joke. I wont eat them again  It was an average meal, not my favourite but not horrible despite the meat wasnt up to par it was still good for it's toppings."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and I have liked it in the past but this time....not so much! I have just spent nearly 24 hours vomiting and it is all I ate all day yesterday! They have interesting toppings which may not get the turn over that the usual suspects get and I am sure that something was off.   Unfortunately, they just lost me, and I will not be back. This has been a miserable experience and I hope it will be over soon!"}
{"text":"Located inside Bayview village,  It seem to be on par with what I have seen from other location, from signature burger to the style to fact it serve alchol.  The place is pretty clean, quick service and alot of room to sit. only thing is cash order area where cash is a bit small, not alot of people can fit but it good food."}
{"text":"I always want to like this place, but never leave here satisfied  - in an overall sense that is.  Perhaps its the price  ( Just poutine and a soft drink is close to 8 bucks), or it could be the veggie burger - not the best, or it could be the decor - its got a big empty feel inside, either way - I am not a huge fan. I would give it 2 stars but that wouldnt be fair as the quality of the food is ok, and the staff are friendly enough. If you like Poutine - this is the fast food version of Poutine - there are better places out there  and for better value- Try the Big Cheese on 17th.  The burger itself ( veggie ) is made up in front of you with a selection of toppings from their topping bar - and they have a lot to choose from - but the veggie patty itself ia not that good, and the bun is oversized and too much. The staff are efficient - but the restaurant lacks warmth.  Some may like it, but  after having been a couple of times, I wont go back."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are good, but this particular location is probably the worst in the GTA. The staff is downright rude. The atmosphere is not inviting at all and the bathroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"The burgers ARE tasty depending which one u get, but the prices rose significantly from the last time I visited. However, they do have some unique toppings that other joints don't have so that is a plus. The fries are umami though. GODDAMN i would get the fries on their own. Surprisingly good fries. Another item to add to the list of surprises is the hot dogs. The sausage had intense snap and tasted like a hot link from the southern states.   Unfortunately because of the abundant, fairly-priced burger joints around i have to give an avg rating."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places around.  The selection of sauces and cheeses make the difference.  Very nice owner gave the girls complimentary ice cream! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Here are the facts:  Service was a little crazy because there were a couple of mix ups and the gentleman behind the counter was getting irate... It's a service industry my friend...   What I loved: - extra cheese included many choices such as goat cheese, cheddar and Monterey Jack  - extra bacon included 2-3 slices - guacamole was free - lots of great fixings to order from, veggies were also fresh...  - so much free sauce and spices... Try the Cajun one with fries  - onion rings... YUM  What was questionable: - pickles should be nice spear ones. Not the yucky slices - burger bun ration was a little off - change your meat supplier. My friend found a sliver of wood in his burger... Like ew. And um, dangerous. - milkshakes were good but my straw should stand right up. Thicker!!!  Greasy high five!"}
{"text":"We went back for a second time to this place for a burger and a chat.  Generally this South Street is not so busy and they don't play their music too loud.    So the wife orders the True North (cheddar, bacon and onions) and I ordered the Swiss melt.  Both on white buns and 6 oz burgers.   The service was fast for on the grill burgers. The pop, either in the bottle or from the fountain, is very pricey.    Our meal was for dine in.  The first thing I noted. They salt all French fry orders even their poutine.  The guy in front of me had seen how much salt the server had put on the previous order and asked for no salt. He said the gravy made the fries salty enough.  Our fries were also pretty salty.   The second thing is the burgers when wrapped are very greasy when you unwrap them. Granted they are fresh burgers but on their buns it makes it messy.  Plus a burger with all that grease does not look appetizing.    The third thing was our 6 oz burgers.  Both had a spot where the meat was pink and not cooked.  I took both back for a reheat.    The fourth thing was with a set burger they over do it on the condiments.  The wife practically 1/2 an onion on her burger and I had a ton of mushrooms on my Swiss.  The mushrooms were kinda tasteless.  But the wife scrapped off her onions.    Based on all that, we won't be coming back.  Big Boy Burgers is close by and makes a superior burger for a lot less money.    Plus they offer onion rings.  South Street has ads on the wall about their rings but they are not on the menu.  Plus New York Fries are good for those who like the skin on their fries - just hold the salt."}
{"text":"Several people have mentioned this being their favourite burger joint. I'm not really a huge fan - partially because I wasnt satisfied with my burger, and also because it was way too pricey for something I didn't really enjoy. Maybe I expected too much. Or maybe it's because I asked for a whole wheat bun - serves me right for trying to be healthy. NEVER AGAIN. Maybe I'll try it again with a white bun, but for now....PASS."}
{"text":"This place has redeemed itself from a few years back when I wasn't so crazy about this location. Here to say in the past 3 months I've dined in and enjoyed their burgers & poutine. Tonight I had the \"Mac's burger\". I had it in a 6oz patty size- what I didn't realize is I get 2 burger patties & 2 cheese in my bun! Massive is what it was and absolutely juicy mouthwatering yum! Patties cooked perfectly. The cashier couldn't believe I ate it(I'm skinny but can eat- yeah hate me later) the poutine cheese was perfectly melted and a good amount of gravy. We also had large fries which were crisp - hey it's part of New York fries franchise so can't go wrong.  Toppings are my fav here especially the onions - numerous toppings to choose.  You have your choice of white/whole wheat/multigrain bun for your burger. If you're bit into bovine (beef) the there's chicken or veggie patties available. Sausages/hot dogs available too.  Enjoyed all that beef!"}
{"text":"A rather expensive burger joint with mediocre quality. No surprise why it is always so empty in a busy plaza. The patties and fries are usually fresh since they cook it when ordered but most of the toppings look like they have been sitting there for days. Service is decent, same as other fast food places. The atmosphere inside is pretty clean and roomy. There is no drive-through. Overall, there are better burger places out there."}
{"text":"The service at this location has been deteriorating slowly over the past 6 months.  Any reasonable district manager would determine the need for more staff during peak times.  Waited in line to order for over 10 minutes.    Time to prep and cook can easily be seen that they need faster systems and manpower.   Time to smarten up."}
{"text":"A casual, no nonsense experience with the staff. The veggie burger with gluten free bun was sensational. I luv the guac topping too."}
{"text":"This place is good.  Comparable burger places I would say would be five guys. I would actually give South Street the edge as South Street has a pure beef burger whereas Five Guys just as an ever so hint of some kind of filler in the patties. They have NY fries here as sides to the burger and pretty much any topping you are looking for.  The restaurant appears modern and clean.  I had no issue with service or restaurant operations as many people here seem to have had, thought it was fine.  For GF people there is a GF bun avail and the fries are cooked in a separate fryer.  All in all a good experience.  For those looking for a potato bag size of fries they don't have that like 5 Guys does.  I don't know you but you probably shouldn't be eating that many fries unless you are a competitive eater in training."}
{"text":"I had to wait approximately 20 mins for a burger. A TURKEY BURGER. My friends finished their food way before I did and they had to watch me eat. I was also very hungry and I almost fainted while waiting. But the burger was alright 3/10. You might as well just go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Typical taste, healthy fresh beef patties, a bit overpriced but is justified by the quality of beef.   Recommend for a pass by burger. Not necessarily the go-to-burger of choice but better than most unhealthy options."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times--work is across the street and I take classes at GB so how could I have not been here?  I last went here on December 23rd, treating my office mate to lunch as an xmas gift.    The concept is easy enough--pick a basic burger and then have your toppings added, kind of like Subway.  The bring your burger out to you.  There is lots of choice, especially with the toppings.  The taste?  No complaints--certainly far better than your average burger.  The fries are particularly tasty.  Yeah, the quality is high here, no doubt about that.  I find the prices to be right where you'd expect them to be.  The interior is nice, clean and shiny new.  Kind of dark but in a good way.  It is a fine place to have lunch with coworkers.  I haven't had a beer here yet but it seems like a good place to go after work for a few pints with coworkers.  Not sure if this could work as your local if you live in the area.  It doesn't quite have that cozy (or worn in) feeling of nearby Betty's or Gabbys.  There are a million and one places to go for a burger in this city so I can't recommend you rush out here UNLESS you are in the area.  If so then by all means stop in."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly.. very knowledgeable and well-trained for a new location. Food is consistent and drinks are perfect temperature. I honestly have never seen the person from the grill measuring a temperature of meat before for south street. Place is very clean and well-kept. Lots of seating. I would go back.."}
{"text":"Not blown away. I mean, the food is South Street, and this location's food isn't any different than the other South Street locations. However, at lunch, I had to wait more than ten minutes to put my order in because at the peak of the lunch rush, they only had two staff inside. One had to take orders and then make burgers, and the other one had to cook everything. Rather difficult."}
{"text":"$27 for two burger combos, seriously!? Not worth it at all. If you want a great burger just go up the street to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Great burger and NY fries? What else for a hangover....yummmy"}
{"text":"This review is only for this location since I have been to many of them all over Toronto and the service has been excellent and the food good.   I will not go in great details but in summary: the service was poor and rude but the food is good.  Hence my experience was ruined by rude staff!   I will not be back to this location.   Do not use this review to assess other locations since I have been to over a dozen different locations and food and service have consistently been good!   Unfortunate experience here."}
{"text":"I really like a good burger and I have gone far and wide to find it.  South Street makes a good burger, I really like the veggie selection and I am a big fan of everything on it. The patties are thick and juicy like a patty should be. However, the most ingenious idea South Street does is server you New York Fries my favorite type of fries! If there was ever a good example of fast food collaboration this would be it, because you can not only get a good burger but a poutine with your burger what a way to get a heart attack!   #30daysofyelp"}
{"text":"Another build your own burger place, only twist,  they don't carry any of their specialty toppings, I asked for brie (try it b4 you deny it), they don't have it, okay, I ask for the pepper jack cheese, nope not in stock, so I had to stick with good ol' reliable cheddar. While making our burgers, the servers just seemed out of it, like they didn't want to be there. First bite to the last bite was just mediocre, nothing special, the fries were just okay, for the price we paid, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I was recently at the Markham VIP Theatres to see a movie. After the show my hubby & i had limited time to grab a bite to eat before heading home. South St. is located at the back of the theatre complex, on the way out to the parking lot, so we stopped in. There was no line up and only 2 booths were occupied. This wasn't my first visit, i've eaten at South St. before, at this location and a couple of others. After this visit though, it will certainly be my last.  Service was horrible! I get it, nobody wants to work on a statutory holiday, but it doesn't warrant giving customers a poor quality & service. I requested something specific while ordering - that i didn't want included in my order. When my burger was made the toppings i didn't want were added!?! When i said something, the guy preparing my order brushed off the topping and put it back in the bin he took it from! When i said something about it being on the bill, he said \"you're supposed to tell ME, ok?\". Ummm, ok, strike 1 for the poor attitude.  Then he proceeded to speak to his co-worker on cash (not in English) in front of us, chuckling away. Hey i'm all for speaking different languages (I speak 4), but it is very unprofessional & inappropriate business practise. And don't give me attitude when you screw up MY orders! Strike 2!  Next the food:  I was very disappointed over the burgers. No seasoning, no taste. Buried under a huge bun & lettuce that was on my burger. They forgot the bacon, put too much mayo. Fries were soggy, indicating they weren't cooked enough. My hubby had the same issues with his, but his burger was dry & no seasoning. 2 burgers, fries & 3 drinks set us back $37 & change. Totally not worth it for the poor service & quality. I would much rather see a Burger's Priest or Hero Burger in that location.   No more, not going back. Photos coming soon..."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, once to grab a 6oz. burger (nachos) and the other time I had a chicken club. I would give 4/5 for the burger! The patty was thick and juicy (a bit underseasoned to my taste). But only 3/5 for the chicken club because the chicken breast was thin.  I love how you can add all the basic condiments and toppings (including salsa and guac!) as much as you want for free! And you can get New York fires here as well. The service at this location is very friendly and helpful.   Overall, I would recommend this place for a burger but probably not for a chicken club."}
{"text":"I have a rotating list of good burger joints, and South Street is always at the top.  Five Guys and Burgers Priest fight for second, but there is something about dressing a burger with non-standard toppings and condiments.  For example, you can have the normal green relish, or South Street's own \"Gourmet Relish\".  Go gourmet!  Wasabi Mayo?  Yup.  Maple Infused Onions?  Got 'em.  Several different quality cheeses?  I'm in.  Of course if you are going to make a combo, it doesn't hurt that New York Fries is what they serve.  Addictive!"}
{"text":"I do believe, the secret to having an exceptional burger at South St. Burger Co., lies in the toppings you select.  This location just recently opened in Pickering and since the received a coupon for a free small poutine, we figured we'd give them a shot.  We ordered two cheeseburgers and a drink and our bill came to just over $16.00. They're a little on the pricey side but, speaking strictly from my burger experience, worth the money.  The selection of toppings can be a little overwhelming and although the girl at the cash was really friendly, the girl preparing my burger had zero personality and little patience for my indecisiveness, leaving me feeling like I was ordering soup in an all too familiar episode of Seinfeld. I promised I would come more prepared next time.  The toppings I selected for my burger were: Dijon Horseradish, Chipotle BBQ Sauce, Red Onions, Pickles and Goat Cheese.  I do have to say, the texture of the goat cheese was incredibly smooth and creamy and the combination of the dijon horseradish and the chipotle bbq sauce was absolutely heavenly!  I was thoroughly enjoying my burger however, my husband was having a 'meh, I've had better' moment and, upon tasting his burger with his selection of toppings, I would have to agree with him. I didn't really find anything outstanding about the beef patty itself... or the bread. It's all about the selection of toppings and the difference between his burger and mine was like night and day.  We selected the veggie poutine which consisted of New York Fries smothered in cheese sauce and sour cream and then topped with diced tomatoes and green onions. This too was heavenly and the cheese was a nice change from the typical gravy.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back again for more of that dijon horseradish!!! Delish!"}
{"text":"This South St. Burger is across the street from McDonalds, so I used to go here once and a while because the New York fries and burgers are typically better quality than the other fast food options. I live in the neighbourhood, so if I wasn't in the mood to cook, I'd come here to get relatively quick food to go.   I stopped going, however, because I'm really turned off when I see unsafe food handling procedures. A few weeks ago, I ordered a poutine here, and while the employee was cooking the fries with disposable gloves, he reached into his pocket (or apron?) and pulled out a smartphone and very quickly scrolled through before putting the phone back. He then came over to the condiment section, still wearing the gloves, and proceeded to put on cheese curds while arranging the fries and curds with the same gloved hand that had touched his smartphone. He did this again when trying to put the to-go lid on the fries. Smartphones are notoriously filthy, so it makes me a little nauseous to think of going back. I know there may be incidences like these at many other restaurants, but I've got a weak stomach for witnessing it.  EDIT: I gave this place another change here in August 2017 and STILL they do not change gloves when they move from touching cash register, to food, to an IPad they keep on the table. What the... Come on, this is the most basic of safe food handling procedures, and when I asked the young woman at the counter to change her gloves after using the cash register, it did not \"click\" that it was a problem. She then changed them due to my request but started using an IPad with those same gloves back and forth between touching food *face palm*. Definitely the last time I go here, especially hearing how others became sick from the same issues.  EDIT AGAIN: It's March 2018 and WHY WHY WHY have I not learned my lesson. No matter the staff members, they just keep using those same food handling gloves to clean the area, move boxes around, touch every single thing around the kitchen, and then go back to touching my food with those same gloves. How is this hard: put on a pair of new gloves when handling food, take of said gloves when rearranging boxes in the kitchen, and then put on again."}
{"text":"I got one of their signature burgers (true north) and it was SO over cooked. I heard that ground meat needs to be well done, but is there something after well done, Like 'saw dust' done. If there is this buger was that.  Dry and one needed to drink a liquid with every bite.  The lack of caring for the end product was obvious"}
{"text":"This place is great if you 're in the mood for a burger and concerned about over processed beef because their beef is not. Mushroom Swiss burger was tastey."}
{"text":"Definitely not as good as the ones in downtown or the one on Woodbine ave. I tried here multiple times and my bun is always cold, service wasn't as good, and pattie just wasn't as tasty.  I suggest going to the Woodbine ave location."}
{"text":"This is another attempt at a classier burger joint in my neck of the woods.  My first impression was it's a fancier attempt at Harveys.  The ability to choose spicy ketchup, cajun onions, goat cheese or mango chutney on your burger does come at a cost.  I'd say it costs about $3-5 more for a full combo than Harveys for that extra class in your toppings.   Is it worth it?  Well... I'm not sure.   Honestly,  I was excited for the toppings but I think I made a poor combination because I didn't like my veggie burger very much.  I'm all for making food the way you want it but sometimes there is a lot to be said for offering toppings that works together on a suggested menu.   I actually left with a horrid taste in my mouth and had to stop on the way home for something to cleanse my palate.  The buns were nice and the produce were fresh which were good.  I didn't get a good sense on if I like the veggie patty specifically (I can be picky) because I was too focused on the weird flavor mingling.   As a vegetarian,  I don't have a lot of opportunity to order poutine so I liked that they have a veggie max poutine (cheese sauce, sour cream, green onions and tomatoes).  I wasn't a big fan - I would have preferred cheese sauce on fries but if I was making substitutions I'd sub in other fries and a cheesier sauce.  I'd pass on these in another trip.   My fiance says the traditional poutine was too sweet and likely won't get that again either as he likes it very savory.   All and all,  I didn't have the best meal here but I'm willing to give it another go.  This time round I'll be more conservative with my topping combination and skip the poutine.  Next time I think I'll go for a milk shake because those looked good!"}
{"text":"My friends and i wanted to go to the Stockyards for dinner.  However, we did not realize they were closed on Mondays.  We were all starving and decided to go to South Street Burger Co.  Now I will fully admit I'm prejudice against NY Fries.  I'm from Montreal, and found their menu overpriced.  However, I was willing to give their burger offerings a try.  I'm REALLY glad I did.  The menu offers vegetarian and meat options.  The young looking staff was very busy, so I wasn't able to grill them about vegan options.  My apologies for the bad pun.  They do offer gluten free buns.    If you're into meat, please note that the burgers are as natural as you're going to get at a chain restaurant; they are succulent, meaty and flavourful.  I have not had a chance to try to the veggie burger; when I do, I will report back.  I will fully admit I find their fries and combos overpriced.  A 5$ burger becomes 10$ with fries and a drink and taxes; to me that boggles my mind, so I stuck with a burger and shared my date's fries and drink.  However, that was my only \"complaint\", and it's hardly a criticism; I really like the whole \"Subway\" style of burger ordering, where you can basically put whatever you want on your burger.  They have some really neat options like candied pineapple, maple infused onions, wasabi mayonnaise, goat cheese, guacamole, and jalapeno sour cream.    Due to the sensitive nature of Canadian palates, a lot of the bold condiments, like the wasabi mayo, were prepared in a way that made them less spicy.  My date made the same comment about the jalapeno sour cream.  My date also noticed that they had two mild varieties of Tabasco, but no original, which is more of an observation than a complaint.    None the less, the burgers and fries were amazing.  My socks were knocked off.  I'm not sure when the last time was that I ate a beef burger, but I will certainly remember that one.  I plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Pretty empty place for such a busy plaza. Burgers were ok, good quality meat but veggies and bread didn't taste very fresh. Service was alright but a little slow. The lady making our burgers seemed to be having troubles assembling them.  Prices are above average , about $20 for burger and fries."}
{"text":"A good place to eat! The staff is friendly, the sides are fresh and the veggie burgers are delish. There's a wide variety of condiments, from spicy barbecue sauce to guacamole and Cajun onions.  Per the review that mentioned \"overcooked\", I eat there a lot and I've never had that issue.  They serve New York fries (tasty!) but even better are the onion rings. Mmmmmm... Crispy and hot. My only complaint is that the salads are truly \"meh\", being just some lettuce with a few onion bits and four tomato chunks. But I tolerate that for the veggie burgers and onion rings."}
{"text":"Had the 6 oz burger here. It tasted alright. In fact, they are a bit slow at preparing my burger and then bring it out to me at the table. By then the burger got cold and lost its appeal. So they dont get points for prompt service and that's why they are not a drive through burger service. Eat here if you have time. Prices are a bit expensive too."}
{"text":"Stopped by the mall to get some errands done, and decided to get something to eat. It was 4 in the afternoon, and South St. Burger was surprisingly pretty busy on a Monday. I decided to go with a regular sized Poutine as I wasn't really feeling any burgers. At $5.95 it was quite pricey for the size, however the service was fast. The fries were somewhat crispy but the cheese curds did not melt as the gravy was pretty much lukewarm."}
{"text":"It was my 1st tym  to visit at south st burger at 130 ave. This restaurant made my day... accomplish my burger craving!.. it so  delicious!.."}
{"text":"This place has always looked great from the outside -- with the inviting atmosphere, HD televisions broadcasting sports, and light-up SUDS signage by the bar.  I finally popped in to grab some burgers with a friend, who is picky about her food and a part-time burger connoisseur. She was impressed with the Mushroom & Swiss burger, and so was I. We both agreed they were delicious and filling -- she had the 4oz and I rocked the 6oz. I've since been back and stuck with the Mush & Swiss but plan on trying the other signature burgers. The Nacho looks crazy!  They have really great local beers on tap for dirt cheap -- including Conductor Ale, which is one of my favourites. Pints are only 5 bucks!  And they have a few HD screens, and lots of comfortable seating, so this place is a good bet for burgers, beer, and sporting events. Could be my go-to come playoff time!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm burgers before a IMAX movie! Burger was prepared with care! Not messy and no drippings. The staff are friendly! The person who dressed the burger explained the recommended toppings and wasn't rushed. I think I'll be back for another burger before a movie. BTW - 10 cloverfield lane was a good movie. :)"}
{"text":"The only burger joint at Bayview Village. I think it replaced A&W from the old days. I had a BOGO free coupons from the mail and decided to drop by. The place cooked everything very well. Great staff - they explain all the confusing burger choices and toppings for you. I only have one problem with these gourmet burgers is the messy dripping of a freshly made burger. But this place was not as messy compared to Hero Burger. If corporate is listening, please send me some more coupons!!"}
{"text":"If you have more money than sense, more dollars than taste-buds, and a knack for well-done beef, South St. Burger is the place for you. I've been to other South St. Burgers in the past and this place is no different - the burgers are as dry as the Sahara, to the point that it can pass off as cardboard for your cousin Kenny's 3rd grade art project. That being said, the fries are solid though (only because its New York Fries)  Food 2/5 - The one thing that is great about South St.Burger is that they have a bunch of different and unique types of burgers that you would not find elsewhere such as The Nacho, The Hawaiian, The True North, etc. On paper they all look like great choices, ironically, in reality they taste like paper. As mentioned before their burgers are super dry, so dry you could probably throw a couple of them into Lake Ontario to stabilize the water levels there. I ordered a 4oz Nacho Burger and the people there cooked it FOR 15 MINUTES. To make it worse, while I was waiting for the burger, I saw one of the cooks use her spatula to press down hard on the patty to squeeze any of the little moisture and juice left in the burger, then flip it over only to do it again on the same side. I think this location in particular should be avoided as well, because although I didn't order fries, I saw two baskets of cooked fries just sitting over the deep fryer, and they remained untouched the whole time (~20 min) I was there.  Service 2/5 - Service and interaction with staff was decent, they were not good but certainly not bad either. What makes this a 2/5 is how long I had to wait for my burger. After I ordered it took them over 20 minutes to get the burger actually in my hands.   Price 1.5/5 - If I remember correctly, a 4oz burger is $5.25 and a 6oz is $6.75 and to make it a combo is another $4.50 I think. Then if you want to make it a specialty burger that's more money as well. I think if you're addicted to the taste of cardboard you could save money and go to Staples instead, where you can get 2400 sq in. of cardboard for roughly the same price.In the end you are paying money for bad food, period."}
{"text":"It's a good and tasty burger place.. I tried both the meat and the veggie one. It could be a bit more friendly"}
{"text":"Good burgers and poutine.   But I was a bit annoyed that our burgers (two burgers, two poutines and two pops) cost as much as the 4 burger, 4 pop and 2 side \"family combo\"   The staff were just ok."}
{"text":"Rating is 3.5 stars  Being fair, the burger at South Street is not half bad.  By that I benchmark it against some good old-fashioned burger joints.  Of course it is a tall order to compete against big patty, warm bun and fresh toppings.  But bench-marking South Street against anything less would be insufficient, as South Street does bill itself as a traditional burger joint.  With antibiotic and hormone free beef and crap loads of toppings that is.  I could taste the quality of the beef.  I could taste how the beef is not over-cooked.  I could taste the freshness of the toppings.  Let's not praise the bun as it is a smallish regular Weston bun.    I love having the option to order an antibiotic and hormone free beef burger.  I don't mind the price, cause antibiotic and hormone free beef patties are more expensive.  I can see the price difference at my regular butcher shops.  And fresh toppings mean letting go leftovers daily.  So why not 4 or 5 stars for this location?  The line up.  The uncomfortably tight waiting hallway at this location.  The slow services hence circles back to lining up for a l-o-n-g time in a tight hallway.  Minus 0.5 star for that."}
{"text":"Love their burgers....so-so on their fries (even though they're New York Fries)  Although I have fallen in love with 5 Guys Burgers and Fries, South Street will always be my first love and therefore hold a special place.  Their burgers are moist, toppings abundant (you get to pick them), combos save approx. $1 off purchasing regularly, bun fresh. Fries, while the afore mentioned NYF, are good...not great. 5 guys have them beat hands down.  Despite my new affair with 5 Guys, I still visit this location as their burgers are comparable...it's just a hell of a drive to get here from northern Woodbridge."}
{"text":"This business seems to compete with Hero in the \"premium\" burger category.  On the whole, it is just okay, at least this location.  Burger was quite good and I liked the choice of toppings.  I also liked the availability of whole wheat buns.  However, I found the fries to be very soggy.  And for over ten dollars (with tax) for a simple burger, fries and drink combo, I think they could do a little more than McD's does:  Blot the fries to get rid of extra grease, and maybe offer some additional ground meat choices (priced accordingly) like turkey and bison burgers.  Service was blase at best."}
{"text":"I love the concept. It reminds me of subway restaurants but with burgers instead. Basically, you pick a protein and various toppings. I had the veggie burger, which is excellent. I ordered it as a combo and I must say the French fries are excellent. The veggie burger had a great flavour but was a tad dry."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the meal I had here with my 1 year old son.  The staff were patient and very friendly.  The food was clean, burger dressings crisp, and most of all very tasty.  We finished every little bit.  One cool thing to note is they have some nice bottled drinks as options other than the usual soft drinks.  The burger is also a cut above your usual fast food.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats.  This is the saddest \"lettuce bun\" I've ever seen in my life. Why even have that option on the menu?   Also note that they cannot customize your salad, because they totally ignored my request.   Overall disappointed with this order."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a yummy meaty burger and we saw this place and thought a place with burger in its name might be a place to try. Well the place looked good lots of toppings but when I saw them put what looked like frozen patties on the grill was very disappointed.  Patties where grey not the nice pink of fresh meat. Taste was nothing special when we ate them , biting into them looked and had the same texture as any fast food burger joint. Oh well now to find a place that makes fresh made burgers."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a 2-for-1 burger & poutine here, so the bf and I decided to drive over and check it out. I've eaten here a few times at the Cross Iron location, so I was excited that they opened one in Beacon Hill (closer to home). I love that New York Fries are served here, and how you can customize your sandwich to your liking! So many options, it was hard to decide. We settled on two bacon & cheese burgers with poutines. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. It's definitely not the BEST burger I've had, by any means...but it satisfied us for the evening. My only gripe is the price - even with our 2-for-1 coupons, our total still came out to almost $20. A bit steep in my opinion for fast food. Next time I think i'll try the chicken!"}
{"text":"I only started recalling that this place is part of the NYF chain after lining up, getting the order and then settling down to eat.  I ordered the grilled chicken burger and surprisingly, the burger tasted better than the fries although it wasn't anything spectacular.  For some reason the fries were dry, the cheese was not fully melted and I think this is because the gravy was lumpy, thick and cold.  I was a little embarrassed because I was there with my American friend and I'm always proud to show the awesome uniquely Canadian dishes, but this was a disappointment.  With a Chipotle a few doors down, I don't think I will be coming back here and I probably won't eat South Street Burger again unless it was the only option available and I was starving.  I am however fine with NYF, so I'm not sure what happened, maybe they should stick with what they're good at."}
{"text":"I live quite close to this burger bar so it's my go to place when I'm craving a burger. First things first I like the concept of this burger bar. It's not like your typical greasy fast food restaurant. You can grab a drink, relax and enjoy your burger like you were at the bar. They have a few televisions so they play whatever is good on TV. My rating is based on a few things:  Food and Drinks: can't go wrong with New York fries. I also find their burgers delicious compared to most. I've had a lot of burgers all over the city and I would say that south street beats most when I want a quick burger. The meat is flavorful and I don't add a lot of toppings so I know it's delicious. For some reason their burgers don't taste overly greasy to me which is awesome. I don't like being in a food coma. They have a small selection of beers and wine. Nothing special. Not a huge selection.   Service: the only service I get is at the cash and when they bring you the burger. So it's as standard as can be. Nothing to complain about.   Atmosphere: relaxing and good. Low key. Nice quick place to eat and grab a drink.   I'd recommend it if you're in the area and want a quick place to eat and not worry about how long it'll take as it is fast food!"}
{"text":"Nothing against the service or the decor. For a place that charges $8-$10 for a burger, they weren't even on par with Mcdonalds and burger king. While the pics and the menu looked delicious, I was disappointed with the lack of flavour in the beef patty itself. Had the swiss mushroom melt and the hawaiian. I live across the street and by the time i got home, my burgers were cold. The premium mushrooms arent even cooked on the spot - theyre in a jar on the counter, and they were cold too. If u want premium burgers then Hero or 5 guys are the places to go. South st was over priced and below mcdonalds quality. The fries were $5.50 for a large, and my cup was only 3/4 full. They also got cold pretty fast, and they were sub par. Not sure they even deserve the one star here."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They changed employees and they cannot do anything right. They gave me a burger without my cheese  Paid an extra $1.25 for nothing. NEVER coming back here again"}
{"text":"A Toronto area chain restaurant similar to 5 Guys.  Order a large size burger with a drink (no fries).  Have many, many topping options.  The burger tasted great.  An overall positive experience."}
{"text":"Cold too cold. GIVE ME A HOT PACK COLD. Just cold like sips cold like idek. Cold like cold like so cold like give me a jacket cold"}
{"text":"$11.42 for a Signature TrueNorth Burger with 2 x 4oz patties. Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, and Maple Infused Onions.  $11.50 is quite pricy for a 8oz burger.. I can't say I was impressed by the burger itself.   The patty was cooked to par, wasn't dry, pretty juicy (runny type of juicy), pretty much comparable to Supermarket butcher's cut patties.. also reminds me of a hero burger.. I would rather go to hero instead just because it's cheaper.  All in all, I would much prefer to go to Five Guys just down the block.. so much more flavour an value  If it wasn't for the price, the burger deserves a passing grade of 3 stars.. but for $11.50.. I would most definitely take my money else..   Favourite Burger Joint is Fresh Burger at 16 and Leslie!"}
{"text":"We went there last evening. The waitress seated us, and left us with the menu for far too long. When she finally came to us, we placed our order and got our food which was nothing to write home about - and I'm only a few blocks away. I could have made better frozen burgers. After eating I asked for the bill. Waitress disappeared again for far too long. Other people that came in seemed to be waiting for her too. When she finally showed up she asked if everything was alright. I said I asked for the bill a long while ago. Her apology was unconvincing. She claimed she didn't hear. That's because she was not paying attention. She was in too much of a hurry and it wasn't even busy. I was pretty annoyed at that. After paying, a different staff person came along to ask how things were. I said they were only OK, with a shrug of my shoulders. He asked if that meant it was unsatisfactory. I replied that we should just leave it at that. He then said he's a manager and asked for my feedback. I said he doesn't want my feedback and if he can't tell from my behavior that I'm not happy, that's not good either. I said good night abruptly and left.  The waitress did not do enough to ensure things were well throughout our visit, so by the time we were done it was far too late. It's a burger joint, not rocket science. Should be a no-brainer to get it right."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The wait is really short. I once went there when they just opened, and I thought it was going to take long, since they probably still had to set up. But they made my poutine in about 5 minutes. The food here are amazing and the prices here are reasonable. Not to mention, the employees are kind and sweet.   Their poutines are really yummy, with just the right amount of cheese and gravy.   Perfect place to go to before you go watch a movie, since movie food/snacks are pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I went inside to ask them if I could take advantage of one of their coupon promos without having the coupon on me, they said no, understandable, however, as soon as the general manager gave this answer, he immediately walked away to the back of the kitchen, and the two other employees just ignored me as I stayed put in front of the cashier area. Of course I left and went to the Wendy's next door. What a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Portions are small and the service is terrible. They are more interested in talking to each other. I asked what kind of sauces , he tap the board above. Terrible attitude."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burgers... and fries! this location is always super busy ... so may be good to take it to go! They have all the calorie info on the wall which is helpful... or scary haha. So many toppings to choose from and refillable drinks!!! I noticed the workers cleaning up the areas and refilling the ketchup during my stay which makes me Happy cause I know they're keeping it up to standards!!"}
{"text":"I won some sort of gift card to here from attending a show so after several months of sitting in my wallet, I decided to try the place and see what all the hoopla was about.  The gift card was $10 and I ordered a regular burger combo with no special toppings thinking the gift card would be enough...but I had to subsidize it with cash as well. No biggie, but I felt like the prices were far too high for basically a step-up from food court food.  I thought the burger was average, but the bun was nice and crusty, just how I like em. I won't be back as there are way better burger joints at the same price point."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. I went with my boyfriend Thursday night. Beautiful seating arrangement with 90s rock music playing with the right volume. The restaurant was immaculately clean, which is a rarity in snowy January. The guy at the cash register welcomed us ever so cordially and explained the menu to us in detail and with expertise as we told this was going to be our first experience at South Street Burgers. With his suggestion we got a True North Six ounce and a mushroom ans swiss 10 ounce (with extra 4 ounce patty) combos. It took around 10 minutes for the burgers and fries to get ready. The guy at the cash cleaned the table for us and brought the food to our table. We were pleasantly surprised by the hospitality offered to us from a self-service restaurant. I have to say the service was excellent.   The slight uneasiness I had about the price (around 17 bucks for a combo) quickly went away as we started devouring our burgers. My o my- they were probably the best burgers we ever had. They were perfectly cooked with a tinge of pinkness inside. The mushrooms in my burger were supple and of top-notch quality. I feel like can still taste them in my mind. And the fries were as good as fries can get- crispy but not overcooked or of the heavy brown color you often find from fries cooked in repetitively used oil. The burgers were so tasty that we didn't realize how filling they are until we finished them and I had to walk to go to the washroom. And the by the way the washroom was very clean, modest but classy. We were so full that we decided to wait out half an hour after finishing food while talking and listening to classics by Led Zepplin, Queen, and CCR on the radio.   Overall, a fantastic first day experience with South Street Burger, but certainly it is going to be our first of many to come. In the entire hour we spent there, the only negative thing that I can recall is that they don't have Onion Ring, which is a pity as the rings are my first choice of a side with my burgers. I told the guy at the cash that they should do the rings! Anyway, a beautiful evening with mesmerising food and service! I had to give 5 in 5."}
{"text":"Today I went with a friend for a burger at South St, Burger. The following is the conversation we had once we were sitting and waiting and eventually devouring our burgers.  Him: What you drinking?  Me: Coke. They used to have Pepsi here and man am I glad they've switched over. You?  Him: You've been here before?  Me: Yeah. Tons of times. I actually used to go all the time back when I was in college. It's just up the road from here. What you get on your burger?  Him: I got the 6 oz patty with cajun onions, cheddar, guacamole, hot pepper relish and olives,  on a whole wheat bun. And you?  Me: I got a double 4 oz burger, on a white bun with ketchup, mustard, onions, pickles, tomatoes and lettuce. Oh, and fries. They have New York Fries here. I love New York Fries.  Him: Me too.  A bit later...  Me: How's the burger?  Him. Good and yours?  Me. Pretty good.  Him: That's all you can say? I thought you reviewed burgers.  Me: Ok, you want me to review it now?  Fine. You want me to put down my burger, since I'm only have way through it, let my fries get cold and explain in detail what I actually think. Is that what you want?  Him: Uh Huh.  Me: Okay then... I think it's a pretty decent burger. I noticed that the patties come from a sealed bag but they don't taste like frozen patties so I guess they are fresh, never frozen, and then grilled, I was wondering if they have them made especially for themselves or if they use a generic patty? Anyways, it kind of tastes, the patty that is, like Craft Burger, sorry, like Big Smoke burger. It's very similar but it's got a little bit of a tougher texture. It is juicy though, just look at all that juice that dripped onto my tray, although, as I ate it it  starting to get a little drier. But the toppings are fresh fresh fresh. I love it when they dice the onions and look, they diced them. I would prefer iceberg to this lettuce. What do you think this is? Romaine? Wait, let me continue before you say anything... The bun is pretty much perfect. It's tasty, it's springy, it's just the right size for these patties and all together, with everything combined, it just barely fits in my mouth. Yeah this is a good burger. They're toppings that they offer are quite unique which is a plus but I do have to say that taste wise, even though I really like it, it's just not that original. It does kind of taste like a few other burgers I have had before and considering those places existed first they ain't going to win any points for originality. I come back here often enough but that's more due to location than anything. I would return, the prices are good the flavour and quality is apparent. Beef wise it is slightly above average and topping wise they have one of the strongest offerings. Plus they now have Coke and they New York Fries. I can't say this meal didn't put a smile on my face.... How's that? Can I go back to eating now.  Him: Yeah, that was pretty good.  **I actually went by myself to eat and made this conversation up. Lord I need more friends...  Out of 7 South St. Burger scores 5"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this South St Burger location. My burger was waaay overcooked. It was dry and hard biting into this burger. The manager was cooking all the patties on the grill. Patty tasted delicious...but still the dryness was too much, it ruined my meal."}
{"text":"Best burger from a chain. Ever. And the best location I have been too. Plus they have an app that rewards you with points towards your next meal, and every 2-3 visits, you can get a free combo with the points you've accumulated. Love especially the Swiss mushroom melt and the Hawaiian burger. Onion rings are really good too. Lots of toppings available too, many you don't find in other places. Occasionally packed, but usually some to plenty of seating available. A little pricey, but it's an example of you get what you pay for--and here you get an amazing burger. Customer service at this location is usually very good to excellent."}
{"text":"New favourite! We went tonight because we had coupons, and found it to be delicious and very affordable. It was $5 for any beer on tap (Saturday weekly feature), and the burgers were fresh and delicious. A 4oz burger was a perfect size for me, and my boyfriend got the 6oz which was humongous. We split a medium fry and they were crisp, not oily, and very yummy. We will be returning, as they have a lot of specials and we were very impressed.  Special kudos to the waitress - someone called in sick and she was working the whole place by herself. She nailed it, and we're grateful for the great service!"}
{"text":"Popped by to grab a quick bite. Sevice is quick, food is uninspiring. Nothing was wrong with taste,  but the burger that i got was somewhat dry. Was it bad? No. Was it great? No.  Just average."}
{"text":"I feel this place needs a bit more credits than it got. But first, I should declare I'm not a \"serious\" burger eater who gets excited talking about awesome burger places. I'm in general indifferent about it.  With that said, this place got amazing options for a cheap, relatively healthy bite when you are hungry in king east and just need something quick but decent, since you can customize the burger completely.  My order today is a 6oz chicken breast burger in whole wheat buns, and with maple syrup infused onions, guacamole, tomato salsa, and wasabi mayo. All the above toppings are free- and you have more interesting choices. The whole burger cost 7 dollars.  On top of that, the place is open, well lit, and cozy. You can come by yourself or with a group of friend and drink. It's very relaxing as a bar should be, but also open enough so that you don't feel that you have to be here to be here. I often order a burger, eat it then leave within 15 minutes.  Nowadays, a subway sandwich across the street cost just as much, I feel this is a solid choice for a simple meal in king east. Dont come here expecting to be impressed. That's a cute thought in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a new concept by the South Street Burger chain, and looks drastically different. It is more of pub than a fast food restaurant, and there is sit-down service. I really like the fact that they serve craft beer here, and also a full bar as well. Most notable is that they serve beer from Collective Arts Brewing, which is a big favourite of mine.  There are some unique sauce and ingredients that are not offered at other South street locations. The burgers are, as usual, pretty damn good - just like other South Street locations.  If you want to just grab and go, there is the usual fast-food type counter at the back of the restaurant as well.  Overall, big fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and looking for something to eat. I wound up driving west along St Clair when I spotted a Ny Fries sign a quick U turn later I was their. I noticed it was also a south St burger company and had never been to one before. Their a very nice and very friendly lady at the counter who greeted me. I finally chose the true north 4 oz combo. The lady went threw all the condiment  options with me as well as what goes great with what. She even had little taster spoons to let me try some of on condiments Way above and beyond what she had to do. Now down to business the food. The burger was cooked perfectly the fries were nice and golden with a good crunch just like I remembered. And all for under $15 I would definitely recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a burger"}
{"text":"SSBRGRCO (as written on the street level sign) is in the Beacon Hill Shopping Centre and opened last week Thursday.  I caught wind of it and took a drive over.  Good food is always worth the trek, if you ask me.    The space is wide open, bright, modern and clean (as it should be).  I really like the variety of burger toppings (i.e. garlic  mayo, honey mustard, gourmet relish, hot peppers), the big and fluffy wheat buns and the fact that you can choose the size of your beef burger or have a chicken or veggie burger if you want.  I tried the veggie burger (it's soy based) and with my limited experience, they all taste the same.  Nonetheless, this burger was good and sizeable.  For those who like Tabasco sauce, you can help yourself.  They serve NY Fries and poutine, but also offer onion rings and salad as sides.  I'm most excited about their hand-scooped ice cream milkshakes, which I'll get around to trying another day.  Taxes in, my burger alone was $6.04.  Not cheap, but worth it for a fairly healthy meal as I was modest with the toppings.  Cheese (such as Cheddar, Swiss, Goat and Blue) and bacon are at an extra cost and combo prices seem reasonable.  They grill burgers on the spot so it's not super fast, but overall I think it's one of the better choices for a fast food establishment."}
{"text":"I'm astounded by the service at this theatre location.  The burger crafts-person was very meticulous in building out the veggie burger and at times it looked like she was creating art.  Ample seating and staffing.    Would go again even if not watching a movie."}
{"text":"Great burger place and NY Fries are great too.  But this location has mediocre service.  Staff look like they don't want to be there.  Being at Bayview Village with higher end food establishments with superior service, getting a premium burger without the service doesn't seem right."}
{"text":"Was craving burgers and decided to order a burger from here through uber. I got the classic burger with a bunch of toppings. I like when you get to customize your own burger and put as many toppings as you'd like, (some for an extra charge) I requested more than the average toppings and I was surprised they got everything right even if it was for delivery. It wasn't that appealing though. The burger tasted yummy, no complaints there. It was cooked well and it was still juicy when it arrived. The fries however, weren't as great, I might be biased as I love mcds fries. Its a great substitute burger joint if you're looking to choose healthier options. I do however, prefer other places as it can be cheaper."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. The burgers were made perfectly, tasted great and the onion rings and fries were excellent as well. The service was excellent for a burger chain. They asked us if we wanted garlic mayo with our fries and they brought some over when we told them we wanted it. On our way out they tapped the handicap button to open the door to let us out. Overall a great experience for a South St. Burger.  TLDR; food was great and service was excellent for a burger joint."}
{"text":"First time experiencing South St. Burger Co. and it was a very pleasant one. As I first arrived, the manager was cool enough to tell me about their franchise and how its beef is natural. I'm all about natural ingredients. I ordered a 4oz burger with bacon and cheese (bacon was $1 extra and so was the cheese) on a whole wheat bun. It tasted pretty good, one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The variety of toppings you could add onto the burger is very pleasing, the same goes for the sauces. From what I remember, I added diced red onions, lettuce, pickles, banana peppers, and extra signature sauce (top and bottom).   Speed of service was good considering how recently it opened, it should become better when the cooks are more familiar with the process. The girls who took my order and asked what I wanted in my burger were very helpful, sweet, and knowledgeable about what they are doing. Price of my burger was pretty decent and worth it, ~$7. The seating and layout was pretty attractive too, especially their booths.   Also, I had the convience to eat here the day after, I bought their True North burger (basically what I ordered before but for a lower price) and it tasted great."}
{"text":"Stay away.   Went there for lunch today. Service was fine until we found a razor blade in our fries.    Manager on duty was notified immediately by front of house staff.  He never acknowledged us.    I've been back and forth now with head office.    SO THANKFUL WE NOTICED IT BEFORE EATING!  Not recommended.     Stay away."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I used to go here weekly when they first opened and thought it was amazing.  Then last year they changed their menu, ingredients, and prices.  It went from thick juicy patties, to perfect cylinders (mcdonalds-looking actually) patties that not only shrunk in thickness but also in general size.  The buns coincidentally also shrunk in size and quality, they now taste like something you buy in a supermarket (as opposed to the homemade flavour they previously had). These changes combined with the price going up led to us no longer going here. There was no way we were going to pay more for a smaller lower quality burger. We asked the manager/owner what was going on, and were told it was a corporate (chain-wide) change.  The only redeeming quality that they haven't lost is their wide and interesting selection of toppings (wasabi mayo is my personal favourite). Their onion rings aren't bad either if you're not in the mood for NY fries.  They're still better than the typical fast food burger, but i'm pretty bummed out that they've gone downhill."}
{"text":"As a celiac, WOW! I realize it's basically a fast food burger joint but I was impressed with their cross-contamination practices. I walked in and said \"I'm a celiac!\" And the guy behind the counter responded with \"ok no gluten.\" He them informed his coworker who changed his gloves and ONLY touched my food until my order was complete. I was given a little condiment menu for the separate gluten free condiments and a separate tray from my date. It was busy but he still payed attention to only my dish. I did feel bad for the growing line behind me but there were other staff to look a after them. I've never felt so safe eating out! I highly recommend any celiac try this location."}
{"text":"probably one of the better south st burger locations i've been to. 4 stars for yummy juicy burgers, and good service."}
{"text":"I got the 6oz 'Nacho' burger. It was topped with cheddar, salsa, jalapeno mayo and guac. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The patty itself was not very flavorful.  The toppings were somewhat lackluster without any Maxican flare or heat. They had a choice of whole wheat bun, which is nice and makes you feel a little better about the artery-clogging meal you're about to consume. I got the burger only, which set me back $8.  If you opt for the combo with NYF (New York Fries), you'll be paying $12. It's a little much for a run-of-the-mill burger, if you ask me. If I were to rank the burger, I would rank this well below Burger's Priest, Hero Burger, or Stockyards (which is close by.)"}
{"text":"Burger was over charred, too expensive and tasteless. It was definitely not worth the long wait and the price ($15 for a combo)."}
{"text":"I am not a regular eater of commercial hamburgers so keep that in mind Despite this my wife and I had take out burgers from here 3 times last week. The meat is very high quality angus, never frozen, and the condiment selection is quite wide. The price is on the hight side  at $7.50 for a 6 oz hamburger and $1.25 extra for the thinnest slice of cheese imaginable plus tax. Still it all tasted good and if I were in the mood I would go back when I want quality over quantity without the horrors of msg. Also the buns are premium white or whole wheat from Ace Bakery.  ps. I have not ate at a Macdonald', or Burger King for years and only very occasionally at Wendy's so you know where I am coming from."}
{"text":"I loved my experience here.  The place itself was bright, clean and a nice spot to grab a quick lunch with a friend.  This is the type of burger joint that offers a simple, no-fuss burger and does it well.  Prices are comparable to other burger joints. I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger and I was rewarded with a juicy hunk of meat with every bite.  The toppings were fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly. I also ordered a side of poutine which resembled the standard New York Fries build. The employee who took our order was very patient with me.  He answered my queries, cut my burger in half, and got me a cup of water when I asked.  Superb customer service! With a lot of specialty burger places popping up over the city, it's slightly refreshing to see a place that can do a classic burger really well."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem near George Brown College, came here with a few girlfriends on our break at school and it was amazing. It was quick, convenient, fresh and the burger alone was very filling ($8) and staff were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Came by here for a quick sandwich on my day off and noticed the person flipping burgers works a food industry job but doesn't wear a hat to prevent hair in food orders. I can overlook the counter and see a hat hung by their ice machine. The other two employees are wearing company caps. This makes me wonder how small and obvious things like this can slip by and what else might not have been noticed."}
{"text":"It was a rivalry between South St. or Bettys. We chose South St. because it seemed like it had a good variations of burger options.  Came in and realized it's kind of like a DIY burger restaurant. You could customize your burger toppings to exactly what you like and they top it in front of you.  Besides burgers, we came in on Tuesday and apparently on Tuesday and Thursday, pitchers are only 12.50! The workers were extremely kind and allowed my friend and I to sample a few beer options, we chose the Organic (really light beer).  Burgers were delicious! fries were good, especially if you add the cajun seasoning. This is a great place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Went last Friday...had coupons.  It was very busy but no issues.  Friendly staff and clean environment.  Seems like their menu has expanded which is good.  Burger was excellent (6 oz) and of course who doesn't love their New York Fries......Great selection of condiments.  I had cajun onions which weren't anything impressive but were fine...i also got the jalapeno mayo, lettuce and pickles....my only issue was i didn't watch the employee who was friendly put on the condiments...That was my fault, could have used condiments on both side since my whole wheat bun was a bit dry (still fresh but whole wheat is a little drier)  i'm sure if i asked they would have put on more.  That's more my fault, not hers.  The coupon really helped....not a cheap burger joint but that 6 oz burger was a legit 6 oz and very flavourful.  And she heaped on a pile of fries my sister and i shared and it was a small or reg size fries not large.  Def will go back."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place to hang out, have drinks and eat some delicious burger creations! Today I went with my girlfriend, and we had the most amazing time! I definitely recommend switching the fries to onion rings! It is pricier but well worth it because the onion rings are actually made with red onions and fried fresh! I had the Hawaiian burger and she had the mushroom Swiss, a drink, onion rings and a mocha milkshake.   Everything was amazing though she was not a fan of the milkshake! It lacked flavour and neither tasted like chocolate or coffee! She did ask for it to be less sweet but I think we were both expecting a bit more since it was priced at $4.75 before tax.   After ordering they handed us a stand with a sign where we were able to sit down and they brought us our food! As well as you can customized your burger, I definitely recommend the Cajun onions!   Great place for burgers! Next time we will try the lagers and beer!"}
{"text":"I was very disappoint with everything. . My biggest isssue is that the burger was dry and had no flavour.   The pouteen was small and not worth the money.  The food is way over priced and mediocre at best.."}
{"text":"great burgerBUT messed up my order even tho the large foot tall number token was very obvious.   had to leav - left beer-  king east location-   rap music and noise level was so loud I was shocked no one complained.    fries and burger tasty  hate that the service was non apparent   must line up to order - no table ordering food  no condiments on table or napkins even!   pros- meal\" deal\".  came to 14$ for small jr burger a fry and a beer.  not sure that's a deal."}
{"text":"M and I stopped here for lunch on Monday. It tends to generally be busy during lunch time. I like that they have a vegan option (the veggie burger) but I have to get it as a lettuce wrap. The employees don't seem very friendly and are sometimes hard to understand. It's close to work but I think it's overrated and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US. I wanted to check out a fast food place in Canada. This place was great. The burger was A+, just perfectly made and cooked. The fries were pretty subpar though but to be fair I was the last customer before it closed. It says it closes at 9 PM but it was closing at 8 PM."}
{"text":"Welcome to South Street Burger, home of the best and brightest toppings any burger lover could ask for. If you love trying new flavors and dressings that burger like never before I recommend going down to South St. and ordering yourself a beautiful veggie burger and load it till it doesn't fit in your mouth. Then when you have finished reminiscing in the best burger experience of your known existence, schedule next weeks burger day!!  lots of love for South St. Burger Co."}
{"text":"Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.   Where to start.   1) Young lady at the counter. You had gloves on which made me happy, but then I watched you grab a white bucket by its handle take it to the back and returned with it again to the same area you pick it up. You did not put on a new pair of gloves!!!! That's called cross-contamination.   Why am I constantly having to berate people in the food industry about this? Its bloody common sense no?   Child! You are working with food there is a flipping reason why you are wearing gloves, if your going to touch anything else but the bloody food then PLEAE CHANGE YOUR GLOVES.   2) I ordered the Nacho Burger. I have no idea why its called a Nacho Burger there wasn't anything Nacho about it. Could barely taste the avocado. The buns where cold. The burger greasy made my buns all soggy as well.   3) $3.95 for fries? They where greasy, stale and look like they where the ones left at the bottom of the bag. I didn't get a lot either.   4) I could actually smell the meat, which isn't a good sign. I don't think it was very fresh.   5) Within 20 minutes of consuming this take out I had to use the bathroom. I think I got food poisoning.  Just read the other comments after posting. It seems that they have an issue with NOT changing their gloves. Explains why I had to run to the bathroom after consuming the food."}
{"text":"I think the closest comparison I can make it to is Hero Burger. I love the burgers here but it can get a greasy. Now I generally get the veggie burger which is one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here for lunch today for his birthday.  I've been a few other times and and every experience has been pleasant.  The prices are decent and there's an option for 4 or 6 oz burgers.  My favourite part is the toppings. I love that they have olives, cucumbers and other things you wouldn't ordinarily have as an option for a burger topping!   There's also awesome options for sauces- multiple different kinds of mayo, relish etc.  I'm not a big burger eater but this place is fantastic and the staff are very friendly   Overall a great experience and most importantly the birthday boy was happy :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced and what tastes like frozen patties/cardboard.   Better burgers are available for less pretty much everywhere!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Nothing special for the price.  Don't get me wrong,  it wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I would go out of my way for like Peters Drive In or Smash Burger."}
