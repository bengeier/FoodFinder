{"text":"Delivery.   They overload on the veggiesi unless you order beef no broccoli.  Higher prices than the quality of food .  Really nice girl takes phone orders .  Delivery driver quicker than their eta usually.  But overall  fair-good.  We order from there often (mostly due to lack of options ) but more often than not are pleased when we do."}
{"text":"Great service. I felt terrible I gave the incorrect address but the driver was patient and found me anyway! Plus the food was great, just whatI needed."}
{"text":"Owner (I think he's the owner?)is a really cool guy. Wasn't rush hour so he had time for me to ask him some quesions about the food and the business itself and he happily room the time to talk to me which was a big deal for me. Yes this is food court Chinese food, but it's actually pretty good, and the deals are great. Definitely reccommend."}
{"text":"When Chinese cuisine meets taste and elegance, the results are Mandarin Express. In the many times and circumstances I've had the honor of trying new Chinese restaurants, this is by far the best of them all. When you try this fried rice and lo mein nothing else will compare to it, anything that you've tried before will be thorns and prickles compared to the tasteful fruit and delicacies found here. Mandarin express shall remain for generations and generations to come. Happy eatings!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Vegas hands down! Always fresh, generous portions, delivery driver is always friendly and on time. Don't miss out! We order delivery from here once a week."}
{"text":"Got Mongolian beef w fried rice and two egg rolls today. The mongolian beef was really mongolian onions and peppers. There was hardly any beef at all. Especially for $12.74. The meal should have had atleast four times the amount of beef. The rice was okay and so were the egg rolls. 

Plus the place had a weird smell... I will not be going back."}
{"text":"My family and i think this is a wonderful restaurant.  The people there are always so friendly, and the delivery service is amazingly quick.  We ordered 6 entrees tonite and the driver was here in 15 minutes.  The food was as delicious as always and hot!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best tasting Chinese/Mandarin food that I've had in Las Vegas, hands down. The service is fast and everyone is always very friendly. Delivery is always fast and the food never gets to you cold. They always give us little extras like 2-4 containers of white rice, handfuls of fortune cookies, and handfuls of condiments like soy sauce and other sauces. I would definitely recommend checking out this hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! A group of co-workers and I eat here several times a week. The food is delicious! Definitely deserves a 5-Star rating."}
{"text":"We drove to a remote part of Las Vegas because we had a coupon for Buy One Entree, Get One Free -- this coupon was from the Entertainment Book, sold annually, with hundreds of participating restaurants and other businesses offering great discounts. 

When we finally arrived at the restaurant, we were starving -- we hadn't realized how far away this place was.  We entered this hole-in-the wall Chinese place -- at first, it seems just like a \"fast-food\" style order at the counter restaurant, but they had several tables available, and we were told to take a seat if we were dining in.  We were promptly greeted by a young woman, who told us that the coupon we had wasn't going to work, as they didn't have a contract with the Entertainment Book people --- we had just driven half an hour to try this place out, and they weren't going to honor our coupon!  Bleh!  They did offer a 10% discount, however, so we decided to stay, as we were really hungry.  How disappointing, however, for them not to honor a valid coupon with their name on it, that hadn't expired.  Poor business practice!

On the plus side, they had good prices, good portion sizes -- however they offered table service, yet served everything on styrofoam plates. I don't mind eating off of styrofoam, but if you're going to offer table service, go to the dollar store and buy some cheap real plates to serve your customers on!!!  

The food would get a 3.75 stars, but their customer service (in not accepting the coupon) rates them a 1 star -- we would never go back to a business that does something like this, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody else either."}
{"text":"This place was a last minute decision to fulfill my craving for honey walnut shrimp, one of my favorite Chinese food entrees. I was actually on my way to a different establishment when I found this place.

When I arrived I was a tad skeptical. The place was empty and it literally looked like there was no one inside. Had it not been for the bright \"Open\" sign in the window, I would have put the car in reverse and left immediately. I walked inside to find the cashier sitting at one of the tables, dabbling on her laptop. She was very prompt and got up quickly to greet me. She handed me the menu and after a quick page through, I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp ($9.95).

It didn't take long for my order to come out (standard Chinese food 10 minutes). I waited patiently and surveyed the establishment. I had to give this place only 3 stars based mainly on my surroundings. The table was a little sticky and the lighting was terrible. I don't think it would be an ideal place to eat, maybe just take out. When my food came out, I thanked her and headed home to try out their version of the tasty seafood dish.

The portion of the dish was a good size and it was pretty good. It was definitely sweet like all the other Chinese places I've been to, but this place added a different touch to it. When I bit into a shrimp, not only was it sweet, I also tasted a hint of lemon. It was such a nice change especially with a dish like Honey Walnut Shrimp. Usually I can eat a handful of the dish and get sick of it because it's overly sweet and too creamy. The lemon in this dish offset the sweetness and it wasn't overwhelming. My only gripe was that the walnuts weren't candied. I enjoy candied walnuts with my Honey Walnut Shrimp because they tend to be crunchier and it serves as a kind of \"after the meal dessert.\"

If I was in the area again, I would definitely try another one of their dishes to make sure I didn't just get lucky and pick the one delicious entree. Dining in? Not so much. Take out? Without question."}
{"text":"Don't let the location or aesthetics of this place fool you... The food is great. They have plenty of traditional options and even a few Thai and curry choices as well. Service is always great and the good comes out quick!"}
{"text":"Delivery is fast and my food has always been hot!  The delivery man is always so nice as well.  

I always order the General Tso, combination fried rice and egg rolls. I had the teriyaki chicken before but it was drowning in a sweet sauce and we couldn't even enjoy it so never again will we order that."}
{"text":"Delicious.....definitely a hidden gem. They really should move closer to the strip. Tourist it's worth the drive :-)"}
{"text":"Well I ordered 2 lunches and a appetizer for delivery at 3pm, the other day spending about $24 in all... So the pork was tough and stringy and the chicken was a little bit better but not good. Very disappointing... I suspect that these were not freshly cooked and that they were left over from an earlier lunch. They just lost a customer, who lives down the street."}
{"text":"This is one of the best eateries in the neighborhood. I recently had a bad experience, I ordered the spare ribs one night near to the closing hour for delivery  and when I  opened the ribs I was disappointed because it was all bones and usually we order these ribs all the time and there very meaty,  however I had work over the weekend and was unable to return the ribs right away so 3 days later I called and spoke to Kevin and he was very kind, sweet and apologetic, he remade the ribs and had it delivered to me. That's awesome customers service! Thank you Kevin!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I found them via Eat24. Since my first order, I've had no complaints (other than when they ran out of my drink :( ) But otherwise, all blue skies!! It took a while to get my past order, but no complaints. The food tastes amazing and authentic. And in my recent order, they even added an extra egg roll, a crab rangoon, egg drop soup, and another fortune cookie! Talk about good fortune!
How awesome are these guys?
Pretty dang awesometastic!

Keep it up,
Heather G"}
{"text":"The food is good. As any American Asian cuisine. When you go into the restaurant only a couple of them are nice. Delivery was quick. The guy however who delivered was extremely rude. Only word he said was \"Wtf\" and stormed off and sped out of the driveway."}
{"text":"Well I decided to try chinese food on this Friday night so I decided on this place since it was the closest and I've had them before. Well I actually placed my order through Yelp and decided to pick it up instead of getting charged $2.00 for delivery plus any tip money. 

I placed my order and I guess it have me an eta of 10 minutes which was okay with me since I'm already turning up in my pajamas on this Friday night. When I got there which took me all of 5 minutes my order was just placed in the bag waiting for me. I ordered house low mein & house fried rice. Well I must have forgotten the portions are for a family of 4 and it's just me but it will eventually all get eaten. 

Well guess it was pretty good but I've had better in L.A. but it was greasy like I sometimes like it sho it did was it was supposed to do which was fill my belly. But at least it not sitting around under a heating lamp cuz they actually make the food fresh to go.

Service was okay but 1 thing all chinese take out need to learn.......STOP BEING SO STINGY WITH THE SOY SAUCE PACKETS!!!! All this rice I have and guess how many packets they gave me to go with my food??? Only 3!!!! But I always keep soy sauce in the house anyway for whenever I cook.

 But I probably won't be going back and will try to find me another spot to try out. But hey I'm full & not hungry anymore."}
{"text":"This place just opened at the mall so I decided to try it out. I got noodles with bourbon chicken, sesame chicken, and Kung pao chicken. All of it was very good, but I wish the kung pao chicken was way more spicy. Definitely the best fast food Chinese I've had."}
{"text":"I don't know whats going on with these bad reviews but this place is great! I just moved into the area and my boyfriend and I are experimenting with different places to eat. They are located close to where we live, so we gave this place a try as I used to work at a chinese food resturaunt and always have an appetite for something chinese. They have a ton to choose from on the menu, they are prompt with their attentions to the customer and all the employees are very nice. We ordered our food, and although it was a little bit of a wait (i'd rather have quality food than fast food) it was well worth it. Most chinese places charge the same for al la carte, but our meals (we ordered the half portion) came with rice. We ordered the monogolian beef (spicy and spectacular), cashew shrimp, and chicken lo mein. The prices arent that high at all for what you get as portions were bigger than we expected and we have leftovers for today. Everything was flavored just right and they include calories per serving on the menu for those who want to be healthy. The inside is not all dressed up, they only have a few tables, so I wouldnt go in expecting a five star resturaunt in San Fransico's China Town, but I would say if you like authentic Chinese food you should check this place out."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food at a fair price.  Right down the street and they deliver, too."}
{"text":"I have lived across the street from this place for years and it always SMELLS delicious but that is far from my experience every time, no matter what I get the meat is tough, veggies are over cooked and there is just no... Flavor. Plus the place is rather sticky and dirty."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not get any credit probably for it's poor location, or lack of advertisement. I literally live across from mandarin express, and have always been skeptical about giving it a try. Parents were in town and suggested Chinese food for dinner. I was extremely lazy that day and figured I should try mandarin express since it was only seconds from my house.
  
The place is very small, and looked closed because they never have the doors open. Don't get discouraged, and try it! I was actually surprised at how good the food was. Since the place is not busy, they make everything fresh right after ordering. Along with great food, I found the lady there to be very nice (she's not too fluent in eng, however she was very nice).
  Will be going here from now on to get my Chinese food."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have great prices and the food tastes amazing! Their Crab Rangoon is to die for!"}
{"text":"We are usually happy with Mandarin Express and their delivery service.  We ordered our usual family package with Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Pork Fried Rice.
Received our delivery in about 25 minutes but when I went yo get the Sweet and Sour Chicken out for the kiddos... There was NO sauce. I called and they did bring us some sauce BUT by then our kiddos ate the Orange Chicken (hubby and mine)...
Little to say no dinner for the adults since the kids ate first (as they always should). Maybe they will eat the Sweet and Sour tonight.
I feel that when you order something to be delivered then the business should check and double check to be sure and bring the entire order.

Food is good but next time we will check for all items"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, I wouldn't feed this to my dog. It is however tasty and greasy if you haven't a  palate."}
{"text":"Decent food. Big portions, always within the time they give (about 50 minutes). They never give utensils but thats fine. Ordered here plenty of times."}
{"text":"Food was of good quality.  A boat load of food for a real good price.  Drink machine was out so all they had was water and Pepsi, at least they had choices though.    It seemed like a food truck, but inside of a building.  I'll be back again.  The owner /manager seemed nice enough though."}
{"text":"I for one hate to be Anton Ego but I've just had a totally inept experience with this restaurant. There was never a bad time that I had with a Chinese restaurant until the night I came to Mandarin \"Healthy Chinese\" Express. My family including my grandpa and my incestuous cousin (no joke) who planned this evening and chose this place only to feel like an upscale Mr. Chow's, it's small but decent. Now for the bad part, because of the large party they gave some of us the to-go menus including myself. Now if your dining in a restaurant you know this isn't the way to do things, bummer. 

When the drinks came to our table, the waitress (cunt) forgot my diet coke and I had to ask her ignorant-ass several times for my drink. It took 10 minutes in which was a shame and I could of got it myself, fuckin' hell.
Now that killed 80% of my appetite and it pissed me off to no fuckin' end. We had a nice set of entrees including lemon chicken, walnut prawns, fried and steamed rice, kung-pao combo, and chow-mein. For the latter dish, my family forgot to give me the goddamn thing and after asking them several times and I've suddenly lost my appetite because of the eccentricities of my family and the fuckin' morons who run this place. All the food came in paper plates and the serving arrangements could've been done at home. I want to give this place a fair rating but when this guy's appetite is ruined by everything thrown at him, rest assured all bet are off. The food isn't healthy at all and there is a whole lot of MSG so I thought fair warning. If you crave Chinese/Mandarin food and you don't want anyone killing you appetite, do yourself a favor and skip it at all costs. What a way to ruin the entire trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered Family Dinner B with fried rice, ginger onion beef, and kung pao chicken. It came with fried shrimp, an eggroll and some cream cheese rangoons. Those were the best thigns about the order sadly.
The wor wonton soup it came with was a saving grace. It was delicious, and I enjoyed it.
The kung pao chicken was a huge disappointment in that it was mostly CELERY. I'm not kidding you it was atleast 60% celery, and was not spicy at all. 
The ginger onion beef was a little bit better but not by much. It had more green onion and strips of ginger than there was beef. 
The fried rice was very greasy and did not have much flavor. It did not taste fresh. Usually I am excited to reheat left overs from Chinese restaurants but now I dread eating it, but I must to feel like I didn't waste my money. There are so many better options for Chinese Food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food at this place is absolutely amazing, have no complaints about the food the service HOWEVER well I'll get to that. The potstickers are the best I've ever had! My son and I love them, highly recommend them. We live around the corner so we order often, my usual is the shrimp fried rice or Singapore noodles, my son loves the combo low mein and the Thai tea amazing! And all decently priced. Nowwww about the lady cashiering, terrible! She is so rude, I think it's the owner actually, or owners family. You'd think bcuz she's the owner shed be more kind and customer conscious but nope she always has this disgusted look on her face. She doesn't smile back, or make eye contact in fact has no response or reaction to your questions just yes or no. And its not a language barrier shes just very rude and selective on who she gives proper service to. She doesn't treat her people like that. Honestly shes the only reason I order ahead and to go.  Shes just as rude on the phone too. I understand it's a different culture but their  demeanour at that restaurant is just really upsetting sometimes. You're running a business in a neighborhood thats very diverse. They should be grateful and learn some customer skills for their business. If it wasn't for the food being so good, I'd never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"Gross, greasy, over cooked, smelled burnt, took forever to deliver and just not good quality."}
{"text":"Very average Chinese food, but hey if you're craving Chinese take out around this area, I would give it a go. The Family Dinners are great deals and can feed 3 adults and a child, order online for convenience! Entrees are solid, the fried rice and noodles are okay, wonton soup isn't good, and of course you can't go wrong with egg rolls and cream cheese rangoons. Been here a couple of times given convenience in the area, not wanting to eat out, and friends craving Chinese."}
{"text":"As good as Asian take out can be. We've gone enough times that the staff know what we order. Call me crazy but I judge Asian food based on their white rice. They have a everything but the kitchen sink item that has different classifications of proteins all in one dish. I can't think of the name but it is my husbands favorite."}
{"text":"Ordered the Combination Lo Mein ($6.95) and Moo Goo Gai Pan ($8.15). Lo Mein was tasty, although kind of dark and on the salty side. Perhaps too much soy sauce? The Moo Goo Gai Pan was very tasty and seasoned just right! Had to wait a long time for our food, though. Guess they had a lot of orders before mine."}
{"text":"Bomb! Stopped here on a whim with my honey and babygirl  while on the east side, verrrrry good the sesame beef was outa this world. The string bean and chicken was great too! Hopefully we will be on this side of town again sometime soon ! Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"Great portions and I am obsessed with their fried rice! They also deliver! Always a huge plus! I did their delivery option and the food was fresh and hot! Will definitely eat from here again in the future :D"}
{"text":"Last time that I had food from this place I had food poisoning very disappointing I just to be a regular until this happen."}
{"text":"Living nearby my local grocery store I wanted to grab some chinese that's not the usual Panda Express.  I didn't know what to expect but I decided to give it a shot anyway.
They have a lunch special which consisted of your choice of entree with including egg drop soup and some fried chips of some sort. I ordered the orange chicken which was actually pretty good. Not breaded as much as the usual Chinese fast food, but the chicken inside was tender and juicy. 
For the price and value, I would recommend this spot if you want a quick bite but not trying to break the budget."}
{"text":"Because I got the runs after eating here, and my mom was dry puking and also had the runs, don't eat at this death trap!
Dad ended up throwing away the leftovers following the sickness."}
{"text":"\"I love this place for take home Chinese food. Nothing beats it. I usually order Hong Kong Noodles or Singapore Noodles and their crab ragoon or fried wonton are really great. This is comfort food for me. The people who run it don't speak much but they are very friendly. Not the best decor to eat in, but taste great on your couch in front of the tv.\""}
{"text":"Wow, what an incredible place! For the price of this food, firstly cooked, quick service, nice and hot, you cannot beat this place!!!

I highly recommend this to anyone that likes for us Chinese food. This is not a buffet, not a greasy spoon, not food it's been sitting all day, it's wonderful!

Lunch is outstanding today and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is nasty as hell. I ordered some crab ragoons with the red sauce and it had a roach inside the sauce. I am so disgusted, when I told them about it,  they said they keep the tops on their food which means they have bugs crawling around the food. But look here they still crawl in the food dumb asses.  Why don't you get rid of the bugs. U need to be shut down!!  And yes I gotta refund but still mentally fucked! 0- rating"}
{"text":"Price is reasonable but taste is underwhelming. I ordered the Szechuan Chicken Lunch Special with Fried Rice. Rice was dry and everything overall had a processed taste. Fine if you're looking for cheap 'Chinese' food, but don't let the high rating let you think it's anything close to authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely horrible.  Worst Chinese food I have ever tasted in my life.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is family owned and is by far the best Chinese food I've had! I've ask for delivery and they are always punctual, they bring everything needed to enjoy my food, and the food tastes fresh, and delicious! I've also gone to pick up my food, they're always nice and unlike other restaurants you can see your meal being cooked not just hearing it as others do! I'm by far, very satisfy with their services. I've had variety of food from combination fried rice, broccoli beef/chicken, to orange chicken. My favorite is combination fried rice!"}
{"text":"I truly love it here I get it fresh always watching the guy cook is amazing ...happy camper"}
{"text":"Seriously this place is good. I've tried 5 dishes and all are good. Everything is made right in front of you in the wok. It's cleaner and doesn't leave you feeling like crap after. Good find. Mom and pop ran. Way better then panda could ever be and way better tasting"}
{"text":"I just come here for their wonton soup - clear broth - always perfect if you are needing something healthy.  Healthy Chinese food - I've had a few other dishes - but mainly come here for soup if under the weather.  Fast take out."}
{"text":"Wow! Delivery was fast but it was 4:30pm so they probably weren't too busy.

The food was ok.  I got orange chicken.  I think it would have been better to send the orange sauce separately b/c the breading was a little soft (and not crisp).

The pork fried rice was a little bland but it was ok."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Rice Trax but they were closed so we came here . They share the same parking lot so we didn't need to go far. I ordered the Orange Chicken which was made to order. It had that crispness that I love served with some tasty fried rice. I was happy with my order but my brother wasn't happy with his beef steak. He said there were too many veggies and not enough beef. I like that they make everything fresh.  I didn't see any food under heat lamps which I thought was a refreshing change."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was terrible. It was 90 degrees inside and smelled like old grease. The woman behind the counter was down right rude to my wife when she asked about portion sizes. I ordered szechuan beef. It was inedible. They turned it into deep fried beef jerky. TERRIBLE. I don't write TERRIBLE very often about restaurants, but there is no getting around it. It was TERRIBLE. The other diners in our party had somewhat better food, but the egg drop soup smelled like CAT PISS and the huge piles of white rice that came with every order were ridiculous. Why not give us less, but make it better. I will never go again and advise you to avoid."}
{"text":"Didn't understand I wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate. Mostly vegetables in the Kungpow chicken. Place is run down. Large portions."}
{"text":"I get food delivered from Mandarin Express every couple of months or so.  Typically the same order of Pad Thai with an assorted appetizer (sometimes an additional entree).  Delivery is usually 30-40 minutes and the food is always tasty and hot.  I have picked up food from the location before and usually don't see many people eating in the restaurant.  It seems most of their business is take out/delivery.  They are a good option for quick Chinese food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is one of the true Chinese tasting foods out here and best yet they deliver.  The place isn't that big, a typical small place with a few tables surrounding a small kitchen. The staff one could see are the waitress who is kind of cute, the older cook and the last guy who does everything from cooking to delivery. 

Other than the cute waitress the younger guy is also kind of cute. He hides these amazing eyes behind those glasses. He is kind of short, but packs a lot of masculinity in there."}
{"text":"Mandarin Express has some excellent food. I love their egg fo young and Thai tea. You won't be disappointed with any menu item."}
{"text":"Excellent high quality Chinese food and the food tasted like it was made fresh. I had walked by it several times previously but was hesitant to try it. My order of sesame chicken was excellent and came with more sauce that most places. My only complaint is they serve their rice with vegetables and they have no plain rice option."}
{"text":"Yuck!   The service is rude!  I ordered online thru Yelp and went I went in to pick up my order it was ready, but dang be cordial.  No hello, smile or thanks.  

The food was disgusting.  I love sweet n sour chicken with sauce on the side but this was gross.  The orange chicken was bad too and the rice tasted burnt.

Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"best fried rice ever!! so worth it!! would also recommend their mango/strawberry boba!! been going here for more than 5 years and it never fails!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to give this place a try. Since my husband is a picky eater, I decided to order take out in person for the first time. Service was friendly and efficient. Good knowledge of the menu and answered my questions nicely. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name. Very helpful with special orders. Everything was fast, fresh, tasty, and most importantly, correct. We will be back and we are looking forward to trying the delivery."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food, great service super friendly and reasonable prices. They are always fast in making my food and delivery is also fast."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food on the East side of Las Vegas. Healthy and very generous portions  the people who work there are very nice. My favorite is their wonton soup, seriously best soup ever!!! The way they make it is delicious and warms my stomach, especially on my sick days. My family and I usually order from here twice a month and have never been disappointed. When we order delivery they are fast and the food always gets here hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I used to live in this area and when I first moved to Vegas, I tried this restaurant in hopes of tasting like the Chinese restaurants back home.  And it for the most part it does and then some!  The salt and pepper shrimp, chicken, calamari are grrrreat.  Every chance I get I try to come here."}
{"text":"I order 2 wor wonton soups  and ended up getting a vegetable soup not what I ordered. Then call back to inform the gentleman that took my order and he had the nerve to argue with me the customer. Instead of just solving the situation. Not very good customer service if you ask me. So check your order before you take it out of the restaurant. Because if not you are screwed."}
{"text":"The egg drop soup was good, they got the order right,  the rangoons tasted good though they were a bit overcooked.  Over all we were off to a good start,  until we got to the entrees.  My walnut shrimp is soaked in the honey sauce,  and I mean literally, the sauce is almost overflowing and very sweet, it's wayyyyyyy too much sauce and the walnuts are scorched.  Hubby got the combo kung pao and it tasted like garbage, and the meats were overcooked.  We each got a boba smoothie and they taste okay but the boba is old and crusty."}
{"text":"Best delivery Chinese food in town!  Lemon chicken with no lettuce with fried rice, beef pepper steak and white rice, or chicken chow mein are the the things I always get when ordering from there.  The cream cheese rangoons are always a good extra if you're very hungry.  Delivery is fast, and the people who work there are nice.  One of my family's favorite spot."}
{"text":"Ok...So I came back here because of convenience and once again put off by the service. Why oh why did i let the same Chinese lady serve me again. I recieved the same service with no smile along with food being questionable. In all the years I've learned how to cut vegetables, you learn that...You have to cut the parts that are no good. My broccoli was half yellow and when I asked the Chinese lady she said it was because vegetables lose their color when cooking.

The more I eat out at places like this i realize, I need to start cooking my own food."}
{"text":"I was on the Eastside late one night way out in BFE Sunrise Manor visiting a friend. We grew hungry and were craving Chinese/Mandarin food. I looked up Yelp and found Mandarin Express. 

I am glad we did because the service, delivery and food was Outstanding! 

We ordered crab rangoons, war won ton soup, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and house special chicken.

The food was very hot and fresh upon delivery which was Fantastic, they don't mess around with delivery. lol

A full belly is a happy belly :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps I just got a replacement cook that day, but I ordered Mongolian beef and the beef I received was still raw with corn starch and uncooked flour and was completely un-edible!
I did not find this out until I got it home. Yuck!!!!! Yuck!!!! Yuck!!!
Who wants to eat raw flour and corn starch because some basic cook does not cook it long enough in the wok?
Then after going over and over again to the next door Albertson's, they then had a banner out front about their food on sale.
No wonder!!!! 
Apparently, other people felt the same.
I never went back"}
{"text":"This place has been around since I was little. I've always loved it! I even compare other places to them.  their fried rice and crab Rangoon."}
