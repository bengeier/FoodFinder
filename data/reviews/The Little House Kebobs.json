{"text":"I love this place. One of the few places where the price includes tax. Good people and amazing food. Small menu though but its worth it."}
{"text":"Not the prettiest place. But the koobedeh is the best I had in Toronto.Very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a small and cozy Persian/Iranian Kebab place on Yonge. I've been to this place several times and it's always been a pleasure grabbing a quick bite here.  This isn't a \"fancy\" restaurant and the decor is quite simple but with a lot of character, reminiscent of old Kebabb places in Tehran.  The food is tasty, the service is friendly and genuine and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My favorite persian restaurant in the city! Great food, great service, and great prices!"}
