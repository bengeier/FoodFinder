{"text":"Great experience reaaly cool people very authentic great food nice service perfect real profesional"}
{"text":"The price and quality is amazing, the sushi rice in the chirashi is really nicely flavoured, I was eating it by itself for awhile. the only thing I would deduct stars for (but won't because reading the other reviews it sounds like they were having an off day) is it that it took 45 minutes to complete a relativity small order (3 rolls and 1 chirashi bowl) besides that I'm lucky to have this place in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite take-out places ever. Everything is always delicious and well prepared. Their chicken katsu with yakisoba noodles is one of my favourite dishes ever. I usually order the delicious chicken katsu and yakisoba noodles, beef gyoza, shrimp tempura and sushi. 
The only negative thing I have to say about Sushi Karu is that they don't deliver during lunch time anymore, so sad."}
{"text":"I've bought take out twice from Sushi Karu and both times it was great. Reasonably priced items that are fresh and tasty. Well worth it! Also, the lady at cash is extremely nice and does her best to make you feel welcome. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat. 

My only (small and easily overlooked) gripe is that restaurant is take out only and you can't dine in - but this makes sense as the place is tiny."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for sushi over the weekend and didn't want to travel far for it. I remember that this place just opened up and made my order on the phone for pick up.

I had a lot of reservations, as I found the last iteration of this restaurant (different owners) to be pretty ho-hum. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a regular sushi combo (8 pieces of nigiri, 6 California rolls) and a miso soup, and it came to $15. When I went to pick it up, the chef was the only person there and I got my food right away. The space is much more welcoming now with an open kitchen. 

The sushi was pretty fresh and the rice was great. It was the perfect amount of food. The menu is pretty robust with Korean option and a few types of bao! I will definitely check this spot out again to try out their other offerings. Also, they deliver over $30, so next time I won't even have to leave my house!"}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of salmon sushi, maki and sashimi which was all very good. The initial order came with two complimentary sofas. Additionally, they forgot our sashimi appetizer and when I called to let them know, they promptly rushed it over and brought an extra large order of salmon sushi. They were extremely nice about it and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for food quality and service"}
{"text":"This place has really great, fresh sushi. The fish is delicious, there is not too much rice, everything is done just right. The prices are standard. I used to live in Koreatown North, and thought I had the best sushi in town. Sushi Karu is better than the sushi I had in North York and Willowdale by far!

The staff was super friendly too. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We tried his new place and were so impressed! The sushi fish and rice were fresh and portioned, the chicken Katsu was amazing!!! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I was starving around the area with the constant thought of been awarded the Sushi Sensei badge by Yelp. I followed the directions and ended in a modest, famil-run establishment. 

Let's be honest, most of the buildings around the area could use a makeover. Sushi Karu is located in an old place that gives the impression of have been decorated and upgraded as the business goes up. There are nice details in the washroom and cashier area that embrace Japanese accents.

I didn't go there for the view but for the food. In that matter I can say that the three items I ordered for were solid. A good portion of sea weed with a discrete seasoning. Good quality and perfect temperature for the avocado and tuna tartar. Fresh, light, and harmonic combination in the Futo Roll.

I would go back or order from them.

It's a small place with just one 6ppl table available."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal! We had chicken teriyaki bento and  tempura as well as some rolls. Presentation was great. Best Japanese in the area."}
{"text":"I've always ordered delivery from Sushi Karu, so I can't speak to the physical restuarant. But I have found consistently the food is really fresh, arrives very fast, portions are great and the price is reasonable. I would recommend the Hae Dup Bab (which is like Korean poke/chirashi don served with a spicy sauce you can drizzle on top) and the crispy and savoury karaage."}
