{"text":"I love 5 & Diner! The cherry cokes, the mac 'n' cheese, Mrs. Cleaver's pot roast (no longer on the menu but you can still order it), the diner grilled chicken sandwich, and the most delicious root beer floats & shakes! Being a classic movie fan, of course I love the atmosphere and photos of movie stars that adorn the walls. Plus, some nights they have live rockabilly music and people bring their cool, classic cars. How awesome is that? There's no where else like this in Scottsdale. Oh yes and the service is excellent too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are super broke right now, so we're taking advantage of our Groupon credits.  We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.    As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about."}
{"text":"The guy in purple shirt  asking the black bus boy to go out back and fight what a turn off from this place 3rd time i ate here from out town this loud mouth pushing what  seems  to be a manager  never again will i eat there cause of him and i staying across the  street for 2 months  for work shame  on him the girls were just shaking  there head cause of his behavior  lots of kids with  family present"}
{"text":"Today is the last time I will ever order steak and eggs at the 5 & Diner.  This is the third time in a row where the steak just sucked.  Not even eatable.  The server (Carlos) is nice and does what he can but it's not enough.  Carlos told me he tells his boss but nothing changes.  Well now I'm telling whoever runs that place that your breakfast steak is not worth serving let along to pay $12 for it.  Unfortunately you will never have a chance to get me back even if you solve the problem."}
{"text":"Last night I was part of a group of 15  that gathered on the patio at 5 & diner to enjoy the good food  and the beautiful weather.  As usual the service was outstanding and the friendly staff went out of their way to show they appreciated our business.  Looking for a place that serves breakfast any time of the day or  night?  You've found a home here.  This is excellent, low cost, traditional diner food.  I love the type of music that is always playing in the background.  This is one of the few places to eat on the patio where you are far enough away from the street."}
{"text":"I went to this location and since I live in the Northeast, I love diners. This place was great! They had a waitress who stood well over 6 feet tall! I had a good old greasy hamburger with fries and it tasted good.   And when you stop by say hello to Willie. He the guy who bus the tables.( I think he's really the owner!)"}
{"text":"Their homestyle mac and cheese seems overpriced but it is definitely very very very good!  Chili burger is very good, and sometimes I go there with my boyfriend just for their shakes! Mmm!  Plus the atmosphere is super cute and nifty!  They have car shows and other stuff sometimes in the evening, and outside areas where you can bring your pet.  Very helpful and friendly service even if you're just getting a shake."}
{"text":"2.5 stars would be more accurate.   Don't go if you are in a hurry.  menu does have a lot of variety and there were several things I wanted to try.  After debating between chicken fried steak and the southwest burger I let myself be talked into the handyman burger.  it was HUGE.  2 patties, bacon, 2 kinds of cheese, fried dill pickle.  It could have been great, but unfortunately it wasn't.  It was overcooked and dry.  the kettle chips that came with, were great. We also ordered an appetizer sampler.  Excellent onion rings, good chicken strips & mozzarella sticks, lousy wings.   The butterscotch milkshake needed to be more butterscotchy, but I'm not sorry I ordered it. My biggest complaint is the prices.  My burger, the other half's hot dog, 2 sodas, appetizer & milkshake totaled just over $36. A bit pricey for a  late night dinner for 2 in my opinion.   I all honesty though, we will most likely try them again sometime when were feeling flush, just not late night."}
{"text":"Have been to this location many times, excellent diner fare. Love late night dinner or early breakfast. Service is always great. I really like their staff and their food. Their shakes are \"bomb,\" as my daughter would say. Sooo good. Love the meatloaf with the mushrooms and onion straws. She always gets the chicken strips. The fried pickles are really good, along with the onion rings, potato skins and fries. Love the vibe, always an eclectic crowd."}
{"text":"The service was so horrible! Peaches was our waiter and we were waiting for our food for 30 minutes! We left before the food came because 3 tables got seated after us and served before us! not ok"}
{"text":"We have been going to 5&Diner since we moved out to Arizona which was about 7-8 years ago. It is typical diner food and they have great milkshakes! A very nice hostess seated us and our \"usual\" waiter took our orders. I recommend this place!!!!:)"}
{"text":"The food is always so fresh and tasty. the service is awesome! My lil one and i are regulars. We love you five and diner on southern ave!"}
{"text":"$2.49 for a cup of coffee geeeez...i get better tasting coffee at mcdonalds for 81 cents...ill never go back !!!!!"}
{"text":"I was very surprises at how much I enjoyed this place. My daughter and her friend wanted to go after shopping so I tried it for the first time. The service was excellent and the food was all good. I  ordered a grilled chicken salad with raspberry dressing. The girls had a little of everything. I would love to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"ATTENTION- SEE BELOW. BUT I WANT THIS 1 STAR BACK!  I have eaten at this establishment quite a few times over the years ever since they opened. I would have breakfast meetings here, take the girls softball team here after games and other events. We thought it was a good place to suggest 3 of my friends join me last night. after a long day of diving over 900 miles in one shot and loading and off loading a 25 foot moving truck, we wanted a change from the spots along the highway.  My first impression when we walked in the door was it smelled like a greasy sewer. I headed to the rest room to wash my hands. It was gross and the rest room was even worse. I even noticed little deodorizers like the ones in the urinals in some unusual places outside the restroom. Humm. Makes you wonder!  We sat and waited for others to join us. We were parked in the second to the east corner booth, by the kitchen door and milk shake machine. We were hungry and tired. Once our party joined us, we ordered.  It was not a complex or difficult order.... 3 french toast orders and I had small diner salad, half tuna and soup of the day.   The place was far from busy and most other patrons were already eating. It took every bit of 25 minutes or more to get our food. The server Mike (receipt said a different foreign name)  had no clue how to serve, never brought us our utensils, forgetting parts of the order.   But the part I am really complaining and disgusted about and warning to others has to deal with what we all witnessed crawling all around us.   First, while we were waiting for our food, I watched a roach, yes roach, la cucaracha, crawl on the wall under the counter bar where you can sit. He cruised all around there. Several in our party were somewhat grossed out. Still waiting on our food, a second person in our party notices another one on the floor under the table (booth) adjacent to us where a nice family of 5 were sitting. We did not want to start a panic and said nothing. Ok, this is getting a bit freaky. Then, just before our food came, the more squeamish in our group of us male outdoorsmen, sees a third one behind me, crawling up the wall. That did it. Several told the waiter to return the food to the kitchen and get the manager while the others 2 ate with reluctance.    Bottom line, if you want a marginal meal served in a piss poor manner in a smelly environment, with a triple side of roaches, you got to try this place. By the way,  we were compt our meal and tipped our server a little something but this place has lost what amounts to or will amount to 50 patrons. adios la cucarachas!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, like a real 50's diner. The jukeboxes on the tables are just for show, don't work, would have been nice if they did. The raspberrry ice tea and strawberry lemonade were great, real flavor. We ordered chicken noodle soup which was good, but skimpy on the chicken. $3 for a super small cup. The pot roast was good, again, skimped on the meat. The corn beef sandwich had great flavor, but again was very skimpy on the meat. Service was great, but the portions could have been better."}
{"text":"I ordered the big texan. The texan was basically a hamburger and bacon on toast. But dont get me wrong, it was still delicious ! The food was falling out from the toast seeing as how they cut the sandwich in half. Overall, my girlfriend and i enjoyed the food and service! I would reccomend this to my family, and will more than likely become a regular here !"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30 last night. Doors were locked, lights on.  Sign said they close at midnight. I thought if you closed at midnight, then you lock the doors at midnight. We took our business across the street to Dennys."}
{"text":"Cons  - Turkey burger tasted like reheated frozen food.  - Environment is very corporate: not family run so it doesn't feel authentic. They have their own credit card so it takes away from the illusion you're trying to experience - Food is kind of expensive considering the quality of it.  You are not coming to this place for amazing food, you come for the atmosphere and IMO, it falls short on delivering that. The staff have setting attire, but they don't act like it, they're just here for the pay check, and maybe that's too much to ask but this really is all about the experience.   Probably not worth traveling specifically to visit this place. Do stop by if you're getting your car fixed at the local Toyota dealer though and want to eat somewhere a little different."}
{"text":"Knowing this was a casual cheap diner, we didn't expect 5 stars.  BUT ... there's a certain level of service all establishments should meet and unfortunately this place missed the mark.  We arrived at 10 pm on a Saturday.  While our server was sweet, the service was horrible and our food was cold which didn't make sense because there was hardly anyone in there.  She forgot the ranch for our fried pickles, refills on water, silverware, and the check.  We will not be back and suggest hitting up the Denny's across the street."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a few years and I recently decided to give the burger another shot as the first one was so horrible (it was 2 a.m.) I swore it off for good ,well I should of stayed away from the burger it was raw and I ordered it medium well I didn't notice that it was undercooked as I was distracted by our nine year old but when I did notice it I almost threw up and I wish I would of because it's now the following morning and I'm sick as can be and have been on the toilet many many times ,needless to say this places service and food have been on a steady decline and it's too bad we live within walking distance but I'm not into getting sick from their food or the poor service they have had over the last three years . Our daughter recently had the fried pickles and was throwing up all night and I was pretty sick then too. So I'm no longer going to be frequenting this establishment as the food sucks along with most of the service !!!! .........Update, It's been a year and we decided to give this place another try because it's right here in our neighborhood,....after waiting over 35 minutes with no apologies we still didn't have our food and the people around us that were  there before us also didn't have their food, we quickly realized it was going to be over 45 minutes minimum to see our food so we dropped 5 dollars on the table and moved on our way to another local business where our food was on the table at 10 minutes and they were way more busy than this place ever will be needles to say I will not be returning here ever I've been screwed over too many times and I'm actually done with this location as it will more than likely be closed within another year !!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. If you can over look the disgust of filthy. I did not want to touch any of the condiments. They need to take a day and do deep cleaning. The waitress I had acted as if I was bothering her. Too bad. Could be a top contender."}
{"text":"Do Yourself a favor  Do not eat here   The convenience of the location cannot overcome the consistently disappointing food  I order Breakfast  Not a difficult task   More than they can handle"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is great and the servers and service are excellent. I have taken my family there several times and even with a large group the service is quick and friendly.  Have never gotten a bad meal there and always leave very happy."}
{"text":"I've been eating here twice a week for years, because it's one of the few places around where you can still get liver & onions.  And I really like the atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"This place is so dang good. The atmosphere it provides is a cool, late-night dinner with friends. The food is incredible especially for the price. I love how it is a restaurant basically in the middle of a suburb. I recommend this place to all my friends bet place to go for chicken and biscuits."}
{"text":"Now that's more like I remember.. I ordered the philly cheesesteak and fries today. It was juicy and flavor filled, they didn't skimp on the grilled peppers and onions. My plate was overflowing with food between the sandwich and the fries. And unlike other places, when I requested a LG ranch dressing, that's exactly what I got .. without an extra charge. The service was excellent.. quick and friendly.. Overall.. it was a very good lunch and I will be back.."}
{"text":"Always consistent food. The waitresses are always friendly and right on top of things."}
{"text":"Had some high hopes for this one. Charming 50's diner decor meets breakfast/burger place with killer shakes?! C'mon, what's there not to want? Well, my wife and I just left disappointed. We probably won't be coming back here again.   We got greeted by the waitstaff immediately, friendly with smiles (the reason they aren't getting a 1 star rating), and got seated right away. We were told the specials that evening and our waiter came shortly thereafter. We were never given silverware, we had to ask for them. Next, they got my order wrong. Instead of onion rings they gave me fries. Still not a big deal, but getting a little irritated. Then my wife only took one bite of her burger and couldn't finish it. The sauce on it was horrible she said. The bacon on it was also unappetizing to say the least. The only redeeming quality of this place was the shake. My chicken sandwich wasn't anything to write home about, but edible.   Finally as we are trying to wait patiently for the check, they buss boy and our waiter were right behind us cleaning up the table across from us and were throwing the plates and cups into their cart, seriously without a care in the world that they were making super annoyingly loud sounds right in our ears. Get real, how would you like it if I threw some plates and mugs around right next to your ear and hope you enjoy your dining experience.   The waiter kind of knew what was up when he saw she didn't finish and barely touched her plate. He assumed we wanted boxes for the once bitten burger and we politely declined. The only saving grace of this place was the shake.   Like I said before, we probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love to eat here. Staff is great, food is excellent. Best place to have a burger. Very family friendly. Go here to eat a minimum of 3 times a month. Pebble's is a hoot."}
{"text":"We only ate here once and that was enough. The food is horrible. The staff including the manager are very rude and the entire establishment was filthy. Our table and seats were so sticky. Our food was super salty. My food was wrong twice until I simply gave up and went without. The wait was very long (almost an hour) and even my kids were not pleased. We will never go back."}
{"text":"A very fun little spot, open 24 hours. 5 & Diner is a 1950's style diner, complete with juke boxes at the booths and hula hoops on the patio. The menu is basic, but isn't that what it should be if you're going to fully embrace the fifties? The food is not always spectacular, but it's usually more than solid enough given the restaurant's other merits. Just think. You can have breakfast at midnight and ice cream for breakfast if you'd like. I'm not recommending it. Just saying.   The restaurant is very kid friendly (paper hats and crayons). I can't imagine a child who would not enjoy sitting up at the counter. The patio is also dog friendly (water and biscuits)."}
{"text":"OK: what happened?  Several of us stopped by this 5 & Diner location (Arizona Mills) around 7 PM today (11-10-2012) and they are CLOSED!  There was a handwritten sign on the front door stating in essence 'we're closed and thanks for the memories'. I'm guessing Val threw in the towel. :(  I'd give this store 4 stars since I've eaten here in the past but the sudden and unannounced closure earned it a single one."}
{"text":"This 50s diner is easily my favourite breakfast spot in the area. I can't really speak about the non-breakfast offerings, as I always get breakfast here.  Totally reasonable prices, and good food."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday after buying a \"Now\" deal via Groupon. I got $20 groupon for $10. I went with three kids and found that the groupon is not worth buying UNLESS its just two people going. For example, the groupon is not valid for their \"kids eat for 99 cents with each paying adult\". Not to mention the food is over priced for the quality as well! Also, the have All-you-can-eat fish Fridays for roughly $10 but we couldn't get this because we had a groupon. The waitresses there are VERY rude. I told her I was waiting for the groupon to load and it would only be a second be cause we were not expecting to come and her response was \"so do you want a seat or what?\" the place was not that busy for her to be so rude...anyhow, I never complained and eventually after being sitted the waiters kept walking by like we didn't exist until the supervisor (I believed him to be) came over and took our order and he was nice. The environment and the way they treat their customers is rude over all and I've been there 3 times over the last 2 years. The fried pickles were barely battered this time so my kids didn't enjoy them as much.....Oh and don't ask the wrong person for help because they will tell you that they are not in charge of your table and will walk away."}
{"text":"I love this place! I just had the Swiss mushroom burger and it was the best burger I've had in a long time! Service was terrific, food great and clean as a whistle!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. 5 stars on every point! 2 eggs and bacon, hash browns and English muffin all just the way I ordered them. Have only had breakfast here but everytime it was good!"}
{"text":"The service tonight was awful, the diner was filthy. The food was bad. It was supposed to be a birthday celebration. The waitress sat us down, took drink order and disappeared. She at first had an attitude told my guests. There were flies swarming around our table and the floors were dirty. I've been here before but will never go back."}
{"text":"Oh 5 & Diner.  We used to live in the neighborhood so we ate here a lot.  Not so much now, it was just really convenient.   They do have great shakes and I always loved my biscuit with honey on the weekend mornings.   I also like that it was open 24 hours and that the juke box has my two favorite oldies songs!"}
{"text":"Second time here and I love the food, it's nice and cozy the music is always playing by the tables keeps it original old school.."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and without hesitation I can say will be my last. We got there just before 1pm, were seated right away but then it took about 20 minutes before our order was even taken. We were missing parts of our order, and some of our food didn't even match what the menu described. This place has the potential to be a nice little diner but just didn't happen on our visit. As we looked around we could see other customers looking annoyed by the long wait as well.  Dennys is across the street, just fyi."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding.  We stopped by on our way out of town with our dog so we decided to sit outside even though it was 90 degrees out.  The waitress made repeated trip out to our table to ensure we had everything we needed.  (We were the only ones outside)  This was our second time here and both times were we very, very satisfied."}
{"text":"Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment. Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Slow. Undercooked. Cold.   The food took way too long to come out. When it finally did, the burgers were undercooked, the fries were cold, and generally the food was disgusting. Also, head back to the restrooms near the kitchen. The strench coming from the kitchen of rancid grease is overwhelming."}
{"text":"Two people coast 50.00 . The food was cheap in taste. The milkshakes were 90% milk and 10% ice cream. The jukebox took the coins but don't work.   Please if you know what's good for you. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"our server could balance 3 drinks on one hand while wearing a brace and this alone i would have given this place 10/5 but if you had to consider food and customer service i guess i would say 3/5"}
{"text":"The food quality is just above Denny's IMO.  The burgers are cooked to order, so that's a nice touch.  And the onion rings are awesome.  So are the milk shakes.  Ambiance won the 4th star - very retro diner.  Wait staff was oustanding also, careful to keep our sodas topped off and quick to get us what we needed.  And, yes, for a Sunday morning, the joint was beyond busy.  A little on the pricey side for a family of 5 plus 1 visitor; the $4 milkshakes didn't help with that at all.  We'd consider visiting again, if only because they're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast place eaten there three times lately all great experiences. If you like biscuits and gravy try theirs. Online deals available but prices low anyway. Tucked in between the Superstition mall and Southern Ave."}
{"text":"People with long legs, please avoid this place- the seating is extremely cramped, hubby and I couldn't face each other and sit without getting uncomfortable with our legs.  I love their 50's diner theme and everytime I go there I seriously look for something interesting on the menu but to my dismay I've never had one thing that stands out to me. Their waitresses are perky but the less-than-average food for breakfast can make you feel queasy for the rest of the day.  For those who still wish to go there in spite of my review, I'd sincerely suggest that you avoid the waffles and the coffee."}
{"text":"I have ate at 5 & diner a few times, last year. Those few times I had great service and everything was served right but today,  I bought a patty melt with chili cheese fries. When I was eating it, in the middle of my sandwich I found a piece of hair strain sticking out of my patty. I felt sick and disgusted afterwards. I thought our server would give my meal for free but my boyfriend still had to pay for it. She made me another batch of the same meal I got but I chose to throw it away outside.. I don't deserve to be the only one with bad service, she didn't ask me what I wanted to eat when she was taking everyone order."}
{"text":"So me and my husband came in last night, it was pretty busy. It was pretty much the only thing open at 10 pm other than fast food, so we decided WTH why not. I had first ate here about maybe 3-4 years ago ? It was suuper good, so I was excited telling my husband this place is delishh!   We got seated, I ordered the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and he ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. It took over 30 mins to get our food. Which we didn't mind that much (mind you we are starving !!! ), the music jukebox kept us pretty entertained and the awesome décor.    CONS: The food was horrible! The menu states 'nothing is refrigerated and everything is fresh', which I for sure don't believe. The chicken looked fake as hell, almost like the big pieces of fish they give you at Pete's Fish & Chips. Or the frozen cheap versions you can buy at Wal Mart. Ugh, it was so disgusting, just the thought of it makes me nauseous.  IDK if they have new ownership, but the first time I came and ate there, I got the same thing and it was so so good I had to order it again. I wouldn't have came back if it was that bad.  The Philly CS was pretty gross too. It tasted like cardboard.  I mean for 28-30$ you would expect you are going to eat some great a** food. NOPE not that case at all ! I was so bummed, we would of been better off going to Jacks or Wendys.   PROS: Customer Service. Which is everything to me, other than what you are paying for. Everybody was extremely and genuinely nice. That is the ONLY reason I give 2 stars, because of the wait staff. Sucks but I wont be coming back here :("}
{"text":"To Kevin ~ the \"manager\" at the 5&Diner on 16th ST  If it is raw dough, it is NOT a crust.  Home made means made on premises.  Home made  means made from scratch.  Home made is not shipped in frozen and  then baked.  Kevin, you are a rude, unde reducated and clueless fellow who is lacking in public relations.  You are dishonest and you instruct your wait staff to lie.  We asked if the chicken pot pie was made right there.  We were told yes.  Then later we were told it was shipped in frozen.    You had the temerity to parse words with me in a close to violent way.     I love the 5 & Diner.....especially their Eggs Benedict.  I have been going there for close to 20  years     Apparently it is now in decline."}
{"text":"Not even remotely worth the price. Food was expensive and mediocre at best. 3/3 people were unhappy. Waitress was nice but I would never go back and I'm not hard to please."}
{"text":"Ask for Autumn !!!! Amazing server! Smiling , friendly happy to at her job and it shows . She made my day . Thanks Autumn , because of you we will be back ."}
{"text":"Please don't eat behind the counter.  So unappealing.   Breakfast for dinner was good."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a place to go to 24 hours a day and this is just the place. Our waitress was fast, super friendly and keep us well informed of what was Hot! and Not! in Phoenix, Arizona. After ordering my scrambled eggs, meats, toast and great tasting coffee I then strolled over to play some tunes on the jukebox. Even the price of our breakfast was quite reasonable I would definitely recommend this place to everyone back home."}
{"text":"50s style diner, great food. I always get their chicken and waffles, perfect PMS dish, my mouth always starts watering when I think of it. so freakin good!   Their chicken fried steak and gravy is really good too. Can't wait to go back, I'm already getting cravings."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here right now enjoying my country fried chicken! Its really yummy. The gravy is also very tasty. This vanilla mr. Pibb is vanilla as vanilla can be. Im all around pleased. The service is good, food is good and the ambiance hits the diner feel spot on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch..... was not disappointed! Love the 50s theme! The food was terrific, HUGE portions! You cant leave here hungry!! As some of the others have posted, gotta be the best shakes in town! Jenna took great care of us!"}
{"text":"I've only been there at lunch time and it takes forever to get a seat, but the food is good.  The waitresses look like they have more work and tables than they should have and are always 'hurried'.    Darn good BLTs though!"}
{"text":"Food was average service was pleasant. Place was clean and food was good. Had issues with card reader and took a long time to process. Next day noticed several charges for different amounts. Called in to straighten out and manager/owner was going to call back...no call. Next day eve this time evening manager says the manager/owner will call later after they check the tickets. Gave him all the data incl ticket info and tracking details. No call. Wrote concern to corporate and web. No call and no return. After 1 week charges did get resolved on bank statement. Still no contact.  These things happen and I do not believe it was intentional. I would have expected some kind of personal contact. Not going to visit this location or any others due to the way this situation was handled by local and corporate. My repeat business is unimportant and the only effort for any resolve was simply to answer my banks investigation.  See ya!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for breakfast on a Monday morning while my husband and I waited for the tires on the truck to be changed next door.  We LOVED the atmosphere and the folks working there. They were friendly and prompt in serving us and following up to ensure everything was ok.  The food was great, but not excellent.  They have tiny little jukeboxes on the tables, but we lost a quarter on ours thinking that it worked. Well, it took the coin and allowed for selection, but our songs never came on...  Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed coming to this location for years now.  As mentioned in other reviews, the owner, Lee, is exceptional and makes sure his establishment provides exceptional service.  Today , one of my dogs, Timmy, turned 7 and we thought it would be fun to take him and his buddy, Eddy, along for dinner.  A restaurant I'd been told was welcoming to dogs had closed recently.  On a whim, I called the 5 & Diner to ask if dogs were allowed in the patio area.  The woman who answered the phone, Ruth, enthusiastically answered that dogs were not just allowed, they were welcomed!   The waitress brought out to go containers and a pitcher of water for the dogs, served us our dinners, then brought out a birthday dessert for the dogs, complete with a candle and a wonderful rendition of the Happy Birthday song!!  We'll certainly be back on the other dog's birthday for another party!!"}
{"text":"The decor is great. There are little jukeboxes at every table. The service is good. But the menu is a little too Denny's-like for my taste. There is a good selection of burgers and breakfast items, but nothing terribly unique or too reminisent of a 50's style diner. A bit pricey too. Overall I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"What a throw back to the 50's! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner always avail 24 hours a day. I like this place very much. The decor takes you back to the 50's with its table top jukeboxes.  The menu is large anything from breakfast to salads, burgers, and good chicken fried steak. You can also try one of their old fashion milk shakes. The service is always good never had a bad day here. They have whatever you want anytime of day you would like it. If you happen to be their in the morning ask for becky. She always singing a tune."}
{"text":"A nice diner; better than Denny's. Can't go wrong. Good service service."}
{"text":"Great '50s retro with food to match.  Servings were large for the price.  Service was superb (I wish I could remember her name).  I ordered the cherry coke and it knocked my socks off.  It was so real '50's, like I remember.  They didn't hold back on the real cherry syrup.  I also think they use Coke made with real sugar.  I will have to ask next time.   My wife had the Valentine's shake which she said was great.  Real vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and that cherry syrup.  It also had about 1/2 dozen cherries in it.  We split the BLT club sandwich and that, with the mound of very crisp fries, filled both of us up.  Don't miss this diner!  (PS I rarely ever give 5 stars.)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the  breakfasts there the biscuits and gravy are great! Easy to get in and get a good table during the week."}
{"text":"Not my first time here, definitely my last.  After clear request for hard eggs in benedict, 15 minutes goes by, eggs come out hard, but wrong benedict. PLEASE, just quickly scrape out beef and replace with fish, another 15 minutes goes by and monstrosity arrives. Clearly they re-did the muffin and fish, but same (now cold) hash browns, hollandaise (topped with a bit of new), same eggs (also cold). Complain, manager (hispanic lady) says, 'sorry, we tried'. I say the plate is an embarrasment, if you were going to take 15 minutes, you could have at least re-made whole plate. She insists they did, I ask how they managed to cut her hard eggs just like she did, layer new holly over old stuff, she insists they remade it.  Restaurants screw up. Turns out waitress entered wrong model of benny, despite pleading with her to be careful. The mistake is sloppily fixed, but takes 15 minutes and they can't bother to replace 75 cents worth of hash browns and eggs.   Complain to the manager, all you get is a defiant 'sorry, we tried', and absolute BS they \"remade it all\". No discount, no nothing. They did correct the price of the wrong dish choice. Big deal.  5 and Diner is a diner, I don't expect 5 stars. But I don't like being lied to, particularly when the evidence is so obvious.  I've been to PV Mall location as well, same cheerful staff, same cooks who don't seem to give a crap.   At best, hit and miss. I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Place is solid - what you'd expect a diner to be. Food is fast and good. Bathroom needs more periodic cleaning."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tenders and cheese sticks to go at 11:30. By 12:05 I could see my Togo order sitting in boxes waiting to be bagged. At 12:10 I asked about getting my order, the waiter then said that it just came up. At that point I asked the other server if I could please get my Togo order, she said yes and walked away. Another 5 minutes went by when the waiter finally got around to bagging my food. At 12:20 he finally brought me my food. It now was cold, and my lunch hour was over."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was old timey. Food was tasteless which is great for people that were born in the early 1900's. If you don't mind hearing all the old people talking loud cause they didn't turn their hearing aides up. Service was mediocre. I would not recommend it to anybody that like flavor in their food and likes a little peace and quiet while they eat"}
{"text":"Overall a very adorable and nostalgic experience down the cherry red booths and checkered floors, brings you right back to the olden days. I've been twice now, both times later in the evenings, (around 10 or 11pm.) Both times the place has been hopping, I was lucky enough to get one of the final seats in the place before a waiting line was established.   First time I ordered breakfast, just your standard eggs, bacon, hash browns and a pancake. On the menu it's called the \"Hungry Diner.\" I asked for my hash towns extra crispy which they were, bacon was also the perfect blend of crispy and chewy, and they didn't skimp which was a plus. Overall way better than Denny's which has sadly been my go to for a lazy breakfast that I don't feel like cooking myself since I moved from Chicago...and away from my precious Delia's.   Second trip I decided to see if their dinner options were up to snuff, I ordered the open face roast beef with mashed potatoes. Roast beef was sliced thin and tender, gravy was a little gloppy and overly salty but it was still very homey, comfort food so I didn't mind all that much. My main complaint was the mashed potatoes, they tasted funny and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. Had the apple pie for dessert, filling was tart and delicious, crust was just ok.   Overall the service was fairly positive, they really seemed to be a little overwhelmed both times I went so you can't really fault them for not winning any attentive awards but my drinks were always kept full and I received my food in a timely manner so props for that.   Would definitely go back, and next time I'm eyeing the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick breakfast and 5&Diner did NOT disappoint!!! Their full menu is offered all day. The restaurant was 50's themed even the waiters were in costume!!! I ordered the waffle combo and orange juice. It was delivered very fast. It was delicious especially the bacon!!! The waiters were nice and immediately answered my requests . I live in California and I will DEFINITELY be coming back for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed.  Service was INCREDIBLY slow.  We were using a Groupon.  I would have been terribly upset without it.  Food was ok, but I think that was mostly because we were starving.  No apologies for lack of service.  No smile.  No return once food was served.  Won't be eating here again.  They automatically added 18% tip for party of 6, definitely not earned.  I normally tip minimum 20%, not here.  Not this day anyway."}
{"text":"Ruben sandwich was boring. Very light on meat. Chicken pot pie was very good. Nice flaky homemade crust. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food and a great atmosphere.  We went on a Saturday night and they had a balloon artist who made all sorts of great creations for the kids, even a balloon rainbow! The staff seemed a little overwhelmed, but they were very polite. The milkshakes are excellent and you can choose from many flavors (the peanut butter was awesome)."}
{"text":"Terrible in that my overpriced grilled cheese had 2 small pieces of cheese.  The bread was showing in many places and it would not even stay together with the melted cheese!!  When I spoke to the manager she said she would have to tell the cooperate chef??  She offered to make me another one but I was not interested.  I told her that I felt like we had been short changed on it and she just said she was sorry.  The senior menu had it with ham for $5.99 - I told the waiter that I just wanted the regular grilled cheese and he said ok.  On the bill it was $6.99!!! for two pieces of bread and 2 small pieces of cheese! ... We will not return!!"}
{"text":"Always am waited on right away and the food comes out fast. This place is ALWAYS open, so I give them props. I even came here and ate at 5am when I couldnt sleep and the servers were not grumpy at all like at other places. Decent food, cute atmosphere. They sometimes show old movies on a projector screen in the parking lot and you can bring your dog if you eat outside."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, reasonable prices, fast service, hot coffee and good food. What else could you want? I ordered the eggs Benedict. Def recommend if you like that kind of stuff."}
{"text":"Great little diner, with food for all ages.  First stopped there several months ago while out shopping. . It really reminds me of some of the diners of my youth. Had a great lunch, and the prices were not bad.  Several months is a long time ago when you are my age, so I really don't remember what we had, but I do remember it was good, and the price was reasonable.  Then my golfing buddies and I were driving by, and looking for a place for breakfast, and we stopped.  The had Senior prices (which my buddies qualified for) and they were hooked.  The breakfast was good, and of course, I tested everbody's plates.  The only thing that I thought was below par was the sausage.  Bacon, pancakes, waffles and eggs were great, and the service was excellent.    One of the things I look for at breakfast is potatoes - hash browns, potatoes O'Brien, whatever.  I was disappointed here as they only had frozen hash browns, and the gravy they had was not even average.  This cost it 2 stars in my opinion, as one of the things that makes a diner a \"diner\" are great potatoes, no matter how they are cooked.  I should say though that on the last day my buddies were here, they wanted to go back to the diner for breakfast, and this was over several places that had better yelp ratings.  And they bring it up every time I talk with them, so maybe I should have rated it a little higher."}
{"text":"I mean, it beats sitting at Denny's at 2am.   The food is okay. I usually get the club sandwich with plenty of leftovers for the next day (which is rare because I CAN EAT). Service is hit or miss depending on who your server is. I think the only reason I keep coming back to this place is because the ambiance is cute and it's right by my house."}
{"text":"All 5 & Diners are not equal. This location is one of my favorites--they just seem to go the extra mile. It doesn't matter what time of day I stop in...middle of a weekday, after midnight on a weekend...the place is friendly and busy. There is another closer to my house, but this location wins my heart every time. Another bonus? Their table side jukeboxes actually work.   Our most recent visit  was for post-fireworks dessert. We finally tried the new menu. The Waffle Wonder was a hit. Half a waffle (by the way this location's waffles are superior to all others) covered in cinnamon sugar, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and caramel. It tasted like a supercharged churro. So yummy. My friend got the Diner Split which might seem run-of-the-mill, but it had a large scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream, with all the requisite sauces plus a deep fried banana. Yep, you heard right, deep-fried freakin' banana. I had a chocolate malted and could not have been happier.  Next time you need a great way to cap off a late downtown night, check this place out."}
{"text":"I saw this place driving around looking for food. I was looking for something local. I like the whole ambiance. The diner reminds me of a place back home on the easy coast.  After reading several Yelp reviews, I have to admit that I was hesitant. When I walked in I was greeted by a lovely girl in a pretty dress and smile. She seated us very quickly. Shortly after our waiter, Hannah came over and took our order for drinks. She was very pleasant and had just a big smile. Our waitress checked on us several times and was always nice. She even stopped and had a conversation and laugh with us. Hannah was awesome as our waitress. Hannah is great. We really got lucky.  The food came out very quickly. It was delivered on a warm plate and was very good. I didn't think that my burger was going to be cooked corectly the first time, but it was. The staff seem to enjoy their shift, everyone was laughing and chatting with each other. This is how an establishment is ran. The music was great and the atmosphere was definitely inviting.  This place really made a great impression on me. I Will definitely come back whenever I am in the area again.  All I can say is.. thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Fun environment... Great vibe with the 50's car hop diner.....  That's where the fun stops... Our waitress had no personality. Clearly looked overwhelmed.     An order of chicken tenders, a tuna melt and an omlet took 40 minutes to come out.  Not to mention the fact that there were only 3 tables seated when we walked in.    The prices shocked me .. Pretty pricey for a diner.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible. Server was nowhere near customer service oriented and I don't remember a single time she smiled at us. I'm a server myself and if I worked alongside her, I would've told her the job is not for her and to just quit. In earshot of us, she openly complained about not receiving a gratuity tip from a recent table. (Not surprised).   Most of our time in this restaurant was just above unpleasant. We were all shivering cold for most of our meal and the waitress didn't have a second thought about it. To our surprise her co worker John noticed immediately and turned down the A/C for us rather than our server caring about it.   I know I shouldn't expect much of a burger from a 24hr diner but the outside of my burger just tasted like straight burnt meat. The inside was cooked fine but the outside taste was horrid.   I tried to finish what I could with my meal and was wishing to order a dessert along with my company. After our server finally appeared after so long, my company seated closest to her was able to fit in a second to ask for a shake. After taking the order for the shake, I kid you not, she immediately turned around to go make the shake rather than to spend anymore time at the table to take any other dessert orders or take any requests. I had to wait until the shake was fully made and she had returned to order my dessert.   Yes, I should have just closed out my ticket right then and there but midnight dessert was why we were even there. Ordered my dessert and finished. My company and I paid our tickets and left mediocre tips. Am not interested in  going back soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service and greasy food.  No one waited on us until we had been sitting for 20 minutes.  Then we ordered an appetizer and never got it."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had and we were the only people in there! Chicken was burnt and had to scream at the waitress to ask her to fix it!!!! Could not pay me to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and each time I ordered THE BEST HOT DOG I'VE EVER HAD!  It's called the FRANCHEESE. What is the \"Francheese,\" you ask? Well, it's a simple hot dog injected with cheese, topped with cheese, and served on a toasted bun. Simple enough, yes? Seriously, it's delicious!  Along side that, I also ordered a side of a newly discovered favorite of mine (which I initially discovered here my first time): Wet Fries. What are \"wet fries,\" you ask?  Wet fries are french fries topped with a brown gravy. Most people thing \"Ew, that's gross,\" but think about it for a minute. What are french fries? Mashed potatoes. What typically goes on mashed potatoes? Gravy! It's perfect enough to work, right? (Just as my similarly strange love for ketchup chips) Well, it's an east coast thing, or so I hear (though I had trouble finding it most of the places I went on the east coast).  Regardless, the two items I've listed above made for an incredibly excellent meal the few times I got to order it.  Now, why on earth would I give a 3 stars on one of my top favorite meals? Because I went back a few months ago (Mind you, I live 6 hours away from the nearest 5&Diner) and they had entirely REMOVED the Francheese from their menu and it's not just this franchise, it was all of them that I contacted. They all got rid of their cheese injection machine and now my favorite dog is nowhere to be found.  5&Diner has potential to be a five star restaurant if they would only just bring back the Francheese [Please!]  That aside, they still carry the delicious \"wet fries.\" They also have delicious ice in their drinks (I like ice that has more air bubbles in them because it just break really easily in your mouth. Give it a shot, great ice.  The service is okay. They don't come by all the time to fill up your drink, unfortunately, and sometimes they let you sit for too long waiting to order or for a bill, but I'm never in a rush because I typically go there passed midnight.  And, best of all, most of them are open 24 hours and they have a pretty sweet diner theme with juke boxes and all the works.  If you could all help me, maybe we can coerce them into bringing back the Francheese. Haha. That'd definitely help me change my review back to a 5-star."}
{"text":"The food is great, but it takes FOREVER to get your food. Been there a few times and the staff is friendly, but doesn't check on you throughout the meal and you end up sitting there with an empty cup and done eating and no check."}
{"text":"Their web page brags that they deliver, \"Food comes to you.\"  NOT!  Called to order dinners for my elderly live-in Aunt and Uncle.  Was rather rudely told they don't deliver.  Have no idea how the food is but customer service sucks."}
{"text":"LOVE 5 & Diner. Especially this one! Great food, staff, and atmosphere. They were very accommodating when we had a group of 15 for my Daughters birthday. Looking foward to going back!"}
{"text":"Late night fast fresh hot food!  Service was awesome especially for 2am and the place was fairly busy too!  Food portions are generous and tastes great!  I wish the jukebox at my table had been working as I would have enjoyed a blast into the past, some songs I hadn't heard since listening with my mother and her oldies."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here, the service so bad that I walked out. So here's my attempt to see if they got any better:  FOOD: A-OK. Nothing special, but certainly not bad at all. I could see the kitchen from my booth, and let me tell you: The guys scrambling around in the tiny cook/prep area are cranking out the food! They move around like a blur. I rarely see such productivity any more. Thumbs up to the kitchen staff; you guys rock it out!   SERVICE: Barely courteous. I think our server made eye contact once. The server was quick and attentive, which is probably more than you can expect, especially for a place like this. I will say this: The servers at this location take a lot of crap from the customers. I see and hear them too. In our server's defense we did arrive just as the Sunday church crowd was abating. I know how AWFUL the church crowd are. And I know they are usually terrible tippers. Our waiter was probably worn out by the time we got there.   Will we be back? Maybe. I'm still in love with The Stand. But 5 & Diner isn't all that bad. We'll see."}
{"text":"I  have been here numerous time and never disappointed. The burgers are the best thing on the menu, which isn't to say that anything else is bad I just have a love for burgers. The shakes and malts are  wonderful and I loved the service, the dresses and attitudes of the women that work there are HOT in that 1950's natural woman way. Well done, well done."}
{"text":"Truly an amazing restaurant.  It's fun, embraces the 50's.  From the classic music to the poodle skirts and the weekly car shows this place has it all.  The food is not only delicious upon first glance and bit but it is timely.  With seating indoors and out there is always room for patrons to sit.I'm so impressed with my first time experience here, this may just become my weekly breakfast joint.  Now if only they had greasers out here it really would be a blast from the past."}
{"text":"This diner operates like a finely tuned machine. Expect it to be crowded on the weekends, however, that does not compromise the service. The kitchen moves fast and we have never had to wait  a long time.   The breakfast is great. I typically order an eggs Benedict. My girlfriend orders the omelette which appear to be over stuffed with the selected ingredients. Coffee refills come around often. We are always greeted at the door and someone always says goodbye before we leave.   I highly recommend this diner for its efficiency, good breakfast and customer service."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to write home about. It is about as good as Denny's.  Fries are not so great. Burger was ok."}
{"text":"Fulfills expectation of a diner. The reuben sandwich was pretty good. Onions rings were a little lukewarm but the fries were very fresh, hot and delicious. For a small kitchen, they really cranked out the food fast and the service was not bad."}
{"text":"It took some time to get what we ordered, but it was during the car show that's here every saturday, and the front patio was packed. So kitchen was backed up. Waiter let us know what was going on. Fun ambiance."}
{"text":"Service was great. It seems like everything was marinated in oil then deep fried. Kinda turned my stomach. Then topping it all off with a chocolate and strawberry shake wasn't the smartest idea. I like how the waitresses dress in their cute 60's dresses and that the diner is in one big RV. I guess that made up for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"Here is an A-ok place to eat with the puppy. They usually bring water for the dog and have just fine food. You can sit as long as you want and they bring more coffee."}
{"text":"Visited this place with a friend. i used a entertainment coupon for buy one menu item with two drinks and get 1 menu item free. I got the Guacamole Burger with fries. $9.99... The burger tasted much better than the Carl's Jr. Guacamole burger.   The female servers looked good in their 50's style dresses. very hot looking. :)   Fast service and good food. Try this restaurant, you will enjoy the food and the view of the female servers. lol"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. From 16th street to Tatum to 27th avenue. One thing that they all all do the same is the \"Parisian\" omelette. Tasty and fast."}
{"text":"We dine here often, and are NEVER disappointed in the food. Their breakfasts are hands down the best of any neighboring typical breakfast place.  Their burgers are fresh, juicy & made to order, fries, onion rings, always generous portions. The servers are all very good, fast, attentive and friendly.  Over the years we've eaten probably most items on the menu, we've never walked out hungry or dissatisfied.  Would HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and every time regardless if they are busy or not the service is impeccable. The servers are friendly, professional and always helpful. The 50s ambiance along with the top notch food is perfect for all parties. I frequently come here with quite a few of my friends after GCU basketball games and eat on the large patio. I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for some good quality food and a relaxing and friendly environment with world class customer service!"}
{"text":"Breakfast. Go for Breakfast! -choose one of the innocuous seeming egg and potatoes breakfasts, w/ biscuits and a side order of gravy.  It's $6.75, and you may think it will all fit on one plate. However, you'll quickly note that there's twice as many hash-browns as anywhere else, and the food is incredibly fresh. Everything home-style. There's no way you'll finish it or find a place that tops.  ...service and coffee is great too."}
{"text":"Completely blown away by the service and speed of said service.  Traveling from California to mesa and stopped here for breakfast.  At first I was a little put out by how prompted our server was to take our order. I then realized the pace at which this dinner operates. Food came out rather quickly and correct which usually doesn't happen with a party of 6. Valerie, our server not only was on top of all of our needs, but had all the orders right! The food was cooked just right, which again hardly ever happens with 4 kids and a picky wife.  The rushed atmosphere quickly faded as our food was served. Valerie again checked back with us making sure we were satisfied, but never in a rushed sence. All in all, i will for sure be dinning here again in all my travels to mesa.  Great job Valerie!"}
{"text":"Great food. Breakfast all day. I highly recommend this place. Versatile menu. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"cute 50 's diner - fun to eat at and friendly staff"}
{"text":"When I visit Phoenix, this is the best place for burgers and fries.  They do some unique soda flavors.  I love their Vanilla-Cherry Coke.  Breakfast is good too, but I am not much of a breakfast person."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for a couple of years and drive by the diner almost daily. I decided to give it a try, so I ordered the fish and chips with a side salad through GrubHub. The fish was crispy around the edges, but mushy inside. It was also very greasy. On top of that, the fries were cold and hard. The salad had three cucumber slices and a couple of tomatoes. If I ever decide to give this place a second chance, I will probably only go there for breakfast food. The only reason that I am giving them two stars is because my order was delivered rather quickly."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed coming here. Would recommend for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Burgers are good. Omeletts are great! Price is always reasonable and the kids have fun."}
{"text":"Came here for a milkshake.  Walked in and they were closed. However, because we just wanted a shake for a late night snack, they welcomed us in for the last order of the night. Our waitress was okay; when we asked her what shake she would recommend, she looked at us like we were stupid and said really diva-y \"uh, chocolate.\" We all looked at each other like\"wow...did she just do that?\" It was kinda funny. Finally, we all ordered milkshakes (of course, not chocolate). I ordered Strawberry, just to be safe. It was very bland. I can barely taste the strawberries in the shake even though it had strawberry chunks on the bottom. Very disappointed. One of my friends ordered an Oreo one and it was way too sweet. My other friend ordered chocolate (nvm, one of them did) with strawberry one; that was okay but I am not much of melted chocolate so I thought the chocolate was very strong and over-powered the strawberries. Anyway, the service was pretty good, she kept us with waters and didn't rush us out. It was nice.  Oh yeah! There are hula hoops outside the diner (which is awesome). That was the best part."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots in the Valley, and I am surprised by many of the negative reviews it has received. They serve great breakfast burritos and pancakes, and a wide variety of omelets. Their coffee is good enough. For lunch, they offer a wide variety of excellent sandwiches. Here's a useful bit of information for my fellow Chicagoans: 5 & Diner serves Vienna pure beef hot dogs. My personal lunch favorite, my main reason for giving them five stars, is their veggie burger, which I order with green chile, no cheese, and a side of french fries. Be sure to ask for the Cholula hot sauce. This is a great casual dining spot with a classic diner motif and golden oldies playing regularly to accompany your meal. This location, set outside of Tempe's Arizona Mills, is my favorite location."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.. Nothings changed. Without milkshakes this place is no good. Too pricey for a diner. Thought the Turkey burger may be a good choice & it shows up with no cheese :( By the time I got that fixed, everyone else at the table was almost done eating."}
{"text":"I come here with my friends almost every weekend; we've been doing this for over 3 years.  Amazing atmosphere and delicious food.  The staff are so nice!  If you can, ask for Nitzul or Ashlee to be your waitress!  They are both totally awesome people and will make your time there so much fun.  For food, I personally recommend the Hungry Diner, Love Me Tenders, and the Tuna Melt!  They also have the best fried pickles in the world!  This has been our regular weekend hangout for years now; I don't see that changing anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak and eggs for breakfast here. The taste was just average, no better than Denny's. The service was avaerage. I would return again and give something else a try here."}
{"text":"Service was lacking!! Took forever for her to take our order.  But the worst part was seeing the waitress behind the counter and lift her dress and pull her shorts down. There is a bathroom for this!! Then to not go and wash her hands GROSS"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast this week and was actually quite impressed.  Service was slower than average but the friendliness of the waitress made up for it.  I love the old nostalgic feel to the place with the coin operated juke boxes at each table and the old style diner booths for table seating.  They also have a nice patio you can sit on if the weather is right though the plastic tables and chairs could use a little upgrade.  We had an Omelet and Strawberry Waffle and both were great!"}
{"text":"If I could choose no stars for this place I would. The only thing that was decent was the waitress. She was super sweet.  First, I have never had fish and chips that was not edible. Until now that is. The grease was literally pooled on my plate. Even after soaking it up with a napkin it was swimming. I cut into it and the fish wasn't even cooked. Gross My friend ordered the pot roast. One bite and she was done. I think her words were something akin to \"dog food.\"  If this wasn't bad enough, we actually got charged for this crap. Don't waste your time with this place. I certainly won't."}
{"text":"A very nice retro, breakfast place, my children love because they give you milkshakes with the old 'tin' blender container, with the leftover shake. So you feel like your getting your monies worth.  The old photos of nostalgia (actors/actresses, and 50/60's rock stars, are always enjoyable.  Food is okay, nothing wrong with it, but your usual old time standard food I grew up enjoying.  As long as my children enjoy it, we will continue to come here.  They expanded to 3 locations, but i heard one has already closed down. Sad, but glad it wasn't the one we know best. Staff is very nice, and fit right into the theme."}
{"text":"Good place with good food. Waitress that helped us was nice actually all the employees we ran into were nice. Huge parking area. Too bad the booth we had the music player wasn't loud enough to let us hear the songs we chose. Other than that, would come back!"}
{"text":"What I take is an Arizona-based 50's-theme diner chain, the 16th St. location of 5 & Diner is bright & super clean, with the jukebox standards playing in the background. The service was friendly and attentive, with a fresh glass of lemonade each time my mine was 2/3 empty.   The downer was the food. My turkey club was standard, but the fries tasted funny. Couldn't tell if it was the oil or the potatoes or a combination of both. The fact that they were lukewarm didn't help in the matter.   Due to lactose issues I didn't try any of the shakes, which I'm assuming is their real specialty. Every other table had atleast a few - I heard someone order the Butterfinger which, obviously, is a shake blended with the candy bar.   All said & done, a decent place. I'd try it again, but maybe by ordering something else. This particular location's open 24 hours, which I'm assuming the post-bar crowd heads to at 2 am on weekends. I myself ended up here after everything else in the neighborhood (besides Denny's) had already shut down for the night."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast after picking someone up at the airport. Seated right away but took ten minutes for someone to take the order. While I waited for the food two tables sat down, waited for a waitress and left without ordering. The food was okay but the orange juice I ordered was very watered down - hardly tasted like orange juice. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Loooooove it!  super good food and vibes! Get the shroom burger and Oreo milkshake. Staff is great!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so much fun. I'm assuming the 60's theme?! I wasn't born in that era, and dont know much about it. (So don't hate)   We were welcomed as soon as we walked in, and offered a table. Our server showed up seconds later, and got our drink order. Food arrived shortly after, not sure if thats a good thing, it was a little slow, so maybe the cook was just a quick beast like that. Either way, it was a lot of fun. Food was perfectly made, I had the veggie burger, and my friends had the bacon cheeseburger. It was great food in a fun atmosphere.   Will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location few times and it was pleasant. This past weekend, we had our 4 kids and my in-laws with us and decide to stop in and have lunch. A party of 9. They end up splitting us into 2 different tables (not a problem). The hostess was very accommodating, however, when the owners/managers noticed we were a large group, the hostess and the owners/managers had a disagreement, which was very noticeable (unprofessional). Making us feel uncomfortable. We should have taken it as a sign and walked out. Everything after that was awful. Food, service, etc. By the time we got our food, it was cold. It's too bad, we use to like stopping by for a quick bite but not after this experience, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not only was the food mediocre, but the staff was slow, unknowledgeable and incompetent (although very nice, so sorry about that guys).  First of all, I have celiac or in lamens terms, I can't eat anything with gluten (wheat, oats, rye, barley) in it. So here I am at this kinda cute (kinda dumpy) diner with my boyfriend and I ask to see the allergen menu. So they come out with a packet with like 8 point font after a about a long wait, lovely. Then, our server takes about 15 minutes to ask us what we want...I ordered my meal, and substituded mashed potatoes for a side in order to keep gluten free. Just to be sure however, I asked our server if the potatoes are freshly made, she said YES.  Well, I eat one bite of mashed potatoes and minutes later I am sick. So I went to the front to ask somebody, and three of the staff members sit there and argue about wether or not the potatoes are fresh and the kitchen is literally RIGHT BEHIND THEM! Hello, just turn around and ask!  Finally, as I'm about to puke (sorry if that's TMI) one of them says \"there's our manager go ask her.\" Uh, rude. So I do and she informs me that they are in fact not freshly made, they come in a package and probably do contain wheat contrary to the gluten free menu. So of course, my boyfriend and I pack up our food really quick, I tell her they basically just poisoned me and her response was to pay at the front. Awesome. Needless to say I will not be going back there ever again.  What can I say that's positive about this place...(honeslty I'm not typically a negative person!) Well, they do look 50's, I'm sure it would be great place to take kids, and although I have a bad taste in my mouth about them not giving a crap that I just ate something I'm basically allergic to, they are friendly. So there, hope you enjoyed a small ray of sunlight in this negative review..."}
{"text":"The positives to this 50's inspired diner is that, I have never experienced a wait for a table, the prices are fair, the food comes fast, and they have a outdoor doggy patio so you can bring your pooch! There is also a breakfast bar area where you can eat by yourself without feeling like a total loser.  The food may not be the highest quality, but it sure does hit the spot when you are craving some comfort diner food or a hearty breakfast.  Tip- check groupon for deals at this place which are featured often."}
{"text":"Ah, good ol' 5 and Diner. We walked in and were greeted and seated almost immediately. To my horror we were seated by a Breeder and her 5 kids. One of the kids thought that the restaurant was her playground. She was running and screaming from the juke box back to her table. Honestly, I would have given the place a 3 if a manager had asked the lady to control her spawn. It was an accident waiting to happen and I couldn't hear what my lunch partner was talking about.   I initially went in for a big, juicy burger, but my buddy and I saw a couple breakfast platters go by and it instantly changed our minds. I ordered eggs Benedict which came with a side of hash browns. I also ordered a slice of sourdough french toast. Well after a few mix ups with having to make sourdough french toast, I finally told the waitress to just give me a slice of regular french toast. The eggs Benedict were meh, the hollandaise sauce came out of a packet, I think, but Hey I was at a 5 & Diner. The french toast was very good! Nice and crispy on the outside and warm in the middle. yum.   My pal had a giant waffle with eggs and a side of hash browns. He said that everything was perfect. The waffle wasn't too dry and crispy, and his hash browns were cooked perfectly.  Will we go back? Maybe. We will certainly ask for a table far from kids. Maybe that will bump this place up to 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Seriously, who can complain about 24hour milkshakes and a full menu?! Great service, even at all hours of the night! Ive been coming to this location for over 10yrs and its never a disappointment! After a long absence, my boyfriend and I stopped in the other night. Sahra (sp?) was awesome! Food came in a timely manner, even though it was packed and 2am in the morning!! Service great and food was excellent!! We got a bread pudding to go and left full and happy! Love this location!! Perfect for middle of the night munchies! And the service makes it worth the extra couple of bucks! And the drive! Tip accordingly people!!"}
{"text":"I thought is was pretty amazing walking up to it with it's old retro feel! It was way cool! But the waitress barely waited on us.. fairly nice but I cant say I saw her more then 1 time for 2 second when she refilled one of our drinks. (me and 1 other person only) My friends food which was pretty much, french dips, was really gross. Their wasn't cheese on it, the meat was dry and the aushu was watered down.... My food did taste really good, the \"hungry diner\", just a little greasy.  The worst part though, as I finished eating my meal, I look over and crawling across my part of the booth is a nice size COCKROACH!! EWH, It crawled right towards me. The server came back right in time when is happened. She somehow thought I was lying until I freak out of the booth and she looked a little closer. Under her breath she then apologized and said she'll take care of it. I barley knew what she said but before I knew it my date was headed to the door.  I will never go back there! I felt absolutely disgusting leaving that place."}
{"text":"Been going here since i started visiting Phx and now that i live here, it is a good 24 hour joint for breakfast. Nice way of turning a trailer into a venue! You can't mess up omelets. The price is decent and there are plenty of booths and out door seating. Decently priced and fills the belly. Try it!"}
{"text":"I recently tried 5 & Diner for the first time ever and it was OK. The food wasn't great, but it was on par with Denny's and other diners like this. The restaurant looks very cool, which was probably my favorite thing about it. I just didn't think the food was too special, although I might give it another shot sometime."}
{"text":"My ex-boyfriend really favored this little 50's styled diner and we always got breakfast when we went there.  It's clean and the staff are friend, but there wasn't anything on the menu that really stood out.  Just greasy eggs and hash.  What took this review down to 1 star was the egg white and spinach \"omelet.\"  I don't know what that thing was *really* made of but it looked like a big green and while football sitting on that plate and had about that much flavor and the same density.  Pretty disgusting.  I did what I could to dissuade him from this place any time I could.  Icky!"}
{"text":"My kid was sick today so she told me to go have a sit down breakfast.  She gave me $10 and told me to send her a picture.  That picture never got sent.  I was seated at 9:35a on Fathers Day, and place my order at 9:40a.  There was syrup all over the table that end up on my lower forearms.  Ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs and coffee.  Got coffee at 9:45a, and that was the last I heard from anyone until 10:31a when I asked to speak to a manager.   At 10:32a, my cold breakfast got put in front of me.  Amazing how quickly it was dropped on my table when i asked for a manager.  Dianne, the manager sat down at 10:33a.  I told her the story, she apologized and I walked out."}
{"text":"This place is open earlier than other breakfast spots in the area.  The food is standard, nothing amazing. The atmosphere is fun and the music gets you going.  The service is S L O W!  It was like pulling teeth to have our server talk to us. We asked for the bill after we ordered to expedite the process, but that never happened. I couldn't believe how this guy drug his feet. He payed a lot of attention to the people ordering off the senior menu, I guess he thought the old folks would tip better??  Anywho...it's a good standby but definitely not a destination..."}
{"text":"Mediocre chain diner with around Denny's quality or slightly lower food.  I guess the big appeal is their hours?  Maybe I have been spoiled by the awesomeness that is Chase's Diner in Chandler, but there's really no reason for me to ever go here again."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant to not only receive poor service and a wrong order but also to only be offered an insulting   15% off my check for a total disaster experience by their manager Kevin."}
{"text":"Fun, easy, good 50's Diner. Come here for fun Diner experience.  If you want fancy brunch with the girls go somewhere else.  If you have a hang over and had fun last night with the girls and need to share bar stories come here."}
{"text":"Great food, love the chili with onions & cheese. Everyone had a good lunch, wings, a malt, dessert. Outstanding service..."}
{"text":"Like to go for breakfast and home cooking comfort food. The menu has been scaled back but the old stand bys are still there.  Breakfast is served all the time as it should be in a diner. Country potatoes are done crispy and just right. Omelette is a very good size and full of vegetables.  Service is generally quick and friendly.  Lots of extra charges for changes and right now for eggs because of market price."}
{"text":"Loved it.  We passed by the diner while on a family vacation in Scottsdale and once we got hungry for dinner, I pulled up Yelp and checked the reviews. If anything, I'd say it is underrated. Obviously it isn't fine dining but for what it is, and considering the prices, it was excellent!    $3.49 for a kid's plate of meatloaf, (really buttery) mashed potatoes, gravy, and nice fresh veg. How could someone below say it is overpriced?  Ridiculous.  My wife and I both had patty melts and it was the best one I can remember. Good rye bread, sauteed onions, a slice of cheese and FRESH ground beef. The waitress asked how I wanted mine cooked... I was a bit surprised but she said they grind all the beef. So I ordered mine medium and it was spot on.  Sitting outside is pretty drab as you have a view of the street and strip malls but inside it is a different world. If you're looking for a good, classic, inexpensive meal in a kid's friendly environment, you probably won't find better than 5 & Diner."}
{"text":"Seriously ..., even if it's late ... Just don't bother!! Drive about a mile and go to Denny. Just about 2 miles and go to IHOP but the food here sooooo bland!! Smh  I've been in Phoenix for almost 3 years. I've tried t 4 times in the time I've been here simply because I can literally walk to the place from my condo. The food is sooo bland it's so weird!   The first time I tried French toast, potatoes and eggs... Bland!  Second time ... Strawberry waffle, eggs... It took forever and the waffle just taste like dough, almost a little sour. I like my waffles a little in the fruity side.  Third time ..,, steak omelette. That was pretty good actually!! Very flavorful but the hash browns I ordered with it .... Bland bland bland!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I eat here at least once a week. Not only is the food always delicious, but the service is excellent too! Ana is one of the sweetest waitresses in the whole world and the manager always stops by our table to say hello and they always offer to split the check for us. I've been in plenty of fine dining establishments that cost three times more and do not provide the consistent  customer service and quality of food that this little place does."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled ham and cheese sandwich, and it's so nice that we can eat outside, enjoy the 50's & 60's music, and have our little dog with us.  This is such a consistently good restaurant.  Don't think twice, its alright!"}
{"text":"I had gone from restaurant to restaurant to find one of my favorite sandwiches -- an authentic turkey club.  Living in NE Phoenix, I tried Denny's only because they had a good one (until I found a roach under the sandwich on my plate).  Never again.  Then Coco's, but they closed.  Then the 5 & Diner near the Paradise Valley Mall, but they closed.  So I drive a bit to the original on 16th St. north of Camelback.  Despite always being crowded, I love the sandwich and fries.  The atmosphere is fun with its '50's music and the service is good."}
{"text":"We love the feel and the food of a genuine 50's diner. My wife and I went to this one last night. It was just okay. Not even quite okay but just BLAH. I ordered the sliders. Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth: Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order. This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C. They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable but it was somewhat bearable. I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Expect what it looks like. Cute on the surface. Booths need some help as they all sag and could use some help. Food is OK for what I would expect in a diner...beware most things are LOADED with salt. It's been quite a while since I've been here...and quite honestly, It will be a while before I'm back."}
{"text":"A Charming 50's diner theme with reasonably priced food. Great Chicken pot pie which came with a salad.  Wonderful crust and not greasy. Nicely prepared turkey burger with lettuce and tomatoes with a side of fries.  Those fries were really crispy and delicious.   Had an apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream for $3.99!  Can you believe it?  They seem to use Breyer's ice cream which I love.  Love to see the little specs of vanilla in the ice cream. Can't believe we got great food and service and didn't spend a ton of money."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and we have eaten here many times. They were far better 10 years ago."}
{"text":"5 & DINER was an awesome little diner across the parking lot behind my hotel. Inside is typical 50s/60s decor with a few tables and a long bar to sit at similar to Waffle House! Ordered the Pancake Breakfast, 2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 Strips of bacon, and 2 sausage patties a small orange juice and a cup of coffee. Service was great, very friendly staff. Had a great baseball chat with the host, a fellow misplaced Red Sox fan. Waitress was very sweet and recommended everything. Price was amazing at meal + tip totaling at $14.97! Definitely recommend this great diner if you're hungry for breakfast in Meza!  Service: 5/5 (Seated quickly, Good Conversation, refills quickly) Food: 4/5 (2 Pancakes, 2 Sausages, 2 pieces of Bacon, all cooked great) Atmosphere: 5/5 (I Love 50's/60's décor and I love diners so works out well for me.) Price: 5/5 (2 Pancakes, 2 Sausages, 2 pieces of Bacon, 1 Orange Juice, 1 Coffee $3.00 Tip = $14.97)"}
{"text":"No wonder this 5 and Diner has the highest ratings of them all.   Had a delightful lunch with precious teenage granddaughter.   BBQ burger perfectly cooked with amazingly delicious, un-greasy french fries.   She totally enjoyed it. I tried the chicken pot pie that came with a salad.  Salad was perfunctory chopped iceberg lettuce with tiny pieces of tomato, croutons and cheese.  Not interested in salad anyway but  hoping to be wowed by the chicken pot pie.   AND I WAS!!!   Delicious pie with lovely crust and moist inners with chicken and veggies.  Nice job. Loved it so much that I ate the whole thing even though it was just lunch time.   Service from Diane was attentive without being overbearing.  Loved her service style.   Thanks to all at 5 and Diner who made this lovely lunch possible."}
{"text":"My only regrets about this place, is that i never had their food until i turned 18. 5 and Diner has become one of my favorite restaurants to go to. Let me share why. My favorite thing about them is the large variety that they offer. If i had more money I'd sit there all day and eat breakfast, then lunch, and then dinner, followed by a dessert of course. However I'd say my favorite time to go is for breakfast. They have this thing called the breakfast special i believe and basically if you get there before 10:30 AM I want to say, you get a great deal on some of the best breakfast I've ever had. It's the whole shebang! Eggs, hash-browns, (good) sausage, bacon, and my personal favorite, Biscuits and Gravy! There are different combinations you can get but this is what i usually default for. The biscuits and gravy are to die for! The size of them and deliciousness of them make a grown man like myself happier then a little girl who just got a pony. I also get a cup of coffee that never seems to be empty so, great customer service!  Such a great staff and it always seems like they are trying to make you smile. I've been attempting to try there whole menu and basically what I'd recommend is the breakfast, the burgers, and the shakes! They serve wings as well and I'd say they are decent especially since they were all you can eat on certain days. The shake menu is also spectacular and the shakes themselves are also delicious, and that coming from someone who has worked in the shake industry before! I'd say my favorite so far is \"The Elvis\". So GOOD! I  hope they do shakes happy hour again soon! I'd recommend this place to anyone, everyone should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Earlier this month I was in Phoenix visiting my brother-in-law.  In trying to find a decent place for breakfast, he recommended 5 and Diner, saying it is as close to an old school diner out west.  While the food there, wasn't bad, it wasn't great either.  Adding to the mediocre food was the incredibly slow service.  All in all, it is an okay place for breakfast, but that is about it."}
{"text":"We LOVE this restaurant!  My son, husband, and I went here last week after not visiting it for several years.  It was well worth it!  My son was starving and ordered french fries, spaghetti, pasta, pizza, and pancakes (typical nine year-old fare), and it was inexpensive.  He tasted what my husband and I ordered (the roast beef (him) and a veggie omelette (me).  We left with plenty of leftovers, full bellies, and three satisfied customers who did not spend a lot of money.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"The worst Reuben I ever had.  The meat was pressed unseasoned something meat.  My wife had a cup of partially cold corn served as part of a fish and chips meal along with a small pile of shredded lettuce that didn't look look like a garnish or particularly edible. Arbys across the parking lot serves a good Reuben I guess I should have gone there."}
{"text":"Forgot how good their burgers are!  Met a dear old friend here for lunch. Had the bacon cheese burger and fries. Really yummy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a 50's diner which my fiancé and I are always partial to! Really fun atmosphere and nostalgic! We split some items off the menu: their mac n cheese was very good, their salads are amazing ( they have home-made dressings) in fact everything was good except for the pot roast. Honestly its just not our kind of pot roast. Although it's hard when your mom-in-law makes a great pot roast that is award winning! Ha, no I am not trying to get brownie points it is that good. So the pot roast here was a major let down. I need to go back to try some of their more 1950s style food ( burgers shakes etc) and I also want to try their breakfast! It looks like those items will be delicious. =)"}
{"text":"NO STARS! HORRIBLE customer service after 10 minutes got water after 10 more minutes got my bf sprite after 10 more minutes got chocolate shake after 45 minutes more turns out they never put the food order in! How do places like this stay in business?? Don't the owners care? Wasted several hours of my Saturday and left without being fed totally pissed me off! The fact the employees are careless pissed me off too no standards no accountability, all that's left is a BAD review. (Went to Fuddruckers next door in and out in 30 minutes for 3 peeps no problems at all)"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning. Very busy only 1 table open. Were seated promptly with a good attitude. Took a while for food to arrive. When it came to our table everything was correct and hot. Will return"}
{"text":"One of my favorites from wayback. Unfortunately showing it`s age now. Breakfast was still good with good portions and very friendly service but the place itself looks like it needs a facelift. Particularly the restroom area which needs a major overhaul. Also only one restroom for men, and one for women, means an inevitable wait."}
{"text":"I have a couple of quirky friends I meet up with once a month or so, and we just have so much fun.  I wanted a diner waffle and sausage this time, along with coffee, and it really hit the spot.  The wait staff is friendly and the food is reasonable priced...this is by no means a fine dining establishment but it's pretty hard to screw up the basics!  Definitely on the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Much to our chagrin this location is now CLOSED!!   Drove from SE Gilbert for chili omelette so disappointed!  At least the other locations are apparently staying open. Guess we'll have to go to Tempe next time we have a craving"}
{"text":"Totally starving this morning.  Had to go to the store but it was closed.  Went to 5 and Diner at Tatum and Cactus area.    We were taken to our table and it took 11 minutes to have any one come to greet us.  Slow service.  Then a waitress stopped by - took our order.  The food came out quick.  Had the 2 eggs with bacon and biscuits and gravy.  I hate it when your eggs come out and they are crunchy....CAN'T ANYONE SEE THAT THEY WERE COOKED TOO FAST AND THEY ARE CRUNCHY..  QUALITY PEOPLE....  QUALITY!!!!!  yuk!!!  Picked around the crunchy parts. Bacon was good.  Biscuits were ok...  lightly dusted with gravy.  semi warm.  Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast! We sat at the counter and shared a hungry man breakfast. We added some xtra bacon and an English muffin. The English muffins were fantastic!!! The hash browns were crispy and delicious.  The service was good, food came out fast and the bill was reasonable.  Lovely!"}
{"text":"I will absolutely always love this little diner. Great Memories here with personable and truly great servers! I have been to many 50's style type diners and this place has the best vibe and food hands down! Outside or Inside you will get Stellar Service, they happen to be very accommodating to dietary needs for a diner! Open 24/7!"}
{"text":"On our trip to Arizona my boyfriend's grandparents treated us to breakfast here.  I love the nostalgic feeling it gave me, the service was quick and with a warm smile, the prices were reasonable and the food was delicious! I ordered the California benedict and it was so good and fresh tasting. I was so full yet felt healthy about what I ate. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love old timey diners, and 5 & Diner definitely fit the bill. They had classic '50's decor, jukeboxes on all the tables, and all the servers wore uniforms.   I came in for dessert one night, not wanting to go back to my hotel room. I debated between a few options, but went with the Diner Split. The fried banana sold me. The split also had strawberries, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice creams, whipped cream, and was topped with a marachino cherry.   There was no way I could eat the whole thing (it would be great for 2 or 3 people to share). So I enjoyed as much as I could, making sure I got ALL of the banana."}
{"text":"Came in about 7:30 on Saturday. We ordered our son food right away and then ours a few minutes late. His food came out fast and hot. About 20 minutes later we go our. Food looked great Patty Melt and French Dip. I did order mine medium well it looked a little pink, first bite I saw that it was really pink. Yuck! I can't do pink burgers. My husband ate his cold French Dip and super hot fries. While I waited for Roy the server to come back and check on us. The wait ended when he finally came to drop off the check. I gave him my plate and reminded him I ordered it medium well. He did take my meal off the bill, thanks that was great. Problem could have been fixed if the check back happened about 2 minutes after food was dropped off. To apologize for my family eating dinner in front of me while I waited for service, Roy also gave me a expired coupon and one with the expiration date blacked out. Five and Diner use to be a fun place for the family to go for a bite to eat TOGETHER. What happened???"}
{"text":"We were just in there again today and it was better than ever!  We had a burger, fries and chocolate shake.  The burger was cooked the way we wanted and everything was excellent. We've been going in there for years and it just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"Absolutely NEVER again! I will save the fun for the rest of you. I came into the establishment and waited ten minutes, mind you, there was very little people in the place. A waiter made eye contact, but quickly looked away...a waitress walked right by and didn't even acknowledge me standing there waiting to be seated. Finally, another waiter seated me. After what seemed to be quite awhile, my drink order was taken...then time passed, my order was finally taken. I ordered the Mac n Cheese!!! It was so horrid!!! I know diners use microwaves, and that late, I wasn't expecting fancy food, but the whole bowl was way TOO hot to eat! When it finally cooled, it was so bad...fries were awful...stale. Come on 5&Diner at least try!!! I didn't eat much, and then the waiter asked if I wanted a box, I stated, \"no thanks, it was pretty bad.\" He apologized, then gave me my bill...I was charged the full meal. SOOOO...NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I definitely found my next fav restaurant! I came here last week with my friend and I was already excited before I entered, they had apple pie on the menu so that was a plus for me!  I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant. It had a 1950s theme and the waiters even dressed up to go along with it.   We started out by having southwestern egg rolls, which was delicious! The dip that came with it was great too.  Our waiter was very quirky, which made our experience interesting in a good way. I ordered their sloppy joe meal that was their special of the day. I must admit that it was a good quality sloppy joe, even if that seems like an oxymoron. Afterwards I had apple pie a la mode that was good and flaky.   I will be visiting again and again, 5 & Diner has won me over!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to getting a burger and onion rings. They were very busy it was 11:00am..so I placed my order to go..I got a classic burger, onion rings, and a strawberry  shake. I was so disappointed OMG they were so greasy I had to throw them in the trash ate half of the burger which was super dry. The shake was the only thing I could really enjoy..I got a upset stomach from all the grease."}
{"text":"Yeah, that was a $15 breakfast, that felt like a 6.99 breakfast. I have nostalgic feelings toward 5 & diner, so I'll probably still go here from time to time, but really it's not that good.   I got an omelet that wasn't very memorable, the juke box ate our quarters."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants in Scottsdale. New owners need to take a look at the food. I had delivery tonite. The salad had old brown lettuce--thew it out. The turkey was processed, not cooked today. Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Very good food (I got the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and it was delicious) Good service even in the middle of the night (we had a friendly and attentive waitress) Charming retro decor  Con: This place is filthy. Our booth was covered in crumbs, shredded lettuce, other people's hair, and even dirty silverware between the cushions. It was gross. We only stayed to eat because there was nowhere else to go and we were hungry, but it was disgusting. The waitstaff does not seem so busy that they couldn't take a minute between customers to clean the booths and make sure that the next guests won't have to sit in filth.  It was my first time coming here, and although I liked the food, I can't imagine willingly going back and sitting in those dirty surroundings again."}
{"text":"Food is simple and good. Just had the meat loaf. Better than I thought. Good people good times."}
{"text":"5 & Diner is okay for a quick bite.  The food is just okay, typical diner food.  The place it's self feels very old. . and not. . .\"oh cool, I feel like I'm in the 50's\" cool.  It has an old feel.  Needs some revamping (chipped paint, ripped benches, broken table juke boxes).  Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Cool mom and pop Diner. Went during the Barrett Jackson weekend and fortunately found a table. Our waitress was great and attentive. The food was a 8-10 and the service was 9-10. If you're looking for a cool diner experience, I definitely suggest 5 & Diner."}
{"text":"Cute place and I love the old fashioned malt shop ambience, but I will most likely not return.  Everytime we've gone our orders are messed up in one way or another.  I made the mistake this time of sitting at the counter in front of the food pick up window.  They mixed our orders together so that neither of us got what we asked for.  The cook had a question, but couldn't get the waitresses attention so he cooked what he thought was written which was wrong.  Disappointed, but not a deal breaker.    As I'm eating I'm watching the waitresses and hostess make toast.  Their long, nasty fingernails all over the toast, no gloves and one had a band-aid on the tip of one of her fingers.  Then the cook in the back comments \"these plates are filthy.\"  The clincher, a black hair in my husband's eggs.  Note to the staff:  If you're handling dirty plates and order slips please put some gloves on before you start handling people's orders.  I'm so disgusted by this place.  Wait, one more thing...one woman scratched her head and then proceded to butter toast.  Also, to the cooks in the back...cover your long, nasty moustaches.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner tonight. By their hours they were still open. Walked in to immediately be told they weren't serving anyone else tonight."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for breakfast or lunch.  I don't recommend their dinner entrees.  I think their pricing is high, but comparable to Coco's or IHop (around the corner).  Overall, very fast service, and hot food.  My favorite is their BBQ Burger.   They have good chili too.  Breakfast is the best -- especially their french toast.  The only negative is the lack of large group seating.  This location has booths, so they cannot put tables together (Camelback and Scottsdale can).  Also, they tend to seat people rather oddly which can leave a large group waiting for a long time."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Breakfast was very good. My husband had ham and eggs. It was perfectly prepared, and the slice of ham was as large as a dinner plate. We will definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"They should think about closing at night and hire a cleaning crew.  Service was very slow. Seamed like the cooks and the waitstaff was having an argument.   I only go because my children like the place."}
{"text":"Very run down. Just a sad atmosphere.  Many booths were held together with duct tape.  I hadn't been to a 5 & Diner in 15 years, and it looked like this one hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in that time. It's sad because this used to be such a fun place.  The waitress was nice, but got my wife's malted flavor wrong.  She looked like she was struggling so we didn't ask her to take it back.  It was still good, but just not what my wife ordered.   We ordered cheese fries to share, and they came out luke warm, but we powered through.  Hopefully this is the only one in this condition in the Valley.  Sadly, we won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I am from NJ and have been going here for years. Now I actually live across the street from here and still eat here a lot. I also like the Denny's nearby and alternate my visits. 5 and Diner is nostalgia but if the food was bad, I would not go. It is diner food, not for dieters unless you order only salads. I have not had a bad meal here; breakfasts 24 hours are great, specials and dinners always hit the spot. The Reubens are great, meatloaf and chicken dishes. Even the Cobb salad was good. The staff is always very cheerful, friendly and most helpful. I did research on 5 and Diner and note, 5 and Diner is now owned by a former franchisee in Massachusetts who bought out everything, LPM Holding Co. The owners have over 35 years in the restaurant and other businesses so it can only improve. There are 5 and Diners in 9 states now."}
{"text":"I've been here a LOT. I live down the road.   To start...the food here is pretty much all good. The only thing I would suggest avoiding is the nachos. They load them up but so much the chips turn soggy real quick. However they have odd things like deep fried pickles which are delicious and their breakfast foods are super delicious.  The staff is wonderful and we are never left for wanting to say the least. Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice.   The restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up but otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change! Unless you hate 50s music that is. It's also all 50 decor inside so if you're looking for a nostalgic place, this is the place to go.  As for the shakes, everyone is right in saying they are awesome and they're HUGE. I can almost never finish them.   Over all, I'd highly suggest this place and also you can ask for the discount cards so if you get 7 meals, you get 1 free. It's not very pricey either which is a plus."}
{"text":"We came here because California Pizza Kitchen had a wait of 30 minutes, and we were starving.. bumped into this place while we were trying to leave the mall in search of something good.   Decor had the usual 50's cars, pink, Elvis music, jukeboxes, Coke ads, etc.  We got the Mushroom burger w/fries and The Rueben w/fries, house salads as well.. waitress was nice but she seemed kinda old to be working there (?) but nice. It was the first time I even bit into a burger and thought it smelled like cow. As I told Kris this, I urged him to smell it. As I brought it to his face, he said it's just the way they cooked the mushrooms. Meh. Okay. He really liked his Rueben though. House salads were just iceberg lettuce with the typical veggies you could buy from a salad bag from Fry's. Not that exciting. Not exciting, but not memorable. I think I like Lori's Diner better (where I'm from), but I'm not sure if there's one in the phoenix area."}
{"text":"Very friendly server, the place seemed to attract a Baby Boomer crowd. Chili was good, the club sandwich generously sized and lots of thick bacon - who doesn't like bacon? Topping it off, the chocolate milk shake was the most chocolatey I've ever had, though not the smoothest - still, one of the best shakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my wife.  I have to say one of the best breakfast places I've been too in a long time.  The sausage links are fantastic, eggs cooked perfect. Very pleased.  Service was good.  The only reason 4 stars is the waitress kept filling my coffee to the rim, there was no room to add creamer.  I even told her when to stop but it just didn't work out."}
{"text":"This is a really cute restaurant. 50's theme with hip hop decore! We went there for breakfast on Mothers Day. I received a fresh red rose & a free dessert! I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, 3 sausage patties, plus  biscuit! Under $10.00. My husband ordered an omelet with hash browns & a biscuit also under $10.00. Service is excellent! I was happy as we could walk in and not wait 1-2 hrs for butterfields, butters, etc. I think this will my go to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"We've been twice now, and nothing we have had has been very good. The ice cream and cake were mediocre, the onion rings were crispy-initially, the burgers were WAY overdone and made from cheap beef. Ask the bone chip in my husband's burger. The mushrooms were the canned pieces and stems variety, and the fries were crispy but heavy. The cole-slaw was excessively sweet and completely limp.   The service has ranged from complete disinterest- no greeting, no eye-contact, and I had to beg for refills- to interactions between employees so uncomfortable that I wanted to say something. It's great if you have rapport, but the customers don't need to see you slap each other around and overhear you gossiping about each other- even in play. Or, if you hate your job at 5 & Diner, please find another one and stop throwing the dishes around at a volume that hurts my ears and ruins my experience.   Management needs to intervene before this Phoenix institution falls apart."}
{"text":"It may not be the 'diner experience' of New Jersey, but the meal we had was great and the chocolate malts are just about the best I ever had!  We experienced great and friendly service and overall I would recommend it a place to stop for a friendly and non-formal dining experience."}
{"text":"Received a coupon in the mail for a free entree and decided to try it out.  I got the buffalo chicken quesadilla and the boy got the blue moon burger.  He said the burger was pretty good.  My quesadilla had good flavor, however I could feel my arteries clogging with every bite.  There was SO MUCH cheese and I didn't realize the chicken would be breaded and fried.  Probably obvious to most, however I didn't connect the dots.  I ate half and took the rest for the boy to eat for lunch the next day.  Everything was clean, service was friendly, food was good.    I love that you can pick two songs for 25¢, I only wish we had the chance to hear the songs we picked.  Next time, I'd love to hear a little Incense and Peppermints."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon when we were in this area. Disappointed that our visit wasn't better.  The service was ok, they were not rude but weren't really hospitable either. The food was horrible! I ordered the chicken strips and fries and both were cold and gross. Strips were really hard as well. My sons barely touched their fries as well and did not finish their food as it was just \"OK\" they said. The Oreo shake was the only good food item we received that day. The atmosphere of the diner as you would expect was overall cool and my boys loved the jukebox.   Overall the food was a big turn off, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I guess I'm supposed to hate this place; its a chain, its usually crowded, the juke boxes are stupid.   But, I feel comfortable there and I enjoy the food.   What can I say? Its better than Denny's. I like it."}
{"text":"The place needs a good cleaning. Service was so-so and deluxe burger was tasteless as well as the fries."}
{"text":"I was taking a class near this establishment and decided to give it a shot for breakfast. I ordered a Denver omelette and biscuits. I thought the food was great and the service terrific! The ambiance was nice and I would recommend this to family & friends!"}
{"text":"A very nice 1950's atmosphere with lovely breakfast options and good diner food. I had the chicken pot pie which was very savory. It was also 24/7 which is nice if you want something other than the usual Ihop or Denny's. The staff was accommodating and  friendly and there was no wait for us two. :)"}
{"text":"This location lost its' lease and is closing today.  Sorry to see it go. Thanks for all the great meals."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a Johnny Rockets meets IHOP vibe. Fun throw-back spot. The food was decent and the service was superb. Our waiter was attentive and made great suggestions. Plus, they had a jukebox at every table!!! Fun little spot to grab a bite to eat. Don't expect the world, but this place is nice to mix it up every once in a while!"}
{"text":"Cute reminiscent \"diner \"with an unfortunate corporate feel. The food is good enough for what it is. Cutesy  3/4 attempt at a 50's diner. Not much else to say"}
{"text":"This place is alway a good spot for a late night meal, no matter what time it is. I usually get the burgers....really good with nice thick bacon. People should not be so critical of the place, as its a diner.  IF YOU WANT 5 STAR FOOD GO TO THE RITZ."}
{"text":"After a concert my friend and I went here for a late night bite.  The atmosphere was fun and I liked the 50s themed box car decor.  The service was nice and friendly and we both thoroughly enjoyed our milkshakes.  He ordered the macaroni and cheese which came with a side salad and I ordered a chicken sandwich.  The portions were generous and the quality of the food was about standard diner fare.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a quaint sit down place with decent food that is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Ehhh... This was our first time eating at this establishment. I liked the decor. It reminded me of The Peach Pit haha.  The juke box and 50s feel is kind of cool.  The waitresses looked inappropriate with multiple tattoos showing.  ( I have tattoos but I don't show them while I'm working.  One chick had angel wings on her back.  It just seemed inappropriate to show your entire back while waitressing .  This isn't Hooters.). We walked in and it was hot.  I didn't really feel the AC too much and mind you.. It was 106 outside so you would think the AC would be blasting.    They were not that busy and our waitress only had one table.  She wasn't very attentive and the food took over 20 minutes.  He ordered a patty melt with fries and I ordered a veggie omelet.  The omelet was not good.  This was my first time having an omelet that did not have the ingredients cooked into it.  Instead, the cook folded a plain omelet in half then inserted the ingredients. :/ I ate a few bites and was highly disappointed.    The price point for the food is overpriced.  We definitely won't be returning.  Oh and thank you to the waitress who wanted to know if we wanted a refill after we had already finished eating and was ready for the check.  Someone needs to take a crash course on waitressing.  A good waitress doesn't just drop the food off and disappear like a fart in the wind.  A good waitress drops the food off and periodically checks in with her guests."}
{"text":"My friends and I went over to 5 & Diner recently to grab some late night grub and we had a great time!   The atmosphere, decor and ambiance is probably the best part of this diner. It is a classic setup with all the vintage artwork and lighting. The music; however, is modern, which wall it may appeal to a larger audience, somewhat takes away from the diner atmosphere.   Our server was a busy young guy, who's name is passing me, but he did his job well and us rowdy college kids with poise.   My main critique may seem overly critical, but the omelette I ordered, and asked for no onions on, came out with hundreds of slices of sautéed onions. While I just asked for them to redo the order, it was a hassle and can't be given a 5-Star rating because of it. Through and through, 5 & Diner is a great dive for anyone who is looking for a traditional styled diner.   3.8 Stars"}
{"text":"I used to love this 5&Diner until our last visit ended in a horrific case of food poison for both my mother and I.   We both had the tuna fish and were sick within 8 hours. When I called to let them know the following Tuesday the waitress that answered the phone literally said \"you can't prove it was from here!\"   Food borne illness happens, but her response was the final coffin nail. We will not return."}
{"text":"The service was good.  The food decent but nothing to write home about.  Fries were limp and flavorless."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it first opened over 20 years ago.  I still make it a point to get there for a shake every time I make it back home.  It's great for that and for chilling to the oldies.  I can't say I ever had any idea that the place would still be going strong, as I remember it was originally only a temporary setup, awaiting the inevitable displacement from the planned freeway down Colter (which never ended up materializing).  Imagine my shock when I drove past one in Las Vegas a few years ago.  Long live the 5 & Diner."}
{"text":"This place was awesome - Val our waitress was super nice and very helpful.  Place is a cool looking diner with a MASSIVE menu, was all most too hard to decide what to eat.  I had a reuben and the kids both had pancakes (mickey mouse shaped - so cute) - the best though was my husband's a double burger - I can't remember when we had anything so good, yes - I had to eat some of it!!"}
{"text":"Place was quiet at 6.00 am. Waitress  was friendly  . The service was very slow the food took 35 minutes to come out the  country  gravy was OK . Needed more spices .food was average . Prices was average . Forgot to bring refills"}
{"text":"Surprising rude staff especially Sandy. Got a bad stomache ache from a burger. It was saturated in greasy and was poorly shaped. Not the first time ive been here. It's gotten progressively worse and worse. Not worth the money or time. McDonald's is right up the street."}
{"text":"Excellent shakes and soda drinks. The atmosphere is authentic 50's and the food is very good.  i have eaten their a few times and enjoyed the burgers and chicken smothered dinner. large servings!"}
{"text":"If I could give a half star, I would and that would be ONLY because our waitress, Phoenicia, was really sweet and tried to make things better.   It started out pretty good, we walked in at 8 pm and so it was Happy hour and you get $2 of per shake, so my husband ordered a Strawberry Shake. That came out fairly quickly and it was very good. Then we ordered, my husband ordered a cup of chili, the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy, I ordered the pineapple teriyaki burger, I asked that it be made the same way as the menu stated, no extra items such as lettuce, tomato or onion.  I went with the seasoned fries.  The chili came out and though good, my husband said it was quite spicy, which he wasn't expecting from a diner style restaurant.  And then we waited, it seemed to take a really long time for our meals to come out.  When they did it all went downhill from there. The meatloaf was funny tasting and drenched in a really odd tasting gravy, and the potatoes tasted like maybe they were really old...several days old maybe?  We sent the meal back as inedible.  My burger had to be cleaned off of lettuce and onion and in the process the mayo kind of disappeared. It was ok, but every few bites I kept thinking did they use rancid butter to toast the bun?  It was not real tasty but we were starving, so we shared that. The french fries were cold and had NO SEASONING.   I've been to many 5 & Diners in the valley, I will NOT be returning to this one.  We also nearly froze to death and the music that was playing was very boring and unrecognizable, we were born in the 50's I would have thought there would have been something we knew.  I wouldn't waste my money on this one, ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 & diner with Postmates. Got fried mushrooms, Diner chicken sandwich, and pot pie. When I opened the pot pie, this is what I saw. Only the top of the pie. Looked very unappetizing. I know it was taken to go but still, I expect the whole pie for $9.99 and not just the top of it. Really messed up... can't help but think it's some kind of joke. Everything else looked good & tasted good."}
{"text":"This place was eclectic and fun! We got the meatloaf plates, eggs Benedict, mushroom burger and kids pizza! Food was delicious and definitely a great spot to go!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I love the waiters and the manager. It is a staple in my life. Food is delicious. My fav is the New Yorker with kettle chips, the shakes are great. The atmosphere is fun. Everyone is so nice. I look forward to my lunches here usually two times a month. Oh and their rewards program is pretty cool. A thirty dollar lunch on them this past Monday. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband & I bought a Groupon & headed over. We were excited cause we saw a GREAT special online for a burger & a shake for $9.99. As newlyweds on a tight budget..this looked like a GREAT plan. WRONG!!!! Fi should have figured out what we were in for when we pulled up to the parking lot & it was EMPTY on a Sat. Night! Now I COULD make this review soooooo much longer by going into ALL the details, but instead I will give you the highlights(I mean LOW lights!). Menus-STICKY & GREESY. Host & waitress were upset by my discussing the $9.99 burger/shake deal. \"No, we don't have that avail...but EVERYONE ASKS ABOUT THAT !\" Why? Cause it was on the online menu! I suggested it be removed..I think this was my 1st mistake! Sorry..short really isn't my style..I should have warned you 1st! Ok, besides the dirty menus, the floor was dirty, tables not bussed, etc.. & there was only ONE other table in their besides is! Food quantity was very generous..milk shake was great. HOWEVER...I am sooo sick(MAJOR TUMMY TROUBLES!!! Ever since we got home , & that was 6 HRS AGO!!!!!!!!!! This is really my FIRST REVIEW... But I cannot feel THE CRAPPY, & not tell the world( or at least the Yelp community! never, Never, NEVER come into this 5 & Diner!!!! Unless you don't order anything,  & are only in it for the cute photo pics ONLY...You will seriously REGRET IT...over, & Over, & OVER AGAIN! Stay Away if you want anything edible..seriously...STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!!!!!     PS- the ONLY reason I have it 1 Star is I couldn't post this review w/out one. If I could, this place REALLY needed NEGATIVE stars!!!! ;{"}
{"text":"The Groovy P. and I ventured to his old stomping grounds for lunch today.  The '5 and Diner' on 16th St and Colter left me with little to ask for.  Before coming here I had a preconceived notion that 5 & Diners were dirty and nasty. Not the case at all.  We walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside (since it's so nice and they had misters).  We get two different servers bringing us stuff (talk about service) and I ask the one waitress for recommendations.  I didn't listen to her, of course, and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings.  The Onion Rings were perfectly cooked.  They looked like they were prepackaged, but they were very crispy and I could actually bite through the onion without pulling the entire thing out (don't you hate that?!!!)  The Southwestern Burger was order Medium Rare and was cooked accordingly.  Soft, juicy, and pink with a nice crispy browned outer layer that can only be achieved on a well used grill.  The creaminess of the chipotle mayo paired beautifully with the green chiles.  Unfortunately, because I ate too many onion rings, I couldn't finish my burger.  What a shame!  The Coleslaw was just how I like it.  It's hard to find a really good coleslaw.  I prefer mine to be slightly sweet, not sour.  Too much vinegar in slaw ruins it in my opinion.  This slaw had the perfect marriage of mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Not to mention carrots...  My experience here was great!  The servers were top notch and kept my water full the entire time and actually chatted with us for a few minutes.  There is an artist guy named Ross who has been there every day for 5393 days straight. No, not an employee.  He goes there and does his art! He hasn't missed a SINGLE day!!! That's like... 15 years! So if you wanna seem to be 'in the know' ask where Ross is... They'll be able to tell you.  Time for a nap!"}
{"text":"Took my granddaughters there today after a hike out towards Globe. We all had a good appetite. Been coming here for years when we visit our Arizona family. Jill, our server, went out of her way to make sure my granddaughters were having a good time. Great shakes, the best I've had, anywhere, with extra in the stainless mixing container. Ordered my burger medium rare and it was. Onion rings not over greasy. Granddaughters love the 50s decor and the older one was enjoying the old tunes."}
{"text":"Back in its heyday I loved this place. Diner food, jukebox, railcar atmosphere, it was great. Now, not so much. It is a bit old and tired. The food was ok. Not bad, not great, it was calories on a plate. My daughter ordered some massive burger with guacamole and bacon and I ordered scrambled eggs w/ bacon and toast. It all came out hot and the waitress was very nice but this place needs an update and frankly a cleaning."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and the service is unbelievable. My wife and son live to eat here. The bugers are awesome. Everybody should have burgers and fries for breakfast"}
{"text":"We love 5 and Diner for their breakfast.  We usually go on Sunday mornings and after taking our order, the food is usually out in 10 minutes.  Fast and good!  My husband loves their sausage patties, they're like McDonalds.  Be sure to sit in Mary's section, she's awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the low ratings. This place was recommended by family while we were in the area to visit from CA. Good food, big portions, very nice staff. Plus you can't beat the 99 cent meals for kids during the week. Milkshakes were made with fresh ingredients, huge and the way they should be made. Reminded me very much of the diners I used to eat at with my grandparents as a kid. Will definitely be back again the next time we are here."}
{"text":"Woohoo! This particular Five and Diner is as good as it gets for a Five and diner!!!   The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff.   Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner.   So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please.   The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere.   The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.    I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays."}
{"text":"Cute little diner. They are open 24 hrs. When you enter it's kinda small and totally retro. They do have a food truck as well. They are dog friendly. Also they have seating outside & they have heaters outside as well."}
{"text":"Where's my meatloaf!? Mom, the meatloaf!!!! We have been waiting over an hour!! Boo, this suck balls"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to complain but this was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever been a part of. Granted, it was midnight and clearly the people working there got the short end of the stick when it came to their shifts but nonetheless, that's not an excuse.  -Got there at 12:05, didn't receive our food until after 12:50. -Didn't bring all of the food out (clearly forgetting to place the order in the first place) -Overcharged us on the bill -Rarely checked if we needed anything (water, anything else, etc.)  I wish I could say all of this wasn't on one dining experience, but I'd be lying.  I like to keep things positive but I had to write a review.  Eat here if you're desperate :)"}
{"text":"There isn't very many places open in Phoenix past 10pm for a bite to eat.  This diner is open 24 hours and I've been here twice so far. It's a great place to go to get a snack or dessert after the movies or going out.  I've only tried a few things here so far and liked everything. I've tried the hot fudge brownie sundae, chili cheese fries, and the appetizer sampler plate.  All there were pretty good. It hit the spot when I was craving dessert and something greasy. yum! I've heard that the wet fries are pretty good too. It sounds gross but I've heard from two different people that I should give it a try. So, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Usually go to the Pavilions on the weekend to have Sweet Tomatoes or for a quick Taco Bell run but my sister and dad were in town and my dad didn't want either one so we went for some good ol' burgers.   This place doesn't disappoint. Not only did I like the real retro feel that wasn't overly kitsch but the food is good. Sister and dad had a cheeseburger and for whatever reason I decided I was really hungry and to go for the The Big Bopper Burger (double decker burger with melted american cheese and Kenny's special sauce). Wow. I have eaten a lot of burgers but this thing was about 3x the size of any double cheeseburger I've ever had. There was almost too much burger to be honest (actually it was TOO much) but for those who can stomach that challenge, take it on. I'll stick to the regular cheeseburger next time.  That didn't deter me from continuing my calorie splurge and so I decided to cleanse my palate with a vanilla shake. It was easily one if not the best shake I've ever had. Delicious indeed. A little bonus was that the mini jukeboxes on the tables did work, which is nice. The service was a tad slow at times, maybe this may be due to the young crew at hand. Everyone was enjoying themselves and though I was somewhat disgusted by the amount of meat I had just ordered, I can only blame myself. Definitely a place to I'll go back to."}
{"text":"As I wrote in my Tip,  5 & Diner is a really fun trip down Memory Lane!  It is also important to remember that diners were never known for gourmet food, nor as a hangout for Foodies.  What they did instead was make hardy, rib sticking stuff -- and here the 5 & Diner excels.   Last night we had the Meatloaf dinner for $6.99, and Southwest Burger for $9.29.  We washed it down with an Ice Tea for $1.99 and a Malt for $4.99.  This all came to $25.61, before tip.  The service was good and we felt that it offered good value and a nice change of pace.    Yes, the meatloaf was somewhat bland and it was overwhelmed by the brown gravy.  But, it was good.  The burger was tasty with a nice slice of roasted Poblano pepper on top. A nice touch.  It also came with a spicy Mayo dressing that causes the burger to slip off the bun and makes it very hard to eat without a knife and folk.  So here's a good safety tip -- don't sit too close to the table and wear a napkin!  LOL   Will you be confused with 5 & Diner and think that you're eating at Elements? No. Chef Beau MacMillan can rest easy.  But 5 & Diner offers good diner food and is a great place for Shakes or Malts.  Enjoy the 5 & Diner, along with the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons music!"}
{"text":"This was a cute little dinner. The service was great, the food was pretty good. If I'm hungry and in the area, I would stop here again."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and sandwiches! Awesome deserts too and KILLER milk shakes still served in the tin.  The service is fast and ALL the food I have eaten there is wonderfully prepared. Honestly, you can split almost everything on the menu between two people!  The service was wonderful. Everyone was right on top of things.  I would stop there and have lunch ant tim, any day."}
{"text":"My hubby wanted a late night snack. The server was very friendly. He ordered a chocolate shake with PB, banana and more chocolate. I took a sip and thought it was \"meh\" but he liked it."}
{"text":"Omg.. I am so full!!! I can't even move!! Their breakfast really bomb.. Everyone are friendly.. This is my first time come here, it's close by my place but i never come here before because it just has 3 stars..  Give them shoot bro..!! Ohhh yeah..."}
{"text":"The chipotle eggs benedict was EXCELLENT. If I had a bigger stomach, I would have eaten all of it.  The sauce was amazing, and it had cilantro.  Everything is better with cilantro.  Service was good and friendly.   This place seemed a little more cramped than other locations I've been to.  Getting to the bathroom and getting out of the bathroom here is like an obstacle course."}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch. We were notified there was a 5 minute wait so we had a seat in the entry area to wait and sweat. It was ridiculously hot in that area. The rest of the restaurant was fine but the entry area was insane. Once seated we ordered and waited for our lunch. One thing we noticed while waiting for lunch was the noise level was really high.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries and my husband had the New Mexico burger. My sandwich had zero teriyaki flavor so it was just a bland sandwich with a slice of canned pineapple on a slightly soggy bun with some soggy fries. My husband said his burger was just as bland but he did say the iced tea was good. The food wasn't horrible but it was just bland and boring.  Our server was pleasant but that was not enough to make us go back.  3/4/16 Update- this place has closed. The building is gone and will soon be another Starbucks."}
{"text":"Cold cheese fries....should have gone to Sonic.  At least I could have stayed in the car."}
{"text":"Always have liked this place. We go here at least once a month if not more for breakfast. Went this past Sunday my only day off this week at 7am. Ordered the Chipole Eggs Benidict as I always do if it's Sunday. It's an on going Sunday special for years. It was up on the chalkboard outside. So I didn't even need a menu. Placed the order and server came back and said that they weren't ready for it yet. I said I'll wait, mind you I'm a cook I know how the whip up hollandaise in less then 10. Took 45 minutes.  Ugh really and not busy only one other table. Whatever the ham and English muffin we're cold. Was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Sure the place is a giant gimmick, but its a fun gimmick and for what it is they do it well enough.  The food is what you would expect from a diner and it really isn't bad at all.  My boyfriend loves the shakes, I can't do much ice cream so I haven't had one.  On certain days of the week they have awesome deals for kid's meals.  One other thing that impressed me about 5 & Diner was found on their website.  First they have all of their nutritional information available, but even more impressive is they have a menu for Gluten free choices as well as Lactose free choices.  Very cool in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. Here during breakfast hour. I will be back."}
{"text":"went for dinner on a sat night, was not very busy - seated right away. Server was very nice and on the ball, we enjoyed the food and the customer service! Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I've been dining here regularly since 2007, and the staff and food are outstanding. The longer-term staff recognizes my order and who it's for if I call ahead for pickup, and we always look forward to seeing Kevin and several other wait staff who recognize us immediately. The chicken pot pie is outstanding, as are the milkshakes, burgers, and sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo. You can't go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger or the teriyaki chicken sandwich with pineapple. Their breakfast is incredible (try the House Scramble/House Plate), the French toast, waffles, or anything else remotely related to breakfast. We love the location (cramped but fun) and always bring out-of-town guests here for an entertaining meal. You've gotta love the jukebox (retro, bright, and beautiful) and the 50s music. Have Grandma's meatloaf with a side of nostalgia."}
{"text":"How do people eat here and not die??  The interior is not retro... it's old, falling apart, broken, smelly, uncomfortable. Bad. The food is...I don't even know what the food is.  Things will be bland, cold when it should be hot, mushy when it should be crisp, burnt or raw when it should be simply cooked. The servers are just as hit or miss. Get a good one, and you won't realize it. Get a not good one, and you'll at best be left to find your own napkins, silverware, and condiments.  At worst you'll be eating their hair, or they'll be filthy and you're sure they haven't washed their hands all day."}
{"text":"I found the service a bit slow in bringing the check and running my card, but that is my only bad complaint.  This is a kid-friendly place to eat and they have a lot of good choices for everyone.  I am addicted to the albacore tuna melt; however, my niece's sourdough french toast looked really good too.  Also, the root beer floats were delicious.  Also, our server was super-nice."}
{"text":"Went here last night, thinking it's been a while since we last went to 5 and Diner - previous experiences at other locations have been great. First impressions at this location were mighty poor - more than half of the neon signage at this place was out, including the actual logo on the front (if we didn't know what it was already we wouldn't have been able to tell). Second impression not good - only a few cars in the parking lot despite it being just after 7pm.  Went inside, were seated quickly. This is where the issues began. We were told a server would be right with us. Chose what we wanted from the menu, waited - no server. After about five minutes another couple came in and sat at a table off to our side. Within a minute THEIR server was with them. She asked if they needed a moment, they said yes, then she left. We continued to wait for initial contact with a server. Their server returned and took appetizer and drink orders. Still nothing. A guy appeared, cleaned off a table, and left. Nothing. The guy came back and started sweeping the floor. The other server attended to another table, then brought drinks and appetizer to the table that was seated after us. By this time we had been waiting over ten minutes without even giving our drink orders. The other server didn't even bother to look over at us to see if we were being attended to. Completely fucking oblivious!  We got up and left, curtly telling the front door girl why we were leaving. We got an \"ohhh, sorry guys!\" and then we were gone. Never returning."}
{"text":"This is where we go INSTEAD OF CHOMPIE'S when my girlfriend wants breakfast. On our most recent visit, she wanted something that wasn't really on the menu in that combination. The server figured out a way to bring it out at a fair price. The food was just right and the server was perfect."}
{"text":"3.5* rounded up for nostalgia, good food, and great service. We stopped in here after a very rough, long day and really enjoyed the atmosphere, decor, service, and food.   Excited by the prospect of an ice cold malted on a blazing hot AZ day, my extra thick strawberry malt was perfection! They even give you the tin cup \"leftovers,\" old school style. Scott and I shared this, because I got super full quickly. It definitely captures the East Coast Diner/\"Back to the Future\" vibe; we were bummed that the table jukeboxes were not working, but the big one did. This was very reminiscent of the diners we frequented in NY together when we were teenagers, it was a nice feeling.   Sticking with the nostalgia theme, I had the tuna melt with fries: the sandwich was huge, very tasty, and the fries were unsalted and well done just as I'd requested; the tuna was tasty, and not Mayo logged which I appreciated. I had to tap out and take half the sammy to-go. Scott had the patty melt with fries and a side of brown gravy thoroughly enjoying his LI diner style throwback meal.   Our waitress was very friendly, keeping our waters topped off and checking in. She gave Scott some type of info regarding an awards program or Bday special - can't recall - and was on top of service our whole stay.   Definitely fans, and I'm sure we will stop in again. My photos are in the gallery, I'm banging out review drafts, and our visit was a few months ago :)"}
{"text":"Had a great time!  First time here.  Came here after my daughter PASSED her driving test!!!  Took her to get breakfast to celebrate.  (I also had a bogo coupon, in my giant coupon book! Which they accepted with no problems.)  I have driven past a couple of these places and always thought they were cute on the outside.  Well, they are cute on the inside too!  Sad that the Jukeboxes on the tables no longer work. They do have a full size one that works.  The food was great!  The menu selections was huge.  I got  a SouthWestern Skillet, it was Yummy!  My daughter ordered a Skillet also, and they had no problem making a few changes for her.  We had plenty of food left to take home, the portions were huge!! :)   The waitress was great!  She gave us plenty of time to go over the menu since we had never been there. What a fun place!  Can't wait to go back at lunch or dinner and try a fun dessert !!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I just left 5 and diner with our son. The service was awesome! Our waitress was a sweet lady by the name of Val. Val was more than awesome. She rocked it this evening she was always asking to see \"how are things\"? \"can I get you anything else\"? and so on. She was pleasant and had a smile the whole time! Val is phenomenal this evening you could tell she takes pride in her job. We will definitely go back to this location because of Val!  Val we LOVE you! You ROCKED it girl!!!! If you heading to 5 and Diner make sure to say hi to Val."}
{"text":"Simple and good old American fare....... I have been to this place many times and was satisifed with every meal.  Burgers are great!  Try the southwestern, the mushroom burger is awesome - you can actually taste mushrooms.  Great place to take your kids.  They get a hat to decorate.  Sometimes there is a balloon guy there to enterain the kids (for a small tip).  Hulu hoops in the front, if you dare.  Note: Monday and Tuesday kids eat free.    Decor is old school.  Black and white tiled laminate flooring, shiny chrome accents gives you a feeling you are entering a rail car.    Enjoy...."}
{"text":"The food is terrible I got the hound dog and it wasn't my favorite. Friend got a hamburger and also it was just dry. Even the French fries didn't taste right but the shakes were yummy definitely recommend Oreo shake."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict is lame. Floor under table is sticky. Hostess stuck her butt IN MY FACE while seating other people. There's something stuck to my table. It could be a piece of paper napkin glued with syrup. Oh, and by the way, when I say, \"Thank you\", the appropriate answer is, \"You're welcome\", NOT NOT NOT \"Uh-huh.\" WTF with that?"}
{"text":"Ok, so the reason why i am giving this place such a low score is mainly because they take themselves for granted waaaay too much. I was looking for a diner for a long time and when i saw it from the road i thought: oh this should be fun!!. oh well, 45 dollars for 2 entrees is waaay too much. plus the food was not fantastic, the service was soo arogant and the overall feel was like the were all saing: come on, you know you love it.. which immediately turned my off...  hope you have a better experience  good luck"}
{"text":"Not the best Five and Diner we've been to. Service was ok, they forgot some of the order and had to be prompted a second time to bring creamer. Do not show up right at 11am when they switch menus from breakfast to lunch. Both the chilly and the soup were Luke warm at best. Much better options nearby."}
{"text":"If you're a Tarantino fan or have seen Pulp Fiction an embarrassing number of times then you know what Jack Rabbit Slim's is. If Jack Rabbit Slim's existed, this would basically be the Phoenix franchise of it. No, it's not a wax museum with a pulse, it's just a great place to go to after a long night of drinking/smoking/etc. with friends. The music is great and the food is good no matter what your level of intoxication is. Now I'm not using that as a jab at all, that's part of the reason I love this place. Where else could you stuff down a greasy burger at 3 AM, gulp down a massive shake, listen to the wailing of Buddy Holly, have a waiter named McFly, and enjoy being trashed all at the same time? Sure it's not the cleanest nor does it have the best service, but who cares?  If you go at the right hour late at night you'll see people that you are convinced could not be out in sunlight. Be sure to look for the guy that looks like a hermit Santa outside with the wildlife scenes he hand painted on his van. Again, I'm not knocking this place because it's part of the experience. If it's not for you, wear your paper hat and go pick up your order at In-N-Out's drive thru."}
{"text":"Super convenient for me because I live right beside it on Colter :) they're open 24/7 and have good comfort food."}
{"text":"I remember eating at this place prior to my Yelping, and so returned there just today. The food is still good (not great), and while this is maybe more a 3.5 star review, the service was so nice and personable I'm willing to spot them the difference.  Open hours are wrong as listed. Sun-Th 7 AM - 10 PM, F-Sat. 7 AM - midnight."}
{"text":"The burgers here are absolutely amazing! They were so big I didn't think I would finish it. The service is also outstanding. I used to come here as a kid, so coming back was even better! You have to check this adorable diner out if you've never been here"}
{"text":"Food is nothing to sneeze at. Service is no good. Wait for food will be longer than you'd hope. Craving a greasy spoon diner meal, this will do the trick but you won't walk away amazed. Though would highly recommend their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Everything has to be frozen and microwaved! If you care about what you put in your body.... U will not eat here!!!! Just a disgusting plate to eat!"}
{"text":"Short staffed, cold food and gross fries today. Waitress didn't bother to write down our order and, as we expected, she forgot a few items. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious! Compliments to the chef! I loved the chocolate malt! :) The atmosphere really reflected the 1950's. I love how there are hula-hoops in the front; so fun! The staff was very friendly. Our waitress was super nice.  I would recommend to a friend! :)"}
{"text":"I am also surprised by the low reviews, how can McDs next door score higher. I came here with my 2 1/2year old. Very nice employees. Food is typical diner food. Very generous portions. Who finishes, thank goodness for to go box.  I am a bit shocked how big the kids meal is. 2 very big Mickey shaped pancakes w/2 large slices of bacon. My little eater has plenty left over, I could've just shared.  The place is very busy for a Saturday night.  I will definately be back. I would also recommend it for a cheap, quick bite. :) I hope they keep getting good ratings."}
{"text":"Sadly not nearly as great service this time around.  Waitress made it clear she didn't really want to be here.  Order was missing items,  from each order. She didn't hide her annoyance.  Bummer.  I've loved coming here for years."}
{"text":"We came and eat here for the first time  around 2 in the morning, the food was excellent, the service was great! The waitress Chris was a sweetheart! Love the 50s style the restaurant has! Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"Wow!  Makes Denny's like like it deserves 5 stars.  Maybe I'm a food snob, but this was some of the worst breakfast food I've ever had.  I ordered an Eggs Benedict, and the sauce over it was frankly inedible.    My wife's special scramble was equally bad.  My 7 year old son did like his kid's meal.  This place has two things going for it:  an incredible nostalgic setting/rooms, and good to great service.  Both of those are 5 stars.  But if the food is terrible... it's hard to outweigh them.  It really was a soft underhanded pitch I made to them... all they had to do was deliver food in the ballpark of Denny's and I would have been happy as a clam.    But they didn't, and I won't be back.  Damn shame."}
{"text":"We went to 5 & Diner to grab a quick bite on Xmas Eve at around 3:00pm. The place was only about a quarter full. We were seated immediately, given our menus and asked about our drink orders. I ordered ice tea (of course thinking it's sweet tea bcz I lived in the South but I was wrong) and water.  A few minutes later our server returned with our drinks and took our food orders. We ordered a cheese burger (no cheese), and a mushroom burger, both well done. We also ordered chili fries and onion rings.   My opinion of the food: burgers taste just ok. They were very dry and didn't have enough sauce in them to get them going. I added mustard, mayo and ketchup on mine to get it to be more interesting. Chili fries, nothing really special, I've had better. Onion rings, excellent!   Overall opinion, wasn't a very exciting meal but the service was great."}
{"text":"Came in while I was waiting for my car across the street. This place is kind of dark, which is weird given the jukeboxes and neon. It feels like a run down diner. The waitress I had was Morgan, she was nice and attentive - the service was no issue.  The food was subpar, I got a BLT club which was sandwiched between three slices of lettuce. There was very little bacon and an overload of bad lettuce. I only ate half of it because it was so disappointing.  I don't know why I expected much else, but this place was not good."}
{"text":"Not a bad place when you want diner fare and don't want to be severely disappointed yet again by Denny's. The 50s themed diner car sets a unique atmosphere and the food is alright.  The overall size isn't too big so the staff is able to provide good service and they typically have good attitudes towards customers. Worth a stop if you're hungry in the area."}
{"text":"Thought this would be a great little place to go as a cute diner. The food is over priced and not the greatest. Turkey club was barely average. Meat was very thin and from a pressed loaf. Had hoped for \"real\" turkey. My wife had a half tuna sandwich which I tasted and it was like eating tuna out of a can. It was very strong tuna, piled high in the middle with both ends of the bread empty. They say they have the best milk shakes in town however they were extremely thin and not thick and creamy for $6!! Sorry but I can't recommend this place. The two of us came out with a $35 bill!!! Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I love the 5 & Diner! The staff is always friendly, I love the retro theme, and I thoroughly enjoy their house plate breakfast. This joint is always clean, serves food fast enough, and I haven't left here without a smile."}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent service. Little pricey for the quality, but the atmosphere totally makes up for that. Be prepared to share a meal. Huge servings!"}
{"text":"I'm frankly surprised this place doesn't have a higher rating. We stopped in here before heading to Peoria for a spring training game. The place is so cute... the red and white leather booths, juke boxes, and decor scream \"classic '50s diner.\" We were greeted by a friendly host, who immediately seated us and took our drink order. A couple minutes later, our fabulous waitress came by for our brunch order. We ordered the eggs Benedict, 6oz cheeseburger from their \"secret menu,\" and a turkey cheeseburger. Everything was fantastic. I was happy they asked me how I'd like my burger cooked, so it came out perfectly medium and juicy! It was simply dressed with lettuce and tomato, but I really enjoyed it. The kettle chips it was served with were so yummy; they were clearly made in-house and were so crispy and flavorful! The eggs Benedict were also fantastic. Although they could have toasted the English muffins a little more, they poached the eggs perfectly (these days, this seems harder and harder to come by). I can't say enough good things about 5 & Diner--between the amazing, attentive service and the wonderful food, we really enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"Food was good shakes were awesome. Service was really great really out standing. Was very clean inside and out."}
{"text":"We have been here twice with our three young kids to take advantage of 99 cent kids meals on week nights. Yes, we are the couple with three loud toddlers who have a tough time sitting still. It's a work in progress and we do our best to keep them calm and clean up as we leave.   During our two visits we had some pretty awful service at 5 & Diner. The looks of disdain and the lack of attention to our table were a clear sign that they were not interested in keeping us as customers.   The food wasn't helping their cause either. Adult meals were awful and kids' food was nothing to write home about.  Save your time and $$. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I knew it was a kitschy place when I found it online but some of the pictures online did NOT match what we got when we ate here.  It's located in the parking lot in front of a mall next to a motel/hotel.  Typical looking from the outside and has all the usual jukebox and old poster and assorted memorabilia on the walls.  Nobody was dressed like the 50's (as seen in one of their ads) and while the service was alright, it was slow!  Our server had our table of 7 plus a table behind us of 8 and a couple more; she was overwhelmed.   Looks like a lot of snowbirds go here as well as those from the hotel and workers stopping in for a bite before heading out.  The food was reasonable and was nice but to be honest, I wish I had chosen someplace else for us to go.  I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Love Bfast at this place! Prices are OK not cheap but what is anymore?"}
{"text":"Last night, my husband and 2 brothers came in at 11pm. We were greeted and seated. We not greeted by our server, 4 different servers walked past us. We sat for 30 min, and left. The server was new and had a pin that said please be patient I'm new. I only know this because she talked to the table on the side of us and was running back and forth to the computer taking there order. I understand being new is stress full, but let us know I will be right with you. This was the worst service I've ever had. The restaurant was clearing out, so the only person around was the buser. I expressed my concern to him as we walked out the door."}
{"text":"Big servings at decent prices, with fast and courteous service...would eat here again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Takes you back in time. Wait staff was great including hostess. Juke boxes at every table & portions are generous."}
{"text":"I had The Mrs. Cleaver Pot Roast. And I must say if Ward, Wally and the Beav had to eat that shit every night the Cleaver's would have been the first divorced couple on TV.  The Pot Roast was smothered in gravy and tasted awful. This was a one bite episode then ask for the check and leave type of experience."}
{"text":"Honestly was horrible food. Had the country fried steak with corn mash potatoes and toast..the best part of the meal was the toast because it was the only thing warm. The whole meal was cold when it was given to me and my boss.. dont recommend this place really. Also my waitress was a little goofy and didnt fit the whole part aof being a waitress."}
{"text":"Always a go-to when I'm not sure what I want to eat but could use a delicious burger or breakfast fix! Sign up for the rewards program here, best decision ever. BONUS: the music is so catchy & nostalgic!"}
{"text":"We were here for dinner on December 14, 2016 with our grandson and his girlfriend from out of state. They each ordered a milkshake, since the man that seated us told them they were great, and they were so runny, like flavored water!  Hubby and I ordered fish and chips and it was straight out of box flat fish pieces.  Not much taste. Came with French fries and a half ear of corn on the cob!  The corn was old and tough. The kids ordered the chicken strips and fries - they both said they were okay but just okay. It cost us $61 for the four of us to eat and it was not worth it!  We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 stars. Not that it's bad, just not going to set the world on fire with quality. It's consistent though. Huge burgers. Quality sides like the onion rings, loaded waffle fries and cheese and chili fries. Tasty ranch to put on anything, but it doesn't really need it.  EXCELLENT SHAKES AND MALTS! The real thing. Bring your kids here so they grow up knowing the difference between a real shake or malt and what Mcdonalds and Jack in the box serve. Open pretty late too and they have outside or inside seating. My hubby and I love going in the evening and swinging to the music they play. Oldies but goodies all the way around."}
{"text":"On our way home from the McCormick Train Park, we decided to stop off here for dinner before we got on the freeway.  Our experience here was OK, there was some good times, and the some OK times. Ambience was great! Loved the 50's style, loved the music. People were having a great time, including our kids. Food was OK, nothing to be proud of. You don't have to do to much to impress the kids. So they were more them happy. I had the philly cheese steak, not much flavor, bread was to soggy, there were more vegi's then meat. Just wasn't that good. I also had the blueberry milk shake. Again, had no flavor. Ice cream was good though. Wife said the chocolate shake was much better, and she was happy with her chili burger. Then on our way out, kids played with the hula hoop outside on the patio. We still had a good time."}
{"text":"Salads are very iceberg-heavy.  Not bad, just old-fashioned.  Nothing remarkable.  My daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen.  Chicken Pot Pie ( \"NEW\" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3.50 frozen Swanson version you can cook at home.  Nothing remarkable here either.  French fries were hot and crunchy and good.  Best part of the meal.  Worst part:  The AWFUL chicken strips.  You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those.  There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside, then a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and then in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken.  NEGATIVE 500 STARS on the gross chicken strips.  I only went there because I had a BOGO entree' coupon.  Not worth it at all.  P.S.  I have eaten here several times (mostly because of coupons) and they all fell below 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fried steak with a cup of clam chowder.  The food was quite good though the steamed vegetables were a little bland.   Service was good and the waitress was polite.   The big problem was the long wait (Friday night in a busy area so expected)."}
{"text":"Great 50s and 60s music without having to feed the jukebox. Awesome Bryers ice cream shakes ($4.99). I had the Reuben sandwich with fries this time (less than $9) and it was delicious and so big that I had to take half of the sandwich and fries home in a to-go box.  Plentiful, easy parking. Friendly, helpful staff. The menus are faded and falling apart. Time to replace them.  I love this place."}
{"text":"We sat down three guys came in after us they were immediately given menus and drinks. 10 mins went by and no one EVEN acknowledged us. Until we made our way out the door, thanking us for coming. Even thanking us for coming."}
{"text":"Cute little building.  I ordered soup, it was awful, I didn't complain, the server asked me if I would like to try the other soup, I did, it was awful too.  My entree, meatloaf was not a loaf, it was like pieces of ground beef with way too much stuff on it.   The mashed potatoes were good, I ate those.  Priced reasonably.  The server/the service was good."}
{"text":"Food and waitresses are great!  This is a wonderful place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Everything was tasty and felt like a home cooked meal. We will be back again when we visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had been here years ago and just loved every thing about this place!  Went back recently and was disappointed to see what a totally standard diner it is. The food is good but limited selection and not an easy place to eat healthy."}
{"text":"5 and diner is not what it use to be. There place is becoming run down and getting dirtier an dirtier. The shakes use to be amazing but I'm guessing they changed ice creams or put more milk in to save costs because they are not what they use to be."}
{"text":"Ok we made a reservation after hanging out across the street to check out the cars at McD's Rock N Roll Care show.  5 & Diner totally surprised us.  The Black bean burger was AMAZING.... (we are vegetarian) and OMG way good!  Everything was perfect.... oh and by the way the Shakes were A+.  I had the Cherry Coke which they make and again .... WOW!.  Now for the rest of you.... (non-vegheads). Your in for a good meal as well. Everyone in our party who had the burgers were very happy.  great atmosphere.. great food. Ya gotta go!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. The omelette was just scrambled eggs with toppings in between. I had to eat it with a spoon. I asked for water with lemon and I was given a water with a bowl of lemons. It was pretty clear that one of the lemon slices had been sucked on so I avoided them all together. The food was not fresh. When asked what was good the server replied \"everything!\" In my experience that means nothing is good! Save your money and go to Denny's across the street."}
{"text":"Fifties diner all the way with a great green chili burger. I will definitely be back here the service was great and so was the food"}
{"text":"Very fun little place!  A real diner a large step above a \"Denny's\" type diner.  I had a cookies and cream shake that was delicious (I love when they give you the metal tin with the \"left overs\" that don't fit in the glass).  Sourdough French toast with just the right amount of cinnamon really hit the spot.  Very friendly waitress made us laugh.  Can't ask for anything more, the outdoor seating was fun and the inside was decorated very fun with records and classic car pictures, etc."}
{"text":"Great cod special on Friday night - includes fries, biscuit, and cole slaw. Three big pieces of fish. I also got a chocolate shake which was really good too. My server \"Pinkie\" was really nice, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. Ask for her if she's there. Open 24 hours, so great for late night eats. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"For what it is, which is a 1950's themed diner, it's okay.  A quick stop after a car show on a Sunday and the service was good, quick and prices were not too high.  I'd go again but it's not a destination, or must-stop, locale for me."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy. 50s themed, comfort food and milkshakes, what more can you ask for in a lunch. I've only been for lunch, but enjoy myself every time. Don't expect trendy incredible food, but home cooking in its pure form. Chicken pot pie was wonderful as is the tuna sandwich. I love it's casual down to earth style, friendly service and orange cream milkshake."}
{"text":"Typical fun 50's diner atmosphere but good food nonetheless.  Tried their deep dish apple pie tonight.  Made like a pot pie with puffed pastry!!!!  Sinfully delicious.  Boo to Rhonda J for pointing out they have a website with nutritional info.  I checked it out and ain't nuthin' nutritional about it.  But boo to me for being so foolish as to look--especially AFTER I've eaten.  Makes me wonder...will there be 90's style diners someday.  Maybe internet cafes where kids are amazed we used to have to go places to use the internet and they are horrified at how big serving sizes were \"back then.\""}
{"text":"Good milkshakes! Real ice cream. Serving size good enough for two."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to 5 & Diner after he picked me up at the airport and I was starving for some breakfast. They had all your diner favorites and it looked like they served the entire menu, even at 10 AM. I forgot the exact name of my dish, but it was bacon and eggs with biscuits and gravy. MMMM all of my favorite foods on a plate. The bf had the same, but with a chocolate milkshake! I hate boys and their fast metabolisms. The biscuits were nice and fluffy, but the bacon could have been a bit crispier.  It's a nice Denny's/IHOP alternative. Good, quick service, but it was fairly empty at 10 AM on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"The service was amazing.  My server was very sweet and real , I would def recommend my friends and family to come here for breakfast. The atmosphere is chilled and relaxed and their food is absolutely amazing. No complaints on my end."}
{"text":"I like this place. I like the 50's nostalgic feel to it. The food reminds me of stuff my mom use to make, this place is perfect if you are looking for all American home cooked type cuisine.   I love coming here, they are open 24 hours so weather it is lunch time, breakfast or dinner you can order what ever you want. Burgers for breakfast or Pancakes for dinner.  And the milkshakes here are to die for. Don't go to Sonic for a milkshake come here they can not be beat. The staff is always super friendly.   The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that it is a little grungy feeling. it's open 24 hours a day so I think they need to close and just give it a real deep clean...that and that the little Juke boxes on the tables never seem to be working properly.   But if you want good food with good service, this greasy spoon ain't so bad."}
{"text":"We have come here twice in the past few month after bringing cars for service to the Toyota nearby. The first time the service was kind of blah, but the second time we sat near the breakfast bar and our server was outstanding. Sadly I do not remember his name but he was a young man with dark hair.  We were regulars at the 5 and Dinner that closed a year ago (PV Mall), so it is kind of sad for us to stop by here : ( Our experience at that place was the best."}
{"text":"This is our regular breakfast spot, food and service are good and consistent. We usually get coupons in the mail.  They get 5 starts for their crispy bacon, it is awesome.  One of my favorites is the chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the King Kong for dinner. They have good sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Great service, breakfast was wonderful, and the place was clean. I had poached eggs and hash browns. My husband had the chicken fried steak. Both were excellent and large portions. I had to get a to-go box! We also shared a shake which was amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times since 2012. Every time I go there, the service is great. There is always people welcoming me and my family. We usually don't stand for long, until we get seated in a big table. The tables are always clean, So is the bathroom. I haven't been in a situation where I was angry with any of the staff.   There are many options to choose from the menu, and if I choose something, it comes in about 5 minutes or less. Their service is quick, and the waitress comes to our table as soon as we are seated. There are a lot of burgers to choose from, and many milkshakes. I always go with the BBQ burger because it as always good to have. I once ordered a burger, and I asked for it to be well done. When I started eating it, I realized it was not well done at all. It may have a mistake, but the waitress came right away, took my dish, and brought another well done burger with a new plate of fries. I always go back to this restaurant because I always get treated right, with great service."}
{"text":"If you like  oldies like  \"Over and Over Again\", try the patio mid-morning.  The view of Micky D and Best Buy plus Indian Bend Road noise isn't the greatest but a scattering of tall palm trees make the setting somewhat attractive when you  scan upward.  What is missing, of course, is the beach.   The two egg cheese- veggie omelet with hash browns works for me.  For toast I highly recommend  rye for its thickness  and extra seeds."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for many years and I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal BUT my breakfast was overwhelmingly greasy and my coffee was not ordered cold, but it was served that way. This was a regular stop in the past so I'm really disappointed."}
{"text":"To my surprise this place is really good! My friend and I stopped in a few times and I have been satisfied each and every time.  I'm pretty simple, so I admit I have ordered the same exact item each time. The pancake with the chorizo on the side. I'm not absolutely certain what the meal was called but I know it has Southwestern in the name.  So the meal comes with the one HUGE pancake and a heaping order of chorizo. The portions are pretty big so you are able to share. The drinks are fairly small though. The prices aren't bad either. I believe we paid less than $25 for two full breakfasts with drinks.  The decor is pretty funky. It just like an old school diner. Each table has its own small jukebox. The establishment is pretty clean as well. The staff is also the nicest group of folks I have come across at a restaurant.   I'll definitely be making another trip here with the family soon = )"}
{"text":"I heart my NJ and RI diners, so it is really a 3 1/2, but for not being a super cheezy national chain, I am adding on the 1/2 star chunk.  Ended up here for some food around 11pm on a Monday after realzing after some (okay, MANY) cocktails that delicous vegetarian fare was now out of the question in Phoenix and I frequent the Jack in the Box near my homestead a bit too much. We taxi-ed it to 5 & Diner since I hadn't been there yet anyway.   I liked the interior, although the temp was freezing, we got a corner booth and our waitress was simply kick ass. I had to put together my \"breakfast before bed\" from scratch and she totally nailed it for me (yay vegetarian and lactose-intolerant!). I noted there was outdoor seating as well.   I remembered everyone mentioning the milkshakes and I surveyed the diner and everyone totally had one. :(. Jealllouuuus."}
{"text":"Great place! Super fun staff and yummy food ( those fries!!! ) Thank you for a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"When it come to diners this place ROCKS! My friend and I came there for dessert after dinner. I had the apple pie, she had a milkshake. Both were great! The ambiance of the place reminded me so much of the 50s- it was so cute and fun! I  definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Place was dead and the waitress got the food order wrong. Mediocre food."}
{"text":"Garbage! This place was not \"Classic 50's style\" at all! The burgers were so dry and flavorless, I'm amazed people still would even go here, you might as well go to Carl's Jr, Wendy's, or Jack in the Box instead of this place! Don't waste your time or your money. If you want good classic 50's style restaurant go to Chase's Diner in Chandler waaay better!"}
{"text":"5 stars just for the shakes! They have really great chocolate shakes, so good we went back a second time just for them.  The breakfast was also good. Classic diner style, with big portions. Only disappointment was the biscuits - tasted a little rubbery and right out of the microwave, otherwise a solid place for a meal."}
{"text":"Dido to my wife's review of this establishment (Shakira E. by the way) the 50's decor was very cool.....and the service was not bad although it did take a minute for our server to arrive. The grilled chicken sandwich I had was very good and the coleslaw was very fresh....but the Milkshakes were very disappointing. I think if I have another I will have the malt added for the additional 59cents....that may help. The gentleman there making balloon figures was very talented. I don't think we will be visiting this establishment again anytime soon....but continue to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!"}
{"text":"Great shakes and burgers.  The sandwiches are pretty good as well.  Well done chain, reminiscent of the diners I grew up with back east."}
{"text":"Always will be a family favorite because of the atmosphere and memories! Totally cute place to go with the family and really good desserts!"}
{"text":"Just had a take-out. The Caesar salad was a heavily-gunked mess of very limp lettuce. Biscuits fine. Tuna melt more mayonnaise than tuna, with a few melted shavings of tasteless cheese. The small amount of macaroni cheese old. Friendly server, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The employees at this location are sooo nice! Even when it's super busy they are still very friendly. My favorite thing about this place is it's open 24 hours! If you want breakfast for dinner or a milkshake at midnight you can have it! My fiancee enjoys their french dip sandwich whereas I always try something different. I just had dental work and have been eating like a senior citizen, so I opted for the mac n cheese. It was warm and gooey with a crunchy cheese topping- a great comfort food. Late at night this place is especially fun because of the people watching."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids for a treat. A zillion kind of milkshakes :) I love the deep fried pickles and the sliders are good too. Great place for a burger and to look at memorabilia."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they are open 24hours. Solid breakfast and lunch menu but haven't tried the dinner yet. Awesome environment of historic diner. Definitely would be a regular at this spot."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm   My roommate and i showed up around 8pm.... it was pretty busy....  but we were seated right away.. and our waitress.. Barbie Doll (according to her name tag) was so nice!   my roommate had a pumpkin shake... AMAZING!!!! also had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon... she didn't like it all to much.. (shes a very picky eater) the B&G would have tasted better to me if they didn't put paprika over if...   I had their Hound Dog... a pretty nice sized hot dog, the bun toasted... and you could add on chili, cheese or sour kraut!!! I had extra sour kraut and mustard on it! :) mmmm hit the spot... and their Fri's are sooo yummy!! and their BBQ sauce is super good too :)   we both decided to have a slice of their cheesecake.... I had strawberry topping.. it was alright.. i wish they had had cherry toppings... mmm.. but this cheesecake was amazing!!!!!!!!! so creamy and a really nice sized piece ... i cannot wait to have it again!! :)   Barbie Doll was very attentive and helpful... no where near annoying... at all!! i loved it... and all the other waiters that passed by were lovely as well.. all smiles.. but not the fake kinds... i liked it.."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at about 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday morning. We were greeted promptly, and seated promptly. That's when all the service ended.  Despite the fact that there were at least six employees in the restaurant, and fewer than six customers, we waited fifteen minutes and no one ever came over to take our orders.  It's not like this is a huge restaurant. The employees were all at the other end of the restaurant chatting and texting.  Customers first, people!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a rare opportunity to have lunch together and as usual couldn't decide where to go... after driving around for a few minutes we stopped at 5 & Diner.  The staff was really really nice!  Super sweet and attentive.  We were seated right away by the first person who saw us walk in the door (he wasn't a waiter).   I had the chicken salad with bleu cheese dressing... it was good, lots of chicken which was crispy and tasty... the dressing was good as well.  I'm picky when it comes to my bleu cheese dressing - this was not too mayo-ey.  Morgan had the eggs benedict and I'm pretty sure she enjoyed it - she ate it all.  I would come to this location again if I was in the area and couldn't decide what else to eat again ;o)  Four stars for great service and decent food."}
{"text":"The service is excellent. The waitresses couldn't be any nicer. The look of the place is cool/vintage, and I hear it's the original 5 & Diner. However, the cheeseburger I ordered was soggy and the sweet potato fries were burned. As neat as this place is, I just didn't feel these items were worth the cost. Maybe next time I'll leave feeling impressed."}
{"text":"Candy took care of us....ALL 15 of us! Our Saturday night biking group showed up and Candy professionally and friendly took care of all.  We ate outside as the weather was terrific at past 8 pm.   Thanks Candy, hope to make it back again, soon."}
{"text":"Visited today with two grandchildren, ages 2 and 7. Fries that came with children's menu mac 'n cheese were overdone, too brown & crunchy. Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.  Our waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too.   Our waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), \"We don't combine cards!\" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.  Today's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again. It simply doesn't impress me with its service or its food."}
{"text":"We live close by and pass this place frequently but had never stopped in.  Because my husband likes to have shakes at places that give you the extra in the mixing container we stopped in tonight.  50's decor through out and this location is all booths and the counter for seating.  I ordered the all you can eat fish fry and when I asked the server what type of fish she did not know, my husband got the grilled chicken sandwich  he enjoyed his sandwich and we both got the strawberry milkshakes.   We wanted our shakes with our meal and the server obliged us however when our food came out she told us our shakes were done but that they were out of clean glasses so they would be delayed and of course when we got them they were basically just strawberry flavored milk; not cool at all. My fish was very good, homemade not out of the freezer pre-made. But the thought that I may want to take advantage of my all you can eat fish fry was met with oh we are out of fish; only later for her to bring out three small pieces WTH.  I don't think we will be back here unless we are feenin' for some fabulous fifties decor; not sure our meal was worth $38 including the tip. Oh they still have to balloon guy too; he is really talented."}
{"text":"Food - not so good.  I've eaten here twice for breakfast.  The first time I got a basic eggs, potatoes, meat dish and it was okay.  The second time I got california eggs benedict - big mistake.  The Hollandaise sauce was disgusting, and did not look like Hollandaise.  It looked more like cheeze whiz.  I scraped it off.  I wouldn't say run like the hills if you're hungry, but I also won't eat there again unless I have to."}
{"text":"Ever since the 5 n Diner at Arrowhead was closed we've wanted to visit the 16th St 5 n Diner.  A little out of our way - but we finally just went.  We loved the Arrowhead diner and ate there 2-3 times a month.  I guess whoever owned the land forced the diner out, tore the building down and built a brand new building housing 5 little businesses...  So, the 16th St 5 n Diner is ok...Ample parking. Severs and staff were pleasant...facility was clean but in need of some repairs.  The inside is small - seemed crowed to us compared to the Arrowhead diner and it was LOUD - ie had a high noise level.  Some of the booths had their vinyl booths taped together.  We were in and out within 45 minutes.    Food was ok...burgers were ordered medium well and were Crispy on the outside and decent on the inside.  Fries...seemed to be stale...I had a chocolate shake and it was good.  My wife says she wouldn't go out of her way, again, to visit this location."}
{"text":"We decided to use a coupon from our community support booklet today and ended up at 5& Diner. Before walking in we realized we had 2 coupons for a buy one, get one free entree (2 drink purchase as well).  So seeing it would expire soon we gave one away to a table of three eating outside. We went in ,ordered and food was delivered promptly,  and our waitress was kind and courteous (thank you waitress with pink hair). We paid leaving her a decent tip and walked out side. We both smoke and were very very full so we were walking and talking around the outer area of the parking lot so our smoke bothered no one. Then in the back of the restaurant (possibly an employee break area)a lady yelled rudely \" CAN I HELP YOU  \" she was smoking as well. We replied \"we were just having a cigarette after eating \"then she turned and  walked off. I'm sorry but when your assuming something and wrong, at least apologize . We certainly did nothing wrong,we weren't even by vehicles, and making sure our smoked cigarette butts were out and placed in the garbage. Not visiting here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Elvis in the house and all of our fifths icon with merriment. Love my black and white, the banana malt let's be real. Smell like Arnold's  in  \"happy days \" I believe would smell.  I ordered the onion rings and pleased a chicken fried breakfast meal is coming so I hoping. Real cute but not desert at all but very Midwest in the desert \"Go Snowbirds and thanks \""}
{"text":"It's the '50's all over again!  Great fun!  The food's authentic to the period.  Service is good. Prices are reasonable.   Jukebox at the table [awesome cool!]."}
{"text":"I love 5 and Diners and I feel bad giving this one a bad review but really there were so many mistakes made I just can't bring it up to 3 stars.   On the good side I really liked our server Valerie.   On the bad side I ordered a cheeseburger with chips and what I was brought was a bacon burger or bacon cheeseburger, whichever, with fries. I noticed the fries right away and told her I had ordered chips so she took it back and switched them, but I didn't notice that the cheeseburger had bacon on it until after I took a bite. It did taste good so I decided to go ahead and eat it and see which one I was charged for. The bacon one of course was a dollar more.    She had asked how I wanted the meat prepared and one of the things I liked about 5 and Diner is the fact that you could get your meat cooked just the way you like it. I told her medium rare. She repeated it back to me but when the hamburger arrived it was actually more medium than rare. It tasted great but there was no pink in it at all so that was a disappointment. One reason I'd  been anxious to return to the Arizona Mills location was because the meat was so delicious  and cooked perfectly, grilled outside, pink inside.  It was still good so I  decided to go ahead and eat it. She didn't come back to fill our water until we asked although she did ask us several times did we need anything. I did have tummy issues the next day. I won't go into details.  The milkshake was delicious. I forgot to order malt in it which is 50 cents more.  She was nice enough to divide it between 2 to-go cups because the kids were getting fussy so we had 2 generous  cups with chocolate cherry milkshake for about $4.59. Both of the hamburger meals were just pennies away from 10 dollars each which I personally think it's kind of high for a hamburger.   We had the opportunity to ask Valerie if she knew what had happened to the 5 and Diner at Arizona Mills and she told us she had been the owner of it and it broke her heart to have to close it but the shopping center assessed some very high tax fees on the business that was more than she could afford to pay even though business was booming. You know you can't just pay all your income out on taxes, rent and such, you gotta make something.   I would honestly hesitate to go back to this location because of all the errors that were made and the tummy problems I had the next day. Maybe next trip I will try the Scottsdale location because it seems to have really good reviews."}
{"text":"These guys don't have anything on the menu that is less than delicious.  But that is not how they get 5 stars from me - it is their outstanding service.  Tonight, a delivery service was supposed to deliver a dinner from 5 and Diner, but it never arrived.  It was not 5 and Diners fault, but when I called to reorder my dinner, they offered to discount my dinner.  I hope the management team for this location reads this and understands that you have a loyal customer for life thanks to the team that takes care of your customers."}
{"text":"Big time thumbs up all the way around!  4 gals needed some breakfast/lunch after a night at the casino.  3 of us are visiting from Oregon.  Spotless, great location, interesting menu.  The manager Paula was our server and she was a little ball of fire...made us all feel very special!  Food was excellent.  Big fluffy omelets, 2 in our party had different versions of a rueben....one was declared to be the Best Sandwich she had EVER eaten....and honey, we are no spring chickens.  A destination!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Saturday morning breakfast joint.  It is a very fun atmosphere with the 50's style booths, jukeboxes, and poodle-skirt wearing staff.  The staff is extremely friendly and they always seat us in a booth with some extra room for our baby car seat.  They serve great-tasting breakfast and a LOT of it at a reasonable price.  I only gave 4 stars because I don't particularly like this place for lunch or dinner.  The lunch and dinner menu is a bit too greasy and fattening for my taste so I will stick with breakfast."}
{"text":"In the year or so since I wrote my first review for 5 & Diner, ownership has changed hands. The first thing the new owner did was get rid of the crew (some had been working there 12+ years) and replace them with a very... How should I say... WHITE crew. The previous crew were mostly indians and some Mexicans (the joint is located on the reservation after all). But I suppose it was too dark for the new owners liking.  The next thing the new owner changes was the menu.  Cheaper options and less flavorful foods. Now, if you want a water you have to ask, where they used to bring one out right when you sat down.  When we used to get our food in 5 minutes or less (sometimes in only 3 minutes after ordering it), now it takes 15-20 minutes, even if the place is half empty. We wanted it to work, and visited 4 times after the new owners took over, but alas..  We shall never go back."}
{"text":"Diner was awesome. Food was amazing. The buffalo chicken quesadilla was exceptional. Had a lovely waitress as well."}
{"text":"Whenever I am there, I always feel welcomed by the staff and I have never had a problem with service.  The food good and the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"So disappointing. My daughter, husband, grandson and I all visited this location on a Saturday afternoon at around 2 P.M. We were seated quickly, but were not greeted by a waitress until at least 10 minutes later. Our order was taken, and it took around 30 minutes for the food to arrive. The grown ups ordered the Hound Dogs with Fries and for the little guy it was the chicken nuggets and fries. When the food arrived the hot dogs were luke warm and the fries appeared undercooked and greasy. The hot dog bun was cooked to the point of being super crunchy ugh! As for the chicken nuggets... WAY overdone and not tasty at all. We should have sent all of the food back, but were hungry and frustrated by the time it came to our table. We all ate about half our food and left the rest for the trash. The only reason it even earned 2 stars is for the atmosphere and nostalgia."}
{"text":"Service was not the best the eggs were dry and sausage was not good. The waffle is good, but not the best breakfast place."}
{"text":"Always a good place. Customer service is top notch and they always check up on you even if you are sitting outside. It's a step up from Denny's to be sure. Around the same price too! This is the only 24 hr location that I know of."}
{"text":"I have been to this 5 & Diner three times. The first time I ordered the French Toast breakfast plate and I must say it was outstanding. The second time around I tried their Hot Wings traditional style with no sauce and they could compete for the worst wings I had in my life award but I gave them a break because it was 3am (even though they are open 24hrs), the wings were very small, over cooked, and just fried  plain then had seasoning salt threw over them. Anyway I gave this place another shot, but this time around I chose to stick with breakfast and ordered the Strawberry and Whipped Cream Pancakes while my date ordered Chicken Fried Steak with a side of Fresh Fruit. As my Pancakes arrived they just seemed as if they were not freshly made so it took a minute for me to dig into them and I wasn't really in the mood to complain so I just went with them. So in between time me and my date are conversing and she had already started in on her fruit bowl. Then she politely shows me this HUGE FLY resting in peace on here chunk of Honey-Dew Melon. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Went for an early Saturday morning breakfast.  Even at 6:30 it was fairly busy with about a dozen cars in the lot and several booths filled inside.  Interestingly, the following week when I stopped by to take a picture about the same time there was not one car in the lot.   I felt the booth seats were too close to the table as opposed to too far away like Black Bear.  I guess that is why I usually ask for a table as I seem to be more comfortable. I was greeted and seated right away.  In general the service was good right up until I was ready to pay and leave and had trouble flagging my waiter down and then got thrown off a bit by the waiter also being a mobile cashier so I had to sit back down and wait for him to get within range again.  I ordered a Jim's special, a egg scramble with ground beef, onions, mushrooms and I think peppers.  This sounded on paper like a dish that had potential for some flavor.  Not one thing in the dish stood out.  If I were cooking that dish it would have been cooked in butter which would have helped but none of the ingredients were that tasty on their own.  It was certainly ok though."}
{"text":"We bring the dogs on the patio and the servers are great and friendly with the dogs, and they seem to like us humans too.  Service is always kind and friendly, always get compliments on the dogs from other customers.  This is a really nice place for breakfast.  I like the Eggs Benedict, the dogs highly recommend the double smoked ham!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place for lunch on the patio with the dogs.  Staff is always pleasant and so are the customers. After our oldest boy died we received good wishes from all the staff at 5 & Diner.  That was very nice.   Good food, great malts.  Any place that serves good food and lets me bring my dogs gets my business!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like greasy diner food after a night of drinking! I know I do!! Friend and I wound up down at the 5 & Diner off 16th st, and man it was like close to 2am and this place was popping, people sitting outside, people on the inside made me think what the heck are all the folks doing up this late, then just shrugged my shoulders and found a table to sit at.   I ordered a steak bombsomethinganother omelet, which was a steak omelet that had peppers, onions, cheese and eggs served with hash browns and English muffin, man I love English muffins!  The omelet was good, I of course loaded it with hot sauce cuz it needed heat. But it was good diner food and just what I wanted!  The staff was friendly, service was fast and the entire time I was there, there was a steady flow of people coming and going, I guess this 5 & Diner is the spot to go!  Yes I had a fun Friday night.......i do love my weekends!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in these guys. I've been going here for years and always enjoyed the food. Not so anymore. I switched to an overnight shift and stopped here on the way home around 5am. Both times on a Monday morning. No other customers and both times my food was really sub par. Hash browns that were just greasy and not even browned. Today, the sausage links weren't even cooked all the way through. If I'd had more time and could've found my server, I would've had the food re cooked. Never should've gotten to my table this way. Ended up with the trots from the food today. Won't be back. Lenny would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Incredibly polite and efficient service.  Plus, no wait on a Sunday afternoon, which is the exact opposite of, say, IHOP.  We came for breakfast and were bowled away by how great the service was - the waiter had every possible configuration of questions on how we'd like out food, and even offered salsa as soon as the entrees came out.  I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs but sure, what the hell.  Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my buttery hashbrowns in it and going to town.  Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy.  My husband had an omlette which he seemed to enjoy, though the portion looked just a tad small.  Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more.  They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit.  I hope not, because I definitely will return."}
{"text":"Loved it, ever want a bigg burger and good too then this is your spot. Happened too find it as we were driving around looking for something else and boi are we glad we found this place. Big Bopper Burger was awesome."}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Saturday nite so we had a short 10 minute wait. Not too bad. I asked for a burger. Just a plain burger, no cheese, with lettuce and tomato. Onion rings on the side. The waiter suggested I try this special sauce so I did. My daughter had a pastrami sandwich and a strawberry shake. Our meals came about 20 minutes later. The waiter filled our water glasses regularly but I think that was because it gave him a chance to talk to the cute young girls at the table next to us. So he'd fill our glasses quickly, then turn around and talk to the girls next door for a few minutes. I think he was trying to ask one of them out.   My burger was a little dry and the sauce was a weird color. It was ok but nothing special. The onion rings tasted like they were freshly made tho. My daughter really liked her pastrami sandwich. The strawberry shake was pretty good too.   Noise level was energetic and the burger was nothing special. I could come here again and try something different, or come for lunch instead of dinner. But there are so many great places to get even better burgers around town that I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast and nostalgia   Good servers and Sylvia /Autumn. Old diner feel but pretty good food."}
{"text":"Food was good enough.  The service was as good and our waitress was attentive. Date: 11 October, Dinner  The issue: I have a familhy of four.  We walk in and the host starts walking pass the counter area where you can sit ion the bar stools.  She starts to sit us on the end table nearest the kitchen by the exit.  I asked to sit at one of the two tables we passed that was empty.  She couldn't say no but the look on her face was of surprise.  I took my youngest son to the bathroom and I saw at least ten tables and booths available at the main dining room.  I made a note of the diversity of the customers and yes, the majortiy that was by the counter areas were non-caucasian.  Approximately 13 minutes later, the table behind me as open and I saw the host escort a couple to the same table she tried to sit us in.    All tables were for four so it wasn't because there were only two of them.  Yes, they were interacial.  I am in the U.S military service and have served my country for over 25 years with two mobiliizations behind me.  I fight and gladly go where my country tells me to with no complaints.  I just don't feel that this is right.  When are we going to stop this ignorant racism out of our lives.  This just saddens me that racism is still being passed down to our younger generations, either by parents or businesses."}
{"text":"We spent 10 days in Phoenix and ate out at tons of different restaurants with our 2 little kids.  I only wish that we had found the 5 & Diner on day one!  We had breaksfast here on our last morning.  Price and quality were fantastic, especially the kids' menu.  Portions were healthy, but not overwhelming...just right.  Loved it.  Service was great.  Friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Home-style pancakes, eggs, potatoes and milk shakes with 50's music in the background.  What a fun little find in the middle of Phoenix.  Come hungry and leave full!"}
{"text":"It's a really good greasy spoon. They try a little too hard on the ambiance but the food is great.  So why only 4 stars? No wi-fi. I like to read the morning news on my iPad with breakfast and cellular is slower.  But aside from that - it's great."}
{"text":"I love 5 & diner, we go during the week when we get off work and don't feel like cooking! Its like home cooking. I am very disappointed with who ever was cooking tonight ive never complained about their food. The chicken wings were horribly over cooked and so was the burgers the fries and chips were not seasoned at all. I hope they have the other cook working again soon because this makes me not want to come back :( the server was amazing about it. She is getting a good tip and we will come back! She definitely made me change 2 stars to 5!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and ordered the special which was hot roast beef sandwich. Looked great when it came out however after taking some of the mashed potatoes under the hot gravy I was horrified to find the potatoes to be cold! As if they were in the refrigerator cold!  So, this could mean one of two things 1- their potatoes were shipped refrigerated or 2- they were leftovers!  Yuck!!!  The only reason they got 3 stars is because the staff was nice. Won't go back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to 5 & Diner and luckily didn't experience any of the long waits or messed up orders that some other reviewers experienced. When we walked in we were seated right away and decided on the bar stools since they looked fun and we enjoy watching the kitchen at work.    Our waitress (Annie I believe?) was extremely nice and efficient.  She checked on us regularly and refilled our drinks quickly.  I had the pancakes which were just okay - they weren't bad, but not as good as other places around town.  He had the corn beef hash meal with eggs and it was tasty.    Take a walk around the place and check out all the fun decor - wish the individual jukeboxes still worked and not just the big one in the middle of the restaurant.    Overall: B Not a bad breakfast stop off."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for breakfast at lunchtime, so I dropped by this location.  I was able to find a table pretty quickly.  I had my mind made up on what I wanted.....a Veggie Omelet (Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Onions) w/Sourdough Toast and Hash Browns. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JFhfVTt_8xNjtwqSD-raIw?select=M3s_sXbAS8D-Cfylaa6Qww  The food came out fast and I was surprised to see large slices of Tomatoes on top of the Omelet instead of chopped up inside.....this was the first time I've ever had a Veggie Omelet like that.....turns out I like it this way!  The Omelet was cooked well, not runny....which is a good thing.  The only thing I didn't like about the Omelet was the Mushrooms....they were definitely canned and not cut fresh...other than that, it was a solid Omelet.  The Hash Browns were OK, and the Sourdough Toast was very good....should have asked for it dry, but forgot to do that.  I like my Toast dry.  Overall, it was a nice breakfast during lunch.  Return Factor - 70%"}
{"text":"I really dig this place.  If you want classic American diner fare, this is where to go.   It's cheap.  It's fast. The portions are large.   And it's pretty tasty.   I highly recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak and eggs breakfast.   They have a real grill.  The food has grillmarks!  Score!    If you want fancy, smancy food, this place will not appeal to you. It's the same food you could get at IHOP or Denny's, but a lot better."}
{"text":"We had deep dish apple pie and milkshakes. Both were very good.  Staff was friendly, and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place has good food but it seems over priced for a diner. My boyfriend & I each ordered a standard menu item & somehow our total was 40. Mind you I ordered a breakfast item (French toast, I can't remember what he ordered)  The inside is cute even though we ordered take out.  I would like to try it again but the over priced food is a big deterrent."}
{"text":"Not sure why people actually eat here, although I do like the theme and decor.  However, the food is sub-standard.  Even eggs, which are difficult to cook badly, just aren't very good.  Greasy food in a neat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe and the service we had it was amazing. But the food wasn't all that great. My husband god the guacamole burger and the guacamole tasted old and rotten. I got the la bombs and it was so bland and tasted just like a grilled cheese. It would of tasted better had it been made with pepper jack cheese and added some caramelized onions. We had friend pickles as an appetizer and they were pretty decent could definitely use a little less salt. The malts are amazing however and so was the small car show that they do every first Friday of the month."}
{"text":"Slow service ok food.Dirty looking floors food took 45 minutes to come out everyone looked like they were just going thru the motions.This place needs a facelift."}
{"text":"When I was a kid my dad would always put blue cheese on everything.  I thought it was discussting and would not eat anything with blue cheese for years.  Last night for some crazy reason I ordered the black and blue buger at BJ's.  Best burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive service.   I had the waffle breakfast and it was delicious, really delicious. Everything on my plate was cooked to perfection and I felt all warm and fuzzy inside.   My partner in eating crime went for the chicken fried steak - and was very pleased. I stole a bite or two and it was really good, the gravy was top notch - and isn't that what life is really all about?!"}
{"text":"Nice 50's atmosphere albeit noisy. Had breakfast of eggs, ham and \"home fries.\" Potatoes were frozen from a bag, not fresh. Biscuits were frozen from a bag. Service was OK. Seems to be popular with the 70+ crowd."}
{"text":"This is a staple for my husband and I. We've been coming here for a while now and it has always been very good with the exception of today.    I made my own breakfast with corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy, and hash browns.  It was not very warm when it was brought out to us but it was so busy and I was starving so I didn't want to wait any longer than we already had.  Normally this is my favorite thing to get when we come here but today it left much to be desired. I used to love their bacon but it seems they have switched vendors as the last couple of times we've gone, I didn't like it. And it's hard for me not to like bacon!   My husband got the Philly cheesesteak and said the bread was good but the rest of it not so much.   This is a place we normally love to go to but today was definitely an unsuccessful trip. It could have been because it was Mother's Day and it was busy but that should not affect the quality of food."}
{"text":"Great alternative if your tired of chili's-like restaurants. Burgers here are very good and a great selection of really tasty shakes!"}
{"text":"Love the milkshakes nice and thick multiple flavors to choose from. Don't forget you can't forget the whip cream and cherry on the top.  Taste great on those 109 % days!"}
{"text":"\"The last Stop before The 60s,\" And My first stop when I am craving chicken pot pie and cherry coke.  Whenever I come here, I can't help feeling like I am in \"back to the future II\" and mc fly is going to walk in the front door at any moment.  The diner is something you would see on a 50s movie set. Checkerboard floors, old movie posters and portraits of classic movie stars, fire engine red vinyl booths, mini juke boxes on the tables, and the big bopper blaring from the overhead speakers. You are transported back to a time when a gallon of gas cost $.18c , and life seemed...well, cheaper.  There is a reason why ZAGAT has awarded 5&Diner \"top family restaurant,\" for its fun and child friendly atmosphere - as well as winning accolades from AOL City Guide, The Rep, Phoenix Magazine, and New Times  for \"best cheap eats, breakfast, best diner, hamburger, and best late night dining\"  This particular location is only open until 11p, but there are other valley locations such as the 16th street diner that are open for 24 hours, and I have been there on numerous occasions with the after-bar crowd to feast on one of their 12 signature burgers such as the \"Blue Moon Burger\"   Shakes, malts, chocolate sodas, pies, burgers, and fries...you know what to expect from a diner, and you will get it!"}
{"text":"The 5 & diner provides everything you would expect in a comfort food place. From breakfast anytime to comfort foods such as burgers, meatloaf and chicken pot pie. Its a cute place, and when you are in the mood for a walk back into simpler times, or just a cup of coffee it's a great place to  be. I had the breakfast skillet and it was filling and good, while hubby had the meatloaf dinner. They even have an outdoor dog friendly patio which I know Ralphie will appreciate when we go again. Skip on over to enjoy that cup of coffee or milkshake while listening to that 50's music!"}
{"text":"As far as diners go, this one was excellent and the reason for 5 stars is because of how good it was.  The interior and exterior are reminiscent of the old time diner, but with a lot of these places the food falls far short of expectations. That was not the case at 5&diner. It's clean and the service was great, with 50's music playing. I had the meatloaf which was better then Mom's and hubby had the Mrs. Cleaver pot roast. Both great dishes at an affordable price made even better with milkshakes that were awesome. A great find here in the Phoenix area well worth a stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"First time and all though the place was nice and staff were lovely, the food wasn't to good.. I tried biscuit and gravy meal and couldn't finish that and then I tried a pancake cause I'm still hungry and that left me feeling dissatisfied. Didn't even finish half of that. Wth dude.  Bacon was burnt and all the other stuff had no flavor. Blahhhh High note I'm on my second cup of coffee. :) music is playing and the a.c. is on 75°."}
{"text":"So horrible just left the restaurant they served me raw chicken strips! Like dead ass raw chicken strips not even half way cooked . I was so upset all they could say was aw man I walked out so fast I will NEVER COME BACK"}
{"text":"Five and D!!!!! What a great spot. It's always open. Always. And things there manage to be pretty consistent, which must be tough with a revolving staff both inside the kitchen and out.  As a late night scene, it is a fantastic place to pick up a milkshake and some cheese fries (If you're daring, go for the chili cheese fries). It always gets a crazy mix of people at those hours so even just observing is pretty hysterical.   What many people don't know is that it's also a great breakfast spot. Omelettes, waffles, toast, and pancakes are all present and tasty.  And lastly, it is a pretty darn good lunch and dinner joint. I'm a big fan of the Surf City sandwich but the Teriyaki Pineapple Burger has lately become my numero uno.    Phoenix would not be the same without Five and Diner."}
{"text":"Usually I very much enjoy the burgers and other items from this location which I can usually also order for delivery from. I don't know if there's a change in management but suddenly despite them being on Yelp this page, through GrubHub which is delivery generally, they only let me know it was for pick up after the fact when my card has been charged. When I calmly called and spoke to the first person who was nice and told me she would let the manager know I thought everything would be okay, the manager however interrupted me in the middle of me speaking calmly about the situation and told me she did not have to put up with me because I asked you not to interrupt so I can explain the situation and was very rude and hung up on me. Thankfully I will be able to get a refund through my bank however will I be ordering from them again? I don't think so and if you think you can order from delivery from them here think again because it might be a waste of your time."}
{"text":"My children LOVED this place, and so did I.  The waiters/waitresses were so much fun, and the food was great.  This is being written in past tense because we no longer live in AZ, but it was always one of our favorite dinner-time haunts.  Their shakes were FABULOUS, and their burgers were equally as good.  I wish we had a place like that out here."}
{"text":"Pretty good out of town family always seems to like coming here. They have really good chorizo and good service for a diner. Food is typical diner type of fare kind. One Hispanic waitress is really good."}
{"text":"About the only thing I can eat is the potatoes.  That said, I've tried other there while \"cheating\" like their omelettes.  I am not impressed.  How can anyone be impressed with processed cheese and greasy gobs of hash browns???  ick.  Next time, I'm lobbying for Waffle House.  Plus, the last time I was there, I was recovering from surgery and in a wheelchair.  The person at the front taking names and seating people was downright rude.  Yes, she was young and ignorant, but she still acted badly."}
{"text":"Dirty and the food was not good. Service was so slow, I don't see them being open much longer. Jukeboxes at the table don't work."}
{"text":"Sarah the waitress was extremely friendly and a pleasure to have. Southeest skillet was delicious! Atmostphere was simple and nice."}
{"text":"Reliably good breakfast that is a step up quality-wise from the average greasy spoon, more flavorful than Denny's et al, and has good service.  Yes, it is a diner and a chain, but when I'm looking for a good, uncomplicated, non-fancyschmancy breakfast, this is where I go.  No waiting in lines forever for the newest trendy breakfast spot, we get seated here almost immediately because we sit outside.    I like the skillets, the omelets, and an uncomplicated egg breakfast.  I've also come here later in the day and enjoyed their burgers, while my friends have tried the meatloaf and other entrees without complaint.  This isn't fancy cuisine, it's diner food, and for diner food I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since I was a kid! I'm in the neighborhood. The food is delicious, staff is always so lively. Great environment. For all ages. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We were looking for a diner for brunch, and we sure got one! The service here isn't the fastest, but the staff is nice and attentive. I got the BYO skillet with mushrooms, onion, and turkey sausage, and it a little underseasoned, but that's why there's salt and pepper on the side! Their onion rings are breaded and deeeelicious. I also really enjoyed the biscuit. All in all, a charming place with decent breakfast foods.   I will also add that their milkshakes look AMAZING. Next time, l'll be sure to try one."}
{"text":"A New Year's Eve hot chocolate hunt brought myself and two friends here around 2am.  Although the place was pretty busy, we were seated almost immediately in a booth. It was only after being seated that I really got to take in the decor; total 1950's tin can diner from soup to nuts. The waitresses looked like they had just stepped out of Grease, there was a counter lined with stationary stools behind which you could see the cooks working away, and every booth had a mini jukebox where you could enter in songs that would play over the sound system. I loved it! Even more than that, our waitress was exceptionally attentive.  We got our orders put in not two minutes after being seated - two hot chocolates, a sprite, one Marilyn's Bread Pudding, and one Waffle Wonder. Our drinks came out first; my friend and I who each ordered the hot chocolate were at first delighted at how much whipped cream topped them off, but were quickly disappointed to find that the chocolate itself seemed to be made with water instead of milk. :(  Shortly after our beverages came our desserts. The bread pudding was devoured and got my bread pudding loving friend's seal of approval. The Waffle Wonder was shared, and as someone who doesn't like usually like sweet on sweet desserts I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it! The fudge, caramel, and whipped cream were straight out of my childhood, the fat scoop of vanilla ice cream was melting lusciouslly into the warm waffle, and the cinnamon was the perfect bit of spice.  Our waitress made sure to ask us if everything tasted okay a few minutes after dropping off our plates, and was right on time with the check once we finished. My short and sweet visit to this 5 and Diner was one of the most seamless experiences I had in Arizona. :)"}
{"text":"So dirty!!! Hair in our food three visits in a row and everything you order is saturated and butter or oil. No thank you! Especially not with Snooze, Luci's  and Daily Dose so close. Time to revamp!!"}
{"text":"A groovy experience.   Friendly staff and retro atmosphere. A treat.  I would recommend sitting close to a jukebox. I paid for a song and after our entire dining experience, right before I left, it came on. Thanks 5"}
{"text":"Food was okay, breakfast is best thing they serve, service is okay, hostesses are horrible.  Sad get bad experience right from the get go. Will never be eating here again."}
{"text":"I usually love places with a 50's diner atmosphere and walking into this place, it was no exception - it's cute. The jukebox, booths, decor, etc, etc make this a fun-looking place. The food (I had a burger) was okay, but nothing special. On another occasion, I went in with the sole purpose of getting a chocolate malt to go for my boyfriend and it was over $6 for just a malt. That was the point when I realized I would never be back to 5 & Diner. I think that's outrageous and hell, they're almost robbing you."}
{"text":"Ate here with my people for lunch a couple of weeks ago.   They were slammed, but a table opened up just as we walked in so we were seated immediately.  I had an albacore tuna melt with fries and a lemonade, and my wife had a burger with onion rings and a cherry coke.  The food was very good, hot, and served quickly.  Our waiter was prompt & friendly.    Cute 50's atmosphere, but it interested me how many security cameras are mounted throughout the place.  It's not a large joint, but there are 4 or 5 video cameras in there for some reason.    My only complaint is the pricing. I was expecting a burger in a \"5 & Diner\" to be $5 or $6.  It was $9.  This is greasy comfort food -- and good greasy comfort food at that -- but that's just too pricey for greasy comfort food, especially in this type of setting.  I would have given this place 4 stars if we hadn't ended up spending over $40 for lunch for 2 (2 sandwiches with fries/rings, 2 drinks + a milkshake to go for my wife).  This lunch was worth $25.  No more."}
{"text":"I've eaten @ the Five & Diner many times with my husband & friends. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, I've always had a great dining experience & look forward to the next time I visit. The portions are large, the food absolutely tastes homemade & reminds me of eating my grandma's delicious homemade cooking. The open faced beef sandwich on sourdough bread with mashed potatoes & gravy is my very favorite meal. The service is always excellent, even if it's real busy. A great place to go for old fashioned home cooked food."}
{"text":"I swung by this 5 & Diner an hour before closing (8 p.m.) tonight to introduce my boyfriend to the restaurant that I loved going to as a kid.  When we got in the door, we were promptly ignored for a few minutes as we stood around for someone to seat us. We were not greeted or even so much as looked at while we were standing, and there were at least 3 visible employees on the floor: the hostess, a server, and a busser.  Needless to say, we walked out. Being totally ignored like we were invisible to the employees standing 3 feet in front of us wasn't exactly a welcoming feeling.  It was completely disappointing as I was hoping to make this a place my boyfriend and I could attend for date nights. We won't be trying this location again, especially since other reviews for this 5 & Diner are citing the same issue we experienced."}
{"text":"About 3 weeks ago, I had breakfast at 5&Diner with a colleague, we rarely have a day off together.  It was perfect.  PERFECT!  3 eggs, over medium, and I mean they were perfectly cooked \"medium\", best hashed browns I've had since the Aristocrat in Boulder, awesome!  Went back two weeks ago, ordered the same the same menu; the food came up so quickly, it had to have been just sitting there, an overcook, whatever, it wasn't \"fresh\".  I know this much for sure: it wasn't nearly as good as the first visit.  Today, a late breakfast, I enter about 10:55am and I get the last table.  Now, I've been in the restaurant business and when the hostess fucking apologizes to the waitress for sitting the single patron at the last table, I'm already a little pissed.  I tell the server I heard that comment and \"...I'll TRY to be a good little patron\", kiss my ass.  I order right away, so probably close to 11:00am.  At 11:36, I give her a HUGE EYE-ROLL, \"where is my food\" and she say's she'll check.    She'll check?  [I want to take a moment to talk about CONSISTENCY.  If a restaurant is so prompt so as to have served me almost instantly on my prior visit, you cannot justify a 36-minute PLUS wait for any reason.  More on the \"reason\" why the order was so late in a moment]  I said, \"no thank you.  Allow me to pay for the coffee and OJ and I'll be on my way\".  The server was nice, mgt said no chg for the beverages -- thank you and there shouldn't have been a chg -- I even said to her, \"It's not your fault.  I have no cash, I'll come back with a tip.\"  Which I would have done had she not said, \"...it was the 'extra crispy' on the hashed browns.\"  In other words, my order was 20 minutes late because I wanted extra crispy hashed browns.  BALDERDASH!  THAT'S B.S  Last, TOO MANY FLIES!  GET A PEST-STRIP. SOMETHING!  I'll never come back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we love diners and this place did not disappoint us. We were greeted with a smile and seated right away. We ordered the chicken fajita salad and the breakfast skillet.  The salad came with salsa, sour cream and homemade ranch dressing. All this in a big tortilla shell. It was more than enough for dinner. The skillet was great too.  Good service great food good prices. What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Fried Steak for my free birthday meal. That probably shows my foodie ignorance, as who knows what meat is tucked in that fried, breaded coating with gravy. The whole plate was worse than I remember chow hall food when I was in the military. I sent the iced tea (probably another poor choice) back.  \"How was everything?\" the cashier asked when I left.   \"Free,\" I said.  \"Oh good, glad you enjoyed it.\"   I let it go."}
{"text":"Fair prices. Very small so expect a wait. Normal b-fest selections. Very cute atmosphere!! Best to visit durning week days not weekends :)"}
{"text":"The wait staff from the late, lamented Ed Devebic's [I know that's not spelled right!!] landed on their feet at 5 & Diner!! Yep, you can still dine with Pebbles, Minnie Mouse and Grocho at this stainless steel and mirrored tribute to the 1950s. Yummmm!   We were just there again last night for sliders and iced tea. The shakes are also the thing here, not many tables but there's usually a place at the counter, the prices are great and it's just a lot of fun.   But the tableside jukebox didn't work last time...sigh. Other than that it's a fun fab place for 24-hour dining!!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place and have been to two locations.  Both locations were in serious need of a good cleaning.  The last visit, my husband found a small hair in his eggs.  I really hope the owners spend a bit of money to deep clean, maybe repaint, their restaurants.  It would make a world of difference."}
{"text":"Love this place,  very friendly service. The new Yorker is delicious and Chloe is Awesome."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time . The food was really good , reasonably priced . I loved the decor , and our waitress was very sweet . She did a great job ! I will be back ..."}
{"text":"Went a couple times for lunch.   Both times ordered the basic burger (don't remember what the nomenclature was).   Both times, the meat was overcooked and dry.   The lettuce was wilted from the heat.  The last time I went the lettuce was wilted and still had a couple 'critters' along for the ride.   Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind a bug or two - I buy organic when I can and they just are part of the deal (no pesticide use).    But still, you need to wash the lettuce before you serve - just common sense here folks.  Couple this with the overcooked meat - stereotypical fries - and you have the perfect recipe for me to avoid!     Can't recommend.   Hey, if you're in the area and stone drunk and gotta eat - well then maybe but that's the only exception I can make!"}
{"text":"On our way to Grandma's house  and find this on the way.  Very classic diner look and feel. Waitress  was really nice also.  I ordered a green chile burger with onion rings and a root beer shake.  When the burger came out and the smell of the green chile, almost heaven. The burger overall was good but didnt blow me away. The onion rings where good also but samething, nothing great. The thing i liked the most about the onion rings was the coating. My complaint about them was that you couldnt bite thru the onion without pulling the whole thing out, which ruins it for me. The shake was great. I would go back here. There was a lot of different burgers i would try."}
{"text":"Great little diner with a retro 50's flare. Good food!"}
{"text":"Had a to go order child's plate was grilled cheese was burnt to a crisp and french fries have been refried and cold! What kids don't deserve a decent meal?"}
{"text":"They are getting a 4 star because of great service.  That is not to say that their food was bad, it was a solid 3 star, but normal what you would expect from a old fashion diner like this.  I had sliders, they also served breakfast all day which looked good.  Everyone was happy, but the stand out tonight was the service of this place.  They take care of everything and really are helpful."}
{"text":"If you have read my reviews before, been in the business for over 30+ years! - Had a smell of a GREASE TRAP when I walked in!!! My question is looking at other reviews, were they having a TRAP BUILD-UP, or something else!!!! WELL GUESS WHAT - If I was an inspector for NSF, I bet they had OIL THAT WAS BLACK and THAT IS SAD!!! If you have proper training, you can save $$$$$ by FILTERING TWICE A DAY and to BOIL OUT YOUR FRYERS EVERY WEEK!!!! The server was told, and NOTHING DONE!!! Will not be back! PLEASE NOTE: If the 5 & Diner Chain is still the way I remember, all locations are franchised, so please do not think every one is this way!"}
{"text":"I wanted a diner to remind me of the east coast Greek family owned mega-cafeterias that are reliable, completely vast in their offerings, and somehow always ready with dessert.  I found the Five and Diner.  And although it cannot actually compare to all the Diners on HWY 1, the effort is found in the food, the price, and the throw back to the fifties. Good for that time when all you really want is breakfast food at midnight and a milkshake.  You could bring a date here...but just keep in mind that the name of the place will either let that person know you are frugal or not yet stimulated by the economic injection by our new leadership."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place stays in business. I got the eggs Benedict and it was barely palatable. And it was $11. I know an excellent place close by that does a prociutto eggs Benedict perfectly for the same price and the place is a lot more upscale. The service was good I had a really sweet server named Piper. The sausage my daughter had was so awful I can't even describe it. How do you mess up sausage links? They are so oily and it tastes like old fryer oil. I'm pretty sure the only reason people come here is for the 1950's ambiance. I came here bc it's within walking distance and thought I'd give it a try. Next time I'll just cook at home. Do yourself a favor skip this place."}
{"text":"Great service! Susie Q really looks the part of a 1950's Diner. The kids loved it and Susie Q has a real hip change dispenser."}
{"text":"overpriced for \"beep-beep-beep\" everything, but some of the table jukeboxes work!  --omelet was too perfectly formed to be freshly made, ew. where did it come from? --they must have silenced the microwaves, or the beeping from the \"kitchen\" would have drowned out the music. --not much food prepared here, just reheat, serve, and charge a bundle for it  The recent availability of mostly-ready-to-serve food provided by Shamrock and its local competitors is mostly just scary. Don't have a grill? No problem, we can make your eggs benedict for you, almost-ready-to-serve. No toaster? No problem. We can deliver it pre-toasted. [stepping down...ok i'm done now]  I loved being able to select diner tunes from the table's mini-juke. It worked too! Note: some of the tables' jukes are possessed by demons and may suddenly start, or not work at all. Take your chances when dropping your two-bits.  I love the vibe, just not the food. Unfortunately, that's what I go to a restaurant for, THE FOOD."}
{"text":"Food was good staff nice but owner needs to take some personal pride clean up scrub new paint is cheap and when there is a leak in men's bathroom ceiling replace the drywall don't just cover it w paint and let it sag 3 inches down. Gross I hate to think what your home looks like. Could be a great business if you cared even a little"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in 8 years or more (since my days of bar closing~), but I decided to again, on a Monday night @ 9:30 pm.  Just AWFUL.  Waited more than 30 minutes for our food, then my salad came out WITH our dinners.  Chicken friend steak ok, but smothered in bad gravy...mashed potatoes might have been okay, but also ruined with a lot of BAD gravy.  The corn was crunchy-mushy.  I chose the fish & chips, which I feel should only be advertised with big window paint, if it's edible, I literally couldn't eat it...but the fries weren't bad.  The waitress said sorry for the wait, only one cook & he was slammed, but we were terribly disappointed.  I can't believe this place is still open, with so many good resturants holding on & stil more, popping up."}
{"text":"Went before a ball game for a late breakfast. 3 employees standing around the front chatting yet no one seemed to want to seat us, finally asked and we were promptly seated. Our server was very friendly.  Our order was correct and the food was ok.  The table side jukeboxes no longer work. My issue other than the less-than-friendly greeting was the cleanliness. Food all over, tables wiped with dirty rags ... Ugh.  We definitely won't go back"}
{"text":"So we decided to visit my sister in Arizona a couple of days ago.... and this is one of her favorite; wasn't happy that my coffee cup was dirty!! Besides that :parking, outside seating available, generous portions and reasonably priced, I had a skillet( potato & spinach!!Never mind the coffee incident I'm definitely coming back. Thanks sis."}
{"text":"Best milkshakes ever! 5 & Diner has a fun 50's vibe with great all American food. Everything I have had there has been good, but I'm especially addicted to their club sandwich and of course chocolate shakes. A fun blast from the past experience with tasty food and a fun staff."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  This time I just went for dessert and ordered an Oreo shake.  It's kind of hard to mess that up so I can't complain.  It is a large shake though I'll say that.  Service was fine, and it definitely has the 50s diner atmosphere.  They even have mini juke boxes at each table and you can pick a song for a quarter I think.  Tip: If you are looking for a late eat besides the 24-hour Mexican joint, this may work.  Open until 10 Sun-Thu, and until 11:30 Fri-Sat.  Or, the one on 16th St in Phoenix is open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"My first time here and with the franchise. Came in last night after eight in the evening, the manager greeted us and told us that shakes and appetizers were two dollars off. We ordered the Kettle Chips with no peppers, I was surprised. I had no idea what they were my bf did and it was really good. Then he got the New Yorker while I got the Philly Cheese Steak. Both were really good. Then we got one chocolate shake and split it between us. Considering a long day after Christmas decorations and shopping, this was needed and we were so hungry. I wouldn't order the appetizer for myself because even though I shared it, all that food made me want to die after we left but my taste buds were happy. Lol  Staff was super super nice, polite and attentive with our needs. I don't know why there is only three stars for this place but I think it's  improved from whatever  problems it's had in the past."}
{"text":"Thanks to Derek r.'s review, I thought I'd add my $.02.   It's been awhile since I last dined here (at least a couple of years), as I try to support non-chain restaurants these days, but I enjoyed the few dining experiences here, solo and w/ relatives.  Servers were always friendly and efficient.  Tables, chairs, booths, and women's restroom were clean. If you're one to check out those mailers that arrive in your mailbox from time to time, you'll know that 5 & Diner usually has BOGO offers on there (buy one, get one).    Years ago ('03, '04?), this very location sold, during Christmas season, upcoming new year calendars that had cute 50's theme pics.  Each month's page offered coupons such as BOGO, free children's entree with paying adult, or a free shake w/ an entree.  Does anyone know if this promotion is still running every Christmas season?"}
{"text":"Came here this morning  because I had a meeting in the area so I stopped in for some breakfast.  I have not been to a 5 & Diner since my single days of stopping in at 1am....back when bars closed at 1am.  Anyway, I order the breakfast special for $4.99 which is basically bacon and eggs and it was great, the hash browns were brown and crispy, eggs cooked perfect, bacon crispy, and the toast was like what I used to eat when i was a kid...the small bread.  Yep, i was pleased and the service was fantastic.  The atmosphere and decor is very casual and its 50's style with the music and all.  I am not a fan of Mill's mall but this place worked out nice this morning."}
{"text":"Meatloaf and burgers and shakes! Oh My! Classic diner food at its best!  The 50's decor and music make this a fun stop every time. The burgers are HUGE. The meatloaf is moist and meaty and the mashed potatoes are amazing! The shakes are made for sharing! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Regular 50's diner. The food is good and the service is usually good. Small place. Only neg is if your in a wheelchair- you're sitting outside."}
{"text":"The employees here are so nice and upbeat and get you what you want. Amazing service our first time here. This is now becoming our casual date place for my fiancee and I. Great cherry coke, amazing fried pickles, great Reuben sandwich"}
{"text":"We hit this place very time we are in Phoenix and have always been very satisfied with both the food and the service. Of course, the main draw is the the awesome atmosphere. The kids love putting quarters in the jukebox stations at the tables and waiting for their 50's tune. Great outdoor seating section for those warm AZ mornings.  One star less than perfect because the closest thing you can get to fresh fruit for breakfast is thawed strawberries on a waffle."}
{"text":"Yuck.  The \"steamed vegetables\" were from a frozen medley. The taste of the food was off.  My son's shake wasn't blended all the way. The bathroom smells and the jukebox numbers don't play the right songs that you pick.  There were rips in the booth upholstery.  I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like Subway in the sense I've never walked out thinking, \"Wow, I'm really glad I chose to eat here.\"  The only redeeming thing about the place is that their rewards card will give you random money to spend, so you can go once and a while and get like $5.00 off, and they give you like $10.00 off for your birthday.  But honestly, my threshold for being pleasantly surprised here is when the food is just okay.  I'm really glad the last time I ordered a burger that I said medium-rare, because when it came out like an hour later, it was charred black on the outside and completely gray inside.  If I'd ordered it medium, it'd probably have been a pile of ashes and a bun.  I didn't bother sending it back because it would have taken a million more years.  I just ate half and threw the rest away.  There wasn't enough ketchup in the world to raise that from the dead.  I don't know what people see in this place."}
{"text":"Are you craving diner food ? This is the place. 50\"s theme is cute, but the food is even better. I always order the turkey club. Three layers of buttery toasted  bread, crispy bacon, slices of fresh turkey breast, lettuce & tomato. Yum !"}
{"text":"We've recently moved to Phoenix and finally tried the 5 and Diner. I wish we'd gone there sooner. Rebecca, who waited on us, was delightful. We split an order of the Diner Wings, which were great. And perfectly messy. Rebecca brought us lots of extra napkins and wipes; 'just in case' she chuckled. I had the Bourbon Burger special; Ric had the Reuben. The burger was cooked just right, and Ric really liked his Reuben. We both had the fries which were thin and crisp - just right. Unfortunately I can't eat dairy so we didn't try a shake. But we brought a piece of cherry pie home that I can't wait to try.  We both look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here and the service is awesome. I recommend \"Lucy\" as your server. I only come for breakfast but am always happy. I'm here right now!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss my 5& Diner on Ray & I-10.. that was my home away from home for breakfast.    We decided to try this location and while it looks just like the one on Ray, it's nothing like it.  Sure the insides are the same; they even have some of the same looking staff. The food is even good, but it didnt have that same feel I was used to.  Forgot the waitress' name, but when I looked at the menu, I noticed my favorite thing was missing.. the breakfast skillets. :(    They said that all locations were privately owned (Iknew that) and they didnt have those.    I ordered the french toast combo and it was ok...  Nothing like the location on Ray.  They used different styles of french toast and made it an art form.    Will I go back here? Sure.. but it wont be my first choice..."}
{"text":"The 50's were a time of Elvis Presley,Marilyn Monroe,Elizabeth Taylor... and Diners.People flocked to these places to hang and grab a bite.A time when Milkshakes ruled, Diners were the so called cool places to be seen in.  From the moment we walked in i was taken with how friendly the staff was,the girl who seated us was wearing a checkered skirt and a headband with a bow, very retro (loved the look). we had the Chicken fried Steak smothered in country gravy, served with mashed potatoes, steamed veggies and garlic toast. Veggie omelette stuffed with onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and sauteed green peppers served with hash brown and white bread toast.  The food was good and the portions were generous.I was too full to try their milk shakes so that calls for a quick run to the Diner. They have a jukebox inside.The interiors are nice and bright.They also have outdoor seating.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to 5 and Diner on a Sunday morning and we were impressed.  Not only is the decor cute and retro, we had fantastic service and our breakfasts were wonderful!  It was really a nice surprise.  We plan to go back again soon."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I had not been here in a while but remembered as much better than it was tonight.  As I sit here my stomach hurts. We ordered a turkey burger, it was dry and had an odd taste combined with the taste of char (which was dominating). My husband got a mushroom burger, the mushrooms were so weird (chopped into nothing, clearly from a can and a sick yellow color). My daughters kids burger was all char no flavor.  Very disappointing.  We left most of our food, when the waitress came over she could see by the looks on our face that it was not going over well, she never offered anything.  Usually when most of the food except one or 2 bites are still on the plate that might trigger some alarm bells."}
{"text":"Went here the other Monday before Little C's TLG monday class.  Place was pretty empty, but that was alright.  Mondays kids eat for only $.99 which was a nice surprise.    J ordered the Francheeze, which he enjoyed.  That is until he got about 3/4 of the way through and noticed the bacon was not 100% cooked.  He didnt eat anymore after that.   I ordered the club on sourdough.  Cant really mess up a club.  Bacon was fully cooked.  Turkey was nice and cold.  Lettuce was crisp.  I ended up sharing a section of my club with J.  He said, \"MAN, I should have ordered the club!\"  We ordered Little C a grilled cheese.  Cant really mess up a grilled cheese.    Service was fast and friendly.  The waitress even offered to fill up our Bobble water container, which was nice of her.    I'm pretty sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"This quaint little diner is a delight at a great price. I had their burgers which are large and their breakfast which is great.  It's a good size meal of a moderate price. Just don't put money in the juke box at the table. It doesn't work."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried chicken with gravy, loved chicken pot pie I tried for first time. Save some space for dessert waffle wonders it was wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our lunch yesterday.  We hung out for over 2 hours here.    We got cherry cokes to drink.  He got the Big Bopper with onion rings and I got the New Yorker with fries.  I love their fries.  I think they know the secret of McDonald's' fries cause they tasted very similar.  Soft but crispy at the same time.  Love it!  We played some tunes, then ended our meal with Half Off Happy Hour Shakes (2pm to 4pm everyday for the summer).  I got a chocolate banana shake and he got a Reese's one.  They give you the rest of the shake in the mixer cup and that filled it up for another round.    We had fun singing and dancing to the oldies and enjoyed our entire meal.    Service was really good.  Our waitress was Tiny T and she was super nice and kept us happy.  The guy who brought our food was super funny and friendly.  And the manager we talked to was really nice.  Had a great time!"}
{"text":"My husband, my grandchildren and I went to 5 and Diner for dinner last night prior to a holiday event.  We were specifically looking for a restaurant with some holiday spirit.  You know, the old fashioned warm holiday feel, not formal, not stuffy, just good old fashioned fun!  5 and DINER WAS PERFECT, it's very festive and decorated with fun Christmas decorations and lights!!  Our waitress, Rebecca, was very attentive, super sweet and GREAT with the kids!!! The kids had such a great time, they asked to go again tonight!!!  We went back!  Tonight our waitress was Kris (sp?).  She was also FANTASTIC!  Great with the kids, warm, friendly and attentive!  The food is good quality, prepared well and tasty!  Just what you would expect from an authentic 50's diner!!! Places like this are GEMS for our family!!  My grandson actually suggested I put this review online!  This is a new family favorite for SURE!!! Thank you to the owners and staff for such a great experience!!!! Merry Christmas!!!!"}
{"text":"Kind of like truck stop quality food. The place smells musty and the food took forever.  They ran out of fries at 6:45 on a Thursday. Then they made us pay extra for onion rings, but there were no fries! Just throw the the rings if there are no fries. The shakes are very average and nothing special. They took 25 min to come out and then they brought us the wrong flavor. Wasn't willing to wait another 25 for the right flavor. Oh well. We won't be coming back.  Too many other good options in this area."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to like this place.  Over priced food.  Dirty.  Last summer guy sweating like a pig leaning over the ice cream maker to make my shake.  Today  roach ran across the counter, ended my breakfast.  Not to mention the place is just plain dirty.  Place could be so much more."}
{"text":"If you have been to a 5 and Diner then you know what it is all about.  Chain 50s menu.  Pretty crowded the food isn't bad."}
{"text":"I really like this place the vibe is so retro and cute there food and service is good the chocolate strawberry shake and root beer floats are great highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved this place it was so cute. We went here for brunch today and we sat out on the patio through another reviewer's suggestion. The waitress we had was wonderful and very attentive. Even though I do not have a dog I loved how it was a dog friendly patio, and they even bring water and treats for your treasured pups! The coffee was good, and I had a strawberry waffle and my husband had scrambled eggs with cheese, toast, and fried potatoes. The music was also cool as we are both fans of the 50's. I will come back here again as it was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Classic 50s feel. For some reason they hire really large waitresses! Good fun and friendly,  breakfast has ni surprises and no disappointment. Its a fun place with acceptable food at diner price.."}
{"text":"Burgers are great (except for the turkey burger, that was pretty bad), waffles are great, pancakes are so-so at best.  Easy and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best BLT I've ever had.  Fun atmosphere, great service (thanks, Ruby) and good food.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"12/17/15, I had lunch with my friends from work and we had the best, awesome customer service. We will go back defiantly!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food online and this is what happened when i went to go pick it up..I must mention it was also a very slow night, i saw 2 customers and about 7 staff members.  When i arrived to this restaurant I was not greeted with a friendly hello or how are you, i was greeted with :are you the online order?\". I said yes and was pointed to my order which was sitting on the counter. I looked inside and saw my hamburger and fries but only one order of fried pickles. I told the women(dianna) at the register I had 2 orders of fried pickles and was quickly snapped back with \"no you didn't\". I said then can you explain to me how my order comes to $25 with a $6 order of fried pickles and a $8 burger. she(dianna) pulled out the invoice waved it in my face and put it back behind the counter before i could even touch it or look at it. when i said 8 and 6 only make 14 and that a paid for another order she rolled her eyes and told the cooks to make me another order. then i checked my burger( i put very specific instructions that i only wanted bacon,lettuce and pickles. no condiments or cheese.) i open it up to find not only was it slathered in cheese but also mayo! I told her this isn't what i ordered and had to ask her to remake it 3 times before she stopped staring at me and had it remade. she then walked away no apology or anything, i didn't see her again while i waited and extra 20 mins for my order. Another waitress came over and was extremely sweet and double checked my food before letting me check it again, she sat and talked to me while i waited and was very apologetic and i was impressed with how she handled me being a very upset customer, her name was annie. I also came to find out that dianna the women who was extremely rude to me was the assistant manager! I am appalled at the customer service i received by this women dianna. I have been in customer service for 7 years and i have never seen someone so unprofessional!!! my suggestion to this location is to fire dianna and make annie a manager, at least then you wouldn't get such awful reviews!!!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, some of the best service I've had in a long time! A group of us walked in during the wee hours of the morning. There were a few other customers as well. Our server was friendly, helpful, and just all around awesome.   The food was exactly what you'd expect at a diner - a little greasy, full of flavor, and made with love. I'd definitely go for one of their new Skillet Sensations!"}
{"text":"One word:  FRANCHEEZIE!!!! - A delicious bacon wrapped, cheese-stuffed hot dog that can't be beat.  This is my favorite yummy snack at 5 & Diner.  Great food choices all cooked to order in a building that looks like a train car (I think)  straight out of the 1950's.  The service was fast and friendly and the music was fun.  They even have jukeboxes at the tables inside so you can pick some tunes to enjoy while eating.  They have seating inside and out This place is open 24 hours so it is perfect for a bite after an evening of fun."}
{"text":"The food here gave me explosive diarrhea. Used to be good, I'm getting too old for this grease joint. Fries were good, huge pile that I couldn't even finish. I think it was the brownie that I had at the end of the meal that pushed me over. Anyway, won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm ordering the wrong stuff, but I've *always* been disappointed in the grub at 5&Diner... The service was STELLAR and I really do like the ability to dine Al-Fresco at 3am, but does everything need to be soaked in butter flavored crisco??? ughghg."}
{"text":"I would give 1 star - but the decor is awesome.  My girlfriend and I stopped into this cute little diner for supper. We ordered the Diner Dip and a Bourbon Burger, both with french fries.  My burger was o.k, nothing special. The problem was the roast beef on her sandwich was rancid. You could smell it, see it, and taste it. Even the server said \"oh no, you might be right\" after smelling the plate. Very disappointed! We drove across Phoenix to try this place,  now half the night is wasted. Date night fail!"}
{"text":"Terrible food.  The guy in the booth behind me that could not stop yelling bragged that he had been released from Arizona State Prison for the third time 3 days prior.  The \"waitress\" was impressed and refused to even ask him to stop yelling.  terrible food, we just paid and left"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at this dinner at midnight last night!  We came in absolutely exhausted after working a 14 hour day. Our waitress was so kind and patient with us! We were tired to the point of having a hard time choosing what to eat :) not only did she spend time helping us, she helped me customize a meal to fit my preferences. She was sweet and the food was amazing! I had a breakfast skillet. To say the least- I licked the plate clean it was so good!!! Everything was efficient, delicious, and felt like home.  Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I needed a place to grab some lunchtime breakfast food over the weekend, and seeing as how we couldn't find anything better, we stopped by 5 and Diner. I've never been overly impressed with 5 and Diner in the past, and I have to say, they met my mediocre expectations this round as well. My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast. None of which was better than what you can make at home, but it wasn't disappointing either.  Overall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills. However, here's where the problem comes in. When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife \"do you like bacon or sausage\", to which she replied \"bacon\". Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said \"the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra\". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine."}
{"text":"This place needs a good scrubbing!  EVERY INCH OF IT.  just had lunch and to tell you the truth, I wanted to leave before our food arrived.  after ordering I used the women's bathroom to wash my hands and ick!  looks like they wipe the surface of things only to move the dirt and yucky stuff to the edges.  everywhere I looked there was crude.  the faucets, the edge of the sink, the counter edges, the floors (oh, the floors!! gross).  I walked back to our booth and told my husband if he wasn't so hungry we'd leave.  then I check out the booth, the table and even the window ledge and blinds.   again, not what you want in a restaurant.  of course I looked at the silverware and just couldn't believe it.    and I don't blame the person who cleans, I blame the manager.  its their job to check all of this.   my feeling is if the bathroom/tables/dinnerware/windows are this bad, what does the kitchen look like??? won't be back to this place.  there are so many other places right in the area."}
{"text":"I really dig this place.  What a treat!  Everytime I go here, its just so much fun.  The theme of this place is straight out of the 1950's.  I like that.  They have a full menu of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff even dresses like it was the 1950's too!  They have table, booth and bar seating here.  I usually drop in for breakfast, but have eaten lunch and dinner here as well.  I'm sure eating here is probably not the best thing for me, but theres something fun about getting good food that I cannot pass up.  I think its a very unique place!"}
{"text":"Pleasant experience here a throw back to a 50s setting.  Promptly greeted and sat smilels everywhere.  Ordered a cherry coke was deliscious with a cherry on top.   A extensive menu pancakes to burgers.  Miticulously clean. Servers wear their hair clean cut and 50s style.   Ordered a burger with frys sorry forgot to take pic was sooo good.    Will i be back again yesss price very resonable"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for years. We have never had a problem with our food or service. However, it is time for a r model. When you are putting duct tape on the booths, it is time. Also around the base of the booths are falling apart."}
{"text":"Our chocolate malt was excellent.  Buffalo chicken quesadilla was strange (more ingredients than listed).  My husband's food wasn't what he remembered quality-wise from years ago.  Terrible service.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Awesome service.  Last time I was here I had the chicken fried chicken and it was delicious!  Highly recommended if you are looking for some good down home comfort food!"}
{"text":"Arriving gives the overall feeling of an amusement park, there in the, not too far, distance is a playground of food items, wrapped in a costumed, stainless steel, 50's style \"shell\". The Eggs-Benedict was good (better then my recipe), i know i'm on vacation, even for the day, when i'm eating eggs-benedict ! Hash browns were crispy (not always easy in short order) the staff calls them out verbally to kitchen so there can keep up as well as put out a fast, \"impeccable spud\". Our server's name was Elly-Mae, and I think I believe her name tag, but the uniform requirements make it tenuous. Milkshake-exceptional, service -good to great, Building/Diner- awesome, bathroom-tiny (but a must see)and follow-thru on theme-thorough ."}
{"text":"We stopped by here after a meeting with a business client:  What I liked: - great teriyaki chicken sandwich!!! had it with a cherry Coke and seasoned fries! -coworker had a sandwich, easily substituted with veggie patty, very helpful. -great server, very friendly, she referred to us as \"big wigs\", probably cuz I was wearing a sportcoat.  Reminds me of Mel's or Ruby's, but larger menu. Would definitely come back here, the fries are addictive!!!"}
{"text":"My biggest pet peeve is a cold restaurant. I hate being cold and uncomfortable when I'm eating. This place is cold.   I have been to this 5 and Diner probably 5 or 6 times. Pretty much the same as any other 5&D you have ever been to. This location has pretty average service.   They have great milkshakes, but mediocre food. I normally only eat breakfast here. My dining party seemed to enjoy their food.   They do have comfy booths which allow for a nice nap, if you are narcoleptic like me."}
{"text":"My new year's resolution is to keep the same vapid worldly pleasures as always, but to upgrade them all.   I still go to the mall, but I'm blowing money on Macy's and Dillard's instead of Sears and Foot Locker.  I still shoot vodka like I'm in undergrad, I just make sure it's top shelf only.   And I still show up drunk to diners in the middle of the night, I will just make a habit of 5 & Diner instead of those *other* chains.   OK, there's literally no way to spin liking 5 & Diner of all places as a quantifiable improvement in personal growth. I am self aware enough to know I am trashy and an absolute tool just for trying. But I *do* know it's a cut above whatever else you were planning to get after you were done partying. Heck, I could actually eat here for lunch and probably be OK with it. I'm craving another BLT with fries already!"}
{"text":"At one time, 5 & Diner was among the better old time diners available, but the competition has improved markedly over the years and they have gone backwards.  At least at this location.  First, the seating is not very comfortable.  The chairs are literally slippery and you have to position yourself carefully not to slide off.  The booths we were offered had one side too close to the table and the other too far.  Weird.  Breakfast should be a slam dunk for a diner, but not here.  The scrambled eggs were okay but not served hot.  The sausage was tasteless.  The home fries are just plain cubed potatoes dumped in a fryer with no accents (like onion, pepper).  The hash browns were buttery but without the usual crisp top layer.  The coffee was dishwater.  I gave an extra star for good service, but really, 5 & Diner, you don't deserve it."}
{"text":"This cute food joint is one of many 5 & Diner locations in the Phoenix area, though I understand this is the original location, and the only location open 24 hours. It has a cute 50s-motif going on, from the booths to the bar to the music to the little jukeboxes on some tables to the waitresses' poodle skirts.   The menu has breakfast items, entrees, a burger/sandwich section and salads. The BLT was pretty awesome for such a staple item. Prices are very affordable.   The outside patio has umbrellas and cool mist!"}
{"text":"Awesome throwback in time place. Friendly and fast service. Food was hot and fresh...oh ya and very delicious. Definitely recommend if you are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The staff is great. Very friendly, great service. The food (burgers & \"seasoned\" chips) I'd say meh. No flavor. Very bland! The seasoned chips had no seasoning flavor or even salt that we could taste. Husband had a malt that really had very little malt taste. The bill showed chocolate shake with 49 cents of malt added. I'm assuming that was one scoop of malt due to lack of flavor. Husband said he'll give them another shot for breakfast. I'm sorry but I'll pass."}
{"text":"Fried goodness!!!!! Cheese onion rings and eggs Benedict    Sooooooo gooood     I love this place.  Best forage late night breakfast and appetizers.   Heaven.  Yum yum yum y u   Nice service. And beautifully done."}
{"text":"Great 50's diner! We went for breakfast this morning before our roadtrip back to CA. It was packed (as expected). We were sat in 15 min.  Service was fast, friendly and this staff WORKS! Everyone was constantly on the move.  Food was served quickly! We ordered the Cali omelet and the French toast. Both were flavorful and completely devoured! It's cute, kitschy, and your typical 50's diner. However their tabletop juke box selection is more extensive than I've seen anywhere else. I'd love to come back again sometime for that middle-of-the-night belly bomb! Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed this place yet?  My mistake.  Looks like I wrote a tip back around September of 2011, only to ignore this place until now.  This ain't gourmet dining, but everything from the hot dogs to the french toast is comfort food, 24/7.  Every time I go here, it's just plain fun.  After a night of dancing at one of the clubs downtown, there's usually two choices for wee morning hour eats--Jenny's and here.  This place is more original and cool, and there are more food choices available.  You know, you've been boppin' your body to beats for hours, you're like a zombie, but you're still hungry.  This is the perfect place.  They'll have a seat for you ready."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy 5 & Diner, and have never had anything but at least \"good\", if not \"great\" service.  This 5 & Diner changed that.  The service wasn't \"bad\", but it definitely wasn't what I'd call \"good\".  The waiter seemed put out to wait on us.  I will return to 5 & Diner, but not likely to this location."}
{"text":"Met my family here for breakfast on Saturday morning. I had the chicken fried steak with biscuits, hash browns and eggs scrambled soft. Very tasty meal. The portions were generous. Places rarely get my egg order correct but they did a good job here. Clean restaurant, clean bathrooms. The music was a bit annoying. Wait staff very friendly and helpful. My family enjoyed their meals alot. Ended up with a  vanilla shake that was good and thick. The younger kids really enjoyed this place along with the older folks. I know that when I come here (no matter which location) I am gong to get a good filling meal at a good price, no more, no less."}
{"text":"They're food used to be excellent, now it's just good.  What made it excellent was the hashbrowns, they were these huge freshly cut pieces and were AMAZING!  The hashbrowns and the toast were the reason my wife and I kept coming back.  But recently they started using some packaged hashbrowns, and they're just awful.    Bring back the old hashbrowns!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I was kind of disappointed over the burgers. Some of them are good and others are not. One thing you can't go wrong on though is their milk shakes! The milk shakes are why we keep going back."}
{"text":"Being to 5 & Diner before I was expecting some excellent service and decent food.  Was I received was burnt onion rings and bland chips. My waitresses did not seem genuine even though she said the right things. I won't be back to this location a I suggest others stay clear."}
{"text":"Everyone tells me I should have had one of their burgers. But it was morning and breakfast seemed like the way to go. Silly me.   Breakfast was ok. Nothing to write home about, but it was ok. Hotcakes were kind of chewy (yeah, I'm not sure they should be chewy). My Mom used to say that pancakes should be light and fluffy. My eggs (over easy) were perfect. White all cooked, but yolks still runny. Sausage patties were a little dull. I should have gone with the recommended links. Lesson learned.   Would I go back again? Yep, but I'd have a burger next time . . . even for breakfast.  Service was very good. Thank you.   Standing outside in the parking lot after wards saying goodbye to my dining companion, we noticed that one of their three (3) American flags was hanging upside down. Did that mean they were in distress? A little bit in distress? Two were right side up. Or did someone just put it up wrong and not notice? Or perhaps it was a signal for breakfast and now that it was almost lunch the distress was over. Before my companion could go in and let them know, an employee came out and reversed the distress signal. Whew! Burger anyone?"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you sit outside you can smoke and bring your dog. Their milkshakes are to die for! Love their burger and fries."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES 5 & Diner.  I have two little boys who are 5 and 7 and they get so excited to go to 5 & Diner and put quarters in the miniature jukebox at the table and wear the paper 5 & Diner caps they get with their color-on menu and crayons.    I love the service and the ambience.  It's easy to imagine I'm transported back to the 1950's when my own parents were in high school and times seemed simpler...even though I doubt they were actually any simpler.  I remember coming to 5 & Diner in the wee hours of the night after my friends and I left the nightclubs back in the early 1990's.  We'd sit in the booth wearing our black leather jackets and fashionable club attire, and pound down cigarettes (you could still smoke in there then, but not now...THANK GOODNESS) and drink cup after cup of hot coffee while devouring plates of strawberry covered waffles and heaps of bacon.  (Those were the days.)    Anyway, I took the family last weekend and was surprised that they recently changed their menu and the dinner entree I was looking forward to ordering was gone.  (Major bummer.)   It looked like they changed the whole menu since my last visit and I'm still not sure I love the new menu, it'll take a couple of more visits before I have a verdict on that...I know for sure if they got rid of their eggs benedict I'll be scarred for life!  You need to go to 5 & Diner if you are into nostalgia, it's a wonderful place with great service that makes me wistful for a time that came and went a full 20 years before I was even born.    Now lets just see if the new menu sucks or not..."}
{"text":"This was THE worst experience ever..I have been dining here for quite a few years, and sadly with each trip the service gets worse. Tonight was the worst I will never return...adios! I ordered a sundae and never got it. Finally at the end of dinner the waiter noticed everyone else had plates and food...ugh! This service SUCKS I would give no stars"}
{"text":"Hostess was nice, but our server hasnt even greeted us or given us water.  Its been 20 minutes.  Other tables have been served before us.  I understand that its busy but some waters and a quick \"hi guys, i will be right with you\" isnt that hard.  I think that it may be that we (my friend and i) were not wanted there?   We left after half an hour of being ignored and I could clearly see through the window our server zoom right to our table and rearrange the menus, etc.  If they didnt want us there, they should have said so in the first place when we first walked in.  We apologize for being the only yellow people there, we wont be making that mistake again.  Hah."}
{"text":"Great place to go when everything else is closed. The food was a thumbs up, my omelet was very small but a great tasting. I also tried some of my dads waffle and it was the best. that's not all, my mom's biscut & gravy was definitely the best!!!!  And on top of that the waiter was very nice plus he gave us comment on my dad's rocky shirt and said \" this man still got it \" and he made sure we were happy by coming by when we were served asking us to have a malt but we were fine and we loved it anyways without a malt . I highly recommend this dinner to friends & family even the press"}
{"text":"I like 5 & Diner for a few reasons.    1).  They give us kids an idea of what a 50's diner was like.  2).  They serve up a mean grilled cheese and fries.  3).  They have mini juke boxes on the tables.  4).  They have the most amazing shakes ever.    That's all I've got, but it's enough for me."}
{"text":"I had a strawberry milkshake and a side order of french fries. The shake was pretty ace, but the french fries were soggy and eh. I give a star for the service, and they had a live music session going on outside their venue.  I may return for their food, perhaps, after a night of drinking as they are supposedly a 24 hr diner."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so fun they have great food and shakes i wanted to shimmy to the music"}
{"text":"I will admit, I made fun of the boyfriend when he wanted to go to 5 & Diner for dinner last night. I made even more fun of him when he showed me $80 worth of vouchers he'd bought on Amazon Local. Who goes to the 5 & Diner? Apparently he does.   So we went to the 5 & Diner. And it was really good.  Pickle chips! A whole star just for having these! They were delicious.  I had the \"Diner Dip\"; the meat was nothing special but the bun was soft (I can't count how many places give me a hard-as-a-rock bun on French dips) and the horseradish sour cream was yummy. Boyfriend had some kind of burger, and it was one hell of a burger for under $10; this thing was literally 6 inches tall and densely packed with meat, jalapenos, cheese, and onion rings between Texas toast. He lapsed into a happy food coma quite quickly. French fries were perfectly cooked and tasted fresh.   The shakes... oh, the shakes. We had the Reeses Peanut Butter Cup as a malt. It was amazing. Chunks of peanut butter cups at the bottom even!  I loved that they had about 20 flavors, ranging from butterscotch to raspberry to chocolate cherry, and all could be done as malts, soda floats, or just regular shakes. So many options!  Everything came out super fast; 5 minutes on the pickle chips and another 5 for our sandwiches. I was astounded to find it had come out like lightning without being held under lamps; they literally cook that quickly.   Oh, and now I have to rave about our server: She was the sweetest girl I've ever seen in food service. She was genuinely so nice, not the fake front most servers (including myself) put on, that I was incredibly impressed. She had to take my iPhone to do our voucher and it was crazy to see how carefully she handled it and presented it back to me. I enjoyed her pleasant demeanor so much that I left 40% for tip (and even perfect service will rarely warrant more than a 20% tip from me, because most of them have the aforementioned sickeningly sweet fake front). I didn't catch her name, but she had black hair and a nose stud, and worked on Tuesday night, so management please give kudos to her :)"}
{"text":"5 & Diner has a great atmosphere and great milkshakes, but that is just it. I ordered a medium plain burger, chili cheese fries, and a blueberry shake. I would not bring anyone here, nor will I ever come back here. The burger was burnt, lacked any seasoning or flavor and the best part of it was the brioche bun. My chili cheese fries lacked pizzazz. They used what looks like canned chili with little to meat and the fries were boring. We waited a long time just to get water."}
{"text":"Horrible service, extremely slow and unfriendly. Waited 20 min for drinks and another 45 for our food. To top it off she not once refilled drinks and I found a hair mixed in with my gravy ...AVOID!!!!"}
{"text":"A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinner!  I've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment, and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days.  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these days.  There were 5 of us, including one fairly easy to please 10 year old.  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages.... IN THE DESERT!!!  C'mon.  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself.  It was only the beginning.  When the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered.  Picture it... a \"hot\" roast beef open faced sandwich, which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever.  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT, they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen.  How do I know that?  Well, you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave?  It's gets hard and stale, a texture that once you experience you won't soon forget.  When we told the waitress that \"tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess\".  Her response was \"It is for me too\".  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM, THEIR PROBLEM!  Enter the \"Manager\".  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps.  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill.  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything else.  If any of the restaurant staff reads this review, please take one thing away from it... You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES!!  If the kitchen truly was the problem, they needed to step it up!!  If the waitress couldn't handle the number of people she was waiting on, you should have replaced her or reduced her section.  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people, us and several others (and I don't think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables).  Ready for dessert?  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress.  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them.  I bet you know what's coming next.... What's rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies??  Don't bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you, because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave ya!!  In closing, do I think this was meant to be four star dining? NO.  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight? ABSOLUTELY.  Did we catch them on a bad night?  PROBABLY.  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience?  YOU BETCHYA!!  Good luck here, and I hope your experience is better than ours was."}
{"text":"Update from my previous visit. We came back last night and everything seemed back to normal. Great food and awesome service. I love the fried pickles and fried mushrooms. Our server had a great personality. Thanks for stepping up your game after my last visit."}
{"text":"food is awful, place filled with flies.  BABIES KIDS CRYING ALL THE TIME, management lets them make your time there not pleasant.  Would not recommend them at all."}
{"text":"I love their fried pickles and malts, but their chicken pot pie was HORRIBLE. It was reheated in a microwave and a thick, gooey mess. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute theme restaurant. I had pancakes and eggs. My eggs were supposed to be medium, but were much closer to sunny side up. I didn't eat them, and my waitress didn't inquire about why. The pancakes were ok. I would give it another try for dinner or lunch. Definily not a good place for a large group..BTW"}
{"text":"Good service good food beautiful weather to enjoy outside =)"}
{"text":"Being that I love the whole idea about 1960s (or is it 1950s) diners, I made my way to dine here within a few days of becoming aware of it.  The decor is cute and kitschy, just like Al's on Happy Days. The music on the juke box, the booths, decor and even the waitresses uniforms all worked in concert making me feel I took a trip back in time.  I ordered pancakes with blueberry compote, sausage and eggs. Everything was cooked well, but the pancakes lacked flavor. The blueberry compote was clumped ontop of the stack, and ran off the plate as I attempted to eat. The restaurant was so cold that the butter hardly melted. After a few bites, the pancakes were too cold to enjoy if I wanted to finish them.  I was also put off by the a la carte pricing. I paid almost $20 for what should have been a breakfast special."}
{"text":"We don't go to 5 & Diner very often but we've been going off and on since they opened.  Yesterday we decided to go there and have dinner.  I don't know if we were just unlucky but the food seemed to have really gone downhill.  The shakes were runny, the kid's chicken nuggets tasted like McDonalds or worse, the patty melt onions didn't seem to be grilled properly and the hot dog was not hot.  Add to all that to slow service.  We won't be back.  Of course all this is my personal opinion."}
{"text":"Pickle Chips! What the hell?  ...and man are they good, I had never even heard of them before -- deep fried pickle chips served with ranch dressing... Yum!  My girls really like it here - so we tend to visit about once a month. The food is good overall, though sometimes the service can be a little slow... The atmosphere is cheesy and perfect for kids."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you're looking for unpretentious atmosphere, lots of character (50s diner!!) good comfort food, dog and kid friendly, reasonable prices, good portions, and friendly service, this is it."}
{"text":"I was craving wet fries (fries with brown gravy on them - you should definitely try this) and a black & white malted. So, we hopped in the car and drove the 15 miles or so down to the Diner.  Glanced at the menu, but didn't need much time. The menu has all the staples from back in the day when we were regulars at 2am after work. Ordered wet fries, malt, cherry/vanilla coke, Blue Moon Burger & French Dip.  Tossed a quarter in the jukebox at the table, then found out the wheel to flip thru the pages was stuck. Moved to a different table, tossed a quarter in as the flipper worked, played 2 songs only to figure out that the volume switch on this one didn't work. Back to Table 1. Waitress came by and informed us that the table jukes aren't always reliable (if at all) and to use the main juke for best results. I told her she should call \"the guy\" and seems it had never occurred to the staff that there must be a guy that works on this kinda stuff...  Anyway, juke fiasco aside - the food was good. Wet fries and fountain drinks is why we were really there. No complaints on either. You can check it out 24hrs a day, so whenever is convenient for you; stop in!  Upon leaving, I noticed they have a shiny food truck parked in the lot - not sure where you can find this around town, but keep your eyes open for it!"}
{"text":"We walked out.  Never got to eat.  The waiter was to busy hitting on the 15 year old girls sitting behind us then come up and take our order.  We waited a good 15 minutes and no love.    Not to mention, the food looked over priced for what is was."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place when we couldn't decide what to eat. I had the Texas burger while my friend had the Bleu Cheese burger. Both were very delicious! The atmosphere was great and the waitress was helpful and friendly! We were too full to try shakes but will definitely come back to try them. It's a fun place for families with its hula hoops and juke boxes."}
{"text":"I like 5 & Diner. I love the oldies music and their burgers are some of the best I've had. Always juicy and delicious. I ordered the Big Texan which has bbq sauce and an onion ring on Texas toast. It was yummy and very filling with all the fries. Mmm mm! Good lunch with my best friend. Their breakfast is good too. And don't forget about the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Its official, I will NEVER return to this location! The once tender flavorful turkey dinner has now been replaced with slices of cheap, chopped, pressed and formed, processed lunch meat. The stuffing is a bland mush, and the small piece of corn on the cob was microwaved to the point of no return, rubbery and nasty. The kitchen is still staffed by people who are challenged where the English language is concerned, and the replacement meal was just as bad as the original one I sent back. NEVER AGAIN 5&Diner!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast spot!  We had the skillet breakfast which are customizable and insanely good. Potatoes with cheese and whatever else you want to add! Add sour cream to make your dreams come true. The wait staff worked hard to keep all of the patrons happy (and our waitress--Holli maybe? I was still half asleep) was super attentive and nice. We would definitely recommend this diner for anyone looking for a filling breakfast in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Whenever I find myself hungry at 2am (which happens more often than I'd care to admit), my first inclination is to head here.  If you can hit it before the after-bar crowd gets there, it's a much better scene. Anything minus loud drunk people being obnoxious is a plus in my opinion.  The 50s style is fun and fabulous in its own way (jukeboxes - sweet!), the staff and clientele are decidedly queer (which is good because so am I) and there's no lack of personality.  There seems to be one ornery waitress who has no problem telling folks where they can go, but perhaps that's her being \"in character\" ... or something.  Happily our favorite server \"Spinner\" usually scoops us up when we come in and takes very good care of us. Drinks never go empty and my dining companion's cherry Mr. Pibb always gets extra cherry just the way he likes it (and Spinner's been known to bring 2 because he finishes them quickly) and new black tea gets brewed when I walk in.  It really is the little things and being remembered that make the difference between good and great.  The food is hearty and portions are decent, though it's a tad bit pricey, but at 2am it's worth it to not have to do it myself.  Their meatloaf sandwich is awesome (minus the garlic mushrooms for me, but I don't eat mushrooms) and the Hot Pastrami and Reuben are equally tasty. Even the turkey dinner hit the spot one night (despite the mushrooms in the stuffing - and for me that's saying something). My late-night dining companion (who was born in the wrong era and should have been a \"greaser\") raves about the eggs bennedict.  He has tried several different variations on this including the chipotle style and liked them all. He is also huge on the shakes - the orange creamsicle is his favorite. We have literally come here just for a shake - they're that good. They even have a PB&J shake. Not sure that's for me, but it sure is interesting that it's an option. Thick and delicious and served with the metal cup on the side with the extras - 2 straws upon request, just like it used to be when life was (supposedly) simpler. Almost makes me want a poodle skirt and a pair of saddle shoes (and my virginity back ... well  maybe not).  Since this late night experience is a fun outing or field trip for me, the speed of service is inconsequential. The atmosphere is fun and the service is consistently great (Thanks Spinner!). Not much to be done about loud obnoxious drunk people except to avoid the post-bar rush if possible. But who can blame the barflies - 5 & Diner is the best place open at that hour. Period.  I have to say I've never visited in daylight hours, but the dog-friendly patio is a nice touch - not that I have a dog, but I'm an animal lover in general and I think there should be places where dogs are welcomed."}
{"text":"This place is great, Always clean and busy. They work as a team to take care of their guest. We enjoy coming here, mostly early sunday mornings before the crowd truly hits. Have the sunday special! Trust me its a must have chipotle egg benedicts, also if you do a rewards card it will keep you coming back and you'll save a couple bucks. We only come for breakfast, so it will be interesting to try late night...I guess on Fridays they have like old historic cars come in and stuff...lol its a neat place. We dig it.. :)"}
{"text":"First of all, let me state that I have been a long time fan of 5 & Diner. Rarely have I had a bad experience, and never had I had bad food. This has changed however, after visiting this location. Upon entering, it was perfectly clear that the manager was training several of the hostess staff as we wait to be seated. No problem, I understand training is necessary, and the experience with less than seasoned employees will be less than stellar. I get that. What I didn't expect was a bad burger. Normally, the Blue Moon Burger is one of my favorites. At this location however, it was terrible. The burger arrived wrapped in the usual white paper. Although this time, something was different about it. The burger along with everything else was pushed to the back as it was sitting vertically. Eating it was messy because the back end was full of grease and most of the competent of bleu cheese and sauce. Seriously, it was bad. There was taste of some blue cheese toward the front, then was met by a mouthful of mostly bleu cheese at the back. Definitely was not evened out. It was more like eating a bag of melted bleu cheese as desert AFTER a saucy greasy burger. I didn't make a scene by letting the staff know the sandwich was terrible because of the training going on. I'll let them work it out. But for this fan of the franchise, I definitely will NOT be going back to this location. I want to forget about this experience and drive a little further for a different location."}
{"text":"Cool little spot that's been around for a long time. The food's great, but their shakes are amazing. I always get the butterscotch flavor... And I don't really like butterscotch, thats how good they are. Only downside is that it's always busy, so there will be a wait time usually."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, really a fun authentic experience at this place. It's all nostalgia and I was very impressed with how the waitresses were dressed. It made the whole experience into an \"experience\"."}
{"text":"I've been going to 5 & Diners for about 15 years and especially this location. I have seen the quality go down as the prices go up. On this particular visit, I was appalled to see that a burger is now just shy of ten dollars. So I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, pretty basic, no special instructions. I ordered it medium. When I got it, it was half cooked. One half of the patty was cooked and the other half was pink on the inside. I am not sure how that happens. I was with my brother and we both got burgers. I stopped eating mine after I saw that the patty was cooked in that odd fashion. My brother's was prepared fine, but he also stopped eating his because it was just didn't taste good. Service was slow. Even though they were fully staffed and they weren't busy, it was still painfully slow.   There was puke in the sink in the women's bathroom. I spied this on the way to the men's bathroom as the women's bathroom door was open and an employee was attempting to clean it up. Unfortunately, I saw this before I got my food so that set my appetite into a spiral downwards. As for the men's bathroom, the urinal was broken and leaking water. Their solution for this problem was to put a Tupperware container under the leak. It was perched precariously on top of the urinal and was about half full of toilet water. Looking about ready to fall right on the customer who was using the urinal at that time.   This is the second time I have posted this review up. This is a legitimate account of my experience at this place and a warning that the food is very mediocre and the prices are getting crazy. For some reason it was taken down even though I plainly told my experience."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere that makes you feel like you're stepping back in time. Lots of bits and pieces of 50's Americana on the walls and mini jukeboxes on each table.    Great menu with a variety of greasy comfort foods that are reasonably priced. I ordered the philly cheese steak and my fiance ordered the meatloaf.. his portions were HUGE and he ended up getting a to-go box which is saying something! My sandwich and fries were a bit more moderately sized. We both enjoyed our dishes - very yummy!   Quick service, decent food.. quality is about what you'd expect for a diner.   We would gladly return next time we're in the mood for some yummy good ol' American comfort food! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"If you are coming for breakfast or a burger and fries and a shake, this is your place.  I have tried 2 of the regular meals, the ground round dinner and the smothered chicken.  I had to send the smothered chicken back because it was floating in water and the green peppers on top were pickled peppers that had a sweet taste.  Not a good surprise.  This is not the place to go if you are a healthy eater, which I try to be.  I normally can find SOMETHING healthy on every menu,  but this food was too greasy and strange tasting.  The only reason we went there was a buy one, get one meal free coupon.  The servers, however, are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I went right before Thanksgiving.  I had to work on the Holiday so I wanted Turkey mashed potatoes stuffing and cranberry sauce and this place did not disappoint.  I will come again.  the one in Mesa Arizona I had the Mac and cheese and it was the best mac and cheese ever."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ordered the Garlic Shroom Burger w kettle chips. She had the Reuben w coleslaw. We had a side of chili cheese fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"I moved from Phoenix many years ago but while here on a family visit, my husband and I went for breakfast. It was great. Good service and good food. We had eaten at a restaurant at the hotel where we stayed and the difference was immense. Glad I remembered this place."}
{"text":"I've only been here one time at around midnight on a weekend. It was pretty slow for the most part but the service was good for what the place is! The server that helped us was really nice and the food didn't take long to come out and was good too!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night with a party of 6. We ate outside and it was one thing after another. We all ordered burgers and had to wait to get ketchup. Cmon now, how does the server give you burger and fries with no ketchup. I ordered a medium cooked cheeseburger and that tasted burnt. I had my brother tell the server because I was pissed. The manager came out and said she would get another made and take it off the bill. Everyone was done eating and I still did not get my burger. Once it came to the table, we requested to go boxes. I just packed that burger to take to my husband instead. A second manager came to apologize and by this time since I waited so long for my new burger I did not want to be bothered with another apology. Just let me pack this burger, pay and leave."}
{"text":"*Businesses do have bad days, I'm very aware of that* experienced Saturday Morning 9/22/12 approx 11a  I already felt weird meeting my date at a 50s diner, being black, because back then blks/whts didn't even sit together, but I quickly got over that LOL  The design of the restaurant is pretty neat, a pink trailer. & inside, the booths are pretty retro. The menu is more extensive than one might think. I was overwhelmed by the choices.  I went with lunch during breakfast time. Ordered a chicken fried chicken w/mashed potatoes and a bowl of fruit.  I ordered apple juice, at first they told me the machine was broken so I took cranberry juice as a substitute but before I could drink that, they brought me the apple juice and swiftly took the cranberry away. This was odd to me because if the cranberry juice is already poured, and I've put my straw in it, are you just taking it and throwing it down the sink? & if you're doing that, you should just leave it for me, but whatever I was happy they had the apple juice.  The waitresses that I encountered were nice enough. I was glad they had some color in the establishment, just makes me feel more comfortable (hispanic-descent waitress).  My order came, just as I ordered it and it looked good. I always start with my fruit, as I'm eating it and enjoying it, I get to a cantaloupe piece and WHOOMP! There It Is!! There's a dead fly in my fruit cup. I showed my date and he swiftly decided we were leaving. By this time, we'd both enjoyed some sips of our drinks and our food had just been delivered and he was waiting on some butter for his pancakes. I was a little reluctant to leave because I was just so hungry.  But you can't give business to an establishment when there is a bug on your plate.  We showed the waitress who apologized and discarded my plate, however when they noticed we were leaving, they said have a great day! I mean, I don't know what else they could've said. It's not like we would've accepted a voucher to return or something because we wouldn't. But it's not the waitresses' fault, whoever prepared the fruit should've rinsed it, problem averted. I'm sure it's a nice place, however I had a bad experience so it's doomsday. They won't lose sleep over it, I wouldn't have been a regular anyway"}
{"text":"Was in town on business and stayed at the place across the street. Ate here 4 times at random times and the food was served with a smile and very good. I had everything from biscuits and gravy to a turkey burger, chicken pot pie, and a pastrami reuben. Really nice portions and everything tasted fresh though the crust on the pot pie could have been flakier. Great prices, too. I'd go back if I returned to the area."}
{"text":"Food was alright, nothing special, a bit bland. The water tasted so bad though, bad enough that you could still taste it through iced tea or tap water, do they not have a filter!?"}
{"text":"Service was quick, refilled my coffee super fast! Food was great! No wait time, thanks!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and fast service. But while eating I noticed how filthy the fans were. YUK! !!!!!!!  Also one table didn't even get to order and walked out.  The hostess should always bring the beverages,  a no brainer."}
{"text":"Our family has always loved 5 & Diner. Unfortunately, the PV Mall location closed recently, replaced by a Starbucks! Aargh! Fortunately, the 16th Street location, the original 5 & Diner, is still serving up a solid assortment of comfort food. The 1950's theme of the restaurant, reproduced though it is, seems genuine enough. Fun. Friendly servers. You can see why it's a favorite photo op for politicians and the like.   5 & Diner is open 24 hours a day, functioning equally well as a late night hangout, a morning coffee spot for retirees or as a place to take children for ice cream and pancakes. Coin operated jukeboxes located in many booths actually work! Selecting songs and waiting for them to play is great entertainment for kids. They also provide kids with paper hats and crayons. Or, if you're eating outdoors on the patio, hula hoops! The patio is also dog friendly.    Shake and sundae offerings are classic and delicious. They are best enjoyed sitting inside at the counter in my opinion. Breakfast offerings are served 24 hours a day. You're not going to see menu items at 5 & Diner being written up in food magazines for creativity and innovation, but they are American comfort food consistently well prepared.     5 & Diner is really all about the ambiance, 1950's style. Bring the kids, or bring the dog, or bring the kids and the dog, or bring your friends in need of a late night sobering up, and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This 5 & Diner, located in the Scottsdale Pavilions, has a lot going for it. There's a nice outdoor patio which is hula hoop (provided) and dog (not provided) friendly. It's located very close to the ball park. There's also the classic car show at McDonalds across the drive every Saturday. The 1950's theme of the restaurant is fun, especially for kids. The menu is classically diverse and the food is solid. It's a great place for a classic breakfast or just an ice cream treat. They have separate kids and seniors menus, which can help make a visit very reasonably priced. Servers are generally very prompt and very friendly.  Why not five stars? We visited recently at an off time and the counter area was blocked off, a big disappointment for our young companions who wanted to sit there. The table jukebox system no longer works, although there is a central jukebox that is in working order. The classic menu doesn't contain any items that would interest a true foodie. I'm fine with that, but it should be mentioned for those in that category. Overall, though, 5 & Diner is a fun experience, especially if you embrace your inner hula hooping self."}
{"text":"Carlos is the man.  He's worked here for seventeen years and he will make sure you have a good experience.  5 and Diner is a great choice for families.  The fifties themed decor is fun for all.  Just wish the juke box system worked. On my most recent visit I had to try to explain the concept of a hula hoop to a three year old.  Since a demonstration was out of the question, I'm afraid this little one will have to wait for later clarification.  She did enjoy coloring the paper hat the restaurant provided, however, and her folks enjoyed the $2.75 price tag on the generous junior pancake breakfast.  The menu also features a separate section for seniors.  While technically you have to be fifty-five to order from this section of the menu, in my experience servers will allow anyone who would prefer these smaller portions and prices to order them.  A note about prices.  While the kids menu prices are very reasonable, select off menu junior beverages are a bit pricey (juice $1.79) and can drive up your total cost.  There is also a loyalty card that will help stretch the dollar of frequent diners.  The Southwest Omelet was perfect on our recent visit and definitely worth a taste.  The pancakes were uniform and served hot. In all honesty, however, it's the decor and the friendly staff that earns the restaurant four stars in this review. Menu offerings are solid, with a few amusing names scattered throughout, but are for the most part predictable and basic.  But come to think about it, isn't that what you want from a fifties diner?  Even though 5 and Diner is not a \"genuine\" fifties diner, instead an Arizona based chain's recreation of the era, it seems genuine enough.  I've noticed that several locations have closed in recent years, but the PV location seems to be unaffected and thriving."}
{"text":"The 5 & Diner is a great place to go! The food is good and the diner environment is fun."}
{"text":"Lauren knows us so well. Every time were in here, she always help us. She literally ordered our food without us saying anything!! She is great :)))) she's so friendly and full of energy, love her personality   We always get the vegetarian omelet. Yumm. I love this place.  Of course only at 1230 in the morning. :)"}
{"text":"Consistently good food.  Look, it's a diner.  You're not eating at the Ritz.  Flashback from a better time in American history with a soda fountain, malted, breakfast served all day.  Kristin was our waitress and was wonderful.  We even sat next to a table with two teen girls and their mom and the girls asked \"what is chicken fried steak\"?  I overheard and suggested turning in their mom to child protective services cause that's criminal.  We'll see if they order it."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time here at breakfast.  Its an old school diner.  Juke boxes at the table and everything!  We got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and hash browns.  It was only $3.99!  I got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee.  The heath bar shake was awesome!  They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container.  So its like 2 shakes in one.  It was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but I wasn't complaining......I love heath bars!    The service was awesome and our waiter was really nice!  Cool vibe, good food and low prices make this one of the best diners I have ever been in!"}
{"text":"Kids liked it, but I will not be back.  Had a raw meat smell when I walked in, but just was hoping that was because things were fresh. I didn't eat my fries, didn't like the flavor.  Only ate one of my sliders couldn't eat the second one. Customer service was good, they didn't charge me for my meal.  Still will not be back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.... Hostess was really rude and than got kicked out for smelling like smoke"}
{"text":"It was 11:30, I was near Central and Camelback and popped into a local restaurant that closed at midnight but the kitchen was already closed at 11pm.    So I headed a few blocks east to 5 and Diner and was so glad that I did.  The place was packed, but only had to wait a few minutes to get a booth.  I did notice a lot of teenagers/under 21 crowd but it was a Friday night and this place is open 24 hours, no harm, no foul.  My burger and fries were delicious, nothing spectacular but exactly what I expected.  My wife who is a vegetarian, was able to substitute the beef patty for a black bean patty and she was impressed on how delicious it was.  The vanilla shake hit the spot also, very yummy.  Only complaint was the onion rings that accompanied my wife's burger were a bit soft and not crisp.    Bottom line, I'll be back on the late night sometime in the near future, I'm sure of it!"}
{"text":"Just left the 5 and diner and it was the best service I've had in a while! My food came out fast and it tasted amazing. My server frequently checked on me and kept my drink filled up. Will be definitely visiting more!"}
{"text":"Eat there a couple of times a month. Usually good food and service, not this time. bread on sandwich stale. Extremely long wait for food and not prepared right. waitress not paying attention. Too bad enjoyed it in the past."}
{"text":"OMG, STAY AWAY!!! Just got back from 5 & Diner on Southern and where do I begin?  Let's start with the horrible flies!! We were literally under attack from the moment we sat down, but the worst thing??? One literally flew into my fathers MOUTH!!!!! I've never seen anything like it in my life! Should have gotten a clue from the filthy window seal with dead flies in it...The food took forever, it was cold and we had to get it nuked. It cost $40 for some pancakes, eggs, hot dog and burger, but we couldn't eat because the flies decided it was theirs for the taking!! MEAN FLIES!! After they saw us batting flies our entire meal, getting cold food (in an empty restaurant) and then a fly going into my dad's mouth, the waitress asked manager Kathy Riegel to take something off the bill... She wouldn't even come up to talk to me, just told our poor waitress NO. We will NEVER, EVER go back to the 5 & Diner...!!!"}
{"text":"As a born-and-raised New Yorker, I'm a fan of the typical local diner. This indeed is a local diner but more than just typical. They are old-school themed, I don't believe they close, and their food and staff is great. Being new to Phoenix in the particular area I live in this is \"the\" diner for me when I'm in the diner mood.  ***Update: I now bump them down to 4 stars as one weekend we experienced horrible service with guests in town. We had to remind the \"new waitress\" to bring us water at the least after about 10-15 minutes. She gave us a half-full pitcher that was likely from a leaving table. This was after reminding her about menus and notifying her after a few minutes that we were there to begin with (we were outside). Additionally, she continuously came \"short-handed\" and left one particular female friend of ours waiting each time. I'm sorry, typical courtesy in my book is \"ladies first\". I used to be a waiter and yet seem to give some slack when it comes to tip/reviews, but this was just too many strikes."}
{"text":"The place is so 50's - music, food, interior. The food quality is average but the staff is well known for its polite manners. I love the jukebox. It is like a time machine - you put a coin and a song from the 50's starts to take over the area. Having a sit in 5&diner is not just to eat or to have a glass of soda. It's more experience like than just a breakfast or lunch. Prices are a little bit up. Time to time could be overcrowded."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is 24 hours! Skip Denny's and go here, the food is soooo much better.  I love their first Friday's every month with live rockabilly, or country, or 50's era inspired bands. There is such a mix of ages there dancing and hula hooping it is a blast! My daughter is 5 and loves going to listen to the music, dance, and hula hoop. People drive their classic cars out, I've even seen a vintage trailer there. (The Scottsdale location does this on the 3rd Friday of the month too.)   The staff here is always super nice and friendly. I have always had the best service. For a date night try splitting the turkey club sandwich (this sandwich is huge btw) and a milkshake, it will fill you both up and only cost you about $15! For the kids they are served their meal in a cool classic car (my daughter has started to collect them she likes them so much)."}
{"text":"I've been in here when it's me and one other table. I've also been in when the place is standing room only. Either way, service is always spectacular and quick!  I'm always amazed that no matter how packed they get, those cooks on the line always pump out good food fast.   Watch for coupons in your mailer. They often send out free appetizer coupons when you buy two adult entrees."}
{"text":"Over all I was pretty impressed here.   Service was slow, but not to bad.   Food was very good, nice portions. We had fried pickles as an appetizer - good, but maybe a little more pickles for the price would make them better.  Decor is good, seems clean inside.   Lots of traffic in the place."}
{"text":"Was very surprised at this place. A group of us came after our NYE celebration. It's cute inside like a traditional diner. The staff is super friendly and accommodated our large group effortlessly.  The food is way better than Denny's and cooked fresh. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and hash browns and the biscuits were super soft. The portions are huge as well.   I will def be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere isn't bad, the food could be better. Our food was cold and they use frozen patties for burgers. The service wow, the woman had no personality at all. I'll never come back!! Good luck."}
{"text":"Just love this place. The country breakfast is always a hit with me but even when I deviate and have something different I have been very happy. Friendly service and easy parking make this a very regular breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price. I ordered an avocado burger w fries and it tasted amazing  First time here and I loved it. I'll definitely be back :D   Customer service was great too! And the waiter was so cute ;)"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place, so I tried to make it work, I really did....but this place is just a no-go for me.  The food is only ok, on a good day. But have you ever taken the time to look around while you're sitting waiting for your meal? The place is FILTHY. Sticky seats and booths, random stray hairs, grease, grime and gook in every crevice...  The last time we went I told my husband it was the last time I'd go, I just can't eat someplace that gross. I cringe to think what the kitchen must look like."}
{"text":"My Cobb salad was good.  My husband got the tuna melt and liked it too.  The place is clean and the staff was nice.  It took a little while for someone to take our order, but once it was placed the food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"Food was decent, they were extremely busy though, on a Saturday afternoon and didn't seem to have enough staff. Portions seemed pretty hearty, but I think I'd probably enjoy more during non-peak hours-the place was kind of a zoo, and all the staff seemed a little confused."}
{"text":"Val and Bill are the bomb! Great friendly service and fresh delicious food! Chorizo made on site!"}
{"text":"When you have a craving for a milkshake or sundae, this it the place!  They have many different flavors and will make one up for you if you ask. The waistaff is always friendly and happy to chat. I like that at this location there is outdoor seating and you can have meetings with groups. They have a Blue Moon burger with bleu cheese that's really good, too!"}
{"text":"My family & I recently moved back to Scottsdale. Me and my boys took a trip down to 5&Diner to each some great food, and to say hello to, Lee, the owner. Soon as I sat down, a weird feeling had overcome as the atmosphere was second to none and the outdoor tables were EMPTY! Next visit a week later, I brought my husband. This time, I asked our server to please bring, Lee from the office. Bad news came that he started his own burger business. I wasn't settling for that, I wanted to know where. All he told me was Scottsdale Rd & Shea. Googling that location tada, Indulge Burgers & More.   Moral to the story and review is our food wasn't good like we remember, and the service was mediocore and not the same as we remembered years ago. An owner, and staff can make or break a business. I don't believe this location will stay open for another year. We didn't feel welcomed to eat here, more like just a \"customer\"."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner using a Groupon. We were sat right away and drinks came soon after. Then we waited. And waited. Several employees walked by, each time seeming to look the other way. As if to say,\"You're not my table\".  Finally a guy came over (may have been the manager) and said,\"what can I get you?\" That's it. No \"Hi\" or \"are you ready to order?\". I was a little turned off at that point. I would've left since I was already annoyed at how long we were ignored for (I've done that before, you can tell when you're about to get crappy service) but the kids were \"starving\".  Anywho, my patty melt was ok. I've had better. Fries were pretty good.  Service continued to suck. Needless to say I won't be back. My family likes to eat out as a treat once/twice a week. When we find a place that has great food AND great service, we come back. That's where I'll spend my hard earned money. Not at 5 & Diner."}
{"text":"I just came from there and had a really bad experience. I was greeted just fine and was told to sit wherever I wanted. I sat down with my party of 3 and that's about as far as we got. Took us 10 minutes to finally get up and go, no one seemed to acknowledge the fact that we were there. No one came by to offer us menus nor ask what we were drinking/eating. Waiting for 10 minutes didn't seem that bad up until a couple walked in and within a minute, they were being approached and handed menus. It's a pretty small place to completely miss 3 hungry people. Funniest thing is that on our way out we were told to have a nice day .  We were never disrespectful nor loud nor anything of sorts. I hardly get on here and rant like this but I really feel they deserve one star."}
{"text":"This was always our after the bar, the movie or something that lets out after 9pm kind of spot when we wanted something a bit \"classier\" than Denny's.  Growing up in N. Phoenix, getting here was enough of a drive that it became it's own adventure.    I'm totally down w/ their shakes.  I love the Diner feel.  I love that you can sit outside on a good night.  Heck, I love the tiny booths with the jukebox - even though everyone knows there are SO many requests ahead of you, you won't get to hear your song you have to put in a quarter and do it anyway.    But I just got through going by there at about 7pm on a THURSDAY and the parking lot was packed!  PACKED!  I don't get it.  It's good.  I will never take anything away from that - but packed at 7 on a Thursday?  Wow."}
{"text":"The meatloaf with mushrooms and big pile of french fried onions on top, was sooooo good, and I took home half for another meal, like our server said I would be doing.  I used $5 for $10 off Groupon, but I would come in for that meatloaf without the Groupon, $11.  Their juke box was broken.  My friend said every time she eats at 5 and Diner, the juke box is broken.   Her fish and chips was pretty tasty, too.  Server was only 17, and very pretty and \"virginal look\", like a Disneyland or Marriot (Mormon) employee.  She was very vivacious, we loved her.  My other friend did not like her chicken pot pie.  The crust was like raw dough in the center, when I like it hard and flakey, break with a fork, but it was doughy and pasty.    I would have given 4 stars cos my meatloaf tasted so good, and we liked our server, but the food preparation was really really slow and there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant during dinner hour 6:30 - 8:30 on a Thurs night."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger through Postmates. Somewhere my order got slightly messed up but nothing major (burger toppings). Burger was good. I'd eat it again. The definitely go for quantity over quality on the fries. Definitely low quality frozen fries"}
{"text":"Good little spot for breakfast. I'm pretty limited for what I can eat for breakfast right now because I can't eat eggs or wheat. They had some great options and basically let me custom order exactly what I wanted. It came out just like I ordered and the service was great. Only thing they could improve on is the quality of their coffee."}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast there and feeling sick. I ordered a poached egg well done and it was a runny yolk instead. The orange juice tasted like tang and the Tomato juice tasted like a tin can. We didn't drink either. The coffee tasted like cardboard. The water tasted like chemicals. My husband got the skillet and said it was greasy. I ordered biscuits and gravy and it was pure salt. My fork had dried food on it and my husband's glass had old lipstick on it. The waitress didn't hang around for any complaints. I did not pay for the egg or juices and did not want to pay for any of it. This place will surely be closed soon."}
{"text":"I have been to other 5 & DIner restaurants and enjoyed my meal, especially the one at the Scottsdale Pavillions. However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.  We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.  My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.  M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.  Overall I'm extremely disappointed by this location. I now understand why there were so few people eating there as well."}
{"text":"Mixed review. Food was very good. Friday night met cousins after a 7 hour drive from California for a late dinner, had the chicken pot pie, was delish as was the French Dip, service was outstanding, very friendly waitress, Jill.  My father and I decided to go have breakfast on Sunday before we left home.  Big mistake, don't know if it was the owner but a lady with short bob type haircut, greeted us at the door and quickly sat us off to the left where there were no other patrons, being Mexican, my elderly father took notice quickly, I made the mistake of sitting him facing the front door and he counted and watched as the same lady sat more clients to the right where the bulk of the customers were.  Needless to say breakfast food was marred by this incident, I could see him watching as people entered and were seated with the majority, finally they sat another couple  with a child (Caucasian) behind us, but we were the only two clients sitting in the whole area, our waitress was excellent, her name escapes me now but we knew it was not her fault.  The lady with the short hair may or may not have done it intentionally, but my father felt slighted, segregated and discriminated  upon, we did not say anything but will not visit this establishment again due to this."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my visit today at this diner. The waitress was very nice and I have no complaints about her. I ordered the wedge salad and my daughter ordered the kids chicken nuggets. The food came out so quickly, I even commented how fast it was. When I looked down at my salad, the lettuce was brown on all sides and so wilted, I didn't even bother to cut into it. I immediately got up & handed it to a gentleman behind the counter requesting it be remade with fresh lettuce. When I returned to my table, my daughter had taken one bite of her nugget & stopped immediately with a face that only meant something was wrong. She said the nugget was cold. When I touched the inside of it, it was ice cold. I couldn't believe it. I again got up returning her plate to our waitress who was behind the counter telling her first my salad had old lettuce & now the nuggets are cold so we're done. I then left & went across the street to Red Robin which ended up being a very nice lunch after all. Whoever was working in the kitchen today at the diner obviously has no pride in what he's doing. I suppose the one star would be for the hot french fries."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! open 24/7 great menu and amazing shakes!!!!!!!!!!  love the theme always amazing service"}
{"text":"This is always a good place to go when you just want a sandwich or some comfort dinner food.  There is ample parking which is appreciates.  The patio is nice and at certain times of the year it is very nice.  Inside you step back I. Time to the old Pulman diner days.  The retro looks is very fun as are the tabletop jukebox.  The food is very good albeit a tad salty.  I love the tripledecker BLT, fries and a big ol' Vanilla Coke.  It is a delight.  The meatloaf is stick to the ribs and the hubby says the Reuben is good.  Salads are good and fresh.  Staff is good, fun without being  all Ed Debevic's over the top.  The servings are ample and very good.  Always a good choice when you just want some food like mom or grandma used to make.  As a Coca-Cola collector I really appreciate their art."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times & the food was always good. If I had an issue my server would gladly correct it, however my first time order from Grub Hub was very dissapointing. Chicken tenders were rubbery & cold, fries were almost raw & cold. Guess they don't care for orders to go."}
{"text":"5 & Diner.  Why do I keep coming here?  No, seriously.  Why?  Okay, it's the sweet and sassy waitress.  She can sell me anything.  Even dessert, when I am not hungry.  The food is mediocre.  I recommend sticking with breakfast items.  On this last visit, we ordered dinner.  The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8.  Not bad.    I somehow ended up spending $40+ for two adults and two kids on my last visit, even though kids were supposed to be 99 cents with the purchase of each adult entree.    Part of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3.99 per slice of cake or pie.  Let me review that dessert now.  Carrot cake?  Nearly inedible.  With two people splitting a piece, 1/3 of it got eaten.  It tasted like it had been in a freezer.  DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.  The 9 year old girl who ordered it said... \"this does not even taste like carrots.\"  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and then defrosted on the counter overnight.    Cherry pie?  YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.  If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.  Still, the atmosphere is cute.  The decor is interesting for the kids.    But if I ever remember that the food is blah, I will avoid this place.  I just don't ever seem to remember it until I am sitting there eating it!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, but the only issue we had was the blue cheese was awful and the employees were talking so load in a foreign language. If you want a GREAT burger go here."}
{"text":"As diners go, the service and food were fairly average, there was very little to distinguish 5 & Diner from the Denny's across the street, aside from its 50s-themed decor.  We had heard that kids loved this place, but the only comment our kids had was \"why does everything look so old here?\"  I'm not quite sure whether they were talking about the decor or the clientele (lots of elderly, some kids, very little in-between).  They did like the paper hats and the hulu-hoop rack outside though."}
{"text":"Went to 5Diner last night after work. First time I visit this place and had a pretty nice dining experience. I ordered the Fish and Chips. The food arrived just a few minutes after ordering and was absolutely delicious. The server was polite and attentive. The establishment decor is very cool and the ambient just right. Something I noticed is that the waitresses remember your name and greet you warmly at the door. I am definitely a fan of this place now."}
{"text":"Great service once again..good food..happy waitresses makes it a nice.place to visit.thanks!"}
{"text":"California burger with fries and a vanilla malt.  This is one of my ideal hangover meals.  It's not a healthy place and service isn't completely outstanding, but it's a fun little diner for what it's worth.  I seriously LOVE their burgers even though they're way too big and I always eat too much and feel sick afterward.  It's awesome to sit and eat outside as well."}
{"text":"ugh. had the mediterranean omelet. eggs were so overcooked they even looked rubbery, not to mention the taste. the artichokes were hard. the feta cheese was dry. flavors were odd. the only appetizing was the toast, and they don't make that in house."}
{"text":"What happened to my 5 & Diner? Used to be my go to place for great food, great service. Brought the family tonight. Horrible service, so so food, took forever. Filthy booth, feet were sticking to the floor. 100.00 bucks for 3 kids meals , a burger and a club? 4.99 for baby milkshakes? Nope. Bye bye 5 and diner... too many better options in Phoenix."}
{"text":"i have vomited in the bathroom here at least a dozen times, not from the food. it's always good to have a greasy burger after a night of drinking. i usually throw up before i eat so i don't waste all the greasy goodness that is 5&Diner.  as far as diners go in phoenix, this is one of the better options. it's a real diner as opposed to Denny's or ugh, whats left..most of the others are all long closed.  5 stars for the sympathy for my vomit bursts, 3-4 for the food, 4 for the fun atmosphere after dark.  yay.     PS. i'm sorry cleaning staff. :("}
