{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and lunch.  The got great food and fast service.  The owner and staff always welcome you with a friendly attitude which is a big plus nowadays."}
{"text":"I had the corned beef hash and eggs, hold the hashbrowns & substitute toast for biscuits and gravy.   It definitely satisfied my craving.   Their gravy has just the right amount of meat and texture.  The potatoes in the corned beef were pretty tasty.  My over medium eggs were cooked just right.  No runny white stuff. Coffee was perfect!  Not too weak.  Not too strong/bitter.  I'll be back soon.   I didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't tasted enough of their food yet.  Stay tuned for my next review.  ; )"}
{"text":"hours say open till 5pm, yet I just call in at 2:50pm and the lady says \"We're closed right now\""}
{"text":"Had lunch at the 51st Ave Cafe and it was ok. I had the Gyro Greek salad and it's was ok. Decent portion and taste was good. Service was very friendly and hospitable but the food and ambiance was just ok. If you are in a hurry for diner food then this is an ok choice."}
{"text":"My daughter an I had breakfast there this am. The place is nice and clean, friendly and fast service. Prices very good and before 8am they have very cheap specials.  We had 2 eggs cooked just how we asked, potatoes, bacon, toast, coffee for less then 8$. Would reconend this small cafe to any one. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem while picking up supplies from a nearby warehouse. Friendly staff and fair prices. I had the chicken chimichanga special which was not real special, just on the bland side. Could have used a topping of sour cream or guacamole to help. Looking at other's plates most looked good, so I will be back to try anything but the chimichangas. I should have known better than ordering Mexican food in a place that has all the pictures on their walls featuring Mediterranean and Greek scenes. My bad."}
{"text":"2 bean tostadas + 1 breakfast sandwich = $16  wow ! wth? i work around the corner but now i'm gonna drive the extra miles to eat anywhere but here . waste of money ."}
