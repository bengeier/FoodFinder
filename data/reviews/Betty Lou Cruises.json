{"text":"This was a really enjoyable experience. The food was good. It's great to see Madison from the vantage point of the boat and it's a fun thing to do with a group of people. Though I thought the trip was a little bit too long, I still recommend it."}
{"text":"Really fun!!  Our Captain Terri was a hoot!  She kept things light, and sprinkled in some fun facts about Madison and Lake Mendota.  Also, she made sure to ask each party as they checked in if they were celebrating anything, which I thought was a great touch.  We did the cocktail cruise, and got \"2 for 1's\".   We loved it!  My husband tried the wings and said they were good.  I definitely recommend this cruise!  Thanks again Terri for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Below is the letter written to the cruise line when we came home from our experience...  To whom it may concern,  I would like to start by saying a group of friends and I were very excited about tonights tropical cruise. We went so far as to follow the strongly suggested guidelines to dress accordingly for this themed outing (we had accessories from head to toe that included flowers in our hair, tropical clothing, grass skirts and a myriad of leis as well) because there was an offered prize for our efforts. The night started off well. The friendly captain informed us of the highlights which included the drink specials, food details and 2 competitions taking place throughout the night.  The first alarming moment of the evening was when a member of our party noticed additional drink coupons were being distributed to some party patrons as they boarded the cruise (please note that not one member of our 5 person group received one of these additional coupons).  Worth noting because it was a surprise to us, was the limited choice of liquor that was available with the \"buy one, get one\" coupon that was issued with our ticket purchase.  I would suggest that it be noted in the brochure or mentioned at the time of ticket purchase that this perk is so limited.  During our introduction we were informed of the abundance of food that would be available to us because of the low attendance of this cruise. Myself, my husband and my friend were the last of the 14 party goers to go through the buffet. At this time, the bacon wrapped pineapple was completely gone and the macadamia crusted grouper had only 2 remaining pieces (for the 3 of us). At no time were these or any other dishes ever refilled despite our report to the captain.   After returning to the bow once we finished our dinner the other couple in our party reported that the \"hula competition\" had taken place moments ago with only 4 of the fourteen patrons present (those who where currently on the bow of the boat). No one else on the boat was alerted that this opportunity to win another cruise was going to be taking place at this time. This was extremely disappointing because it was a highlight that we were really looking forward to!  Finally as the captain announced we were 10 minutes from shore, my friend and I approached her to inquire about the second competition (that of the best dressed luau attendee).  At this time she quite bluntly informed us, while avoiding eye contact, that that prize had alreday been given to \"the best tropical shirt\" on board.  Please note that other than the five people in my party there was only one other person who even attempted to wear tropical attire.  This gentleman was quite mildly dressed in theme.  This guest seemed to be a returning customer as the captain knew him by name.  He was one of the people who received an extra drink coupon and it became clear at this time that he obviously had a connection with your cruise line.  Needless to say, myself and the members of my party were endlessly let down throughout what we thought was going to be a wonderful night.  We know very well that word of mouth speaks volumes and unfortunately we have nothing positive to say about this experience. Because of our extreme disappointment, we felt it was important to make you aware of our negative experience. I hope that by informing you of this it will help you to better serve your guests in the future.  Sincerely,"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here back in July. The amount of guests we had was very small (little over 20 people) so the boat was very comfortable for the amount of people we had. We had a three hour cruise and got the Captain's lunch for our guests. The crew was great, the food was decent, and everything went smoothly on the day of the wedding. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it was very difficult to get in touch with them. They would rather have you call than email, but are hard to get hold of on the phone. Overall, we had a good experience and are glad we chose them for our reception."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner on a private chartered Betty Lou this past September and it was perfect. Multiple guests told me it was the best rehearsal dinner they'd ever been to. The food was good (not great) but what made it 5 stars was the wonderful staff, captain and views. The staff went above and beyond for us the entire night and the views from Lake Mendota couldn't be beat. The pictures from sunset are simply amazing. If you're looking for a unique setting for a private event of any kind, look no further."}
{"text":"Went on the Betty Lou Brunch cruise taking off from Mariners Inn doc, there was about 25 people aboard.they had plenty of room to move around with unlimited mimosa's. I thought 2 hours wouldn't be enough time for the trip but it was just right. Nice staff , plenty of good food and very relaxing. I'd do it again!"}
{"text":"I recently went on a Betty Lou Cruise for a rehearsal dinner - 3 hour dinner cruise around Lake Mendota, and loved it! The staff are excellent; we received amazing service from the two waitors on board. They brought us drink refills, as well as finger food between courses.  The food is also very good. Obviously not as complex as what you would receive in a restaurant, but it will definitely leave you feeling full and satisfied. You also get a ton of it. I don't even remember how many courses we were served, there had to be at least four! Drink selection is great as well. They serve a few island cocktails which really made me feel as though I was on vacation.   Our captain was great. He made sure to point out a few landmarks along the lake that I had not even heard of. Only complaint (and it's a small one) is that the boat and furnishings seemed to be a bit outdated. Other than that, it was a perfect night!"}
{"text":"Went on the dinner cruise for Mother's Day with my husband, daughter and her boyfriend. The captain and crew were very nice and friendly. The cruise was fun and it was nice to see Madison from Lake Monona.  The crew was very nice about taking group pictures for us when the captain strategically placed the boat in front of the Capital and terrace.  The buffet style meal was very good and the crew was very good about taking beverage orders while also making sure we were satisfied with everything. As I said it was Mother's Day. To the surprise of every mother on board , the crew handed out gift bags courtesy of the wife one of the captains. I found this to be a very thoughtful added bonus to our 2 hour cruise."}
{"text":"I wanted so bad for this to be the best Madison experience of my life! But it wasn't. We ordered our tickets a few weeks in advance so we didn't know that our cruise would be rained out. It was pouring and they had us come aboard anyway with the possibility of leaving the dock. We did not leave the dock. There was limited seating because half the boat seats are exposed. It was wet, stuffy, and crowded. I wish they would have canceled it instead of putting us on a drenched boat. We left early and very disappointed. We did not pay to sit on a docked boat only to pay for more drinks. The drinks were good. The food was stale. We didn't think they were going to refund the ticket costs because they have a strict policy online, but they did refund ticket cost. which I appreciate. I would give this experience another shot but I would not buy tickets more than a week in advance."}
{"text":"I'm surprised there aren't more reviews.  We did the lunch (on Lake Monona) and enjoyed it.  A 2 hour cruise, with a lunch buffet and cocktail service (soda and water are free, alcohol you pay for).  Food (including dessert) was prepared  at either the Mariner's Inn or Naut-i-gal, so it was good.  Some people said the Lake Mendota cruises are better; I could see that as Mendota is bigger--we finished Monona in an hour or less, and just kind of went back around.  You'll need some cash to tip the cocktail servers.  I think it was priced fairly overall."}
{"text":"Attended a networking event on a Betty Lou cruise around Lake Mendota.  It was a two hour cruise with drinks, finger foods, and the option of sitting in the cabin, on the back of the boat, above the captain, or on the front of the boat with the wind whipping your face.  I made sure to mingle a little bit of everywhere, and I had quite an enjoyable time.  The weather was perfect for being on the lake, and the time went by rather quickly.    The captain was a great guy, and his two employees were friendly and served up drinks and trays of food quickly and efficiently.    Good experience."}
{"text":"Betty Lou Cruises are great for celebrating an occasion or even just for amping up a lazy weekend. I've managed to completely luck out with weather both times I've been on the cruises, so my review counts for the best-case scenario! I was surprised by how many people fit on the boat; I honestly only felt crowded when running into somebody while going up and down the stairs for food. I would say that the top floor outdoor seating is the best- you're in the fresh air and don't have to worry about people shuffling around you to reach the buffet! Your best bet for getting the seat you want is to get there early and stand close to the dock, right at the front of the line. The service was excellent the whole time. The waiters were super smiley and came around constantly to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything else, and the captains were cheerful and gave insightful information throughout the Monona tour. We loved the views the whole time. The food buffet, while quite large for the size of the outing, was pretty average. Don't expect gourmet food... it's good, but I say spend more time on the mimosas ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I just went on the Live Music Betty Lou Cruise last Friday on Lake Mendota.  Overall we had a great time!  The cruise featured live music by a local solo acoustic artist and an open bar.  What we were disappointed by was the food.  Their advertised \"light appitizer/dessert buffet\" was simply chips, dip and some cheesecake.  I was sort of baffled they called this \"appitizers\" but in all honesty the great weather, music and top shelf drinks made up for our food disappointment."}
{"text":"I booked a Betty Lou private cruise on Lake Monona for my Mother's retirement party and it was great.  She loved it, which was the most important thing.  At $19 per person the open bar is a great deal.  The food was pretty good too - we ordered the basic appetizer setup and it was actually really nice.  It starts with chips and dip and moves into mini sandwiches and some slightly heavier items.  I also thought the boat was really cool too - there is an awesome covered outdoor area upstairs and a cute sort of throwback loungey area downstairs where the bar is.  The service was really great and the staff were laid back and fun.  The Betty Lou is almost a Madison institution and I highly recommend a private cruise for a special event."}
{"text":"Did the champagne brunch cruise. The staff was really nice and it was a fun afternoon. The food was a mixed bag - some of it very good some of it mediocre. Great service, the mimosas kept flowing!   Overall, it was a fun afternoon with friends and I would definitely recommend it as an activity. Would like to try one of the other cruises."}
{"text":"Today we did the champagne Brunch cruise and it was awesome! We did Lake Mendota, as we live in Monona, and thought the scenery and sights were amazing, tons of fun stuff to see!   Food- very good, and plenty of it! Save room for delicious desserts like chocolate covered strawberries, spoonfuls of cookie dough, and cheesecake bites.   Mimosas were flowin'!! Brandon is a great host, very friendly and kept everyone's glass full.   Seats- this is true, it's not a very big boat, and they pack it in. You have to be strategic with your seats. We ended up next to a huge family of 13, which took over the entire upper deck, but we moved to the front where the best seats are  Overall, highly recommend to any Madisonian or a great idea for guests!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner cruise on the Betty Loud as a private chartered cruise and IT WAS AMAZING! The captain and staff were very friendly, accommodating, and always asking the guests if they needed anything. The food was awesome, but the views were spectacular. I highly suggest using this company for private cruises as well as the public ones which we have done before, as different themes were very unique and fun. The atmosphere is something you can't get sitting at a restaurant. YAY BETTY LOU!"}
{"text":"We had an appetizer cruise the other night for our group of 30. Staff was beyond amazing during the entire cruise. They took care of everything including drink orders and appetizers, and we were extremely happy with everything. A beautiful sunny day on Lake Mendota just enhanced the experience.  I was also in charge of booking the cruise, and had a great experience with that as well. Our cruise director checked in with me about a week before the cruise to make sure everything was all set to go.  I would highly recommend Betty Lou for group outings, celebrations or just a fun night out."}
{"text":"My sister and I enjoyed this relaxing ride.  The food was just okay. Note to Betty Lou Cruise:  please make sure you don't run out of any items of food. Another time when I took a Betty Lou Cruise the food was much better. This could make a pleasurable evening fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went on the fish fry cruise for my birthday. Food was good, but the staff made it great. Made me feel special and treated my whole family well. I know that they don't control the weather, but it was perfect.  Absolutely recommend for a special celebration. Already planning our next trip."}
{"text":"I also am surprised that there are not more reviews for Betty Lou. We did the Monona brunch cruise and really liked it.  Overall, the gig is pretty sweet, but I'll admit they have some serious room for improvement.  Major cons: value for price, selection of seats on the boat, availability of crew/service  Major pros: taste and amount of food, quality of atmosphere/boat  It was really disappointing when we got on to be shoved out of the way by a group of young children, who ended up getting seats on the top deck. If you get there early (like we did), start to line up right in front of the wooden dock to the boats, as that's where they board from. It would be much more organized if they called groups onto the boat in the order they were booked.  The food was AMAZING. So good and perfectly organized into appetizers, main course, and dessert. I loved it!  The mimosas were tasty, but were weak and it was difficult to get a waitress/bartender as there were only 2 of them tending to the entire boat of 50 people. You are dismissed from your table to go and get food, but we were never dismissed for the first round. Again, it was difficult to get the attention of the crew/waitresses.  The views were really scenic and the captain does a quick spin at the end so that you can take photos with the Capitol and the Monona Terrace in the background."}
{"text":"Rip off won't refund your money for the two trips we canceled after they said they would .We have been a customer of Betty Lou Cruises for over 20 years we go on average of six boat rides which include dinner. The offer prime rib which they gave me half of a slice which was all fat I asked if I could have more and they refused to give me more saying that there's 32 people for one prime rib. The music is so loud on the boat I could hardly have a conversation or usually go on about six cruises a year I will no longer be going on any cruises. As far as I'm concerned this is a waste of money. update review the management of Betty Lou said they refund the other for a cruise this weekend planned because we were so unhappy they were refunded two of our cruises but not the other two they said it was the credit card company's fault that I haven't received the money. That's a bunch of BS this company is not a company I would want to do business with . When they slice you A one a slice of prime rib and then cut that piece in half and say here you go you know you've been screwed prime rip slice that I received was mostly fat what a waste of money I would never go on it but a little cruise again I would not recommend it.? Update we canceled  4 trips that we had planned to go on the Betty Lou the management said they would give us a refund they credit us for two cruises and said that it must be a mistake with my credit card company that they gave me the money for the other two which they didn't .so now I have to contest with my credit card company to get my money back what a piece of crap company. Don't do business with Betty Lou cruises. Betty Lou Lou cruises is named after the owners mom I bet you should be embarrassed to have her name as the company logo if she knew how her kids treat people."}
