{"text":"If ever you are in the mood for wings, Oggi's is your place. They are huge. I wasn't too sure when I ordered them since you order by weight not quantity so I didn't know what to expect. I ordered a little side salad to go with the wings. When the wings came I was definitely surprised at the size of them. I left there full and wanting to go back and try the rest of the menu. Next time!"}
{"text":"Meh.....   Service is good and our waitress was very nice. The food is mediocre and nothing special at all.  All of our meals and pizza we're cold and tasted like reheated  frozen food that was over priced."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars because our server was really nice and attentive. His name is Corbin ( I think that's how you spell it ) if you go there he will take care of you.  The place was nice and I love the ambience , it was something we wanted to check out for Sunday football. When the host sat us at our table it was the only table that had food left over from the previous dinners. And not crumbs, chunks of food, baby puffs & sauce. It was gross. I looked around to see if it was a Roadhouse thing ( they let you crack nuts and leave the shells on the ground) or if was just a turn-over tables and hurry and seat the next customers. So we can look it over, it happens I guess . So we ordered the Knots app and a vegetarian pizza. The Knots were pretty pathetic and tasteless but if you dipped it in the sauce the flavor goes to holy sweet! Like pucker sweet. The pizza was good but the sauce was sweet on that too so I didn't enjoy it but my husband did. I'm pretty sad about or visit. We have been wanting to go for awhile."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. Paid $35. + tip to get ice cold pizza, nasty soup and a salad. Waited over an hour for delivery. We will never order food or eat here again. And please do not get me wrong I have worked in many restaurants but this service was horrible. I could have went to a fast food place and paid the $ I spent here and fed everyone around me. Disgusting. I wouldn't feed this good to the homeless."}
{"text":"Oggi's by far is the worst restaurant in this area. We were better off going to Burger King (which is located in the same plaza) rather than this dirty place. I had family members in from out of town and I was embarrassed that I chose this place. The restaurant was empty and we waited several minutes before being seated. Additionally, we weren't greeted by our waitress, we were approached with \"Are you ready to order?\" I felt that this was very rude and our presence was not appreciated nor acknowledged. We were never asked for a refill for our warm water either. If you are trying to show guests a great time and eat great food, don't go to Oggi's!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing beer and solid food.   Definitely one of our favorites in North Glendale"}
{"text":"This is the best bar in the area. The food on the menu is diverse, and everything is pretty much great. I believe there are 14-17 beers on tap (6 or 7 oggi's, 3 domestic garbage, 5-6 rotating guest craft beers). Happy hour goes from 3-7 and varies depending on the day, with all day happy hour friday-sunday. Steph is an awesome bartender, so stop by for lunch! Stop reading reviews and just go there"}
{"text":"You guys need to get courteous people answering the phone.  Correcting us is not good.  Changed my mind on getting food b/c of her."}
{"text":"Agree with all reviews concerning the great quality of food and service!!!  But, I am very surprised that no one has commented on overall appearance of the interior of the restaurant!!!  Badly in need of not only a fresh coat of paint, but also new flooring, benches, and tables.  The bathrooms are actually disgusting!   Flat screen tv's were recently added, and that was a great addition.  I guess that the owners are not too worried since every time we come (which is almost once a week) we have to wait for a seat!"}
{"text":"$1 drafts during Happy hour. Above average beer and above average Pizza. They have a slightly thicker crust, I like a thiner crust but it is still good.  Other food on the menu is not too bad either"}
{"text":"must try philly cheese, potstickers, chocolate souffle, and pizza!"}
{"text":"Scottish Ale!! Good burgers and a decent Philly cheesesteak. The atmosphere is casual comfortable and family friendly with a combination of bar seating, high tops, tables and booths. TV's all around for plenty of sports action. And the McGarvey's Scottish Ale is great!"}
{"text":"Good place and food I'd very good for bar food. A bit pricey but good atmosphere. Great service."}
{"text":"I love pizza I am a pizza guy but when people serve you Pizza that isn't the way you expect it it turns out to be the worst lunch you've ever had I'm sorry but I will never ever be returning here again repeat pizza was awful"}
{"text":"Threw the pizza thrown out after 3 slices bland bland bland overpriced paid 22.50 for a large chicken and onion .....hey Oggi your competition is NYPD and Humble Pie have you tried their pizza it's worth the money.....never again.....chalked up as a loss.....gross"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Got a hawaian pizza which was no that great.  Broccli soup was delicious.  Overall would say place is so so."}
{"text":"Great food in a unassuming  environment... the beers are fantastic and don't miss the pizza and the quesadilla.  A great place to hang out with friends or family (is family friendly).  Never had bad service.  Parking can be a challenge at this location."}
{"text":"Service was slow but very kind. The food was awful. We had order a mushroom pizza and meat ball sub. The meat ball was not flavored and mushy. The dough in general dominated the taste of both dishes. It tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. We left with over half our plates filled with food. In general it was not pricey HOWEVER for the quality it was expensive. I could have made a better tasting pizza at home. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I waited a week for a good beer stumbled across California Gold and the World Series Pizza... Well worth the wait"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Came within 30ish minutes, food was warm! Got the bbq wings and a quesadilla. Both were AMAZING. The sauce the quesadilla is cooked in is to die for. Probably the best I've ever had! The wings are are drumettes which was a pleasant surprise. Large, and tasted great! I would definitely order from here again :)"}
{"text":"Man, let me find words. Bland. Tough. Overcooked. That was the pizza toppings. Mushy, tasteless and blah. That wad the ravioli. Wings aren't wings, but tough drums. And the price? We spent more than we typically do, for yuck. We will not go back."}
{"text":"First tried Oggie's in SoCal/orange county where i am from and when i found out there was one in AZ i had to try it.  Glad i did....Their Wimbledon vegetarian pizza is the bomb!  Their ingredients taste so fresh and they really stack it up!  Same great pizza taste/experience as in SoCal!  Lovin it!"}
{"text":"Oggie's pizza is devine!  I've been to this location several times and each time the crust has been perfect soft, chewy, and you can even smell the yeast!  They have lots of fun topping combinations on the menu and their desserts are great too!  Be sure to check out their happy hour menu for good deals on food & drinks!"}
{"text":"I cannot explain how thrilled I was to find that this franchise has popped up in my backyard.... I LOVE OGGI'S!!! I spent 11 of the last 12 years living in North county San Diego and have been a fan of Oggi's since they were called Stuffed Pizza before the pizza-brewery split.   There are quite a few items on their menus that I just love.... first of all the pizza is great, love the sauce, love the toppings, love the crust. Make it yourself or choose one of their specials.... you can't go wrong; besides anyplace that will let me make substitutions (which drives the hubby NUTZ!) gets an A+ on my list. The Oggi sticks as an app, especially when you have a night of drinking and watching the game planned, are a great way to start. One of my all time favorites is the balsamic chicken salad... There was a point, a good six month stretch a few years back where I was eating this salad like three or four times a week.... it is great to split before the pizza comes or a perfect meal in itself.   The BEER,,,, yummy. I have been called a bit of a beer snob, and its true; I don't like light beer or big domestic giants.... I have this saying \"If I can see my hand on the other side of the glass I probably won't like it.\" They have a great stout and porter, some seasonal beers and an occasional barley wine that are right up my ally. What can I say I like what I like, and anywhere I can pick up a growler is a good place by me."}
{"text":"It's the service that gets Oggies an extra star.  Beer selection is ok;  I wish it were larger or at least had more options in bottles/cans.  In a world IPA's (and they have a lot), there's not much room left on the taps for other styles.  Food is good, but I wish they had smaller portions or at least the option to order a smaller portion.  Most of the time, I want to eat but skip the food because it's just too much.  To be fair, there is a happy hour menu with small portions but it's limited."}
{"text":"Great place with a great staff and great atmosphere. Love the selections of beers on tap...."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken wrap, not bad good taste. Hubby had Matidor burger, said it was tasty. Service.... In the beginning it was decent, but then our drinks were about empty before she made it back. Refilled my husband's tea but not my soda."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed by service, food and beer! Just wish the actual bar was bigger, very limited. Loaded cannon pizza was killer, Oggi's beers were great as well! Love the IPA and Paradise Pale Ale! Definitely one of the great finds for great beer, food, service, atmosphere, music, sports in the Peoria/northern Glendale area, if you're kind of over the regular Bell Rd chain bars, hit up Oggi's, we'll probably be here!"}
{"text":"I have been to Oggi's many many many times. The food has always been great, the service is always helpful and accommodating but the beer is even better. You come to a pizza and beer place for just that but they give you so much more. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our first time trying in being new to the area. Pizzas is decent the wings were  a bust, tough, chewy, and could've been cooked a little bit more.  Did take out , and Original driver never did get here so I had to call and ask and they made a new order and send it out it was here in 22 minutes but overall time to get it was over over two hours.  They were very nice about it and offer to comp the entire meal so now I have a credit at the bar so to speak so we'll try that experience here the beer and atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Shouldnt let people smoke outside on the padio when people are eating eww!! And def can improve the hummas trio. Otherwise pretty good!"}
{"text":"Tried giving this place another chance after a long-falling out between the snarky owner and myself...and other regular customers he has offended over the years..., however, after a pizza delivery, and ordering a \"world serires with extra sauce\" the pizza in which we...once again...paid top dollar for....tasted slightly better than the box it came in. Stay away...far way...go some where else instead."}
{"text":"Oggi's has been one of our spots since we lived in California. It took a while for us to try one here in AZ with all the new local options available to us, but we gave it a try and it took us back home. It can be a little pricey but if you go for happy hour there are some good deals to be had. I'd say it is above average service, and consistent with the food quality and service we were used to in California."}
{"text":"When I first saw Oggi's, I was not excited, I thought it would be just another \"applebee's.\" There were a lot of TVs, which I'm not a fan of. But I also really like good craft beer, and unlike most brewery/restaurants I've been to, the beer at Oggi's was really, really good. I especially like the Scottish Ale. BUT THE BEER WAS ONLY ONE DOLLAR PER PINT! Good craft beer - far less expensive than any budweiser I've ever ordered at a restaurant.  And the food was really good, too. I've actually gone back TWICE within a week, which I rarely do with a restaurant I've just visited. The won-ton nachos are delicious, the garlic knots are great, the burgers are tasty and juicy, and I also enjoyed the wild mushroom tortellini. Even the pizza is good. The menu has lots of choices and lots of diversity."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here. The burgers were amazing and we had the pleasure of having the manager wait on us. She went above and beyond to ensure my Grandma had a fabulous 93rd birthday."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. Great place,  good food. Tried the pot stickers, hummus, and lettuce wraps this time. All were tasty, would definitely have again. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Take out tonight; 2 pasta dishes to go.   Probably could've put each $11 Entree's contents in a red solo cup.  Weak and wont be back."}
{"text":"This review is more so about the service over the phone.  I called to place an order for 2lbs of wings and a large pizza my total came out to $49.  Really didn't think much of it but when I got to pick it up and pay I heard them talk about a special that. Was never mentioned to me on the phone.  1 large. Cheese and 20 wings for $26.99.  I really felt that I  got ripped off because I believe that whoever took my order could've mentioned this special to me.  Especially since we went back and forth about how many wings the order might have.   That was disappointing to me and makes me not want to return.  We totally love the food there and it's so close to our home but things like that are just not right.  I hope someone there reads this and speaks to these girls about it and fixes it at least for the next customer ordering for pick up ."}
{"text":"Outdated, poor layout, could definitely use some tech upgrades-- don't you need better TV's to be considered a sports bar?"}
{"text":"Three stars not so much for the food but the decor.  I had a wonderful meal, pizza was delicious kids ate all their food, and they are pickey!  I am sorry but the fact that the booth we were sitting is was so worn away I almost asked to be seated elsewhere.  Part of being a restaurant is having a nice clean place to sit and eat... Not on a worn down torn stained booth.  If take as much pride in your food as your facility job would have received 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"We have been going to Oggi's for the past two years, and it has quickly become our go-to sports bar. They offer great drinks at reasonable prices and always provide excellent service. The environment is friendly and laid back. Not to mention, it's always very clean. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great bartender,  fantastic pizza. Happy hour portions are impressive.  The stout was enjoyable too. Enough large screen TV's to watch all the games on a Friday night.  Patio seating available..."}
{"text":"Still LOVE this place. I do agree the inside must be redone! Always get great service. Oggis is happy to help out with any fundraisers ie soccer, football, a special cause, you name it, they accommodate.  Also have call ahead seating. A PLUS.  The happy hour menu is great!!! Wings are a must."}
{"text":"Tried Oggi's first in Del Mar, CA and it was really good, but this time it was even better. Our waitress, Stephanie, was so personable and friendly. Her recommendations were spot-on and everything came out just as we ordered it. The beer was great and loved the sample flight so we could try lots of variations of beer.  Happy hour and lunch specials will have me going back for more."}
{"text":"Just by the danger imposed by their delivery drivers. Again, I watched their delivery driver going down 67th Avenue in Phoenix well over 65 mph in a 40 mph zone. Weaving in and out of traffic. Yes, I did call Ogg's and their comment was... \"we always go down 67th Avenue that fast\". The only reason I was able to get the company name and phone number was that he got held up at a traffic light. Then... back onto Highway 101 where he accelerated up over 80 mph. Now Oggi's Sports Brewhouse Pizza, if you don't care about the motoring public and have such disregard for your neighbors and customers... I darn sure will never walk into your establishment again because I am most confident you have less regard for the quality of your food."}
{"text":"This place is solid in every way.  Great local brewed beer.  The food is surpisingly good every time.  The menu is huge and they really do everything well from pastas and pizzas which are excellent to their Philly, which is equally great (they put a little gravy on it, mmm), and wraps.  Fries are darn good.  Servers are all nice and like working there. It shows.  Good lunch specials.  Good happy hour too with half priced appetizers.  I really recommend this place.  Solid and semi-local.  Can get busy but I always sit at the bar.  PS.  Believe it or not I met my wife there a few years ago!  Thats why it gets the 5th star.  :)"}
{"text":"The food and service were good. Prices were okay.  That being said, I was there on the Monday of the college football championship.  With the game still in the third quarter they closed at around 9pm. We were able to finish our beverages, but they had locked the doors, put the stools on the bar around us and closed. Definitely not a \"sports bar\" snd should not present itself as such. Disappointing to go to a place promoting itself as a \"sports bar\" only to find out it isn't."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING pizza and the best Teriyaki wings I have ever had. This is our go to place for big family dinners. Great staff and service!"}
{"text":"Decent happy hour prices although they change their times often. Margherita pizza was great but quite expensive. Sweet potato fries are a must. Friday happy hour is 1 dollar off all alcohol. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the restaurant and ordered takeout Food was delicious both times and service was great.  Ordered Pizza, Wings, and  Burgers; all we're great.  Will definitely be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Better than expected! HH all day Friday with 30% Yelp checkin good after 10PM. Drinks and enough food for 2-3 people for $35! HH salad was awesome and big enough for dinner entree with flatbreads on HH special extremely good and $5.99! Caitlyn in the bar is the best bartender I've seen in forever. She pours the drinks and serves all tables in the bar area prob 10-15 tables."}
{"text":"1. Wings are good, flat bread is okay, pizza gross!  2. Don't call yourself a brewery, if your beer is shipped in! None of there beer is appealing, and never have many on tap.  3. Service is stupid slow 18 minutes to get are ticket, took it to the counter to pay, the two teenage girls looked at us and just kept talking till anther person helped us 5 minutes later. 3rd time going there and last.  4. I might order on-line for the wings??"}
{"text":"Hello friends .  For me Oggi's and the food  is just ok , but I have to say it has a great sport like atmosphere , lots of big screens and people were having a good time . The staff is friendly and service was fine . Like I always say don't take my advice you must go and make your own assumptions and when you go enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and both times were great. Servers are friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. They have a good selection of beer on tap also."}
{"text":"From the Ant on the bar to the over vinegar Mediterranean flat bread and the sucky burger with the under cooked onion rings. Never eating here again. Don't get me started on the beer....yuck"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Their pizza is decent, but if you come during Happy Hour, you'll find some great finds- garlic knots are so yum and the flatbreads are also quite good.   Very friendly customer service and the vibe is really fun. Chill during the day, sports bar atmosphere at night. Go with a group!"}
{"text":"GREAT local place with a huge variety of microbrews, guest beers and food.  I've been going in for years and the faces that work here tend to be the same.  They are highly attentive and friendly.  Harry is the best and in addition to the beer is a reason I continue to go visit often.   They have a seasonal menu and we fell in love with the baked potato pie pizza, served thin crust.  It went away PLEASE bring this back and put it on the regular menu!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Love the garlic knot's, pizza, and wings.  The beer is pretty good as well.  Unfortunately, I forget they are so close.  I am adding it to my list of places to visit more."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing special. Came here for the first time only because of the yelp deal 30% off of all food items AND the daily specials. We came on Thursday which was 2 for 1 drinks, thinking we could save ourselves some money with both those deals. VERY MISLEADING. 30% off is LAST HOUR they are open, and 2 for 1 is ONE person has to order two beers, you can't order two beers for two people. Ended up spending way too much money for way too subpar beer and food."}
{"text":"I am really not a fan of this place. We ordered pizza and we ended up throwing most of it away. The sausage is not old and the crust is weird."}
{"text":"Lunch..manager was rude. restaurant is dirty floor, table and windows. assume the kitchen is dirty as well. wont go back again"}
{"text":"Still really dig this place. We are moving, so our Oggi adventures will likely taper, but we will have to make a trip from time to time when visiting family on the west side.   Outstanding service. Caitlyn is exceptional behind the bar. Fast and attentive, and always knows exactly what we drink, even though we don't stop in all that regularly.   Food is still solid every time I come in. Pizza is a little bready, but still good. Wings, flatbreads and knots are all great on the happy hour menu.  Certainly one of my favorite establishments in town."}
{"text":"Just got finished, was good. Will order from them again. Delivery was 40 mins food was warm. Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This is a great local place to enjoy a nice cold beer and delicious food! We walked in and were seated and greeted right away. The waitress came and took our drink orders and they brought it out nice and cold! We shared short rib nachos which was delicious.  I had the grilled chicken club sandwich and my husband had the Philly cheesesteak.  Both were delicious and the portions were generous.  There are tons of TV's to watch the games and the place was super clean. We definitely will come back and support this local bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Food = Bland, flavorless, typical bar fare. (we had burgers ordered med - arrived very well) Drinks = Prices are great!  Service = pretty good - kept drinks coming. Overall = would stop back for drinks and to watch a game but, unless the idea is to get so drunk I forget what food is supposed to taste like - I'll pass on the eats.  Maybe the pizza is good? A lot of takeout customers picking up pies..."}
{"text":"We order for delivery all the time. Love love love. Never fails to be awesome!!!"}
{"text":"It's all about the wings for me. The large selection of draft beer doesn't hurt either.  The bartender is salt of the earth.  This is a great place to watch the game or get above average American pizza."}
{"text":"Oggis is a sportsbar/brewery in north Glendale. Its located in a nice area near Arrowhead Ranch. Inside they have dozens of tvs, lots of booths, and a small bar. The food is just okay. Nothing outstanding or horrible. The wraps and beer are probably the highlights. They have half a dozen or so home brews that are not too shabby. The pizza is the low point. Doughy and ragu-ish type sauce that does nothing for me. Oggis has a happy hour with discounts on the brew as well as a lot of other items. While I wouldn't go out of my way for anything served at Oggis, if I was in the neighborhood and wanted to grab a quick bite, beer, and watch the game it would be on my list."}
{"text":"As a San Diegan, Oggis original home, I was really disappointed with my home town pizza brew.  My sausage artichoke pizza was a spot above your home baked frozen pizza, just less chewy.   I suspect my trip might have been better if I didn't follow the bar tender's advice to get the house tomato sauce on a normal crust.  Everyone around me got their buffalo sauce on a thin crust, and appeared to be really enjoying themselves.    So I got a full flight which is 8 tasters for $9, not too bad.  If you aren't a beer drinker get the Light Lager, if you like medium beer get the Scotch and the black if you like beers dark as night.    Light lager. One of the best lights on tap anywhere with a little wheat finish Amber. Hoppy start  with no body  and a stingy finish Pale.  Worse than amber  Hef. So so, just no wheat taste  Gold.   Absolutely unremarkable and indistinguishable from the amber and pale  IPA Lingering hoppy water Scotch ale. Some maltiness with a splash of caramel.  Best beer of the bunch. Black.  A darker hoppier version of the Scotch.    An OK place to catch the Coyote game and kick it with your guy friends.  If you're looking for your authentic pizza or craft brews, look else where."}
{"text":"I regretfully rate my most recent visit with 1 star. This was not my first time visiting,  and every previous visit has been great. On this trip, I had the Baja 500 and a couple Double Up IPA's - my meal was great! My wife had the pulled pork sliders - the BBQ sauce was waaaaaaaay too sweet. My oldest daughter had the Angus burger, and my youngest daughter had the cheeseburger sliders. Both of my kids said that the beef was super peppery. I tried it for myself, and they were right. It's unfortunate,  because we've never had a poor food experience here before. It's gonna be tough to convince the family to go back so I can get some more of that Double Up IPA."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents and my husband.  The beer and wine were good.  The flavor of the wings were good as well; However, they were drumettes. On the first order, we received all drumettes.  I requested some wings on the second order, but the server did not seem to care to make the request to the chef....and again on the second order, all drumettes.  After speaking to the manager, we were informed \"the menu is misleading\" and Oggi's only serves drumettes.  We also had the pizza.  It was good but was lacking in sauce (see picture).  We did ask for a side of sauce and we did receive some from the manager- not our server.  Unfortunately, after requesting the manager regarding the wings, we hardly saw our server again- which was sad because we would have still tipped her well and just considered her new to the job.  So, overall, the only thing really good was the drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Pizza needs more sauce in my opinion. Service is good I received a warm 24 oz beer and told the waitress and she came back with two more cold glassed 16 oz beers. A little pricey but great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Didn't give it 5 stars because service was slow but the food was amazing . Tried the marathon flatbread , very good. The beers are great . Kids portions are large and everything is made fresh . Will definitely return !"}
{"text":"I live near Oggi's, and have been going there for years.  The staff are all accommodating.  Management takes an active role in insuring that the vibe is positive and friendly.  I love the beer selection, something for every taste.  Food is good, not great, but you're not paying for great.  Flat-bread pizza is a steal, and custom orders are welcome!"}
{"text":"This place was not bad. Always busy and always loud. Wish it was brighter inside. The food is good and the place is nice. Wouldn't mind going here for a date or to take friend and family. They can work on some things customer service is alright."}
{"text":"The beer and bartenders were good. The food was meh. Keep returning so my youngest can visit his former coworkers when he is in town. But I can watch the Coyotes games ((or other hockey game)) which is important for me"}
{"text":"Food was bad, only to be rivaled by horrible service. Items left off meals food cold... The place was not even crowded"}
{"text":"Although the food was very good at this restaurant, it is likely that I will never return. Upon my visit, I mentioned the broken chairs to the manager. (I recently lost the end of a finger in a broken chair at a restaurant.) His reply to my concern was that he would put it into the \"whatever it's worth column.\" I cannot support a restaurant that is not concerned for the welfare of its patrons! Good luck if you go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wings. Easily the best in Phoenix. They are sold by the pound and are all drummets. They are dry rubbed and baked in the pizza oven. Scrumptious. They have a lot of craft beers on tap. What else could you want?"}
{"text":"This place sucks, slow service, bad service, barely edible food and super over priced for what it is, food was cold, i would never eat at oggis again."}
{"text":"Oggi's is awesome! Great food, good beer, and pretty good service! My boyfriend and I go sometimes on Wednesdays and get dessert and cheaper beer! Cool atmosphere! Really great wings!"}
{"text":"I am extremely upset and disappointed in this establishment! I not only told the person taking the order that the pizza was to be gluten free but specified my son had a allergy to gluten. When we received the pizza it looked just like the regular one as I noticed as my son started to eat it. I called just to verify that it was gluten free and was told it was not gluten free this is very serious and could cause someone to be very ill! They seemed to act like it was no big dill and don't even offer to refund my money! You would think they would take people's health a little more serious! Unbelievable what horrible customer service!!! Will not order from there again!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza, garlic bread knots/ sauce and ranch I've tried around Phoenix local area. Bread and crust was really fresh and perfect crisp. The ranch is great and the pizza marinara sauce is delicious. Wings are ok/good. ONLY things I dislike is the place needs a little work- the carpet looks old and smells funky and feels muggy inside so is some of the tile areas and the restroom was crappy and didn't look sanitary. I'm glad I didn't use the restroom until after I ate other wise I'd be in a ugly mood and judge the food before I got it. Waitress was ok she just took a while to come back and get my check and give me more water but that's not my main concern. I will defiantly come back but please fix that carpet and restroom and other things that hurt my eyes. I pay close attention to these sanitary details."}
{"text":"Great food! The pizza is amazing. They have a wide array of menu choices.  Great place to watch any sports game! Staff are very friendly! The owner is very personable as well."}
{"text":"Laid back, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff (especially about their beers!)... and more importantly, great food and beer!  I recommend most of their menu (burgers and sandwiches), their calzones are delicious, and their pizza is pretty solid (I'm from Chicago so that bar is set high).  If you like artichoke, their chicken parmesan sandwich is worth every penny.  Most importantly their beers are pretty generally excellent, I'm hooked on the Torrey Pines IPA, and they have happy hour from Friday to Monday (all day).  Four of us had dinner and a few drinks each for only $65.  I highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place overall. Only have been here a couple times but the vibe is good and lively. Their food is good and service is pretty on spot."}
{"text":"Can't say I ever paid $18.00 for a picture of beer, but now I have. Pizza, needs less dough, more sauce and cheese,don't  let the picture fool you. Service good though but I was here about 2:30 pm, maybe ten people in the lace. All in all won't come back!/"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Vodka Penne Di Parma. We order it for delivery and my friend raved it was the BEST pasta dish she ever ate. It has such good flavor. Unami! I ordered the lasagna veggie roll up, it look like a regular piece of lasagna and it was lite and yummy. My husband always enjoys the meaty Heavyweight pizza. We ordered on a Friday night around 730 and our meal arrived in 45 minutes or less. Everything was in the order which I appreciate. The salad was kept cold too. Oggi's Ranch dressing Is the best. We love living close to a great place for food delivered or a place to eat & have a great beer. We always get awesome service.  They have Friday Fish Fry, but I recommend grilled fish tacos."}
{"text":"Every time we come it's great service.. Great atmosphere. Repainted, new TV's new booths!! Great place!! Amazing wings. Great beer. Yummy salads  What more can ya ask for!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here this week with my wife. We had never been before but had heard it was good.  We ordered honey bbq wings. A small Margherita Pizza and some nachos.  We had two beers to start off which were really cold the server stopped by probably 4 times before the food came to check on us. When the food arrived I had ordered another beer but she must have forgotten because we didn't see her again for @25 Mins. The nachos seemed like they had sat out for a while as the cheese was practically cold. The bbq sauce on the wings was definitely not  a honey bbq but some strange bbq sauce which was not good and they were pretty overdone. Finally the personal size pizza had no flavor at all and the crust was awful. Like crunchy cardboard.   I would not recommend this place and definitely will not return."}
{"text":"Well whoever the driver is in the white Nissan Frontier just blew threw a stop sign and almost caused an accident while I was with my girlfriend. Looked right at us and didn't care. I'll never go here for that reason alone."}
{"text":"My man performed a Google search today for delivery in our area besides the usual weekend pizza or Chinese. He found this place and we decided to try it out. He got the meatball sub and enjoyed it. I got the Philly cheese steak and it was fantastic. I am originally from NY and grew up eating real Philly subs, in Philly. These taste almost exactly like them. It was like tasting and smelling my childhood. Just needs a tad bit more cheese and gravy and it would be straight Philly deli style. We will definitely be ordering from them in the future :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The ingredients are super fresh, the dough is either made in house or so good you can't tell. They have interesting topping combos (but in the best way). The beers are good too, but even if you don't drink, you must eat here! Staff is super friendly as far as I've experienced. I recommend it! Check this place out if you love pizza! My favorite is the Marathon and my husband swears by the Heavy Weight (\"packed with protein\")."}
{"text":"This place is great!   The beer is good, the staff is so warm and welcoming.   I love the sports ambiance of it as well!  There are a few items on their menu that are absolutely delicious and that hit the spot!   During March Madness and the basketball playoffs it gets really exciting. At least for me because I am a huge basketball fan but it gets even more exciting during football for everyone else because they have all the games on!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best Cobb salad in the valley!! Over-Loaded with toppings, I've ordered this multiple times and it's consistent in the amount of topping, freshness , and their homemade Ranch dressing is the bomb! Order extra of that for sure!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here has to be frozen tombstones. The crust was chewy and looks beyond cheap. The cheese is just as equally as awful. I can't imagine why they call it their home made dough and sauce. Their cheesecake is just as big of a joke, as it too is frozen. I hope they care more about brewing their beer than they do making food. I hate giving bad reviews but they need this to improve. I won't be returning to find out but best of luck."}
{"text":"Nice avocado quinoa salad, killer wings are good. I like their California gold beer and their pale ale.  The Oggie sticks are good if you are looking for cheesy garlic bread.  Plenty of TVs with all the sports"}
{"text":"Better version of a family bar & grill. A+ food. Wings are to die for I just hate that they are so darn expensive (2lbs) very friendly staff. Always clean"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here!  It can get crowded, once you taste the food you will see why.  We love the entire appetizer menu.  You could also try the vodka penne de parmia...everything is so good.    Last time we went the waitress told us that it is ALL DAY EVERY DAY happy hour!!!! from now on?   YES.  I wish we lived close.  We would be here all the time."}
{"text":"wings are perfect! Beer selection is great the vegetarian lasagna was amazing!, Kelly  (bar server) was good. ww will be back & would recommend"}
{"text":"Placed an order that was reasonable in price and super tasty. had the northern pizza and loaded fries. Great food while unpacking"}
{"text":"I am so thankful that this place delivers all the way to me. I am tired of most of the places around here. The pizza is really good and the wings are very tasty as well. They deliver super fast and the drivers have all been very nice. I will be ordering from here more often."}
{"text":"My \"Cheers\"    for many years...great staff, great food...great service...only spot to meet friends and watch a game...."}
{"text":"Soooooo where's the brewhouse? It's not here. This is a franchise and the brewery is in California. Didn't know this until we got here and looked around and asked our waitress (server was fantastic).  I'm not sure you can call this a brewhouse though. Disappointed with the feel of this place (basically a neighborhood restaurant), BUUUT!...but the veggie flatbread was VERY GOOD!!! Aaaaannnnd the pale ale was excellent."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location quite often, but the quality of the food seems to have gone down quite a lot. My most recent experience was calamari which was poorly cooked, lukewarm beer, and just a general poor quality for the price paid. As great as they used to be, I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Phoenix.  Harry the bartender is such a great guy and totally friendly.  Staff is friendly and work hard.  Good beer and guest taps.  Pizza is money!  Give this joint a try and I bet you will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Oggi's to watch the World Cup and drink some beer. At the beginning the service was prompt, which was to be expected since they weren't busy. The first disappointment at Oggi's came when they didn't have their California Gold on tap, which I would have been fine with until the second disappointment. The second disappointment came when the waitress admitted she had no knowledge about the beer. In result, I settled for a beer that was warm and sweet...in all unsatisfying. The third disappointment came from the continuously declining service. The service was awkward because the waitress never stood in front of the table to ask how I was doing. Instead she would do a walk-by-half muffled \"you okay?' The most annoying thing about the employees at Oggi's was the young bus girl who was walking around with her cell phone in her back pocket. First of all, you're here to work! Second, where the hell is your manager and why are they allowing cell phones while you're on the clock? Anyways, I sat through the whole soccer game and never had a glass of water brought to me (thanks to the lack of focus from the bus girl). The food at Oggi's isn't bad, but nothing to write home about. In all, a pitcher of beer and a chicken sandwich for $22 wasn't worth sitting in a gaudy sports bar posing as a \"brewery\"."}
{"text":"Good craft beer and good heavy pizza.  Friendly service.  Got stuffed with a smile!  Ordered the Triathlon pizza, boneless wings, sweet potato fries, McGarvey's Scottish Ale, and some sodas."}
{"text":"Wow... Incredibly disappointed after being on hold 2 times to speak with the manager to ask about a credit for a pizza that was cold when delivered by an employee who was lost and had to be walked through how to get to our house.  No apologies whatsoever from the manager and who finally offered a credit for the pizza but didn't verify any info and just hung up. The driver was apologetic which was the only customer svc delivered. We've seen a decline in the food and menu changes and will not be ordering or visiting Oggis in the future.  Disappointing as we have been a customer for about 4 years."}
{"text":"Yummy home made crust. Staff wasn't the friendliest, but maybe they just had hangovers from Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Oggi's has decent pizza but TERRIBLE service. We have tried going on our lunch hour several times & more times than not, they couldnt care less to make you late getting back. The female servers & the manager are incredibly rude. Several coworkers & myself will NEVER go back. Their happy hour sucks as well. $13 bucks for a pitcher of bud light? You can get that price anywhere & beat it most places to boot. Their produce is often questionable as well. Several salads came wilted with bitter cucumbers & shriveled pepperchini's. All in all, TWO THUMBS DOWN."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice bar/restaurant environment, this is the spot.  The staff has always been really great.  They run pretty good drink specials on weekdays.   The food is reasonably priced.  The food is good, but not great though.  The best items on the menu are the deserts by far.  With that being said, I will definitely continue to be a happy customer.  It's not our favorite spot, but sometimes it's just what we're in the mood for."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego where Oggis is great for wings, pizza, and Padres. I was thrilled to find one near our new home here.  We always sit in the bar for pizza and beer. We're always served by Harry, and he is the best.  The pizza tastes just like home. This is our go to for pizza. My only critique, which isn't a big deal, is the layout of the place. The Oggis in SD are just cooler, I mean the look more bar like. This one is laid out like a Denny's.  I think that's why we always just sit in the bar area.  Anyway, to wrap it up, this is our pizza place for life as long as we're in PHX."}
{"text":"We had 2 pizzas last night.   The pizza was too dry because it had very little sauce and cheese.  The pepperoni was of mediocre quality.  The server was always behind.  One the straws in our drink was sticky.  The audio for a game that was being showed on about 37 TV's was too loud. This place used to be good but not anymore.  You guys really need to pay attention to food quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and love it.  The menu is shockingly large compared to most brew-pubs and sports bars.  They have great Italian food, great pizza, wings, burgers, and lots of other variety.  Their house chips with garlic and parmesan are simply stunning--must try.  Service is always friendly and fast.  The pricing is typical for this type of restaurant, so you're really getting a good value with the quality of the food.  They have a good beer selection, I'd recommend the sampler to get a taste of all of them."}
{"text":"I only tried to eat here once was awful.my chicken was so dry I nearly chocked....I hear beer is cheap...guess this place is only drinkable"}
{"text":"We enjoy Oggis.  Food is good, especially the Oggis special pizza. Beers are really good, we enjoy the Duck Dive Hefeweizen and the Torry Pines IPA.   Harry the barman is great, he's friendly, and quick with his service. Great neighbourhood bar!"}
{"text":"1st bad sign. It's a sports bar/restaurant and the place isn't busy during the NFL Divisional round games. Waitress was quick to take drink order and disappeared for 10 minutes to return with two iced teas. Tea was either old or was sitting in a tea stained container, but tasted horrible. Asked for a diet soda instead which I had to remind I ordered when the food arrived. They person who brought us our food (not our waitress) said, \"yeah, some people don't like the iced tea.\"  Hmmm. It wasn't flavored tea, it shouldn't be that difficult to make or correct.  People complain about it, and you do nothing about it?  Food (burgers and fries) were pretty good and was served in an appropriate time frame. I guess my big complaint is that the service stunk. You couldn't find the waitress to save your life. No else seemed to care that you sat there with a disgusted look on your face. Not the same memories I had visiting Oggie's in the San Diego area. Those were really good restaurants with good service."}
{"text":"Food is ok.. But both times I've ordered delivery it has taken well over an hour to get my food. I live 3 minutes away. Wish they would call if there is going to be a serious delay so I can have the option to pick it up before the hanger kicks in.   Update: price increase. Still super long delivery time. I like the beer and food but will prob go elsewhere as a result"}
{"text":"The five cheese march madness pizza was outstanding. I also tried the happy hour house salad it was good but dressing was some lemon herb concoction and that was only ok. I saw the chicken wings, they look good, but I did not try them.  Chris, our server, was very good. Very timely with his service.  They have plenty of tv's with sports of all kinds to watch.  They have plenty of beer options.  I LIKE THE SMALL RECTANGULAR leftover pizza box, perfect for 1/2 a pizza.  Only gripe was ordered 8\" pizza but was served 12\" pizza and price, didn't complain because pizza was great and service was good, and who doesn't like leftover pizza.  I also liked that this place was roomy, open, seemed inviting and they have a patio outside.  Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"There are times when it's nice to go unnoticed... when you are hungry and want pizza, that is not one of those times. I dined here and the service started off great. The hostess seated us immediately upon arrival, and let us know that our server will be by shortly. Little did we know that shortly is between 8 and 10 minutes. I could attribute the poor service to the group of stoners seated in the booth over, as they were a large group and loud, but that's no excuse. Once the stoners left for another blunt, the restaurant quieted down, and we were finally acknowledged. The food was decent, not the best pizza, but when you're starving, anything will do. Hopefully if we come back next time, the staff will acknowledge separate parties in a more timely manner."}
{"text":"Never got the opportunity to try this place. Oggi's shares a parking lot with several other businesses and as I was pulling out of the lot headed toward a side street, a small Frontier came barreling out of the back. Didn't even make a half-assed attempt to yield. The truck was plastered with Oggi's logos and a sign atop the truck.   I let it go because I figured he must have been in a hurry. Pizza boy and I are at a stoplight waiting. It turns green. We both turn left onto 67th Ave South bound. I need to turn right on to Union so I change lanes (with plenty of room, mind you). Pizza boy starts waving his hands and flipping me the bird! He gets aggressive and starts driving like a maniac, swerving, trying to brake-check me, etc. This psychopath is nothing but a liability to the company driving like that!  He then proceeds to LIGHT A CIGARETTE in the DELIVERY TRUCK with someone's FOOD inside! Disgusting. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that a major health code violation? The joke of a manager did nothing to help the situation. He said the owner would be in touch with me, haven't heard anything back yet and that was on Sunday. After this experience I don't care to try the food or support this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"We got Margarita & pepperoni single serving size. Really enjoyed the margarita pizza will order that again. We also got the hot wings they were average good news they delivered which was nice when your craving pizza, don't want to go out but don't want a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I place my order online and asked for all the chicken well done... bought 4 lbs of wings and 2 sides.  As we started eating we all noticed there was blood coming out from the center of the wings  my daughter had eaten a few by the time we realized it.  Fingers crossed that we don't get food poisoning!  Almost all the food went to waste, we all lost our appetite after seeing that.  I called and spoke to the manager and instead of being apologetic he kept saying how \"it's baked for an hour then fried\", \"Maybe it's just pink meat\", or \"I don't know how that would even happen\".  Ummm if the chicken is PINK then it's under cooked!!  At the end he refunded it all.. As a manager he needs to learn to not be so rude.  I will not be going back! They lost us as customers... and we always spent $60+ each visit.  Be glad I gave you 1 star!!"}
{"text":"We had family in town and decided to try this place.  It was delicious!!  The cheese bread (I think it has a different name) was so good.  The garlic knots were also good.  We also had a pizza and it was very tasty.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have a co-worker who may want to stick some sort of explosive device in my car after this review. She and I would frequent the Oggi's in Scottsdale because really, we do very much enjoy the buffalo chicken pizza. How can you not? It's spicy and yummy and chewy. Because of my enjoyment of the buffalo chicken pizza, I'm going with three when experience here was a solid two.   Came here with the family after my daughter's swim meet. Hanging out in 110 degree weather watching people in a pool in excruciating! It was close to the meet so we went for it. The BF and I wanted to share a few small things so we got a personal size meat topping pizza (the name totally forgotten after what happens next) and some buffalo chicken sliders. My daughter got the mac and cheese which I thought was \"meh\" but she's seven and it was mac and cheese. She loved it.   The pizza came and was pretty darn good. I found myself looking at the sliders like my yellow lab would look at me when I asked him a question. They were fried pieces for chicken. And not like good battered fried. I mean, like breaded fried. They looked super greasy. The worst part was that they tasted like nothing but grease and like the grease had been used for the last month. It was so awful I actually did something I never do. I sent them back. Got the burger sliders. Guess what they tasted like? Grease.   I may go back to the good beer that they have and for a pizza but do yourself a favor and don't stray from the pizza. Ever. Period."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Bar tender ignored us for 10 mins.  Took our order didn't say a word.  Need I say more."}
{"text":"No flavor and cardboard crust. The beer is awesome but for a place that slogans pizza as apart of their name doesn't matchup. Ordered their specialty pizza and honestly tastes like Digiorno pizza taken out 10min too early. Sorry but the pizza is no bueno but beer is great."}
{"text":"One of those really unmemorable experiences for me.  I forgot that I had came here 2 days ago!  I was trying to review something else when I saw this on the list. I had the quesadilla and a beer.  The beer was tasty, about the only positive thing I remembered.  I do remember thinking the place is just average.  Atmosphere was kinda blah; if ambiance was a food, this one would be bland.  Need some salt and pepper.  Service was good.  This was not my first time here. Everything seemed familiar to me, that I remembered I had visited years back, and had such a lackluster experience back then as well.  The only way I will be back is if in a couple more years I forgot that I had been here and once again attempt to try it out."}
{"text":"I ate here on Fathers' Day and again a week later for my Wife's birthday. Both times we had excellent service. The Oggis Special was so good, we ordered that pizza again. They actually have 3 IPAs on tap. I loved the Torrey Pines IPA."}
{"text":"This place is terrible when it comes to taking an order. The first time I called(for delivery) I asked for a guacamole burger, and the person I talked to was completely incompetent. I had to apparently repeat this over and over to Jose it was like talking to a brick wall. The guacamole burger is on the menu how hard is it to listen to me say \"guacamole burger\" then proceed to input it into a computer. Then when I revived the burger it was just a cheeseburger no gauc at all. I called and complained I just wanted the right order completed I don't care about getting free stuff I just want you to be intelligent enough to take someone's simple request and relay it to someone else, and the least you could do is check in the freaking box before you deliver it. The next time I called (about 20 mins ago) Jose answered again(I'm not sure if it's the same one). This time I was ordering for a group. while I asked for 4 things that are on your menu. he then sounded completely confused again. THESE ITEM ARE ON YOUR MENU by shear odds you should know at least one of them. I'm completely disappointed by OGGI's cause they have decent food, but this drove me so crazy I AM WRITING MY FIRST REVIEW."}
{"text":"Unmemorable: yes. Convenient, generally good food, catering, staff, and atmosphere: also yes. Very accommodating to students so at the end of the day I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The waiter actually told us not to order some items because they were terrible.  Pizza looked good but was undercooked.  Some old guy that works there has a really bad attitude.  Their TVs were old, so for watching the game this is not my first or second choice."}
{"text":"The food was really great, but the service was not so good. We waited around 20 minutes for the server to take our order after she took a drink order. She was very busy. It appeared that she was the only server, so we definitely were prepared to offer grace, but even after we were the only table left we still couldn't get her attention. She never brought drink refills, we had to ask multiple times for a to go box, and then there was a mistake with the check which she was not able to explain adequately. We may go back to offer a second chance because we did really like the food, so I hope we get better service next time!"}
{"text":"First time patron & probably last time too. Went to watch Sunday afternoon football & the place was busy but not packed which was nice. Ended up seating at the bar which provided great views of all the games; so far so good. But once self seated at the high top table in the bar area it took forever to get service which was surprising since it didn't seem that busy. It probably took the male server at least 15-minutes (felt longer though) to stop at the table.  So what felt like forever, finally able to place an order. I order one of their micro-brews; the dude replies that they were out \"till Tuesday\" (WTF it's football Sunday!), ok it is what it is, so I then ask for a Heineken,  the dude replies \"we don't carry Heineken\" ( again I'm thking WTF), third choice, which they had, was one of their labels; a heifenwiser.   The food was good;  nothing special but good- no complaints.  My only beef is with the service.  Totally lackadaisical & by no means customer - service oriented.    Ended using the bathroom twice & the overall condition was nasty. The urinal had a puddle of water under it, which I didn't realize was there until I was standing in it (gross), so I end up using the stall & that too was nasty. At this point,  I'm thking,  I just eat here, hope I don't get sick.   I have no plans on returning nor do I recommend it. There are loads of other joints in the area to watch the games, have lunch,  but more importantly;  receive way better service & a cleaner facility to take a leak."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on, slow service many of their own beers out of stock on a slow Sunday evening. Food was so slow I cancelled my entrée and left."}
{"text":"Great pizza awesome service over the phone delivery was slow pizza was only warm when it arrived  driver didn't offer me a receipt so I didn't offer him a tip."}
{"text":"I don't like to give negative reviews but my husband ordered chicken and it was undercooked...TWICE! Service was good and they apologized but raw chicken to me is a major mishap. Upon leaving we noticed sewage seeping up from the drain outside and notified them about this unsanitary issue. Unfortunately, our visit there consisted of a combination of bad events.   We have not returned here to eat and I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"It was all right. My boyfriend had a craving for fish and chips, but we were too lazy to drive anywhere. This place delivered, and it delivered fast; about half an hour. The fries were too salty, and the dinner came with three small pieces of fish. I would like to try a pizza off their menu sometime, since those sound good."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.   2 for 1 beers hit the spot.  This is a great place to come kick back with the guys.  Small enough to have good service, yet not too small you can't get a table.  Pizza is good, but not great.  It's a little  \"pre-made\" tasting to me, but is priced accordingly.  Nice outside patio and couple games for the kids make it pretty well rounded.   Beer is like the pizza; good but not great.   As I said, good for a group of guys, but wouldn't take a date or family here."}
{"text":"It's our Friday night spot. It is truly a neighborhood place.  We see many of the same faces.  Always welcoming.  Harry is the best. No matter how busy he is still happy to see you. Food is fresh Happy hour menu all day with great options!"}
{"text":"Oggi's is a dream if your a fan of a good brewery.  The Beer is fantastic and the food is better then your standard pub grub as well.  Their gourmet pizzas are top notch and show some creativity.  The grilled chicken with hot wing sauce, in place of your standard tomato sauce, was very good, and even better heated up the next day.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to relax, have a great beer, and good food."}
{"text":"I order the vegetable lasagna roll up. I was a little iffy about ordering a pasta dish at a bar but their menu sounded like they prided themselves in their Italian food. When the plate came out, it was a dish of cheese with one tiny, overcooked garlic knot on the side. I had to peel through all the cheese to find my vegetables and lasagna. My first bite was surprisingly good. However, I quickly realized my vegetables were raw. The menu said they would be grilled. These were washed, cut and thrown on the dish. And it wasn't even a good amount of vegetables. I found 1 zucchini slice, 2 yellow squash slices and some artichoke. Now to the garlic knot. I heard raves about these things, so I was excited to try it. I was disappointed that it was over cooked, but I figured I would look passed that if it was good. After first taste, I said \"Needs some garlic.\" This was just over cooked dough. It was so bland and disappointing. I'm glad it came with my dish and I didn't order a plate separately because I would have sent it back. My boyfriend got sliders and fries which he said were good. So all in all, this is just another hole in the wall bar that should probably just offer bar food and stop trying to be an italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place smelled really funky when I walked in.  Pizza is better than average.  If it didn't smell, it would get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in the West side. This stormy weather had us reminiscing on our Washington State days when we would get takeout Pizza Pizzazz, best pizza and rolls ever! Recently some of my classmates recommend this place to me and we decided to check it out. So glad we did. My only complaint is that they had carpet, so it absorbed a funky smell in there. Other than that the food was great!"}
{"text":"Really can't say enough about how awesome this place is. I've been coming here for 4+ years and it's because they are amazing. Harry the bartender is such a cool and genuine guy. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Nice Patio!! Hubby can even smoke a Cigar out here! The 1/2 Chopped Salad is great; We always get a 1/2 & split it & get pasta or pizza-- both are good!! Service is ALWAYS AMAZING!! Hooked on this place!! Today is National Beer Day, but no \"National Beer Day\" specials\".....no worries though, we'll be back for the Weekly specials!! Patio should have bigger TV's &, perhaps, misters for 5 stars"}
{"text":"First thing I looked for walking up was a NO FIREARMS ALLOWED sign. Nothing on the outside around the door. When a place sells beer and wine they can allow firearms. When they serve liquor they cannot. This place serves liquor, and no where do they have a no firearms sign posted. Not even next to the liquor license. I am pro second amendment. And I like to follow the law. So upon entry, I noticed their bar, asked if they do serve liquor and they said yes. So I left my firearm in the car. If you're going to call yourself a brewery, and you are gonna serve liquor, you should post no firearms. Even az state says it needs to be laminated and posted in a conspicuous spot near the liquor license. And any additional posting is up to management.  Anyways. Pizza was AWESOME! Beer is great."}
{"text":"We came here for game night with a meet up group that we are members of. It was the first time we had ever been here and there was a group of eight of us. I had checked out their website prior to going and signed up for their email list and had received a coupon for a free appetizer which was a bonus. As we were one of the first ones there our drink orders were taken promptly. They have a very good selection of beer as well as cocktails. After the rest of our group arrived the waiter came to take our order. We decided to use our free appetizer coupon on the Lettuce Wraps. I was so glad we did. I loved the flavor of them as well as the fact that you can build your own with the accompaniments. They are served with shredded carrots, a hot mustard, and a very flavorful sauce. The addition of the cashews mixed in with the chicken was a nice surprise and added a crunch that I loved. I ordered the Vegetarian Flatbread and to be honest it fell a little flat. The toppings were mostly centered in the middle which left the outer edges nothing but flatbread. In addition the balsamic drizzle that I had been looking so forward to was almost nonexistent. However I did like the fact that the vegetables were still crunchy and not overcooked. Hubby had the Pulled Pork Sliders and he enjoyed those very much. The pulled pork was very tender and the sauce was a little sweet with a slight tang to it. They had a dollop of slaw on each one that made it just the right amount of messy. It included french fries and they were hot and crispy. Our server did a really good job of taking care of us even though it seemed as if he had way too many tables to take care of. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For the price point of the beer and quality of food, this place is totally 4 star.  The beer was so cheap compared to what we are used to in the northwest valley.  I swear the Northwest valley restaurants serve beer with gold dust in it because they charge an arm and a leg for it.  Not this place though.  Great selection and great price.  We had a pizza too that was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Good food in a sports bar setting. Wait people are friendly and attentive. Prices are average and in a good location. Can get crowded during peak hours and nights"}
{"text":"First time ordering here and they deliver half of the food. So now I'm sitting here watching my wife eat and I'm starving. This was after them taking my credit card four times and then getting a manager to get it to go through. The driver gets here and ask for cash and said we have not paid and he had to collect before he gave over the order. He then calls the store while the food dies in the bag and is on hold forever. Once he gets on I can hear the same girl that took my card several times say she doesn't see one in there. Are you kidding me? I then ask to speak to his manager and he doesn't see it. I them explain the train wreck I experienced trying to pay over the phone the first time and he says he remembers and found it now. Unreal.. Then there was only one calzone. The driver says maybe it's sitting there and he will go get it and bring it back. He wanted to being back the old one that's sitting there possible close to an hour now. To wrap it up I call and ask to talk to the manager. I shared what happened and that I tipped ten bucks for a total of 55.00 and Ge says he can take the tip off. I said it's not the drivers fault and if any compensation is made it shouldn't be the driver. He says ok and apologizes and that's it. We will send another one... Bad experience, especially for the first time ordering here. Oh, and my wife said not to take it out on the chocolate brownie. It must be really good. When the kid brought back the food I have to say it was really good. Everyone was nice and I will try them one more time to see if this was just a fluke."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and usually enjoy the casual, family friendly atmosphere.  Tonight we had a bad experience so not sure we'll be back, at least not anytime soon.  They weren't too busy when we arrived, seemed a normal weeknight crowd.  When our food took forever we overheard our server tell the table next to us (when they inquired 'where's our food?') they were understaffed in the kitchen.  Our food was served almost an HOUR after we arrived with no explanation or apology.  The kids fries were barely warm, mac & cheese was like soup, hubby's fish tacos were ok and my spinach salad was ok as well.  I would expect the manager to be offering an apology, maybe even a complimentary bread appetizer to hold us over (especially the kids!), or at the very least the server should have offered an apology."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be !  Food and service dissapointing . Not much else to say but we have no desire to ever go back or order delivery again."}
{"text":"it's great as a family-friendly sports bar.  the food is VERY reasonably priced and good. The beers weren't superb, but definitely not bad, either.   our server was great -- there when we needed him and not there when we didn't. the manager was available and made a point of going to the tables, which sometimes i find awkward, but this one seemed very genuine and sincere.  it's definitely a place we'll return to -- especially during football season."}
{"text":"Good food and really good beer.  In fact, on certain days their own micro-brews are a dollar a pint.  That's right, one dollar a pint for liquid sunshine.  The pizza is ok, but the beer is why I go.  Try it for yourself, I'm pretty sure that you'll agree."}
{"text":"Good pizza but average... typical sports bar pizza. I give them props for 30% off at check in though. They have a good selection  of good beers.. ipa\"s. I would come back because  of the good beer and value. My rating would be 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is so polite and helpful. Difficult to find decent service, but the staff here have always done a great job!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this was some of the worst pizza I ever had.  So disappointing.  I ordered the Heavy Hitter and my girl got the Chop Salad... I think she would have had a better salad from a bag at Safeway or Fry's. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to not compare a brewery to Four Peaks since FP is the best of the best, at least in Arizona. The food here was good but nothing special - I had the chicken ciabatta with aioli and bacon. The aioli sauce was sort of like barbecue mixed with mayonnaise or ranch. The bacon was really good - very thick and probably apple wood. The ciabatta was soft but not toasted and just very... not good, not bad. I probably won't be coming back but it was nice to try something new."}
{"text":"My family and I come here 4-5 times a year and I this location is great and continues to improve. While I enjoy their house beers, they also maintain guest taps that I change with each visit and I often enjoy these craft beers better than the house beers.   This is a great place to watch a game as they have several televisions showing anything that is going at the time, and their pizza, calzones, and appetizers are all very good. Our favorite pizza is the grand slam and we almost always get a large so we have some to take home as it heats up well.  This location has good happy hour deals and their website always seems current. Their wait staff is attentive and helpful, though not all of them always seem to know the beer menu (though the last few visits it has been on the table with an iPad version available on our most recent visit).   I always enjoy lunch or dinner here. Depending on the crowd and what is on the televisions, it can be loud inside. When the weather is nice we like to sit on the patio for this reason."}
{"text":"Let me first say we were die hard Oggie's fans.  As such we have gone to Oggi's every Saturday night for the past 5 years as part of our weekend out.  We liked Oggi's for its service, prices and the taste of the food.  However, with a new Manager in place things have really gone down hill.  Happy hour prices are no longer happy.  I usually drink a 22 ounce mug and they would charge me the same price as a pint.  Last night, they raised the price to $6.29 while the pint remained at $4.40.  Also, our check has gone from $35 to $50 due to the increase in prices which in humble opinion is a bit much for Humus, two slices of pizza and a chicken sandwich.  We have $50 left on a gift card which after we use  we plan on eating elsewhere.    Note to Management:    if you read these reviews (and you really SHOULD) losing a customer like us demonstrates poor customer service."}
{"text":"This place is so close to home we eat here and do take out a lot! The food is so good I haven't yet found a dish that I didn't enjoy! They have a great beer selection! The service is always so good and they serve your food to you really fast! Theres even a small little game room to entertain our kids while they wait for their food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, all previous positive experiences at Oggies was canceled out on this visit.  We've come to expect good food and beers at reasonable prices in a fun environment. While the food (pizza) and beer were still tasty, the prices and service failed to meet standards.  The service issues stemmed from a couple large parties which were apparently not expected. I doubt this will be an ongoing problem.  The pricing policy however will be the reason I won't be returning for some time. A \"happy hour\" medium pizza and 4 house beers for $50 is unreasonable and not close to area prices. The policy of 25% off  pizza OR happy hour beer prices isn't made obvious nor is it competitive.  Sorry that I can't  recommend this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We really try to come here only when Harry is bar tending.   The other guy, Kelly, seems unhappy and isn't friendly at all.  He messed up our order.  Thirty minutes later, we get our food, yes he somewhat apologized, but offered no compensation whatsoever.   We used to come here a lot, but Kelly just makes us want to go elsewhere.   Kelly, if you're not happy, at least fake a smile and act descent towards your customers!  Harry, you rock!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this place. We came here for my mom for a late Mother's Day yesterday as she loved this place previously! It was pretty dead with only four other tables with people in the dining area. First of all it took forever for our food. We got there at about 6:15 and I don't think we got our food until 7. But then when the food came our order of wings were the wrong flavor and my flatbread never made it to the table. The waitress said she would have the right flavor made and left the wrong order at our table which was nice. After about another 15 minutes we finally found our waitress and asked about my missing flatbread and she advised they made the flatbread wrong and were remaking it. By the time it actually got to the table everyone else was done eating so I ate one piece and then bagged it up.   When she brought the bill she had not taken the wings or the flatbread off instead she gave us a $10 off discount which didn't even cover one of the full costs of the two items messed up.   I realize she didn't have to do the $10 off so we appreciate what she did do, but are just unsatisfied with the outcome all together. Especially since the food was only subpar. I wouldn't suggest going here unless you have at least two hours to waste and want to over pay for super salty, subpar food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was very empty. The dining room has lots of TV's on the walls so we were able to watch a couple of the March Madness games at the same time. The lunch specials are a pretty good deal. You get a soup or salad as well as a choice of meals for $6-9. The Baja 500 sandwich has a juicy chicken breast with a spicy sauce and was good. The battered thick-cut fries were just OK, a little too mushy inside but that didn't stop me from eating them. :)  The beer sampler is a lot of beer, they give you 8 samples, which are ~3-4 oz each, so that is essentially two pints of beer. The waiter also gave us an extra sample of the Stone IPA they had on tap at no extra charge. Most of their beers were good, I liked their stout, scottish ale, and IPA the best."}
{"text":"Food is terrible. I've been dragged here a few times and have yet to actually have anything I liked. Even the pizza, (how do you make a bad pizza?) sucks.   The ONLY reason to go here is for ridiculously good beer specials (241 or half off -i think - depending on the day) and lots and lots of TVs. I'm a pretty picky beer drinker and I found a beer I like. Good selection I think, all the way from super light to super dark."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour specials.  The bruschetta flatbread is great!  Love the gluten free options too.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went there on Groupon and it was well with it the food and beers were good but the service was awesome, we had a female waitress and I wish could remember name. But my son has ADHD and was having issues and she went out of here way to make him feel comfortable and happy so I am totally going back there with family. Fair prices for food and beers and good environment for family."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying I have been in the hospitality industry for going 36 years. I've done every job from dushwasher to head-bartender to exec chef. I've worked in huge chains, done openings all over the world. Tonight I witnessed the worst behavior of any manger I've encountered. I've worked with the best of the best to the worst of the worst. I had to inquire about her name and I was told her name was Stephanie. The things she said to our server were inexcusable and the way she treated her I swear if she were a man I would ask her to step outside. Her behavior was despicable at best and close to criminal. To top it off out in the dinning room? Really! To our server she knows who she is. If you ever decide to pursuit legal actions I know a great attorney!"}
{"text":"Recently met a friend here for a late lunch on a weekday.  When I rolled up I was bummed that the happy hour beer specials didn't start until 2PM (two for one).  I was pleased when we got the receipt that since our server didn't ring us up until 2:15, we got the special!  The server was also good at being non-intrusive while we were catching up prior to looking at the menu.  As for the food, it was fine.  They had some nice lunch specials categories from 'single' through 'home run', which were basically an entree plus a salad and soda.  I went with a 'double', which was a one topping personal pizza, caesar salad and bottomless soda for $7.99.  Not a bad deal at all.  The pizza was good (and there was enough for leftovers), while the salad was just ok.    I would definitely go back to Oggi's, especially for a happy hour.  I solidly rate them at a 3.5 and am going to round either up or down...think I'll go up, mainly because the service was solid.  (Plus, if you like sports, there are a ton of TV's in the place)."}
{"text":"Oggies is a good solid brewery and pizza restaurant. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. I've been here a few times and love the beer and the pizza is real good. Beer is reasonably priced but the food is a little expensive for what you get.  I've had the meat pizza and its good...but somewhere like Mellow Mushroom is better and cheaper... Plus the TVs are small and outdated. I live close to here and would love Oggies to be something more but its just about average for me. Well a lil above just because the beer is really good and they brew a lot if high percent brews. I'll still come here just based in location and beer."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly I didn't like the food the wings were ok but the pizza was horrible"}
{"text":"Nice place for a good beer and some decent food. Lots of TV's to watch while you eat."}
{"text":"We have been going to Oggi's for about 5 years now.  Their wings are the best in the NW Valley and they have a large selection of craft beer.  This has been our go to place for our family events as they can accommodate large parties and have a varied menu to satisfy everyone's taste."}
{"text":"What you need to know about This place is the beer is great one of the only places in the valley you can get lumberyard IPAs one of the best IPAs ever made food is good pizza is good atmosphere is mostly family unless you're there on a Friday night or Saturday night personally I love to go there and have lunch with my father Stephanie waitress/bartender is quite the personality if Stephanie can't make you laugh you just have no sense of humor absolute pleasure to be around my father and I always look forward to having lunch there because the beer is great and Stephanie is excellent if I say anymore The other waitress Dad and eyes second favorite not to mention names but her name is Carey it's hard to tell the difference if you're looking at them from the backside not that I look this is the place that I would recommend this is the place that I love this is the place that you should all enjoy"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  I live in the area and Oggi's is always on the pist of places to go for dinner.   They have great servers and every pizza I have gotten is very good!  They have their own brews and they are always at a great price and they hit the spot!  I definitely recommend Oggi's =] If it's going to be your first time there, get the garlic knots for an appetizer."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and happy hour pricing. Ordered a Hawaiian pizza it was pretty good. Service however was a bit slow."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza and beer spot. Great place to kick back thanks to their laid back atmosphere. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"How can one not like a brewery?  They ususally have good beer, fun atmosphere, and tasty bar grub.  I guess some are better than others with some places knowing how to please their patrons better.  Oggi's is located right in the middle of the Arrowhead Ranch area so location surely isn't an issue.  Right off the freeway and easy acess to the restaurant.  It's a brewery that serves its own brewed beer and pizza to a sports watching crowd as well as a family customer base.  The food I've had here has been less than stellar.  Pretty much mediocre in my opinion.  Helping to satisy your hunger craving, but that's about it.  The prices are on the cheap side so it shouldn't be a suprise that you aren't coming here for the food.  The beer is ok and I'm assuming the main reason why people come here.  That and all the TV's for that sports watching crowd.  Also don't expect to be super impressed with the beer.  It's good, but nowhere near the best you would expect from many other breweries.  This place could also use a little updating with its decor.  With a little modernization this brewery may actually be a fun little watering hole to come to.  Ok choice for the area, but definitely not a place to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"We've gone to this location for 10 years for Christmas Eve. Tonight was awful! Waitress took our order delivered our drinks then sat at a table visiting with someone. The cooks had to look for her to tell her our pizzas were ready. When she finally delivers our 3 pizzas they were totally cold of 3 pizzas and 7 people 5 slices were eaten. Told the manager he asked me what I wanted him to do. I told him to pay attention to his staff. What a dumb Shit!"}
{"text":"The selection here is vast! The place specializes in pizzas and beers; moreover, their selection branches out to sandwiches, calzones, burgers, flatbreads and much more.   So far I have tried a few of their beers and have liked each one. I also have had their pizza special which is delicious and decently priced. I recommend coming here to give it a try.   If you're into sports the location has TVs all around the the establishment showing a wide variety of sports.   Of all the times I have been here the service has been excellent as well."}
{"text":"We've been to Oggi's so many times but after a night like tonight we may question that decision to go back! We had to get our own water refills, ask for our own plates, got served our pizzas as two different times -seriously waited 10 minutes before they brought out the other pizza, and waited at least 15 minutes just to get a beer from the bar! Terrible service"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Beer is warm, the traditional calzone was disgusting, popcorn chicken for kids is spicy with pepper, tomatoes on salad were left with the core on. Just laziness and lack of caring. This could be a great neighborhood spot. It's more like people come here by default since there is nothing but crappy chain restaurants saturating Arrowhead.  Seriously, save your money."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has bad reviews. My buddy insisted it was good even though I didn't want to go based on the reviews. He talked us into going tonight, Friday. I have zero complaints! Our pizza was great, beers were above average, and service was definitely above par. We will be back!"}
{"text":"A great place to have a drink and just hang out. The pizza is not all that, flat out its bad. I may try something else if I go back. Tip to the ownership...do better on the food."}
{"text":"Family came ordered the regular thing We also ordered a pizza for the first time.  We did not like the way it tasted! The waitress went above and beyond to remove it from Bill showing us just tell customer service should be done! Not only do they have great service that is exceptional would recommend them to everyone!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Nothing to write home about. Service was ok. I might go back, but not something Ill develop a crave for."}
{"text":"Food was too greasy, lacked taste and flavor quality, service was great!  Patti melt was over cooked.  Loaded fries were a gross second to Chillis loaded Texas fries.  Cheesy bread and dips were good.   The old fashioned sundae was great!"}
{"text":"This maybe a little biased as I work here, but as a food aspect the food is great and love coming in with my family. As a work aspect, the people that I work with are great and it's truly like working with family."}
{"text":"Found them by Happen chance.  One of the most flavorful Pizzas Ive had. Will definitely return to explore more of the Menu."}
{"text":"Probably the worst bar food experience I've had in a long time. Service was horrible and the food was worse. Thanks for the 7 extra small boneless wings for $10 and thanks for the horrible recommendation on the Philly.   Never again. BTW, it was only 2 pm and the place was empty but I guess my money isn't as green as the guys at the bar drinking their life away.   You suck oggi's"}
{"text":"Oggi's on a Monday was a good choice because it wasn't too packed. Although basketball and football was on. The waitress was friendly. I wanted a burger and ordered the guacamole burger with sweet potato fries and I was disappointed, the food was flavorless. I heard they're known for their pizza, maybe I should have gotten that instead."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have awesome and delicious pizza, appetizers and drinks. Looking at it from the outside, I'd expected to large pizza restaurant, something that would a little crazy but it was the complete opposite. It was a nice size place and loved the vibe of it. You can relax, not have to deal with a big or loud crowd. The drinks are very tasty and I really like how they recommend which beer goes perfectly with which pizza. It makes it easier to order"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we had a very frustrating experience at this place. We had two hours for dinner anticipating spending an hour on dinner, but the service was so slow that our entire two hours were spent here. First of all, there was a sign on the door advertising help needed for cooks and servers; that should have been the first clue that service would be slow.  After waiting for 15 minutes, I went to the front of the restaurant to ask for drinks and menus. The lady was apologetic and told me someone would be by soon. Another five minutes later and a guy was by to take our order for drinks, which we received after ten minutes. Once we received our food, I was completely underwhelmed with the taste of my food, as was my husband. I felt like I was eating food I could cook with my very minimal cooking skills. My husband had to ask three times for a glass of water, which he got minutes before leaving.  Positives-the beer was tasty and the staff was friendly.  We will not be returning for a repeat performance. Ever."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken sandwiches , the jalapeño one and the club and they were both pretty good. I was not a fan of the fries. They were too crispy and had a bit too much seasoning on it."}
{"text":"Wow people you should really check the address and review the correct Oggi's. This place is worth coming to Friday and Saturdays tend to be a little busy especially in the bar. Appetizers are good they could have a little better selection but its a pizza/sports bar kinda place, the pizza is yummy especially the Boce' Ball its other worldly.  Happy hour is awesome 2 for 1 drafts with purchase of food and after 6pm then its dollar pints for some decent beer trust me I know beer. Total Wine...tried all the beer there.  Best beer there in my opinion is the Scottish Ale but thats only my opinion."}
{"text":"Everything I expected and more . Great menu and the dry rub wings are not on the menu but if you ask it's super delicious . The matador burger was super super yummy and spicy too . The hopily ever after is super ever after :). Fun place excellent service too :) atmosphere super casual and yet clean too gray plus"}
{"text":"Arrived to sit down with a good crowd & ambiance. Soon a stinky bar tender assisted with our order. His body oder was so offensive that it made me gag... We didn't want him to come near us. Couldn't even enjoy our meal. Came here on a Monday evening to watch a football game."}
{"text":"This place has gone really down hill :(  I was in last weekend after a hockey on a saturday at 9pm.  The ladies bathroom was gross.  The service was lacking in friendliness and timeliness-and all we had was beer and appetizers!  We used to love coming here, but will definitely think twice."}
{"text":"I'm from WI and found my new fav micro-brew spot! Beers are wonderful and prices are cheap. Try the Won Ton Nachos!!!"}
{"text":"For the price, the beers can't be beat. However, if you're hoping to watch a game be aware that good seating is limited. The TVs are dated and mounted in such a way that if you're sitting in a booth along the outer wall, you'll more than likely have to crane your neck to see. But I digress, still worth it for the low cost drink  factor!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 custom burgers from them (Angus with swiss, mushroom, and sauteed onions) and seasoned fries. The food took an hour and a half to get here the first time because of traffic, and was cold.   Why did I give it 5 stars? Because when I called to complain the general manager, Shane, remade the order himself and brought it back out in less than 30 minutes.  The food was amazing, but the fact that the manager specifically went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied really put this place over the top for me."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite nearby restaurants, but the front staff seems to have changed, and I guess the cooks have changed, too.  My wife's chicken was almost completely raw, and about 1/3 of my tilapia was uncooked.  We won't take a chance on anything but beer and pizza in the future.  Cooks really shouldn't be learning on the job."}
{"text":"Great food!  Did delivery on a Friday night, so took a little over the 60 minutes. Worth the wait!  Only snag, they forgot the lettuce wraps, found out after they closed."}
{"text":"Wow how wrong could a reccomendation have been to try this place.  I heard about good pizza and good wings so I decided to check it out.  I ordered the New Yorker pizza and the \"killer\" boneless wings.  First of all the total for that and soda was over $30 which is rediculous but if it was amazing ok fine I'll deal.  Well the pizza was very underwhelming and the toppings were just laid on not even cooked into the pizza.  The wings were far from killer hot barely even on the mild scale.  There was a huge lack of sauce.  Just overall I was not impressed and for sure will take my pizza and wing business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Dissappointed. i've necer had chicken cooked as hard as my pollo pizziola was today. it tasted pretty good but was very tough! others in our party were unhappy with the wings - too few per order, hot wasnt hot - calamari was not good. the only thing anyone was happy with was the burgers."}
{"text":"Went again last night and the service was even better then before. I'm not sure why I gave them only 3 stars last time. Oh wait, now I remember. It was mostly because of the small app portions. Well, we stayed away from the tiny apps this time, and now the place and the setup is starting to grow on me.  Happy hour food specials are there but limited and still not a GREAT bargain. Happy hour drinks are a much better deal. If you go, try the 8 beer sampler (see pic). It was lots of fun for $9 and the calzone was just enough to soak up all the alcohol. Double YUM! Wife had the boneless wings (buffalo sauce) and the loaded fries (covered in cheese, bacon bits and chives). Both were good but the fries were especially addicting. If you don't pay any attention to all the mismatched paint touch-up spots and dings in the walls, the place even starts to look a little upscale, or maybe the beer goggles were just a little foggy last night. You be the judge."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  I've never been to any of the other locations.  The pizza was decent, very cheesy and a soft, thicker crust.  The best part was the beer sampler.  I can't remember all the different kinds they had, but it was a good way to try them all.  The service was good too.  The building is a little bit too open for  brewery in my opinion.  It's like a Denny's.  The bar here is nothing special either.  It looks like they close around 9 or 10 at night so those coming here hoping for nightlift will be disappointed.  But if you want dinner and a beer or two, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Had the Wimbledon it was crispy and delicious will come back again and try the beer"}
{"text":"I have seen several good reviews so my wife and I decided to give Oggi's a try. Since pizza and Italian style food appeared to be their specialty, I ordered pizza. As I stated in my tip, the crust was hard and crunchy. My wife usually orders a salad and then eats the outer crust of my pizza. We've been married 20+ years and this is literally the first time she rejected my leftover crust because it was too hard and dry to eat. Their Scottish ale was very good and the insides of the pizza were decent as well although the heat that hardened the crust also desiccated some of the topmost ingredients. In all, we found it to be average, as sports bars go with below average food and above average beer. There are lots of sports bars around and more and more artisan breweries and brewpubs all the time. A sports bar/brewpub needs something to make it stand out and invite me back. Unfortunately, this place does not have that."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, kiddo friendly and had good service :)  Was easy and good for happy hour"}
{"text":"We sat outside with our two dogs on the dog-friendly patio. The server brought water for everyone right away, including the dogs. Happy hour food was generous and we saw a great sunset."}
{"text":"Beers are mediocre here.  They got rid of their best beer last year, the Bavarian style Hefe-Weizen and replaced it with a watered down American wheat.  Appetizers are above average and an exceptional value during happy hour.  Pizza is very average.  If you're a beer enthusiast then don't bother, but if you like fried appetizers, cheesy breadsticks (Oggi stix), then this place will work for you."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Very open concept seating, meaning wherever you're sitting, you have a full view of everything. Think of their dining area as a huge great room. Bar included, although sectioned off by some booths. Saturday night, very busy, long wait. I think it's because there just isn't much in that area unless you want to head south a couple blocks to the Arrowhead area. Just another average bar and grill."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to get great pizza, beer, and watch a game!  We stop by about once per week, and have always had great food and service! We've ordered the \"Heavyweight\" Pizza each time, and it's been great!  Loaded with meat, and cooked to perfection!  We will definately keep coming back!"}
{"text":"the food is great here they offer you 10$ off a pizza when you check in on yelp. the place was busy it was happy hour and the server was slow but we order a good portion of our food right away when he ask us what we wanted to drink the beer was not that great i order a hefenwezin their where no carbonation but the server did switch my beer  to a better one  then when i order again they brought me the same beer that had no carbonation. they server was asking if we need anything more to eat or drink as you could tell he wanted to clear the table but we just wanted to drink and stay a little longer .  for a Friday night it was busy but the food was good  the beer not so much   if you go during happy hour  on a Friday night  don't aspect fast serves"}
{"text":"Love this place. Our waitress was amazing with our large party. Their BBQ pizza is wonderful and their microbrews are great. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Busy restaurant.  I went on a Saturday night.  But not too busy that I had to wait for seating.  I like the booth seating.  Staff was cheery and came to our table often.  We ordered the Hawaiian and boneless wings.  Both were nothing to write home about.  The crust on the pizza was quite bland.  The wing sauce was good but not superior.  I ordered the Golden Blond beer.  Pretty tasty! I would definitely come back for the beer but the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I never have high expectations for sports bars, there isn't any reason to.  Walking in to Oggi's, I felt no different than I do walking in to any other similar establishment.  We came in and were seated in a half full restaurant.  The bar area was fairly busy as there was a game going on.  The food is really not good.  Everything is quite greasy, and not in a good way.  Trust me, I like greasy.  They were also out of multiple menu items and a couple beers.  Of course, they didn't inform us of that beforehand, so  when I ordered the dish I wanted, I was told no, then my husband ordered what he wanted and told no again!  JEEZ!  I guess they have never heard of prepping.  I finally settled on the fettucini alfredo, as it's a simple dish and hard to screw up.  Well, they did.  It's all very generic, and the pasta was overcooked and mushy.  Ugh.  Service was so-so.  I will not be back, simple as that.  I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
