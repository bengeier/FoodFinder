{"text":"great food, cold drinks, nice atmosphere.  Prices are very reasonable.  This place is a nice alternative and local.  Good seafood and steak choices and better priced than most other local establishments.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Recently a group of us gathered at this establishment on a Friday night which they have a band with no cover charge!!! Nice plus the band was excellent, I love fish and always seeking a place that says it's good and it really is... Yep it is... It is the best fish in the area, not cookie cutter but a real filet, great batter, fried perfectly, not over fried or cooked, great flavor and very flakey.  Everyone that ordered food said what they ordered was good.

The server was ok, kept forgetting to bring things, The fish was advertised comes with mac & cheese or fries which were good & said coleslaw,  didn't think about it until the end that I didn't get it.  When asked what happened to the coleslaw I was advised they were told not to bring it out unless asked to!  I understand not wasting but she should of asked if we wanted it.  

So in all the food gets a 10, the band gets a 10 and the service gets 5.... stop by & see what you think..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a mid-week dinner while exploring the area. On the way in I noticed the evening \"special\" was Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken which, at the time, seemed like the perfect selection. 

The restaurant/bar is obviously a favorite of local residents and Viola's is obviously tuned into those folks. After wandering around searching for a table (or someone to seat me) I ended up at a high top table near the pool room. The friendly waitress eventually visited my table (almost 5 minutes after I was seated) and I committed to the above mentioned evening special. A few minutes later I received what was surely the worst serving of \"Italian\" food in my life. The fettuccine was dry, virtually tasteless and stuck together in a mess the size of a baseball. The chicken was also dry but burnt as well.

Apparently the nice folks who visit Viola's are there for the beer, friendly service and to catch up with buddies as few were eating. I only wish I had
known that before ordering as my time and money would have been better spent eating something from the convenience store located next door."}
{"text":"Great remodeling from last time I was there.
Crab cake sandwich was thin and small. For the size of a MickyDees Hamburger there should have been 2 for the $10 fare. It was lost on the plate without the bun, however it would have been lost IN a bun too."}
{"text":"There are many things I would like to recommend about this place, but there is one big negative that outweighs the good things.
The water in the men's room will not go beyond a trickle.  I thought it might be just trouble in the line but it was the same on multiple visits weeks apart.
If I could tell for sure this was turned down to save money on the water/sewer bill, I would call the health department.

If there are ever any other patrons doing what I was, believe me, you want everyone to be able to wash their hands.

If they choose to fix that, I would give them a good review, but I will probably never go there again to find out."}
