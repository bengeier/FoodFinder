{"text":"I LOVE Roscoe's.  Fantastic Food, wonderful service.  The cornbread is delectable, the sauce is amazing, and I can't help ordering their homemade potato chips.  Deeeelish!"}
{"text":"Succulent authentic Texas pit BBQ with the right mix of smoke, spice, sweetness, and tender juicy BBQ for a down home meal.  Roscoe spent time working the farmer's markets in the valley before he found this old Road House on S Main in Phoenix.

The first time I went, was after a friend's birthday party which ended way too early, and we went to dance.  The band ended at 11:30 and Roscoe brought out plates stacked with ribs for the band.  The aroma juiced my sensory system to hightened awareness without overload.  I thought: \"I gotta come back and try this.\"

I've had the ribs, the gumbo, the ribs, the chicken, the ribs.... The menu also sports brisket, pulled pork, and catfish.  A meal comes with a choice of two sides: beans, coleslaw, potatoe salad, or corn bread.  Dinner for two, plus three drinks each set us back $34 the other night when we went to hear the Suspects play.  And when a band is playing on a Friday or Saturday, the music starts at 7 pm.  No more staying out late to hear a great gig.

The ribs almost slide off the bone.  Conversation ends as everyone sinks into a blissful oral experience before arousing themselves to exclaim the beauty of it all.  Someday I'll try the brisket, as I've watched people cut it with a fork, but hey, ribs is it for this guy.  Its better than meditation! but not sex!

Full bar, a good mix of tap beers including microbrews, and a basic house wine add up to a simple, pleasurable night out."}
{"text":"Fall off the bone ribs! So yummy! Very cute hidden gem in talent Or!  Our server with the curly bangs was soooo sweet! If your looking for good BBQ, go here"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Texas, I was pleasantly surprised. Fried okra was good, collards were excellent and BBQ sauce wasn't totally Texas style but pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Roscoe's is closed till further notice, perhaps permanently due to the owners illness."}
{"text":"It is hard to find good BBQ in the Rogue Valley, but this place has it.  Yum.  Also catch the great music on Fridays and Saturdays.  Last night was Karen Lovely.....what a voice!"}
{"text":"We visited Roscoe's, which has a down home kind of feel, for an early dinner, and ordered their BBQ ribs & chicken with sides of cole slaw, baked beans and corn bread.

The Ribs:  What there was of the meat, was cooked to perfection and fell right of the bone.  I'd wished their ribs were meatier, and the sauce had a bit too much vinegar for my taste.   I preferred the ribs I'd eaten in in Texas and Calif.

Cole Slaw: Okay... wished it had a bit more flavor

Baked Beans: Fine

I must say that our waitress/service was wonderful.   I'll most likely give them another try in the near future.

Update:4.23.10

I was craving ribs this afternoon and ended up at Roscoe's again.  I pretty much had the same experience.  The difference was that I'd met some really nice locals.  Great conversation can really add to a meal, and they told me that there's an excellent local singer by the name of Karen Lovely who performs rock/blues there on certain nights.  I just might just have to check her out.  ;-)   Darn, I wish I could give Roscoe's 3 and half stars."}
{"text":"Service was ok. I had the ribs & brisket. The ribs where good falling off the bone before they got to my mouth. The brisket was kinda tough but had a good flavor, they need to smoke it longer. But all n all we were satisfied & full, with some to take home."}
{"text":"Odd that on a busy Saturday night, with a Blues Jam to happen at 7pm that evening, that before 5pm they were already out of some beverages, desserts, liquors, etc.
We had 5 of us for dinner, and while the brisket was fine, the beans were cold (and obviously out of a can), the cornbread and potato salad were barely average.
My coffee drink was to have coffee, cream, godiva chocolate liquor, and shnappes. Instead I received something with marshmallows on top. HUH??
Plus, the table we were at did not have a reserve sign. Imagine our consternation when the waiter (one of 5 people working there that night) brought out bill (we were planning to stay for the music), said that our table was reserved, and no room for the 5 of us. 
As we left, we heard yodeling at a table near us, so makes me wonder what type of \"jam\" they really were going to do."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go if you're over 55, female and love to dance.

Dig the dive bar vibe. Lots of red dye in the old fashioned."}
{"text":"Best place in the Valley for BBQ. Have not found a better place, and most likely never will. You rock Roscoe!!"}
{"text":"Roscoe's is in an old converted house (barn?) and a rather dilapidated-looking building at that. It's not obvious where the entrance is but the place is small enough you'll eventually find your way to the side of the building to get in.

Once in, it's dark, dingy, and not exactly super-inviting. I mean, I get that it's also a dive bar, but can you at least turn on the lights during the day? Oddly, in spite of it being dark and all, the place was packed with seniors when we visited. Seriously. Walkers and all. It's like we were teleported into the cafeteria at the Manor or something. 

Soooo ... the BBQ was good, that much is for sure. But it took kind of an unexpectedly long time to get out. Fifteen minutes to get served BBQ and sides is a little weird. I mean, it's already cooked and all they had to do was plate it all -- it's not like the grills were going when we came in. 

And it was good BBQ. Not the best we've had, but good. Sauce could've been a little spicier and a little less sweet, but it worked. Pulled pork sammy was tasty, but like their compatriots at Tim's Backyard BBQ, they used garden-variety Costco rolls instead of good bread. Brisket plate was decent; tender, juicy, smoky flavor, but not a whole lot for $12. 

We were looking to do the sampler platter, which was quoted at $20 on their website. Sadly, it was $26 once we arrived. And that's pretty much the biggest problem with Roscoe's -- decent BBQ, just super expensive! They're already obviously way better than Roadhouse taste-wise. Just wish there was a little more value to it. It's not like you're coming here for the atmosphere -- I mean, this is Phoenix, Oregon -- so the food ought to be dang good to justify their pricing."}
{"text":"Great place for some inexpensive bbq. the venue is awesome and gives you a classic country bar feel. They've been having Ashland Blues Society gigs here the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of the month and that is TOTALLY worth it. These guys jam!"}
{"text":"Good food, though a bit on the expensive side for such a funky dark atmophere."}
{"text":"It was awesome food, fun atmosphere and going with three of our friends made it so much better. Dollar fifty draft pabst beer and eighty bucks in BBQ, we were sweating the good meat sweats when we were done. Totally worth it. Two could eat bad ass for thirty bucks."}
{"text":"Food was good....Chicken and Catfish...yummy...service needs work but I would go back for a second try."}
{"text":"My pulled pork sandwich, while not a culinary masterpiece was damn good. Music was fantastic. Townie people watching was stellar."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is great every time and the staff is wonderful. I also like the fact that the owner and cook comes out every once in a while to make sure everything is good."}
{"text":"If you're in the Ashland area, and you're craving some comfort food, then Roscoe's BBQ is it.  It's a little out of the way, but the Ribs are the Thing here, and definitely worth the short drive North from Ashland.

The ribs are definitely cooked properly with top-notch tenderness and flavor.  I got the 5-rib meal and it was a pretty hefty load with appetizers and sides on top.

They give a nice choice of sides as well (mac salad is a recommend, the slaw not so much).

We also got the fried okra, which if you've lived in the South and get the craving, well, they do that right proper too.

We'd go back again."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ ooozing with great atmosphere. Visting from the Bay Area and wanted to hear some live music...after a bit of a seach found this place and WHAT A FIND.

Great BBQ (I had the sampler platter), wonderful music (Karen Lovely) and good service (given how packed the place was).

the Food reivew:
BBQ pork ribs: fall of the bone DEEEELCIOUS! nice tangy sauce, just the right mix of sweet n' sour... sooo good. 
Hot Links Sausage: nice crisp skin, cooked perfectly
BBQ Chicken: Excellent-- would have wanted more but how much can 1 man eat?
Brisket: good not terrific. would have liked it just a bit more moist but it was definitely good... the leftovers made for amazing brisket sandwiches the next day...mmm mm good
Cole Slaw: zesty and wonderful... great with the Q...
Corn Bread: good but not the best...a little too soft and crumbly but still quite respectable
BBQ beans: standard issue but very tasty too

Come to Roscoe's... you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. If you're lucky enough to have Karen Lovely singing you will be in for a double treat!"}
{"text":"Great food, stingy portions for the money, and lousy service. Too expensive for the bar / rickety-table atmosphere and tattooed waitstaff. Either lower the prices (and expectations for a dining experience) or give fairer/larger portions like you see on TLC's \"Best Food Ever\" ( if they can afford it, busy Roscoe's can), and educate the waitstaff on courtesy and a \"the customer is always right\" attitude (considering the $12 brisket plate I had contained 5 small slices of beef most likely costing $1 !! ). Won't go back again, and can't recommend it, as it's a ripoff considering the low value. A huge shame considering how great the BBQ sauce is! Get your act together, Roscoe. Complacency and greed seem to be your Hallmark traits, hidden in BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I went with my Texan girlfriend who was very  dubious at first but was instantly won-over by the Sampler Platter. Best sweet potato fries in southern Oregon fo sho. Service was sweet and nice. Their BBQ sauce is out of this world and they are not stingy with it!"}
{"text":"Roscoe's is a staple for the Rogue Valley.  I hate to say this, but their prices are very competitive (don't raise them on us!)  This is a regular stop for us.  Terrie and the staff are quick, friendly and the meat is \"fall off the bone\" good.  While a Celtics fan, Roscoe is still a great guy, quick with a joke and can often be found working behind the scenes to produce the succulent (seemingly) fat-free delights!"}
{"text":"We went here on Friday night: the food was awesome and the band was phenomenal. What a great atmosphere they have created! The ribs were the best I've ever had. We'll definitely be visiting Roscoe's more often."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Oregon and run by nice people!"}
{"text":"Good and inexpensive pulled pork sandwhiches. I'd eat here again. :)"}
