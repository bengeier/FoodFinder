{"text":"Eat n park is similar to an IHOP but in my opinion better. The bananas fosters French toast is so good. The breakfast buffet is good, usually slow to refill but the food is good. The price is reasonable, especially since kids eat free at the breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"Always enjoy going to Eat 'n Park. Love the chicken soup. Truly missed it when I lived out of state for a while. This location is friendly, clean and prompt."}
{"text":"I went to this Eat'n Park location at 9 am on a Saturday and was extremely disappointed. We were seated at a table, and waited about 15 minutes before someone took our order (apparently our waitress hadn't shown up to work yet).  I had a hair in my food,  when I asked to have some cheese added to my scrambled eggs, I received two slices of American cheese melted on top of the eggs.  My friend had silverware with old food still attached, and something was found in his coffee mug."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a number of Eat n' Parks throughout the city - what 26 year old hasn't? - and these folks are really hit or miss.  I feel the food quality is a lot lower than Eat n' Parks closer to the city center.  Service can be great, or awful.  Ultimately, I prefer the Denny's that's close by.  Alas, my friends don't feel the same.  If you're going to go, hit up the breakfast menu.  Lunch / dinner is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I have to admit this was my first visit to a Eat 'n Park. In travels through PA we've driven by them hundreds of times, but had no desire to stop. Meanwhile, after a Sunday Night Football Steelers game nothing (other than fast food) was open at midnight, forcing us here.   We expected a similar experience to Denny's, Bob Evans or IHOP and weren't far off. While the quality is slightly better here it's nearly at par with the others. On the other hand, after midnight it's a fair choice and if you're driving north from WV it's much better than the Waffle House or Omelet Shoppe.   We tried an array of items. Trying to warm up after the football game I started with hot chocolate. It came in a huge cup, but was extremely watered down. The side salad disappointed with poor quality iceberg lettuce.   Our entrees were average, too. The hot turkey sandwich comes smothered in brown gravy (obviously canned) and has a small amount of turkey on it, but it's decent. The turkey club is average, too. Next time (if) we return we'd definitely order breakfast. Those options looked better as we saw them dropped off at other tables.   On a positive note, even though there was only one young girl working she did a great job managing all the tables and catering to customers. The service was far better than we expected. Also, the late night menu comes with $2 pie (we tried the pumpkin) which is a steal. Comes expecting slightly below average food (for good value) and you'll leave content."}
{"text":"This is close to my home and everyone can find something they like on the menu. My favorite things to eat here are Stuffed Green Pepper soup (which u can only get on Monday) chicken noodle soup and the sticky buns. (THEY RULE)"}
{"text":"Idk what can i say?? Did i have high hopes?? Yes.. should i have just gone to sheets?? MAJOR YES. Something about this place just makes my stomach turn the philly cheesesteak looks like burnt possum tails, the milkshake tasted like cholocate laxatives that have been frozen and whipped into a drink.. idk this place reminds me too much of the movie waiting My stomach hurts g2g"}
{"text":"I did not care for this place at all. It was so loud, seemed grubby and the service was not good. My husbands salad plate remained on the table until the end of the meal. Along with fifty other disgusting dishes they didn't clear either.  The food was pretty good which is the only reason I went with a three. I also thought the kids menu was pretty extensive and the kids loved the cookie they included."}
{"text":"Overall, a happy and surprisingly good dining experience! The salad bar was very fresh with nice,  tripe fruits and fresh lettuce,  spinach,  and salad topping. They have a great selection of fresh baked pies,  muffins, and these really yummy honey pinwheel rolls. The prices are good ($7.99 or $8.99 for the salad bar). The staff is friendly and helpful...AND, there are the cutest little things in the shop.  All smiles! Two thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has went down, but the prices went up. Three or four times now when I sat down to eat, I've had awful experiences. I used to love their food, but now it's just gross. Sometimes cutting costs isn't the answer."}
{"text":"Great experience with a party of 27. Thanks Courtney!!! Food is good and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Eat n Park is a staple for anyone who grew up in North Huntington.  The food is typical diner food, but still good. The special pecan waffles were delicious, and the service has always been good. It is a good place to go for breakfast or an easy meal out."}
{"text":"This is your standard Eat 'n Park.  For those not from the Pittsburgh area, it is basically a local American style eatery.  They try to source local products and also have a bakery in the store.  The quality of the food it okay and cheap.  They now also have pretty decent coffeehouse style coffee."}
{"text":"I love supporting locally operated restaurants and businesses as often as possible.  For this reason,  I find myself at one of the many Pittsburgh area Eat' N Parks at least twice a month.   Whether I choose to visit for breakfast, lunch or dinner I always seem to find something satisfying to eat.  I  enjoy their famous soup and salad bar and I am usually pleased with the selection and freshness of everything on it.    Their employees are dedicated and hard working. Both our waitress and hostess were  very friendly and provided great service this evening."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant when we're looking for an average dinner date. They consistently have great food. We usually get the turkey club and the buffalo chicken wrap as our meal. Other times, when we go out to eat for a late night snack, we buy multiple appetizers which are usually the cheese sticks and fried zucchini. All there food is consistently good. I love the staff here, and personally know a good bit of them because we eat their enough. This is a simple American restaurant. With that in mind, there food is also reasonably priced, and the dining area is usually clean. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I rarely find myself at this ENP because it always seems so busy. In fact, the whole plaza with Target and Giant Eagle is out of control crowded most of the time. However, the other day, my husband and I were out running errands and were both in the mood for breakfast. We agreed that if it didn't look too busy, we'd stop here. Glad we did!  We were seated immediately upon arrival and were greeted a minute or so later by our waitress. The H noticed that there was a 'Breakfast Smile\" special from 5am - 11am, which consisted of 2 eggs, your choice of 3 strips of bacon, sausage, or turkey sausage, your choice of a fruit cup, hash browns, or home fries, and your choice of bread. I opted for scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, fruit, and an english muffin. He got dippy eggs (sunny side up, for those not familiar with the term), turkey sausage, home fries, and wheat toast. Meals were $4.99 each. I was happy with mine, but actually could have eaten a little more. The fruit, which was melon, cantaloupe, bananas, and pineapple, was surprisingly fresh. My husband liked his also. But, again, could have probably eaten a complete second meal.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but not annoying or overbearing. My husband had coffee and I had an iced tea, both of which she was prompt to refill. With tax, our bill was around $15.   Cons: Parking lot is crap. It doesn't look like a traditional parking lot, as it is a single row that wraps around the building. However, there is ample parking close by, since - as I mentioned already - it is in the same plaza as Giant Eagle, Target, a dollar store, a gym, Bob Evans, etc.  On a side note, it's been a while since I've had one but their pies are delicious, especially their banana cream, which is my favorite.   Another side note: About 14 or 15 years ago - when I was about 22, a friend and I stopped in for 'breakfast' after a concert at like 3am. Our waitress was pretty nonexistent. So, when we went to leave, we simply left the money on the table, with a small tip. As we walked by the counter, we told another employee that we haven't seen our waitress, money is on the table. She said okay. A minute later, when we out by the truck, a manager comes running out saying we did't pay. We explained the situation and offered to go back in with her. Lo and behold, the money was there on the table, next to the check! I guess we were two still-half-drunk girls at a restaurant at 3 in the morning. But thieves, we are not. She apologized profusely. Too bad it wasn't busier, I would have loved it if there were a bunch of customer around and I could have embarrassed the crap out of that woman. I didn't go back for years after because I was so angry. Should have stolen a banana cream pie!"}
{"text":"I've never been to an eat n park until today. I always worried it'd be similar to a Golden Corral or a Ryan's. But I was mistaken...  Because I love love love Hello Bistro which is owned by eat n park, when my co worker suggested we eat here, i decided to give it a chance.   The servers were friendly and working very hard to meet the demands of the lunch rush. I got the burger, forgot what it's called, but it's similar to what old Big Macs used to be like. I was in love. This burger was so good! Not just that, eat n park turns out to be a very affordable dining option. I had the all you can eat soup and salad with my burger and it came out to less than $10. Wow. I'm a big fan now.   Minus one star due to the messiness of the floors and salad bar."}
{"text":"We moved into town from Chicago ten years ago, and this was the first restaurant in the Norwin area that we tried. We've been regulars ever since. The servers are amazing (they know what you need way before you do), the food is quality, dependable and FRESH. Very kid-friendly: they offer free baby food (bananas), a great kids' menu, and a Smiley cookie (if approved by the parents) after every kids' meal. It's the place in town where you always bump into so someone you know (or several someones!) and where you can always get a great meal at a good price at any hour. Their salad bar and breakfast bar are amazing, too!"}
{"text":"This is my local Eat n Park, and I have always enjoyed coming here with friends after the game on Friday nights when I was in high school.  They have decent food for decent prices.  However, I was very sad to find out that this location no longer has the Midnight buffets.  That was the best feature of Eat n Park, and I cant believe it is no longer there.  That's why this Eat n Park was knocked down to a 3 star rating.  GET THAT MIDNIGHT BUFFET BACK!!"}
{"text":"Went during the Sunday brunch. Server was oddly hot and cold. She was very short with us at the beginning but then she started to butt into our discussions out of no where as if she has a seat at the table. Odd. I was disappointed that the restrooms have no seat covers. The water from the sinks shoot out, soaking my jeans. Lol! It looked like I wet myself. I did like the salad I had, the Greek Chicken salad. The size of this restaurant is nice and large so we had a minimal wait."}
