{"text":"Update: I went in again and got a free taco because the person somehow recognized me and felt bad about giving me an American style vs Mexican style taco last time. I'm not sure how she remembered but it felt great to receive such good customer service. The steak was on point and the campechano (steak/chorizo) was incredible again. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today and oh my god, so good! I'm super picky about my steak tacos and the ones here are to die for. I could be happier and easily the best ones I've had to date. Would recommend this place everytime"}
{"text":"Mo's Burritos has hands down the best steak tacos in Champaign-Urbana. They actually might be the best steak tacos I've ever had in my life. Their elotes are also very delicious. Whenever I am craving Mexican food, I always ask myself, \"do I want some decent Mexican food at a dine-in restaurant or do I want the best Mexican food in town at a run down little food truck?\" I always follow up that question with another question - \"why did I even ask that first question?\" Mo's burritos or mas amigos or whatever name it holds, their food is simply the best."}
