{"text":"Whoa! I cannot believe that Bona only has one, low ranking review.  It is unquestionably the BEST delivery option in the east-end and quite possibly the best pizza in the city. The crust is doughy and thick, toppings are generous and you can decide if you want them above or below the thick, oozy cheese.  They also have about a zillion gourmet toppings, including my personal fave: sauteed portobellos, asparagus, roasted garlic and brie --that's right, brie pizza.    East-enders, pick up the phone and order your gastr-orgasm now!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place regularly so I thought that since we have friends in town from Ottawa, we'd give it a try. One of our visitors has food allergies so we called to asked them what was in the sauce. Wow, we were met with total rudeness and a belligerent attitude! Shocking. The guy said: \"Tomatoes...whatya think?\" When we asked about specific ingredients he laughed and said he didn't know.  I drove by the next day to talk to the manager but they were closed. These were simple food allergies we were asking about. I don't know how a place like this stays in business!"}
{"text":"If I could sum up this review with two expressions, they would me \"Meh\" and \"I wasn't that impressed.\"  I ordered from here as a fall-back option because Danforth Pizza House was closed and I didn't want a cheap $5 takeout from a chain.  I went with the deluxe, which was nothing special. The dough was OK and there weren't enough toppings. The whole thing was sort of bland.  Plus, I think they stiffed me on the free salad. But that's OK, because if it is anything like the pizza I wouldn't have good things to say about it either.  The experience really sums up the east end pizza scene - it's lacking something. There are a few of options in this area, but not enough good ones. Most of them are stale chain/fast food pizza joints.  It's so frustrating, especially when the only new pizza places that are opening are all Neapolitan-style because of the craze created by Queen Margherita and Pizzeria Libretto.  /end rant"}
{"text":"SOOOOO EXPENSIVE! They threw in a free salad but the lettuce wasn't washed and was dirty and gritty. GROSS. The driver seemed very angry because there was no apartment number on the bill (not our fault) and walked away cursing and muttering under his breath. Overall, pizza is a solid 6 out of 10. We were charged 3.50 for swapping 1 item of the same value on each pizza and was never given a heads up. Cost 65$ with tip for two larges with 3 toppings. Good crust but SUPER cheap on the toppings and cheese. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"I think I order Bona pizza at least three times a month. sigh.................it is so damn good! The crust is fluffy. The sauce is perfect. So many toppings to choose from. My fave is the Margarita. Would have to be one of the best pizzas I have eaten.  The sandwiches are fantastic as well. So saucy, finger-licking yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"An OK choice for delivery pizza if you live in the beaches, riverdale or danforth. Generous on toppings and whole wheat dough available."}
{"text":"Generous toppings, funny staff, and delicious pizza.  The pricing isn't bad at all either. I'm glad I found it!"}
{"text":"Free hat! (Not really, but free salad). *3.5 stars.  Like Laz C before me, I can't believe that Bona has so few reviews, especially with all the East Yorkers around here. I'll also second that it's the best delivery place in the east.  Though I'll admit that Bona is not my #1 (that would be Gerrard Pizza & Spaghetti House), it's my #2 pizza spot in the east-end. All the pizzas are great and the menu is massive: http://www.urbanspoon.com/u/menu/130602  It ain't cheap, but it's delish and definitely worth a try. In fact, try yourself a Hawaiian with hot peppers and you'll be amazed. It's even Tony Bourdain approved."}
{"text":"This place is yum.  Straight up old school mom n pop pizza joint.  Gooey cheese good toppings, really nice dough.  I'm beyond tired of the new wave of wood burning oven pizza joints that rave about their Napolitana authenticity.  I love wood burning pizzas as much as the next guy but the ones around here are nothing special and do not compare to Italian or even Paris pizza joints.    This place just makes a tasty pie, good price no snobbery.  Get it!"}
{"text":"Had their pizza once and I recall it was okay really not that great. Called tonight to give it another shot but they refused to deliver because my pizza didn't cost over $14.00 before tax and were not very friendly about it. Happy to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the second time I ordered from Bona and I am not impressed!  I normally order from Danforth Pizza house but I wanted delivery only.   Its ok but not the best in town!"}
{"text":"Assholes: brought me a squashed pizza and didn't offer me a refund."}
