{"text":"The pizza cold not be any better.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!  The pizza buffet is amazing.  They will make anything special you want.  Just ask and they will make it.  The pizza buffet comes with a salad bar too.  The ranch dressing is the BEST!  Hands down the best dressing I have ever had.  AND ask for their cheeseburger pizza.  Made with mustard AND a pickle on each slice.  The Stromboli is really good too.  AND just like any place worth its weight in Gaston County they have sundrop and cheerwine on the fountain.  The owners and workers are super nice too!  A great family place."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by after a long day of travel and wow I was really surprised. I'm a huge fan of New York style pizza so this was right up my alley the crust is a little less tough than the standard NYC style pizza but still retained that nice flavor. This joint is definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"We went mid-afternoon so the buffet was not available. We ordered the pasta with meat sauce and a stromboli.  We felt cheated when we left. The meat sauce had almost no meat in it. The stromboli was the thinnest and skimpiest I had ever had. We wont be back. For what we spent we could have had lunch at a nicer place."}
{"text":"This place got a face lift and an upgrade in management. Solid product now. Priced right and the owners seem to care."}
{"text":"The buffet will fill your kids inexpensively. That is my only positive thing to say."}
{"text":"This place has closed and Village Pizza has re-opened in its spot. Which is funny cause Village Pizza sucked the 1st time it was there..."}
{"text":"I think it has a great price for the buffet and the pizza taste great! Yeah, it is not an updated nice place for a date but I don't go there to impress anyone. Sometimes you can't judge a book by it's cover and I go where there is good food. I hate going to some nice looking place or a box chain restaurant and then get served tastless food or over salted food that might have been frozen or processed. I'm not a fan of most jukeboxes because they never have the music I like but this one did and I was very happy to hear some Led Zeppelin, Skynard, Ozzy, and Metallica. My 4 year old daughter and wife like coming too and the staff is always very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Very solid pizza joint. My husband and I stopped in while road tripping today and were pleasantly surprised! Tasty, hot pizza, and a salad bar with just the right amount of choices, but the best thing there was the spaghetti sauce. KILLER TASTY! You NEED to try it. Drinks are included and very clean bathrooms, too. Plus everyone that works there are so nice! All for under 10 bucks. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Overpriced!!!!! 17 dollars for essentially a Dominos thin crust minus the flavor. Seriously laughable. Virtually no sauce, minute ingredients on an everything pizza??? I feel cheated!! Place looked nice but a facelift doesn't necessarily change the soul of a person or place.  Don't bother going..."}
{"text":"This little pizza place is AWESOME!!!  I took 3 very picky teenage boys in to grab a bite and left carrying a pizza home for later!  They ate everything offered on the buffet bar and even had a special one made.  The price is great and the people working there are very nice.  Ask for Mike he'll make sure your meal is perfect!  I had a Stromboli and a salad from the salad bar.  It was just like I like it.  Hopefully the boys will share with me the pizza they made get them to take home!  This Pizza Place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"This restaurant opened in the same spot as Village Pizza, which had closed several months ago.  I was hoping that they would have gotten rid of the bad pizza taste when they cleaned and redid the interior.  I think this new tenant has what it takes to stick around.  It's basically a mom and pop version of CiCi's.  I was greeted by a friendly face at the counter where I had an option to purchase the buffet or a la carte.  I had come for the buffet, so the buffet it was.  The lunch buffet was $5.49.  I grabbed my beverage cup and found a table.  The buffet featured salad, pizza, and two types of pasta..  I can only speak to the pizza here because I ignored the salad and pasta.  I can tell you that the salad bar appeared to be your average salad bar featuring romaine, and the pasta served was penne and spaghetti.    The pizza was decent.  Nothing outstanding, but I wasn't paying for outstanding.  There were several different varieties of pizza available and the staff even took requests.  I asked if they had a buffalo chicken pizza, and they said Sure!  Ten minutes later, the pizza was out.  The staff calls out the pizza-type as they're put on the bar.  That is extremely helpful in getting the pizza you want.  It's styrofoam plates and cups, so nothing fancy.  But the pizza is decent and the service is outstanding.  I'll be back!"}
