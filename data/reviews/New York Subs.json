{"text":"Despite how this place looks, it's a great place to eat. An ex-taco bell building serving up tex mex, subs, and gyros, run by Asians. I've only ever had their subs so I can't comment on anything else but I had to review given the only other review is a 1-star rating based on a menu change.. Some folks don't realize what the purpose of reviews are."}
{"text":"I always buy from this place and I like the Cajun cheesesteak and it's delicious. I usually order a meal so I can enjoy the fries. Also I always tell him to saut√© the sweet peppers before adding them to the sub."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in Pittsburgh. Yeah I said that right. The beef teriyaki sub special is one of the best steak subs that I have had ever. Keep in mind I am used to real Philly cheese steaks. Get it, its worth the trip!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to eat, until they got rid of the best thing on their menu, the steak tacos.  These were literally the best steak tacos I've ever had.  No idea why they got rid of them.  That move will probably ultimately put them out of business.  I know I'll never go back."}
