{"text":"After eating Aroma two nights ago I simply can't award this place more than 3 stars. In short, the food was just missing something. Perhaps it was yogurt, maybe it was real mint chutney. The food took a while which means it is nice and fresh. The samosas came out and were just drenched in oil and I couldn't make myself eat them. The butter chicken was pretty tasty but not the best. It is for sure worth it to upgrade to the bowl for an extra $2. The mango lassi was a little sour so that's an indicator they used fresh mango and yogurt, but maybe a little extra sugar would have come in handy! The owner is very charming and happy to give recommendations. A small charming place for lunch."}
{"text":"Worst Indian restaurant I have ever been to.  The butter chicken was red (red!) and the chicken was rubbery.  The fried chicken was okay but nothing special - there's a much better chicken place two doors down.  Potatoes were so spicy and salty that none of us could eat it.  First time trying this place and will never be back.  There's another Indian restaurant is three times further to walk for me (called Maurya) but if it meant I didn't have to eat here, I am totally for freezing on the walk for the other place.  The front counter was a table with a cloth over it, all the signs and placards were poorly done which I wouldn't mind if the food was actually edible.  I requested no spiciness for two of the orders and specified it was for a child.  After paying, I double-check with the guy and he says there was nothing he could do and the food was already marinated.  I said that it cannot be spicy under any circumstances and he continued to interrogate me about the child that would be eating it.  I wanted a refund but he refused and kept saying it would be fine. I just didn't want to argue anymore and left.  Worst place ever."}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken combo, there is some truth to most of the reviews for this place. They definitely do give a huge portion for what you pay, however the quality in food is not there. The butter chicken is definitely not butter chicken, and the chicken isn't even chicken in the butter chicken. I'd only recommend this place if you're tight on money and want lunch and dinner for cheap. You can take a look at my photos to see the \"chicken\", it was very chewy and fibery, doesn't taste like chicken at all. However the potatoes were mediocre in flavor, that's a plus."}
{"text":"That was really yummy! I was hesitant since it's new and unproven, but I was impressed.

I got the Butter Chicken Bowl.... it was quite large and plentiful, and every part of it was delicious. They didn't skimp on the amount of chicken, and it was nicely juicy. The sauce it was in was full of flavour, and everything else (chickpeas, rice, salad/coleslaw, potatoes, etc) were all quite tasty.

I have a big appetite and this was a good quantity for me. I've read many reviews (of other restaurants) where people call a dish \"filling\" and I come away feeling unsatisfied. I like feeling \"full\" and thankfully the Butter Chicken Bowl at 6ixTriangles fit the bill!

The rice was sweeter than expected, but it wasn't a bad thing -- I enjoyed it! The entire meal was a winner, and none of the components were disappointing.

I got it via Ritual for $10 as a first-timer thing. It is regular $13.95 which is a little on the steep side, but it's Liberty Village. Either way, it was ready when they said it would be, the gentleman there was very friendly, and the temperature was perfect. 

One thing to note is their two spice options are \"regular (spicy)\" and \"hot\".... so there's no mild. However, I found the regular/spicy to be perfect... I wasn't on fire like some other Indian places, and the rice helped.

I will go back, but I'm not prepared to spend $16 after tax very often... so this will be more of an occasional thing."}
{"text":"Found this place off Ritual . Ordered myself a Palak paneer it. Great prices for Liberty village . Portion size was very generous; tasty but it was so big  I couldn't finish it. 

For my personal preference , I'd prefer the rice to be more fluffy, but that's because I'm Asian and this is basmati :). This paneer definitely hit the spot. Will be coming back here regularly to get my fix ."}
