{"text":"Amazing Montreal style smoke meat sandwiches.  Like the other reviews mention, the owner truly cares about this establishment.  My parents frequent this place to satisfy their smoke meat cravings and they always have nice things to say about their meals.  The deep-fried banana was also a nice treat."}
{"text":"Love this place. 

I go frequently, food is always good.

Greek salad is the best, ever.

Their corned beef sandwiches are legendary."}
{"text":"Awesome all around. This is exactly as he name states, a deli. Great deli style food, smoked meat is awesome, smoked meat burger is awesome,  souvlaki is awesome, etc. It can get a tad busy sometimes but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Montreal smoked meat sandwich this side of town. Price and quality is always fair and fresh. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's got an appetite in the afternoon, their breakfast is amazing as well if you want something on the go. My father put me on to this place and I know a lot of coworkers that go there too so it's a majority vote this is a spot you want to be at. The close shortly after lunch so don't wait too long."}
{"text":"Great food, great value, great selection. If you order ahead for pickup like most people, it's awesome. But if you come as a group for lunch, expect a 30+ min prep time. Closes at 4 but you can call after for pickup orders."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  I was not impressed, place was not that busy but still took them 40 mins to make a smokemeat sandwich.   

For those of you who have had smokemeat sandwiches from Schwartz in Montreal, you will be disappointed, this is nothing remotely close to it.

The the smoked meat here is similar to what you can get at the Deli counter of your local supermarket.  Only saving grace is that they pile on the meat here. But for a $12 smokemeat sandwich combo, I can make the same thing at home for less.

As an ex-Montrealer I expect alot when restaurants claim they have Montreal style smokemeat, my search continues for a taste of home, will have to try Caplanski's downtown next."}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is based solely on the food, NOT actual venue or service as it was ordered ahead of time and picked up by a co-worker. However, the lady on the phone was very pleasant and patient with me as it was my first time ordering.

I had the Reuben with fries & coleslaw just a half an hour ago. My mouth is still watering from the amazing flavour of EVERYTHING! It's an absolute must to get it with the fries and coleslaw as they compliment the sandwich very well.

They filled the takeout box (with a small container on the side for coleslaw) and I could only actually finish half of it as I'm at that point where I'm the perfect amount of full :P 

The sandwich was toasted/grilled perfectly, cheese was melted on top of the meat and the warm sauerkraut brought it all together.....ahhhhh, delicious!

I will definitely be ordering from here again. I just hope they update their website soon as it does not fully display their menu :( You have to go there and pick one up or order off the menu board on the wall.

That is all...ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place, a caring owner has really ensured that the Smoke meat is exactly right... Straight from the source! The smoke meat sandwiches rocked, exactly what I remembered when living in MTL.

We had the black cherry cola and malt vinegar on the fries which were a perfect touch! Want a true Montreal experience, this is the place! 

I will be back when I head up from Florida again!"}
{"text":"First time at the Montreal Deli in Richmond Hill. I had  the smoke meat.

I have eaten Montreal smoked meat before as I am an ex Montrealer living in the GTA for close to 25 years.

I decided to try the smoked meat here as as I had tried the Mississauga location for their pizza and though it was excellent!

I have eaten at Centre Street Deli, Dunns, and Wolfies

This is absolutely the worst smoked meat I have ever eaten and is way overpriced.

The smoked meat had the texture of bologna, was greasy, and not hot.

For an excellent Montreal smoked meat go to Center Street Deli or Wolfies or Dunns all located in the GTA"}
{"text":"This is an updated review based on our annual trips to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to visit family. One of our favorite restaurants is the Montreal Deli & Greek Grill in Richmond Hill, Greater Toronto Area. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=iR-RK6EIx5OuOk3Z0jbUNQ 

Montreal Deli specializes in Montreal-style smoked meat, corned beef, and roast beef, as well as Reuben sandwiches.  Smoked meat originated in Montreal in the early 1900's and is similar to New York-style pastrami, but has differences in the brisket cut, ingredients used in the spice rub, and the curing-cooking process. Generally, the iconic Montreal-style cooked meat is marinated, smoked longer, and is milder, sweeter, less spicy, and more peppery than pastrami. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=XmqyZ7iXt6LRMzsiUZcW9A 

We enjoy this restaurant for its delicious smoked meat sandwiches, with the meat slices piled about 2\" high on light rye bread. The smoked meat is fresh, warm, flavorful with the right amount of spices, and sliced to order. Montreal Deli also serves other sandwiches (chicken, fish, BLT, peameal bacon, homemade burgers, and others); and breakfast (eggs, toast, smoked meat, peameal bacon, and others). Greek items such as soulvaki and wraps are also offered, as its owner/cook, Nick Trakosas, shares his family's cooking from his Greek heritage. Servings are generous, and prices are reasonable. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=XXNRCfMJ1rvseZLVv9PlvQ 

Not only is the food delicious, as we also love the hospitality of its friendly and personable owner/cook, Nick, who has more than 25 years of experience. He and staff enjoy talking to customers who either dine-in or take-out in this clean and comfortable 44-seat restaurant. While we were there, it was a happy atmosphere with regular customers chatting with restaurant staff re the happenings of the day or how the family was doing.  It felt like we were a part of Nick's family. As such, customer service was first-rate and hospitable. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=dBOlanf9rVCII7liomoY_w 

We brought two of our grandchildren (ages 12 and 11) for lunch, and they enjoyed both the food and the personable conversation by Nick and staff. They even told Nick that they liked his food and couldn't wait to take their parents (our son and his wife) to his restaurant. (I think Nick turned his charm onto them!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=3vPQOXWxftkpbo808PlOQQ 

Montreal Deli also participates in the annual 18-day Canada National Exhibition (fair with pavilions, exhibits, shows, concerts, working farm, horse show, casino and carnival midway) which is attended by 1.3 million people. They have two booths in the food building where there are long lines for their sandwiches, which are the same as offered in the restaurant. As he does each year, Nick will close his restaurant early to tend to the crowds at the CNE. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=ecmeKLaUGDTA6YE_QFj0oA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=czMNsT-dOvXZpXRG3zN7yw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=EbdR-AHWQDi_w9Don4QZ7w 

Nick continues to provide catering as an option, and also takes part in many fund-raising for worthy causes.

Montreal Deli also has a second location in Mississauga that is owned and operated by Nick's cousin and has a different menu (we have not been to that location).

With outstanding sandwiches, especially the Montreal-style smoked meat, and the warm hospitality offered by Nick, our family will certainly make it a point to dine there again on our next visit!"}
{"text":"The best Reuben sandwich in the city.  Ample amounts of freshly steamed meat, perfectly toasted rye, hot sauerkraut and swiss.  top it with a little extra mustard, dill pickles, and wash it down with black cherry pop and you've got yourself heaven on earth.

Nick is a great owner who takes pride in his work."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches - and pretty decent portions. Sandwiches are jam packed with meat as you would expect. Wouldn't say it's quite like a new york deli or montreal deli (partially due to the atmosphere being more of a family diner) but still very good."}
{"text":"Looks like they closed early again today. And they weren't very nice about letting me know they weren't open. Won't be coming back."}
