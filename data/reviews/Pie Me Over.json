{"text":"Best chicken pot pie. Garlic crust is my favorite. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas & stumbled upon the most wonderful gourmet chicken pot pie shop.  It was their grand opening day and is strictly take out.  I tried the habanero cheddar pie; A slight kick to it and the most delicious rotisserie chicken & homestyle vegetables! You can take home a pie and cook it or  call one hour ahead and it will be baked and ready for you.  If you are anywhere nearby, stop over at this wonderful shop right now! PieMeOver won me over."}
{"text":"Omg so good! I was really craving chicken pot pie on a rainy day, so we searched chicken pot pie and this came up!   We got the apartment size chicken pot pie with the garlic crust. It was amazing!   I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the crusts! We'll probably get the individual in two types of crusts next time so we can try them. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owners, saved pies for me until I was off of work! Excellent flavor and very good pricing for serving size. Recommended"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pot pie I've ever had!! And the customer service was on point. Definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"So delicious! Exceptional customer service!!! Cheddar crust is the best :) you can buy pies frozen and have them freshly made!"}
{"text":"Picked up a habanero cheddar pot pie for lunch. YUMMY!! Baked perfectly and ready right on time. Staff was super helpful. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS POT PIES. We got three individual sized pies, two steak and one chicken. All with cheddar crust, which was delicious! We were all very impressed! Though, word of caution, it is NOT a restaurant like I thought. It is either take and bake or order ahead for them to bake it! ENJOY!! :)"}
{"text":"Great Pot Pies! Genuinely very nice people. Its a very small mom and pop gem I'm so glad I've found. Great original crust, fresh vegies and creamy deliciousness. They even have a cheddar and a mild habanero crust too. You can call ahead and have it cooked, ready to bake or frozen. I stock up on frozen ones. Trust me you won't be disappointed! UPDATE! They have added a meat pie. The brown gravy is awesome and they are full of hardy sirloin tips. This is warm comfort food and it doesn't get better. Try them today!"}
{"text":"Pie me over the best pot pies in las vegas so good i loved it and also great service ive found my pot pie home in vegas ! Couldn't get better then this !"}
{"text":"Still amazing, didn't talk about the beef pot pies! Like I thought, loved them. I would say they are my favorite, but it's more what I'm in the mood for. The owners and maker of pies are still awesome, you can taste the love they put into their pies, I always pick up two, when I get a chance, perfect well balance meal, especially more so now, during the colder months! If you haven't yet, why you waiting to check them out!"}
{"text":"I am not particularly fond of chicken pot pies because the creamed gravy is usually too oily or greasy.  This is hands down the best chicken pot pie.  The gravy filling is full of a balanced flavor and is not greasy or oily.  Highly recommend these pies."}
{"text":"The hub didn't want to eat at Jaburritos with me so we ventured here. The woman at the counter explained the concept and showed us the fresh and frozen offerings of the day. Having a full belly from my burrito, my hub settled for a fresh-made cheddar chicken pot pie.   Customer service is an A+, pies look bomb-diggity..if the hub likes it, I'll probably get a veggie one next time around !"}
{"text":"Delicious pies paired with super sweet customer service. Highly recommend the chicken pot pie! If you are feeling adventurous the curry pot pie is also very yummy. Comfort food heaven!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I love this place!  What an easy meal and may just be the best pot pie ever.  Habanero cheddar crust with chicken is my favorite, but I also love the veggie pie with the cheddar crust.  I want to try garlic crust next time.   I wish they were open on Sunday's.  Twice I've wanted one on a Sunday and they were closed.  I also wish they would add chicken to the veggie pie."}
{"text":"What a great little gem! Being from the Midwest I personally love good old comfort food and this place fits that bill. I've tried both the beef pot pie and all the variations of the chicken pot pies and they have all been good. I've also introduced some friends to the deliciousness that is a pot pie. I love that you can call ahead and they will cook it for you, or you can pick it up refrigerated or frozen to be cooked later. The owner is friendly and you can tell she really cares about the quality of her products. So glad this place exists and that it's basically on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Yum yum!  Decided to give this business a try based on Yelp reviews! Don't pass this place up!  By far the best pot pie we have ever had.  Hubby had the chicken pie with the habanero crust, I had the veggie pie with cheddar crust. They give great baking instructions, follow them. You won't be disappointed!  Wish there was a bottom crust like other Yelp reviews.  That is the ONLY reason for 4 stars."}
{"text":"I bought a large chicken pot pie with regular crust for a dinner party.  It was wonderful.  Just add a side salad and you are set to get rave reviews of you dinner.  The pie had large chunks of chicken with carrots and peas.  The gravy was perfect.  I also bought a small chicken with habanero crust.  The crust had a small bite to it but not overwhelming  spice.  I will definitely try their other pies."}
{"text":"I love Chicken Pot Pie! Pie Me Over was walking distance from my hotel. Looked on their website and saw that it is a take out that you can purchase frozen, fresh, or they will cook it for you if you call ahead. They provided me with a plate and utensils once I mentioned I was at a hotel. I walked over and when I got back my pie was still so hot I had to be careful. It was delicious! Huge pieces of chicken. My only wish was for a few more veggies. Great place. Easy fast delightful people."}
{"text":"Love this pot pie joint! The pot pies are always tasty and you can tell are made with good and fresh ingredients. They care about quality and you can notice, they even cut out different little shapes of pie crust to top the pie with. I've had a pine tree, a flower and a house. The staff there are very friendly and helpful and the instructions are clear and get you a delicious pot pie every time! They will also heat it up for you if you call ahead."}
{"text":"The garlic crust chicken pot pie was absolutely delicious. I'm normally not a big fan of pot pie but the overall taste was great. The only thing I wished for was the portion was a bit bigger. Other than it I loved it. It took them 35 mins to bake my pie and it prompt."}
{"text":"Delicious! They offer great Chicken and Vegetable Unbaked Pies.  I recommend that wrap the edges of the pie with tin foil to prevent over cooking.  The owner is very nice and helpful. If you call ahead, they will bake the pie for you."}
{"text":"Had the chicken with the garlic crust.  It was great, the crust was the best part.  The people working there are very nice and informative as well.   If I had one else criticism that would justify the 4/5, it's that there's no bottom crust to the pie.  It's just a top layer over the pot pie, so basically a stew with a top pie layer on it.  I would have hoped for a bottom and top, like a normal pot pie. Aside from that, no complaints."}
{"text":"this is by far the very best chicken pot pie i had ever had,hands down & i had alout in my day..."}
{"text":"My family loves when I surprise them with these pot pies. I usually get the cheddar Jalapeño crust chicken pot  pie. I may try the others, but why change it up when you've found the perfect combo.  I usually call in advance and have them bake it, so it's hot and perfectly done when I arrive and just the right temp to chow down, when I get it home."}
{"text":"Similar to Papa Murphy's, Pie Me Over is a take-and-bake business model, except with a different product. If you like pies but hate the hassle of baking, or the flavor of frozen, this place is a good option to have.  The pies here are tasty, but as Norm said, I'd enjoy more customization options. The freshness is evident, and the rotisserie chicken especially was tasty in the pies, but so far the only thing you can specialize is the crust. Owner stated her favorite was the cheddar, other reviews tend to favor the habanero. Taste is only slight, but the habanero was my favorite as well- buttery crust has almost a Ritz cracker flavor to it, but flaky and soft with a tiny hint of spice to it.  Price is competitive: crust selection changes the price a bit for each size, but the individual is just under $7 and an ample portion. Apartment size is meant to feed 2 (roughly $15), with a larger family size available too. If you're just a couple, I'd get two individual size pies with different crusts until you find your favorite.  Service was friendly from owner and cashier. When owner found out I'd found the business through Yelp, she made a few comments about how they have one \"weird review up,\" and discussed the customer's visit.  I found the comments unprofessional, particularly given that Yelp is essentially free marketing and the review she was referring to was the only reason I'd even heard about the business to begin with, let alone stopped by.   If you like the product, hold on to their punch card: nine pies of any size will get you a free individual! Hoping they eventually expand to other flavors of savory pies, or even maybe offer take-and-bake dessert pies- maybe try this as a holiday special? They also had sliced date bread available at the register."}
{"text":"OMG....this was the best chicken pot pie I have ever had.  Loved the mini pie just enough for one.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I may be biased because my mom makes THE BEST homemade chicken pot pies, but these were a little bland for my taste. All the flavor is in the crust, and I would prefer some more spices/flavors in the filling. The crust is pretty good, would probably recommend the cheddar, the garlic is fragrant but doesn't really add flavor. The staff is amazing, super helpful in making your selections. Come here earlier in the day if possible because they do sell out of flavors by the end of the day."}
{"text":"I love these pies!! The crust is so flaky and browns beautifully and the stuffing is full of chicken and tasty sauce. It makes dinner a breeze and the owners are really nice. And the smell from the oven is divine! This is a weekly go-to for me and my husband."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! It's a take-and-bake shop, although they will heat up the pie for you if you call ahead (you still have to do take-out, there is no place to sit and eat it there). They have a case of fresh and frozen pies. They make chicken pot pies, beef pot pies, and veggie pot pies. All pies can have different crusts: original, cheddar, habanero cheddar, and garlic. I chose an 'apartment size' (2 servings) cheddar crust chicken pot pie. It was delicious. It was full of tender and flavorful chicken, veggies (carrots were obvious cut by hand), and a delectable sauce. The crust had a great cheddar flavor. I thought for sure I would have leftovers, but no such luck, it tasted too good!  This is my new go-to dinner problem-solver!!!"}
{"text":"I love chicken pot pies. So when I saw this place open, I just had to try it. The pies are cute and the sixes are deceiving. Im a big eater, and didnt even think their medium size pie- The Apartment- would feel me up. I only ended up eating half and was full! So they pack more then you think.   I got the garlic crust pie, and while I can smell the garlic while it was cooking, I couldn't really taste it. What I did taste was the over powering flavor and texture of onion. I'm not a fan of onion. But that's all I tasted, so I was extremely disappointed. There was a little too much of peas in the pie, and while the carrots were a good amount, they should be sliced into halves, or quarters even, instead of full rounds. It would make for much easier eating and diving among plates.   I typically rate places with a 5 star or a 1 star, so this was a tough decision for me. I will be back to give them another shot and try the habenero crust, and I will review again.   I hope the owners take to heart the reviews left by myself and other reviews. This can be a great concept, but they need to take it a step further. Adding a chicken and potato pot pie would be a good start. As well as beef pot pies. Not everyone likes chicken. I also liked the idea from another reviewer asking for a curry pie (who doesnt like spicy food!?). All good ideas!"}
{"text":"Pot pies are hard to mess up but these ones are perfect. Golden brown crispy crust, just call 45 minutes ahead of time so it's ready for you or you can cook it at home."}
{"text":"Love, love \"Pie Me Over\", you will never eat a store bought pot pie again. My family and I have tried most of their varieties, with the exception of the habanero crust. My favorite is the Veggie pie, I will agree with some other reviewers it could use more filing, but just the same the pies are absolutely delicious. Looking forward to trying their new \"microwaveable\" pot pie with roasted potatoes, yum-o. Fresh or frozen they're the best!"}
{"text":"I picked up several pies for a party. I ordered them via email days earlier so that I could be sure to get the flavors I wanted. When we picked them up, they went over the cooking instructions with us and told us which was which, but they were also marked so we couldn't forget. When we cooked them, everything came out perfectly. Everyone at the party loved the pies and all asked for the name of the place and where so they could go back. Definitely a hit! We are going to do a party again in a month cause it was so good! Can't wait."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish they were closer to me! The BEST pot pie I have ever had! The chicken ...... drool ... so tender, yet not salty which is a HUGE positive for me. Plus, the people that I met that work there, so nice!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! I can't believe I waited so long to try it. My husband and son loves it!! Stop in and pick one up. I plan on ordering a few to freeze."}
{"text":"I ordered some chicken pot pies to be delivered to my dear friends in Arizona. The pies were delivered by FedEx on the promised day arriving well-packaged, intact and frozen. Needless to say, the recipients LOVED them and I'm a hero.  The ONLY problem was that I forgot to order some for myself! Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pot pies. Had the Chicken pie with Habanero Crust & a Vegetable pie with Regular crust.  Wouldn't change a thing. So much better than Marie Callenders. Can't wait to go back for more!!"}
{"text":"Don't ever buy a supermarket pot pie again! I ordered three single serve pies. One chicken and two beef. I bought them fresh (not frozen, although you can buy them frozen) and put them in the oven for 40 minutes at 400 degrees. The pies came out piping hot and golden brown with a delicious flaky crust on top.   I ate the chicken pot pie. My Mother and husband had the beef pie.   Both types of pies were chock full of chicken, vegetables and beef with a delicious cream inside. The crust was thick and delicious. The pie was bigger than what you can get at the super market and it's made with all fresh ingredients.   Take my advice and get your pot pies here! They have different sizes and crusts like regular and cheese crusts.   mmmmmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"My husband loves chicken pot pie so of course when I found this place we had to try it!   A great find!!    We baked it at home and it was excellent!  I'm afraid we bought the largest one and 2 of us finished it!   I will be getting a different one next week.   Maybe the beef!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it is a little on the pricey side. We got a family size & I split with my 8 year old. We had a large side salad at home to go with it! With that being said, it was SO worth every penny! You can taste the quality in every bite. That is actually a hard thing to find nowadays. The habanero cheddar crust is amazing! Bravo!! (I do wish it had some heat but that's just me being picky) The chicken was so flavorful, the veggies delish, & the sauce was incredible. I love that I could bring it home & bake it myself! It was the perfect amount of time to have my son do his homework while I prepped lunches and made our salads! Thanks to one of our Safekey guys that recommended this place to my son & thank you to my son for continuously bugging me to give it a shot! This is comfort food at its best! Definitely find time to try them out!"}
{"text":"I was going to take a photo but the pot pie smelled so good I couldn't stop myself from digging in. The only bad thing about Pie Me Over is having to wait while it cooks because it fills your home with a delicious smell. They offer a variety of tasty options, but so far I've only had the classic chicken pot pie. My picky chef father even loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm a girl who loves a good pot pie. I always found it hard to find someone who makes a pot pie just right. Let me tell you, this place has nailed it !  I was just getting over a cold so I was in need of some hot  food to get me through the night. Saw this place and decided to come in. They have chicken pot pie (regular ) veggie pot pies for you vegetarians :) chicken curry pot pies and sirloin pot pies. I got the regular chicken pot pie with regular crust.  You bring these pies home and cook them in your oven so you can eat them fresh of course. They give you a list of directions which was very helpful because my pot pie cooked beautifully in my oven. Also pretty simple directions .  40 mins later I take my first bite and it was soo good guys. Creaminess was perfect, wasn't over salted :) The chicken was amazingly tender and it was like rotisserie chicken so it was in strips. Veggies were soft and just right, and ate those up too !  This was one of the freshest pot pies I could have eaten.  Will definitely be coming back and I think I will be getting a chicken pot pie with cheddar crust next time! Yum.  Also you can accumulate points here! So every pot pie gets you more points:)  You want a good pot pie ? This is the place to try !"}
{"text":"Went here tonight after finding out this place was very close to my apartment and I didn't feel like cooking. Probably one of the best decisions I have made in a while with my take out. When I walked in the staff was very prompt to fill me in on what they had to offer seeing as I have never been there. Prices were very reasonable. Next time though, I will be getting a Large because of my boyfriend. Originally wanted to get a garlic crust, but they were all out. I guess that's what I get for coming in 30 mins before they closed. So I opted for a Cheddar Crust Chicken Pot Pie.   Instructions were very easy to follow. Cooked at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes and came out perfect. The crust was cheesy and flaky at the same time...so good! I find myself to be a very picky eater, usually pushing aside vegetables. But with this...somehow I found myself loving everything! Most specifically, I never find myself eating carrots.... and then I ate all the carrots on my plate. Crazy.   Overall, I will definitely have to make many more trips here to try different crusts. And I am tempting to get the special order X-Large for a party now!"}
{"text":"These are the best pot pies I've ever had, we came on a Friday after work and I had the beef sirloin with Habanero Cheddar and my husband had the chicken with cheddar. We both fell in love with them. They are both so nice (the two owners) and informative as far as letting you know your choices and which crust combinations work best. Get yourself up in here for the best pot pie of your life, so good we came back the next day."}
{"text":"I've picked up a chicken pot pie from here twice & they are FANTASTIC! The owner & her worker are very friendly & helpful. They are passionate about the pies & it shows in the flavor & quality-even better then Grandma used to make. Super convenient to pick-up a pie ($15 for 2 people). I toss a salad together & you have a wonderful home cooked (wink) meal. I'm looking forward to trying the sirloin-pot-pie, they make those on Thursday's & Friday's. This is such a great concept- make one thing, and do a DAMN good job!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Boyfriend suggested we try them and we've already gone 2x in the last week! Can't wait till the weather gets cold so that we can have them more often"}
{"text":"I've never seen a place with so many 5 star reviews, so I was worried my expectations would be too high. Nope! They were met. My mother-in-law and I ordered the large chicken pot pie with the cheddar crust and a small beef pie. I did the mistake of eating the chicken first -and it blew my mind too much to give the beef pie an equal chance. Maybe if I'd eaten that first I would have liked it better, but the chicken was perfection! Plus the lady and gentleman at the counter were so great and informative. Along with having the cooking directions online and in paper, she went over it with us to be extra thorough. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cute, homemade, fresh, mom and pop place. A very nice couple run the place. Yummy pies, I enjoy how they have different sizes and flavored crusts plus a good price! Yum! I'm surprised that I actually found that I like just popping them in the oven myself"}
{"text":"We finally got to try their pies.  We had individual sizes of regular chicken pot pie and beef sirloin pie.  They were both delicious.  I also bought a big pie for my friends. They are new parents.  What a great dish for them.     The owner was very helpful and extremely proud of her products.  Love this little pie store.   Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Pie Me Over is a small take-out-only place that specializes in one thing. Pot pies. Chicken pot pies to be exact. Although they recently started offering a delicious beef pot pie option, the chicken pot pie is king in my opinion. You can order your pie in 3 different sizes, uncooked or frozen and I think you can opt to have the pie cooked and ready if you order over the phone. The pies come in a variety of crusts: regular, cheddar, habañero cheddar and garlic crust. You can't go wrong with any of the crust flavors. I almost wish they had an all-crust pie. It's that good. The meat to pie ratio actually improved since my first experience which gives Pie Me Over a high mark. They are closed on Sunday so order ahead if you want to eat your pie during football season. They include baking instructions and it's pretty easy and affordable. I order at least 3 pies and store them in the freezer for a nice semi-home-cooked meal if I don't feel like eating out or cooking. I loathe microwave dinners, don't you? Support a local business that deserves it!"}
{"text":"So with the new chicken pot pies at KFC, some people may be trading in quality for quantity when it comes to this savory meal, but not here at Pie Me Over! This new year started out a bit rough for me and Pie Me Over was there to provide filling and delicious comfort foods. You can call ahead to get a pie cooked for you or call ahead/walk in to get a ready to bake pie to cook at home (there is no seating in the store). You can freeze the pies or cook the, immediately. They can provide you with directions at the store or you can always log on to their website. I've dabbled in a few different sizes and flavor combos, but I think my favorite is taking home a ready-to-bake cheddar crusted, apartment sized pie. It's perfect for two people and the cheddar isn't too overwhelming. If I end up freezing it, I let it defrost the night before, pop up in the oven during the day, and reheat it later for dinner if I don't quickly devour it myself. It leaves my house smelling like a home cooked meal. If you are particular about a certain pie, make sure you call ahead, because they do sell out. For the vegetarians in your life, there are veggie pies, with cauliflower to replace the chicken. The folks who run this place are always helpful and down to earth.   Buyer beware - make sure to check out their opening hours. The worst is craving one of their delicious pies, only to find out they're closed. Do like me and buy extra pies to freeze for later :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their veggie pies.  Flaky crust and the flavors are amazing.  These pot pies are filling and tasty. I like being able to pick one up ready to go.  Also, frozen pies available. The different sizes are convenient.  Service is fantastic too. I love supporting locally owned businesses."}
{"text":"Really like this place a lot!  Great pot pies, great service! The reason I only give it four stars is there is no place to eat there and I think it would be nice to have that option.   However it's understandable that maybe this is a small start up company and they may not be able to afford a restaurant just yet .   The crust on theses little jewels is really great . I wish it were on the bottom layer of the pie as well since the crust is really good and you want more after eating the top layer crust. They have different flavored crusts and I had both the cheese and the regular - both were great ! I have been twice and got chicken pies both times.  Also brought one home for my honey and he thought it was delish too .   You bake these pies at home .  It's a unique concept.  I think it's a cute idea.    The pies seem to have fresh ingredients and seems carefully made with care."}
{"text":"I never knew pot pie could taste so good! It's important to properly follow the directions though. I set my oven to 375F at convection (400F on normal bake temp), covered the crust edges once browned so that the center could finish cooking, and the pie turned out super scrumptious!  I do prefer the chicken version over the beef only because I thought the beef gravy was a bit too thin for my liking.  Both chicken and beef pies had relatively generous and even amounts of flavorful meat and veggies, and for me, the individual sizes were more than enough to make my tummy feel satisfied and full.  For larger appetites, I'd get the next size up.  Out of the different crusts, my favorite was the habanero cheddar.  I'm glad there wasn't any bottom or side crusts because that means more delicious filling! I can't wait to try the curry chicken next time, mmmm!  :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty, cheddar crust was so delicious. Tons of chicken and veggies inside. Baked well at home in the oven like you would get it at a restaurant. Addictive."}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem.  Pot pies rich and delicious, reminiscent of homebaked type from G'ma only much better.  Cheddar crust  great.  Can't wait to try beef available only on weekends."}
{"text":"Flakey crust, delicious chicken, perfectly seasoned. And the owner was more than helpful and so nice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am a fan.  Their pies are delicious.  Although I am pretty good in the Kitchen I don't think I could make anything close to their amazing tasting pies.  We have tried the Garlic Crust, Habanero Cheddar Crust, Cheddar Crust and Regular Crust.  All were delicious but the Garlic and Cheddar are my favorites.    They are on the pricey side but that being said if i made my own to their quality it would cost me allot more so in the aspect it is well worth the cost.  We signed up for their club and got text messages on 20% off sales and stocked up.  We have baked them ourselves and got the same fantastic results as when we had them bake them.    The owner is so nice and we had received nothing but great service the 4 times we have been to Pie Me Over.  They have well packaged my frozen pies to make it easy for me to just put them directly in the freezer when I got home.  The young gent who works with the owner is so nice and has even helped me carry out my large order once.      This is a unique place that has some amazing Pot Pies.  I have never had such a great tasting Pot Pie and always look forward to popping one in the over for lunch.  Great food and great service!  If you haven't given them a try and love Pot Pies what are you wating for?"}
{"text":"Tried the veggie and the chicken tried the habanero cheddar crust as well as the cheddar crust everything was amazing definitely going back and will probably get the family size put it in the freezer and grab another family size just for the night. Tasted like a Gourmet Chef or your mom came over and cook for you that night"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken pot pie in town.  My fave is the habanero crust pie.  Ate it in less than 5 minutes because it was absolutely delicious.  Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"The pot pies here are amazing! I usually hate crust but I could eat just crust from here.   The chicken pot pie is my favorite!  The owners are very sweet and nice.  I think I'm going to make this a weekly thing."}
{"text":"Wow!   Chicken pot pie like my grandma made!  This is the best chicken pot pie you will ever eat.  Even though it only It only has the crust on the top it is fantastic.  It has the right amount of spices and the flavor will bring back memories of your youth.  Well, assuming your grandma knew how to cook, used fresh ingredients and made it with love.  This is the closet you will ever get to that experience.  Good thing it's not close to where I live or might just live on it!"}
{"text":"Cheese crust chicken pot pie & also got a garlic crust chicken pot pie. Crust is flaky, flavorful (I'm a crust person) chicken is tender. Great chicken/veggie ratio, savory sauce. Only thing I would ask for next time is if I can buy extra crust (again I'm a crust person and it was delicious crust).   The staff is great, very welcoming. They will tell you about the different pies and crusts. They will also tell you how to bake it at home and send you home with directions."}
{"text":"When I walked into this shop today I was greeted as though I was a long time patron, what a great establishment, if you haven't tried these pies you need to put it on your weekly menu, moms this is a homemade meal, for a family of 4 $20 and you just pop it in your oven, delicious I will be back."}
{"text":"Pie Me Over was recommended to me and when I looked them up on Yelp they had high ratings.  I had the chicken pot pie and it was amazing. They recommended the key lime pie and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I have had more than a few and they are awesome.  Way better than fast food and reasonably priced.  They are very helpful and tell you all about the fresh versus frozen and the different crusts and fillings.  I have tried the beef, it was tender and very tasty.    The only thing that would make them better would be a crust on the bottom and the top like we used to get them in the good old days!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  I'm not one to eat chicken pot pies but this was really good.  I had the cheddar crust which was flaky and yummy.  Lots of chicken.  Whatever the seasoning they used only enhanced the flavor, but I did have to add a little bit of salt but other than that the flavor was fantastic.  I just got my first one yesterday and I want another one today."}
{"text":"Best chicken pot pie I have ever tasted.  The ingredients are fresh, the chicken is so tender and the crust is perfectly flaky (just like some of the people that live in Vegas).   I make it a point to pick up a pie from here every couple of weeks.  The cost is reasonable and the service is great.  Definitely worth trying if you are a chicken pot pie connoisseur like me."}
{"text":"Saw this place on my way to work, did a search on yelp and saw Pie Me Over had good reviews, so I stop on my way home and grabbed 4 fresh chicken pies, which was amazing, even my toddler loved his pie. The staff were very nice and helpful. The cooking instructions provided were easy to follow and I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"beyond fabulous  the selection is beyond any I've ever come across.  I've tried most of the *flavors*, not a single disappointing bite."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Pot Pies in Las Vegas you found it. These are the best, tastiest pot pies in Las Vegas. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service and the best food def will b a regular...even vegetarian option and they deliver across the states"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! The habanero cheddar crust is so delish! The only thing I think would make their pies better would be to use all white meat chicken.  I am not a fan of dark."}
{"text":"Delicious pies!  The chicken is soo good. They cooked the chicken themselves and make all their dough. We got the apartment size for me and my husband. When you buy a pie they give you a small sheet with cooking directions which are really helpful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We walked in, and took a chance on this place, and oh my goshness! The quality of the chicken, the flaky crust...AMAZING!!! Me and my wife loved it!!! We will definitely be back for more..."}
{"text":"Perfect solution for the, \"what do you want for dinner\" dilemma. This place produces by far best chicken pot pies in Vegas. My ultimate favorite crust is the cheddar crust which provides just a small kick of cheddar flavor.  When this place first opened, I remembered the pies had an overpowering rosemary taste. It took them a couple of weeks, but they perfected the recipe and flavors are on point. I tried the steak pot pie and wasn't a fan. The meat was very chewy and the pie was watery. The curry pot pie was delicious, however it was at about a spicy level 8. It would be cool to have a pot pie with potato and hamburger. Also, a bacon crust. The large size is perfect for three people. The apartment size is good for two people. The individual is a perfect proportion size for one person. I tend to get four frozen individual pies to keep in the freezer and two not frozen individual pies for dinner. Don't want to cook dinner, Pie Me Over really offers the perfect solution! The staff is very friendly and helpful. They provide service with a smile!"}
{"text":"This shop makes me so happy! They put little designs on the middle of the crust. I just came today for the first time and got the chicken pot pie with the cheddar crust. So delicious! I can't wait to try the other ones. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I stopped here over a week ago but it was before the business was open for the day so I knew where to go and what time.  I stopped in yesterday and bought two chicken pot pies--one with cheddar crust and one with habanero cheddar crust.  They were in individual boxes and the boxes were not marked so we had to guess which was which.  I din't learn this until I got home.    They gave me a sheet with baking instructions that were very accurate.  I baked mine a little longer than they suggested but I wanted a nicely browned crust.   After baking, I turned the pot pies over onto plates and a bit stuck to the bottom which is what I expected.  I have made my own and I know this happens.  The filling of the pot pies was good.  You can tell the freshness by the carrots alone.  When I bit into the carrot slices, I could taste the fresh taste of carrot that hasn't been frozen but is a fresh produce item.  A couple of things about my experience.  I wish I had noticed the lack of marking crust flavors on the box before I got home.  That being said, my wife and I found almost no difference in taste between the two.  The habanero just was not evident.  I also find that chicken is the only option and your flavors are determined by the crust, the chance for different tastes is very limited.  What I'd really like is a curry chicken pot pie that you could taste and it wouldn't be that much extra to do.  The pot pies were OK.  I know I'm paying for fresh ingredients and they roast their own chickens, but the cost for the size of the pie is high and maybe it has to be.  I won't need their buyers' card for getting a free one after the correct number of purchases.  Tip:  If you're going to Pie Me Over, look on the east side of Rainbow for the Firehouse Subs.  Pie Me Over is in back behind the buildings in the front of 6070 South Rainbow."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good pot pie for a long time now in Vegas and have been disappointed all over town. I stopped here today and met the owner Marge who is very nice. I got the top sirloin pie and it was delicious. The crust is airy, flaky and you can taste the quality. They told me that everything is made from scratch and you can taste it in the food. Definitely will be back and try the different crust they have."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! Addicted!!! These pies are sooo good and the individual ones are plenty filling. Love the way my home smells while it's baking. Seriously the best chicken pot pies I've ever had!! My husband and I are seriously addicted!"}
{"text":"Like a good Yelper, I read the reviews before coming to this place, and one of the things I noticed is that the owner definitely read the reviews as well and has made appropriate adjustments. That's huge, for a business owner to care enough and be willing to make changes and adjustments based on customer feedback, and I appreciate that.   That being said, I came here with a few friends and we all got the classic chicken pot pies with different crusts. Two of us got the garlic crust, one got the cheddar, and one got the habañero cheddar. Everyone was extremely pleased; you could tell these were made with fresh ingredients, and the crusts were flavorful, flaky, and tender. The owner was so sweet and helpful as well! My girlfriend and I are looking forward to coming back on a Thursday or Friday to try the beef pies!   Oh yeah, and if you'd prefer to pick up an already-baked pie, make sure to call them at least an hour ahead of time and they'd be happy to oblige."}
{"text":"My favorite and the only chicken pot pie I enjoy. So much fresh chicken it's so good. I need another. And the moon and stars on that delicious crust is a nice touch"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted something different for lunch. I remember seeing this place and wondering what it was about so I looked it up. I'm so glad I did.   Called in our lunch order and picked it up 40 minutes later. Delicious fresh flaky chicken pot pie. Tender chicken in creamy sauce with crisp veggies and excellent flavor. Not too salty. And really affordable, too!   I will absolutely be back. Possibly tonight."}
{"text":"These pies are fantastic! We've been coming here since we moved into the area a few years ago and it never disappoints. Yes it's just pie, but they offer enough variety to please everyone in the family.  It's always the owners who tend the store; they're super friendly and I really appreciate spending my money at locally owned and operated spots like this."}
{"text":"Awesome pie, flaky good homemade crusts. Friendly staff. Wish they had longer hrs. And maybe pies ready to eat. But they are VERY GOOD pot pies!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest so I love my comfort foods. I was pretty excited when I heard there was a bakery specializing in one of the classic comfort foods.   We were immediately greeted by the owners who were very welcoming and explained all of the options available. The display cases were nicely labeled and large overhead boards clearly outlined the pricing for everything available. It seemed like everything they offer was available for purchase the day we visited.  The bakery focuses on their pride and joy, Pot Pie! They offer Sirloin, Chicken, and Veggie. There is also Chicken Only for veggie haters and Gluten Free for those with dietary restrictions. Crusts come in Regular, Cheddar, Cheddar Habanero, and Garlic. Every flavor comes in Individual Size and Apartment Size (serves two). Some of the flavors are offered in a Large Size (serves four). We learned that the chicken in their potpies is from rotisserie chicken that they make on site. I like that the pies and the ingredients are very fresh. Pies are offered fresh (to be made no later than the next day) or frozen to save for later.  My husband and I decided to try the Sirloin Pie with Cheddar Habanero in the apartment size. The owner gave us detailed instructions for baking along with a piece of paper to reiterate her instructions. I used my convection oven per the instructions and the pie was perfect. The aroma drifted to the far reaches of my home and invited me to dinner.   The most important part is the taste of the pie. Taste was a 5/5. The sirloin steak was flavorful and in large pieces. The ratio of meat to vegetable was good for me. The crust had enough cheddar and enough habanero heat to satisfy my taste buds. Serious food kudos on the ability to flavor the crust without overwhelming the pie flavors. Yum, yum, yum!  My only suggestion would be for a bottom crust layer and a tad more filling. Maybe they omit the bottom layer because it bakes better at home without it, but I do think a second layer of crust would make it even better. Also, the filling seemed like it could have been packed a little more to make it a heartier meal. I supplemented the apartment size with a side of roasted vegetables and would consider it a lighter meal for two.   We'll definitely be back. I have to try the signature Chicken Pie and I want to try some other crust flavors as well."}
{"text":"The other day I discovered PieMeOver.  Fresh pot pies to go.  I got the individual size, chicken with habanero cheddar cheese crust.  The ingredients are fresh and they stick to the basics inside.  I'm going to try the sirloin next."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Pies are super fresh and tasty. The owner is really nice as well explaining how to make the pies at home. Definitely coming back here soon for more flavors."}
{"text":"Pie was very good.  I like bottoms though, these pies have no inside crust.  I don't know if that's traditional, but I like a pie with crust inside.  All in all. Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Experience:  this was pretty darn good. I stopped by because I saw Stefany's review and it enticed me. I was in the area, so I stopped in to check it out.   Facility: it's located in a strip mall in the South corner. It's a small, clean shop that's just has the counter to order your food and some displays.   Service:  the gentleman was very polite when I came in and tried to help, but a lady, who I think was the owner, stepped in and took over. She was polite and talked me through their choices and answered all my questions. She stated they were putting the instructions in the bag, but there wasn't any in there when I got home. I called and she talked me through them, and they were super easy. Don't be thrown off when they answer the phone \"Hello?\" either.  Not sure why they don't identify their business, but it's them.   Food:  I got two individual pies...a plain and a jalapeño cheddar. I ate the jalapeño, of course. The crust was delicious!  It was flaky, and I could taste the cheddar and even a slight spicy hint. The inside had a good flavor in the gravy and big chunks of chicken and veggies.    Overall: As many other people have said, the menu is pretty small, but I did enjoy what they have.  I guess it's better to do one thing good, then a lot of things mediocre."}
{"text":"Pie Me Over easily has the best pot pies that you have ever tasted.  The light garlic crust was so freaking delicious on my veggie pot pie.  The filling was very flavorful and all the vegetables tasted very fresh, even though the pie was baked from frozen.  I have been going her for takeout a few months and the quality is consistently excellent. Gonna keep going back."}
{"text":"Love love love. Inexpensive, family favorite. I stop by on my way home for work and get each family member an individual pie. They get protein and veggies and I get a night off of cooking and dishes. Also great to drop off if someone is sick or has new baby."}
{"text":"love the garlic crust chicken pot pie, they sold out the beef 1, told me fresh one will b made every week Thursday and Friday, definitely will b back"}
{"text":"This is a great mom and pop style kind of idea.  The chicken pot pie to purchased to bake for later was delicious and way better then expected, the chicken was delicious and unlike what that one lady said the crust exceeded expectations,  I look forward to purchasing a few pies for later and want to try the different crusts as well."}
{"text":"Listen... this place already has great reviews and says everything there is to say.  So, I'm going to simple say... The Best Damn Chicken Pot Pie I have ever had, including homemade. We had the regular which is an excellent traditional chicken pot pie... the crust is exceptional... the gut is seasoned perfect... the right amount of fresh veggies... a little light on the chicken but taste great.  Although they do offer frozen, I picked up the fresh, \"apartment\" size for the 2 of us. Took it home and baked it as directed. It took the full 50 mins and the wonderful smell throughout our house, of this cooking was almost unbearable. We couldn't even wait until it cooled properly to cut into it.  Disappointed there wasn't any key lime pie... not sure if they were just out or they just don't offer it anymore.  Not a big fan of the Indian Pudding even with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. more of an acquired taste and texture."}
{"text":"Pregnancy cravings got me eating chicken pot pie for two days in a row from @piemeover. It's a bummer because I bookmark this place on yelp for years but finally decided to try it out.. the owners are going to move to Massachusetts so they told me they might close at the end of this month. Check this place out !! It's soooo good!"}
{"text":"Tried the garlic crust as well as the cheddar crust pot pie and they were both great! The crust is really flaky and flavorful and the filling is excellent. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"My husband had a yankering for pot pie, luckily I remembered seeing reviews for this place.  Only bummer is that he didn't tell me till Saturday night, too late to be a contender. I suggested we have it for dinner Sunday, I was bummed that they weren't open. Just need to plan ahead next time.  We delayed it for one more night. By this time, my husband was beyond yankering and moved to craving desperation to fulfill his taste.  Now he was expecting something fantastic.  Pie Me Over truly delivered.    We both had chicken, he had the original and I had the cheddar crust.  There was just a hint of cheddar which I appreciate.  It shouldn't be so strong and overpower the filling.    The filling was made with fresh ingredients that were perfectly cooked.  Plenty of chicken, right amount of vegetables and the sauce was the perfect consistency.  And I'm glad there was no potatoes.  That's just a filler that makes it more starchy.  Keep the recipe as is.  FYI, they make the sirloin beef on Fridays and Saturdays; veggie on Tuesdays; any other days you want these, you'll have to settle for a frozen pie if they have it.  You can probably call them to set aside for you.    This is now my go to place for pot pie.  It's even better than ones I've had at restaurants."}
{"text":"Small local business making the best pot pies you'll ever have they do a vegetarian and gluten-free cheese crust habanero crust garlic crust have had them all. You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Take and bake chicken pot pie!!!!! They also have beef and veggie with various crusts like cheddar, garlic, and jalapeño mmmm!!! Also sign up for their mailing list for discounts/promotions!  They also can bake your pot pie if you call like a hour or two in advanced! Their pies are made with the freshest ingredients, dough, meat, and veggies! They also give you cute baking instructions to bake your pie to perfection.  We got the apartment sized chicken pot pie with garlic crust! It smells so amazing and tastes great. I absolutely love this place and will be back :) great prices, quality pies! Thank you pie over me for keeping my stomach full and wallet happy"}
{"text":"Really cool unique idea!  I really hope this place makes it.  I love the idea, and the pie I tried was great but as a whole it needs some work but I think the need to be more successful in order to make the changes that would make this place great!    I would just like to see them offer more variety... like different flavor fillings and maybe other protein options like ground beef or steak.  Maybe add mushrooms or potatoes to the current chicken pies?  As it stands the offer chicken or veggie only, with 3 crust options.   The other day I wasn't feeling well,  I didn't want to cook. But I didn't want to pick up crappy fast food either.  I stopped in and got a chicken pie with cheddar habenero crust in the medium (apartment) size.  The crust was delicious and the chicken filling was great.  However the veggie filling was a little unbalanced... which is understandable if they are making a ton of pies at once... but my pie had mostly onions and peas with practically no carrots. It did have plenty of chicken though which made up for the loss of carrots.   The staff was super friendly and helpful too.  Overall... i will for sure be back to try again :-)"}
{"text":"Love PIE ME OVER but must offer a bit of constructive criticism ....  MORE veggies in both the chicken & the veggie pie .please !   :)  ***** Thanks for your reply ... It's nice  that  most of your customers think lots of veggies.   We disagree.   Would be nice to add at least peas & celery  .... In the veggie pie there seems to be nothing but onion cauliflower & potato   I have bought many of your pies & am a fan but always make side veggies for my husband / guests to add"}
{"text":"Pie Me Over has won me over!!!   The Chicken Pot Pie they bake is the best I've had outside from being homemade!!! Flavors had depth, with the rich creaminess of the stew, seasoning and the crust came together real well. I could tell that after one bite the pie was made with lots of TLC.   The restaurant is a small, takeout-only place, basically you pick the pies up uncooked, they give you written instructions on the length of time to cook depending on the size and you heat them at home. If you don't feel like turning on the oven, you can call them an hour in advance and they'll heat it up for you. They make Chicken Pot Pies, Veggie Pies and Top Sirloin Beef Pies with different flavors of crust Regular, Cheddar, Habanero Cheddar and Garlic. I felt the prices were reasonable considering they are made from scratch.  Marje & Feliciano (owners) are awesome!! They are both are so nice, and wonderful people.  I never left without a smile on a face. This is why I love supporting small local businesses."}
{"text":"Called ahead and ordered two pies - a chicken pot pie with cheddar crust and another with the habanero cheddar crust. When I got there they came out hot and fresh from the oven. They were delicious and my family really enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Pie Me Over does one thing, and one thing only--   they make fantastic pot pies.  My husband and I shared the beef pot pie and the chicken pot pie.  You even get to select the type of pie crust you want.  The crust options included the following: regular, garlic, cheddar, or a spicy cheddar cheese. Their pot pies come in several serving sizes too.  The next time I host a dinner party, I will be picking up a pot pie from Pie Me Over.  Side note: They have vegetarian pot pies too, but I love the chicken pot pie!!!"}
{"text":"Awwwwwww yeah.... by far the most comforting food I've ever eaten. The habanerro crust is just delicious. You're life isn't complete untill you've eaten here."}
{"text":"Love love love! The owners are super friendly and the pot pies are fantastic! I love the habanero crust. This place has saved me more than once when I run out of dinner ideas. Super convenient to throw in the oven last minute."}
{"text":"I'm always on the look out for a good pot pie. I've been wanting to check them out for a while, just never got the chance. The strip mall they are located in doesn't have a lot in it, so you probably won't see it unless you're looking for it. Upon entering I was greeted right away. I told them this was my first time and the woman (the owner) behind the counter was quick to explain it all to me.   There isn't a lot of options. Chicken and Veggie then you get to pick your crust and size. I wanted one for dinner so I got a large non frozen chicken with regular crust and then 2 individual frozen chicken pies, one with cheddar crust, one with habanero crust. Gotta try them all! The instructions were put in the bag with the pies. I made the large, it smelled great! It tasted great. Tons of chicken and veggies, flavorful gravy, the crust was buttery and delicious ...I want more crust! My only disappointment was that there weren't any potatoes in the mix. Hubby loved it too. I'm hooked. Can't wait to try the rest of the flavors. I will definitely be back. Especially once I make some room in my freezer. Great meal to make when I'm busy or tired. Just sit there and wait until it's done."}
{"text":"This is a must have. Great flavors and fresh ingredients and the best crust ever. We tried the Habanero crust and it was amazing. We will definitely be back for more.. Great job!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 regular Chicken pot pies and a habanero cheddar chicken pot pie. They were very tasty. In my opinion and the habanero cheddar had a lot better flavor then the original. The pot pies had a very good Chicken to vegetables ratio. The next time I think I will try the beef pot pie."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall mom and pop owned place that really just specializes in one thing and that is their chicken pot pies ! You can tell they take their time in making their pies . I love this place it's sucha good find ! The pies are amazing they're easy to heat up and full of flavor ! Me and my co worker just recently visited and nearly cleared them out when we purchased 10 pies !"}
{"text":"I will not be able to express in words how good this pot pie was. It was so good I have told everyone I know about it. I even posted a flyer at work telling everyone to go here. I work like 3 minutes away. The owner was pleasent the worker was just as enjoyable to talk to. They have frozen pies and fresh pies. I will defiantly be back. 14$ for a pie that fed two of us."}
{"text":"Pie Me Over is hiding away @ the Rainbow & Patrick Mall that quite behind the building that is not to be easily seen & found. Luckily today by chance that I saw it , & out of curiosity I went inside to take a look. It is a small shop with a To-Go fast food layout, it was covered with window curtain so at the beginning I thought it was a sit-in restaurant but it is not. All they have is mostly freshly-made Chicken pot pie. I am a fan of chicken pot pie, green peas pie etc, but they only have chicken pot pie & some kind of vegetarian pot pie, I wish they have green peas pot pie too, cause i tried the one in Austria & that was pretty good with good memory. All you will see in the Pie Me Over store are frozen pot pie, they hv 3 sizes, individual,  apartment (for 2 pp), & big round one for family size, it is not cheap,  prices range from 6, 7 dollars to 20 bucks or so for a pie,  but the ingredients are fresh & it is made 2 order. They do not have one already made at all.  You can either buy the frozen one & bake it at home right away, or call to pre-order one an hour ahead & pick it up. I see people would just buy the frozen one home. I didnt have time to bake so I just pre-ordered one & pick it up later. Same price!  Next time I would call in to pre-order beforehand. My kids love it, it is not salty like the commercial ones you can buy it in market, it is more like home-made pot pie. My daughter said she wishes it can be more juicy like having the creamy soup inside the pie kind, I think it is alright, still good, not too juice, but not dry either. We ordered the garlic favor, it was good. They have original, cheese & garlic favors etc etc, when I am craving for pot pie again, I will be back as it is hard to find one good pot pie shop here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pot pie never was something that stood out to me, but since discovering this place and trying out their goodies, I've had a new fondness for both pies and pot pies!  Call ahead to order your pies, since it will take about 45 mins for it to be ready, but it's worth it!  Every time I've called, the lady has always been friendly and knowledgeable. I've had two of their crusts so far, but between regular & garlic crust, I would go with regular. I love the crust. They have different types of pies and I've had the chicken pot pie and the curry chicken pie. I'm leaning towards the curry one as of now and have yet to try their chicken lovers pot pie but that's definitely next on my list.  The pricing is good for their size of the pot pies, and always more than enough for each of my meals. They even have a pot pie to go option, which I have yet to try, but will eventually!  The place is easy to find, inside Firehouse Subs plaza. They are very friendly in person and when I had questions about their posters on their walls, they were very helpful. They even have Perka if you want to accumulate points for future visits."}
{"text":"Grand Opening today and it was worth the wait!  The pies were awesome!  I ordered the family size original crust and the family size habanera crust pies and it served a lunch group of about 10 people along with salad.  It went over really well and I was surprised we were fighting over the habanera crust pie.  Every drop was gone of both pies!  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"My family & I are addicted to this place! The owners are the sweetest people ever, and they know me by voice now when I call because that's how much we go! We love a good homemade meal & a pot pie is always a favorite! They have by far the best pot pies I've ever had! I always refer people to them! So yummy!"}
{"text":"These pot pies are a bit to dry for my taste. They have different crust options available which is a phenomenal idea! They offer original, garlic, cheddar, and habanero cheddar crust. If you want the pie baked you need to call ahead (about 50 minutes) and they will bake it for you. I can see what they are trying to accomplish with their pies. Maybe I just hit them on an off day."}
{"text":"Wife picked up a Chicken cheddar pie on the way home. It came out really good and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This chicken pie was dry, rubbery, and had burnt crust... way over cooked. Also Not the best customer service. No wonder they are going out of business/moving to another state. Good riddance!!!"}
