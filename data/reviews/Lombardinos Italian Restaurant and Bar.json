{"text":"Food was fantastic. I had the pappardelle with truffled mushrooms. It was amazing. Boyfriend had spaghetti bolognese which was easily the best I've tasted in the area. Our only complaint would be regarding the service. We say for 15-20 minutes before we were even brought water let alone greeted by our server. When she did come she barely spoke to us, took our drink order and left. He ordered a glass of Sangiovese which was described as having a \"big, bold finish\" but was served in a very small white wine glass. I went to the bar and asked for the proper glass. Once the food came, all was forgiven until we asked for our remaining food to be boxed. We ordered more drinks...no boxes brought out. Ordered dessert (got the sampler which was wonderful)...no boxes. Paid our bill...no boxes. Finally flagged down a different server to get them. Of all three courses we had, our actual server only brought out one. It should also be noted that we went on a random Tuesday. It was not overly bust at all. Overall, I'd rate the food a definite 5 stars. But the service is lucky to be getting a 2 star rate. We will go back, though. The food was worth it. But we'd probably just sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Lombardinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  For a casual night, sit in the bar and split a pizza Lombardino and salad (hint - they will give you half portions of many of their menu items if you just ask).  When I want to splurge, the orecchiette is one of the best cream-based pastas I've ever had.  It may seem a little dated inside, but that's what makes it special."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Madison. They treat us like family here! My kids regularly order off menu simple dishes which they always accommodate. It's not uncommon for me, especially in the winter if I need a serious veggie fix, to just order all their veggie sides and make a meal of that -- their brussels sprouts are heaven sent, their sage rubbed squash divine! I've loved their bolognese; spicy clam sauce; their brined pork; they do something to the polenta there to make exceptionally creamy -- delicious. I can't say enough good things. And their housemade limoncello is perfection."}
{"text":"Very delicious Italian food.  This place is like an old gem in Madison and I'm glad someone recommended it.  I had a vegetarian pasta, which was lacking a bit of salt.  Plus, there was no sale or pepper on the tables.  I had some of my friends' beef dish and was so envious!  Next time I know not to order anything vegetarian and order what I truly want."}
{"text":"As usual we were not disappointed.  We took my niece and her roommate  out for dinner.  My wife and the girls had the ravioli while i went with the bolognese.  The service was fast and in no time at all we had our food.  We have always been pleased with the food."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend there the first time we went out in Madison. Wined and dined her the whole nine yards and we were both very impressed with the wait staff and food. She was so pleased that she asked if we could go back again. That's the first time that's happened, ever."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for years, but decided to try it because we could eat early, eat at the bar (always more fun in my opinion), and because it was close to the early evening movie we'd be seeing later.  We each had a nice glass of white Italian wine and, not knowing alot about Italian wines, we were helped nicely by our bartender.  We decided to split a neopolitan style pizza and enjoy separate salads.  I'm not a fan of pizza in general, but I do love neopolitan style disks.  The \"Insalata Lombardino\" was excellent -- fresh, perfectly dressed, and larger than we expected.  We ended up being grateful for its generous portion because the pizza was a real disappointment.  We were expecting a thin, crisp crust with almost sparse toppings.  (We probably should have inquired, but we didn't.)  Instead we were presented with a pizza that was piled with cheese and the other ingredients -- alot like any pizza you can order anywhere ... thicker crust, brimming with cheese.  I'm sure there'd be plenty of folks happy with that, but we ordered something else.  Picking off the mounds of cheese, we left quickly afterward.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu, but don't come here for neopolitan pizza."}
{"text":"As a recent Madison transplant, this was the first stop in my neighborhood after hearing rave reviews.  It's worth the hype.  Split a pizza (can't remember the name but had spicy giardinera veggies on top), calamari & a Caesar salad with my dinner companion.  Calamari might be some of the best I've ever had... no grease, crispy panko breading.  Great service, beautiful atmosphere, very pleased this is within walking distance as I will make many return visits!"}
{"text":"Love Lombardinos for their calamari, pizza, pasta and desserts!! Yes, that is a lot of food, so as you have guessed, this is a perfect place to go hang out with friends for a nice meal together. 

They have seasonal specials for pizza and pasta. But I got reluctant to order from the specials cos 
1) tried the squash pizza offered during their squash specials but the squash was not properly cooked =(
2) their combinations can be pretty adventurous, once I saw a sour cream flavored gelato ~~

I would saw go for it if you are up for trying some new stuff, but for me I prefer my traditional go-tos when I am here. I would always start with the calamari, the marinara sauce is a great pairing to the calamari, it does come with horse radish sauce but you can always tell them to leave it out if it like me, it's not your favorite sauce.

The highlights for me have always been the desserts in addition to the Italian food. They have superb home-made gelato ice-cream and the serving is really generous! The flavors vary but the classics such as vanilla (wow the texture of vanilla beans!!) have always been there all those times I'd visited. I would also recommend the tiramisu, it looks deceivingly small but boy it's rich. The thick chocolate sauce that they drizzle on the side just makes this dessert twice as good.

Service has always been awesome so my times there have been wonderful. They take reservations so if you are planning a trip down, go ahead and let them know in advance! The atmosphere is nice too, semi-dark lighting with nice decos on the wall and postcards on the tables, makes for a great setting both for groups or dates =)"}
{"text":"First visit.  Wonderful waiter!  Food was very good.  We appreciated the use of local food.  The atmosphere was warm and cozy.  Fellow dinners seemed to be regulars.  Great vibe!  We definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner there last Friday and was happy that yelp did not steer me wrong again! My red sangria and calamari appetizer were delicious. I had a spicy mussel pasta special and it was scrumptious. I was impressed with the atmosphere and the service. There are not many great Italian restaurants of this caliber in Madison. Would be nice if they made veal parm to try. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Spaghetti Bolognesr. Outstanding Chicken \"under a brick.\" Excellent service at the bar."}
{"text":"flat out the best pizza in madison.  Seriously.  We used to order entrees here until we got around to trying the pizza and since then we've never ordered anything but.

I'm not a huge fan of the wine list, it tends to be mid range in cost but we never seem to get a bottle that I really really like.  

The service is usually spotty and we always have to wait for our table at the bar even though we always have a reservation (which you need).  Despite this, we keep coming back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Sought this place out because it was across the street from my hotel, but was pleasantly surprised by the service and tasty entree.  I'm not a fish person by nature, but after a long day of tasting cheese I wanted a relatively light dinner and ordered their halibut - served over flavorful mashed potatoes with an awesome creamy (but not heavy!) sauce.  The fish was tender, flaky and moist, really nicely done.  

The goat cheesecake dessert was a lovely cheesecake, but unfortunately drowning in a far too sweet cherry sauce.  I wondered if this was to smother the goat cheese flavor in the dessert - but if someone doesn't like goat cheese, maybe they just shouldn't order the GOAT cheesecake?  

The wine was lovely although it cost twice as much as the one I thought we had ordered... either myself or the server was not watching my companion closely enough when he ordered it!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing ambiance. If you are going on a date its perfect and the food is amazing. This may be the best Italian in town and the servers are really personable. I had the eggplant parmesan and it was amazing. It was the best eggplant parmesan that I've had. Also the lighting creates a really romantic feeling. You can also tell that the people that go there are frequent visitors. For a romantic date, this is the place to go. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they don't make the pasta on site."}
{"text":"Classic, slightly kitschy Italian. Good food... although, like any good Italian restaurant, I recommend it as THE event of the night. Don't plan on going out after dinner to bars or dancing... you'll want to slip into a happy food coma instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for at least 12 years. We moved out of Wisconsin 8 years ago and this is the one place we always come back to when we are in town. Service is always good, food is always on point, and the fact that it has stayed consistent for over a decade counts as a win in my book. Definitely a place to go for a small celebration meal, or to eat at the bar when you're craving some yummy italian. Also love that their menu changes seasonally and that they use local farmers when possible."}
{"text":"This is truly my favourite restaurant in town.  Their bread is amazing, everything I've ever had has been delicious, and the cocktails are restrained and classy.  The decor does not do the place justice, but I'm happy they haven't changed it - to me, it keeps the place more humble.  I'd recommend the pizza to anyone - and haven't found it particularly cheesy as another review mentioned.  I have found their hostess and some staff to be a bit snobbish and unhelpful, particularly for a large party holiday dinner.  They refused to give a reservation for a group of 10, which just seems like a poor business practice.  The food makes up for their staff failings."}
{"text":"The bread, despite being cold, was crusty and moist and the olive oil was great.  We shared the Parma ham pizza as an appetizer and the crust was fabulous.  I would have been happy to make that my meal.  Given it was the perfect time of year for corn, I opted for the homemade polenta and vegetables and I was not disappointed.  The sweetness of the corn came through and the vegetables were perfect.  My mother had the Orecchiette pasta with sausage and rapini in a lovely cream sauce flavored with brandy.  I tasted the Bolognese thought it was well seasoned and the meat was very flavorful.  We tried the Cello flight with included lemon, lime and orange and the majority of us voted for the orange followed closely by the lime.  All in all, the dinners were very good and I look forward to returning and trying some of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"After moving from Madison we came back for a visit and went back  to Lombardinos for dinner.  It's always reliable -- food and service.  I had the Tuscan wood fired ribeye.  Outstanding.  The flavor was as good as I've ever had.  A little fatty but then it's a ribeye.  My wife had the seafood pasta and it was also very good.  Parking is a pain now that their old overflow parking lot is now an apartment building but the restaurant was full so it must not bee too much of a hindrance ."}
{"text":"I had always thought the Lombardino had moved away or closed just by looking at the outside of the building.  CityTin made me realize that it's actually open.  So I went there for dinner and was very impressed.   
Atmosphere was casual and charming, although I personally like brighter restaurants.  Food and service were both great.  We had the tomato-mozzarella-basil pizza and it was as good as it gets.   Calamari was very very good although not exceptional.  The Italian wedding soup had excellent flavor, if not a little too salty.  The lowlight of the meal was the rolls which were just so-so.  Overall it's a great place and I highly recommend it.  Make reservations if you can because it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty solid dishes. Recently went with a group of friends and had a try of pizza, eggplant parmesan, steak and all were great. I tend to think their specials are superior to their other items in flavor and quality.  The wine is waaaay too expensive and good but not great. 

Make sure you make a reservation, otherwise you'll be waiting a long time and be met with scowls."}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian in Madison. Always a good place to take family or guests if you don't mind paying the price for good, authentic Italian food. Serving sizes are decent, and the food isn't too heavy. Favors here are just great."}
{"text":"Good service.

Love the eggplant noodle and Fillet~

Definitely will come again for tiramisu and pizza."}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Tuesday night. The food was excellent but a bit pricey. Split the Pizza Lombardino as an appetizer, always great. Had the eggplant pasta dish, and it was very good. The Caesar salad is not to be missed! Service was very good. Parking can be a challenge."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a while, the Eggplant Napoleonata. Great pesto around the edge if the plate, crunchy eggplant with carmelized onions and loads of cheese. Yummy! Quaint atmosphere. The waitress even brought the Caesar salad on three plates for us to share the salad."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Madison. Caesar salad was excellent and the pizzas were superb. As always service was top notch."}
{"text":"Lombardinos is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Don't be thrown by the piratesque decore, the food is outstanding.  I was last there on New Years Eve, and the caprese salad was unbelievable.  I had to keep my dinner companion at bay with a fork to save some for myself.  

Everytime that I have been, the service has been outstanding.  

Don't waste your time on the pizzas.  They are good, but the rest of the menu is filled with beautifully mixed flavors.  I tend to steer clear of the cream-based dishes.  They are fine, but the other dishes have much more flavor to them."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I dined for the first time at Lombardino's last night. Overall the food was excellent but I feel that service could be improved... atleast by our waitress. She never introduced herself so we don't know what her name was, and when my fiancé and I ordered drinks from the bar she walked away and then returned two minutes later asking if we were 21. We both looked at each other and said \"yes\" but the waitress never even asked to see our ID's which I thought was a bit weird considering she came back to ask us that(we were celebrating my fiancé's 25th birthday). After our drinks were brought our waitress exclaimed she would be back with some bread..... and as I sat there and saw literally every other server walk around with a bread basket we never got our bread. It was even more of a frustration  considering it didn't look like she had many other tables and later in the evening I saw her bringing bread to one of her other tables. So please note that this three star rating has more to do with the service rather than the food. I work in the food service industry so I take that aspect of the dining experience very seriously."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this place didn't sell out to the development next door.  Lombardino's  has changed (and improved!) over the years, but retains so much of its classic-Madison character.  I hope that Lombardino's with it's throw-back mural and Trevi fountain replica, stay a neighborhood fixture for  generations to come.  We stopped in Saturday night with friends and were reminded of how much we love this place.  From the starters garnished their fresh pea shoots, to the pasta courses, to perfectly cooked steaks and scallops, we left very satisfied.  Friendly and attentive staff don't hurt either."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Lombardino's.  Nothing would please me more than a place that serves up good, classic homestyle Italian with an occasional modern touch to keep it fresh.  After two visits, it just missed the mark.

I have never had anything bad here, but I have had some remarkably mediocre things and I have never had anything amazing.  And that is really the problem.  I could forgive mediocrity if it is mixed in with the sublime, but Lombardino's never quite manages to really excite my palate.  I recommend Osteria Papavero for Italian in Madison even though it is not trying for old school like Lombardino's."}
{"text":"I just don't get what people like about this place? I've been here a couple times and have never been impressed. I appreciate their attempts at authentic dishes, but they fall short. Service is good, it's just not worth the money. I have no idea how this place got voted best in Madison anything??"}
{"text":"Best Italian in Madison.  Ignore the hater reviews.  Get a reservation if it's a weekend.  Best advice is dine at the bar.  Pizzas  are excellent, calamari and Caesar salad solid.  Top 1% martinis.  Always ask about the specials."}
{"text":"Our group of 8 arrived on time for our reservation.  A party of 3 continued to sit at our table for 45 minutes after they had finished thier meal.  The staff refussed to handle the situation by offering them a drink at the bar, moving them to another table, or even letting US buy them a drink and dessert to move.  Unbelievable.  No customer service skills.  We are well connected business people in the community, and they just burned a very valuable bridge.  Too bad."}
{"text":"First of all, great tap beer selection! Local and other various micro brews with full flavor. Obviously they also have an extensive wine list :)

This place is charming and chic. I loved the wall colors and the tiled art around the bar. I was at Lombardino's on a Friday night without a reservation, so we sat and ate at the bar. The bar tenders were super busy but managed to be friendly and attentive between pours. 

Everyone I was with had pasta and it was all delicious. Very fresh tasting with great sauces. The dishes were unique, yet not so weird that you get sick of it after 3 bites. 

Nice, cozy place. Oh yeah, we also had dessert... yum."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5
Service: 3

We made reservations for Saturday evening to have a nice dinner as a belated, low-key birthday meal.  In full disclosure, we celebrated in stealth mode and didn't let the staff know that there was any specific reason for dinner.  It was just an occasion to try out another restaurant in the city.  Decor is as the other reviewers have already mentioned.

We started with calamari which was good.  This is the first time I've seen the addition of horseradish in the sauce, so it seemed more of a cocktail sauce than marinara.  My fiance ordered the Bucatini Carbonara and I got the Chianti Braised Beef w/ Ravioli.  He thoroughly enjoyed his plate and I politely declined to share any of mine with him.  Luckily we each had some left over so we could afford to let the other taste.  There was no way I was going to leave behind what I was too full to finish, so we took the rest home and the beef/ravioli heated up quite well the next day for lunch. 

The only part of the dinner I did not like was the service.  The hostesses and other waitstaff seemed quite friendly, but our server in particular just was not at all. Not that he was rude, but he seemed very much indifferent to us being there and there were some long delays when we asked for a beverage refill or box for the remaining food despite the fact that he didn't seem to have more than one other table.

Overall, it was a very good meal and dining experience meant to be enjoyed, not rushed through.  We'll just hope for a different server next time we visit."}
{"text":"Awful. We had to ask for everything.  Actually we had to ask another sever to get our server twice so we could get things like water, salt, Parmesan... The spaghetti was undercooked and had barely any sauce so we asked for a bit more and were charged 6$. The waiter had it taken off after we complained but did add the cook was new otherwise he'd dispute that. Wow. Very disappointed overall"}
{"text":"Lombardinos is a good family place to go..Lombardinos service/staff is ok...The food is good though when we ask for crispy pizza they never give us crispy pizza but it is still good!!The Pasta is nothing wowing also the calamari is good...If you want to go to a nice pizza family restaurant u should go to Lombardinos!!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Madison hands down.  Pizzas are amazing as is all the other amazing pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Bring back the original! There pasta is poor to avg, the portions were good but who cares when the food is avg.  Waiter couldnt get it right and came back a few times asking what we wanted. Whats that all about? I miss the Lombardinos in the 70's, 80's and early 90's."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Lombardino's a number of times since I moved to Madison in 1998.  When you enter the restaurant it looks like an old school Midwestern style Sicilian place, but the food transcends.  Tuscan style cuisine with a focus on locally available ingredients, it has never disappointed.  I've heard the original was average but a local favorite.  It's anything but average now and I consider one of the best upscale dining experiences in Madison.  Still a local favorite, reservations are essentail.  Has a nice bar for waiting though."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to celebrating a new job with dinner here.
The food was great but the service was awful. We waited over ten minutes just for our waiter to come to the table. He didn't introduce himself or offer anything (drink/menu specials, etc) but he did make an excuse that it was really busy (on a Tuesday with four empty tables around us). He took our orders and said he'd be back with bread. He took another ten minutes to bring bread and drinks. When we were done eating, he came by to see if we needed a box. When he brought back the check, he left it on the table and ignored us for 20 minutes. We tried flagging him, telling him we were ready  and I finally had to stand up to stop him from ignoring our table again. We watched and listened as he talked to the elderly couple behind us, offering up the specials and explaining dishes to them. He literally ignored our attempts to stop him and several times turned and walked away! 
Really disappointing."}
{"text":"I do dine quite a lot in Madison as I come in often on business. I also did eat a few years ago at Lombardino's. It was noisy, roudy, packed and delicious. Unfortunately, I do have to say that I was not overly impressed on my latest visit. 

The salad was just ok. It was not fresh. The pasta was also just ok, and not at par with the price (dinner was expensive for the decor). Being from NYC, it is unfair to compare the tiramisu, A good effort, yet again, nothing memorable. The waiters were aloof, Maybe too slow of a day, but staff should NEVER be aloof at an italian restaurant. 

My take is that Lombardino's, somewhat of an institution in Madison, needs to choose between becoming a family style or a high end italian. Hard to pull both, particularly being a small venue. Perhaps the surge of restaurants in downtown Madison is taking a toll.  I do long for the ole roudy noisy place with larger, fresher dishes. Maybe I won't care as much about the check then."}
{"text":"Lombardinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  I can't rave enough about the pizzas here.  First of all they are cooked in a wood oven, so the flavor is amazing.  The freshness and quality of the ingredients is always exceptional here as well, it's really Italian done at its best.  The pizza Lombardino is a classic and always satisfying, but really all of the pizza's are amazing.  I shouldn't ignore the bulk of the menu, the regular entrees portion but I think writing too much on it would be pointless as Lombardinos does a great job of changing their menu regularly to match what's in season and offer new options for the scores of regulars which keep the place packed on weekends.  The servers are friendly and helpful, so if you're having a tough time choosing you can ask them for advice, or just do what I do and order a pizza because they are always great."}
{"text":"Every part of the meal was delicious. For appetuzers, we had the warm olives and gorgonzola-stuffed dates with salumi and pea shoots. Then Spaghetti bolognese for an entrée.  Every bite was perfect. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"When we walked in, this restaurant looked like it would be a nice spot. It seemed a little pricey, but based on other reviews, we thought it must be good. Nope.
We shared a caesar salad and a pasta dish--orchetta with rapini and a garlic cream sauce. Both were extremely salty, but had very little other flavor. The garlic cream sauce was both bitter and salty. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I've lived here for this long and have never been to Limbardino's before! Made a reservation for Friday night, arrived about twenty minutes early and entertained ourselves at the bar.  Service was good and friendly, and we were seated within just minutes of our reservation

The menu offers pasta, but it appears that the real stars are their Jordanal pork entrees. I loved my orchiette dish with rapini I also ordered a salad starter, the house salad, and my only complaint is that I prefer to dress it myself. The yummy brandy vinaigrette made up for any disappointment.

Drinks were good, a tad pricey, but they have diet tonic, which is hard to find, except at our house:) so an extra star for that"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. The ambiance is excellent--low lighting, warm colors, and authentic Italian decorations abound. I've read a couple reviews about food saying it was not excellent...I've only been here a couple of times, but both times I was very pleased with the quality and taste. The prices are not cheap, but in my opinion are reasonable for excellent service, ambiance and quality of food.
But...I never have a problem with \"too much\" cheese. ;)"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Lombardino's, three or four years ago, was so-so, and I was a little nervous about going back. But something's changed, because our experience last night was phenomenal. Luckily it's still tomato season, and because Lombardino's changes their offerings throughout the year to use seasonal ingredients, we were able to enjoy the \"tomato menu\". The tomato/onion/basil salad was the best thing I'd eaten all summer. For dinner, I ordered the roasted red pepper cannelloni -- as a vegetarian, this was very close to the best dish I've ordered in Madison yet. The wine was perfect, and the service was prompt -- though not too prompt; we wanted to linger over our meal, and not be rushed through it. It won't take us three more years to come back!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located across the street from the BW Plus Inntowner, I decided to have Italian for dinner. I had a glass of Pinot Grigio (the daily special) with the Framboni pizza. It was quite good, but I could only eat three pieces before I was full. I requested a box for the rest of my pizza and paid the bill. First, I was given the wrong change (a simple mistake). Then, when I opened my leftovers the next day for lunch, I realized I had been given someone else's pizza! Instead of 5 pieces of Framboni, I had 2 pieces of Biaca. The Biaca was pretty tasty as well - I would give the food four stars, but had to knock one off for the service."}
{"text":"Lombardinos - I've been here at least 10 times and the experience is always a win. The menu is standard authentic Italian studded with unique additions, often seasonally inspired, and I love the fact that they have something different to offer every time we visit.  The atmosphere is cozy and warm, the service is unfailingly pleasant and prompt.  I don't think we've ever come away hungry, and yes, it's pricey but it's always worth it. Wood-grilled entrees are my go-to here, while the boyfriend usually gets their orecchiette, which is full of delish Fraboni's sausage.  Calamari is the best in town, and their drinks are made perfectly.  Great place for date night but I also usually recommend it when people have family in town or a dinner business meeting; the dining room never seems to reach that fever pitch that's so common in many places.  Keep on keepin' on, Lombardinos! We'll keep coming in!"}
{"text":"I thought I settled for the closest restaurant because I was exhausted and perhaps having zero expectations made this experience all the better. Background is that my 17 year old daughter and I started in Ohio 4 days ago and have visited 5 colleges since. My husband joined us at Purdue. University of Wisconsin is our last stop before heading home and after being bossed around by a short, spoiled diva for what it felt like 10 years, we were excited for the possibility of a drink. She stayed in the hotel room (thank god) and we walked across the street to a shabby, suspect looking old building with their name on it. It had decent Yelp reviews so that is the only reason we tried it. OMG...sat in the bar at a table that bordered the dining room and started with an old fashioned. Ordered a sausage/arugula pizza to start. Thought I died and went to heaven. Had to reevaluate our menu choices because we were already satisfied. Seasonal soup of pork meatball, white bean, kale, escarole, and tomato was rich and satisfying...want the recipe. I ordered the orachietti with sausage and rapini which was in a cream sauce kissed with brandy. Yum. Ordered a glass of wine with dinner: nice selection, nice pour. We skipped dessert to deliver our piping hot margarita pizza to our sick daughter across the street which she devoured in 10 minutes. Helpful, kind, efficient, knowledgable staff. Completely pleasant experience. Best of our Midwest college tour!"}
{"text":"Lombardinos is getting five stars not because it was one of the finest Italian restaurants I have experienced.  It's getting five stars because Lombardinos meets all expectations with excellence.  Pastas, pizzas, service, cocktails etc. are all wonderful and are at a good price point.  My Caesar salad was done correctly and classic.  The Spaghetti Bolognese was robust, with just the right amount of saucing.  I will admit, I found the Spaghetti and meatballs over sauced, but that's my preference.  Pastas were all done al dente, in the Italian manner. 

Bartenders were engaging and poured Wisconsin true.  Now that I live in Utah, two cocktails at Lombardinos were plenty.  We ordered a pizza to go, and left happy.  Seventeen years ago Lombardinos went through a needed metamorphosis and has become one of Madison's best restaurants.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Lombardinos frequently for many years, and we believe it's the best restaurant in Madison. From the top-notch service, cozy ambiance, and incredible rustic Italian food created by chef Patrick, Lombardino's is not to be missed. I was so thrilled when they agreed to cater my wedding this past summer, and wow, did they deliver. They were so accomodating and worked with us to create a rustic menu with local and seasonal ingredients. Our friends and family still rave about it and the food was totally outstanding. Thank you Lombardinos!"}
{"text":"I always get excited to go here, but I'm never that impressed with the food. It's good, but not great. Nice atmosphere & staff though."}
{"text":"Solid Italian cuisine. Lombardino's is an established place, and they've perfected their dining experience to a large extent. We were thankful we made an online reservation, because the place was poppin' off. 

Our server, Ricky, was fantastic! He was super friendly and prompt with orders, complementary bread, and picking up the check. 

We ordered fried calamari as a starter dish. Lightly breaded with some fresh-squeezed lemon juice made it oh-so-satisfying. My sig other thought their was too much horseradish in the dip, but I didn't mind. 

I ordered the eggplant napolenta as my main, and it's honest to god my favorite take on eggplant parm. They lightly fry it and top with generous amounts of caramelized onion and parmigiana. Place on top of spaghetti, this dish is filling and fabulous. My sig other did a 1/2 order of orecchiette \"little ears\" pasta with Fraboni Italian sausage, broccolini, and creamy garlic sauce. We enjoyed this dish minus the super bitter broccolini. It distracted from the full Italian sausage flavor. He also did a 1/2 order of stracotta with slow cooked beef and rosemary pasta. It was WAY too salty. I know that stracotta is kind of the equivalent to slow-cooker in Italian, but man we could not get past the heavy salt. 

Next time, we'll try a wood fire pizza. Thanks for an overall great date night, lombardinos!"}
{"text":"We were in Madison for the night because we were visiting the MU hospital the next day.... With all the chain restaurants in Madison, We were looking for a low-key, authentic place. This place was such a great choice. 

Very intimate restaurant, we noticed that it was great for family gatherings as well as date nights. We got the whole authentic Italian experience... Our waiter was even Italian!

The food was phenomenal.  I ordered the spaghetti Bolognese which was amazing and my mom ordered the prosciutto pizza with arugula. 

I'm not familiar with the restaurants in Madison... But I can truly say that this place was a gem and an absolute must try!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Madison on business and felt like having sushi, punched the GPS for a place and when I got there I looked at the sushi place, then glanced across the street at this italian joint that looks like its been there for 50 years.

Madision WI, an Italian place that looks like its been there since Eisenhower?!?! Hmmmm

I walked across the street, walked in, the decor was like it looked in 1950 (which the waitress told me is when it was built) beautiful mosaic tile behind the bar, which I am told the original owner brought over from Italy with him.

The decor is kitchy 1950's, nothing has changed. 

but The food is to die for!!!

I am a Brooklyn born Italian, and this is the best italian food I have had in a decade!

I'd like to use one of my NY Expletives but I will just say this is good frickin' food!!

I had for an appetizer, Milk Braised Pork cheeks on local polenta. Let's just say there were too many people in the place so I couldn't lick the plate! The pork was butter soft, the polenta was cooked to perfection!!

for main course I had Meyer Lemon Seafood Linguine

Mussels were the most tender I have ever had, as was the shrimp, how does this guy cook mussels like this?!?!?
This is a dish where too much lemon and it's ruined! not the case here, done again to perfection.

What's sad is I don't live here, but I will be back and I will aspire to try every thing on the menu.

Service was also wonderful, kind, smiling waitress, answered every question I had about the food and the restaurants history.

Summary: Just north of incredible across the board!"}
{"text":"A couple of my most memorable meals in Madison were at Lombardino's, so we had high expectations before a recent return visit. This time it was pleasant,  but the kitchen may be slipping a bit. 

We enjoyed the app of Gorgonzola stuffed dates along with our cocktails. Sour cream ice cream cherry chocolate dessert a winner, too. 

I like the tacky classic decor and ambiance. Considering the  price of the entrees there are many competitive options in town, though."}
{"text":"I am very boring when it comes to my Italian food I prefer. Lombardino's is a little too fancy for my taste. I would have gave it 4 stars but my wife's walleye fillet was full of bones and the spaghetti was not as described and my son was not pleased."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week and it was my first experience here. It's a pretty small, romantic feeling place that's great for dates. The appetizer, pasta, meat, and dessert were all so good. I was very satisfied. I want to come back and try some of their dishes on their regular menu. It's pretty difficult to find parking. It is easier during a snowy winter, but I'm not sure if I even want to try to find parking around there during nicer seasons."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 28th birthday there a few weeks ago.  I haven't ventured into this place since about 1997 when it wasn't the \"upscale dining experience\" it is today.  Although the interior has been cleaned up, they maintained much of it's kitschy-charm.  We had great service and wonderful food.  The calamari was absolutely delicious.  I also fell in love (lust?) with the Wild Mushroom Ragu over Polenta.  It's something I could eat and eat and eat until I died, happy for every last bite.  But be forewarned - this ain't the Olive Garden, endless soup, salad, & breadsticks are not available.  And, it's not a place to bring a \"meat and potatoes only\" crowd.  But we'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here at the restaurant week. A good deal. I'm not a fan of Italian cuisine (except for Italian stone backed pizzas). But it was nice to have three courses in small portions. Forgot all the dish names but u can see the pics I had. Tasty food and ok service. Hard to find parking spot. Nice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service were both very good. The food would be very good if it were not **extremely salty** :("}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was attentive. The clientele was the only drawback on my visit. This is more to do with me than the restaurant. I wanted privacy and intimacy, but the people next to us seemed to want to be part of our dinner experience.

It is a very cozy restaurant and I will definitely go there again. The food was outstanding! I definitely recommend the warm goat cheese salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great first experience here.  We had reservations and upon arriving we were immediately shown to our table.  The service (Michelle) was impeccable, getting the beer and wine we ordered almost immediately on a busy Sat night.  Michelle was on top of it, but allowed us to enjoy our quiet experience.  I would say, and my husband agrees, Lombardinos has the best eggplant parm we have ever had.  I will definitely return, next time inviting friends and family."}
{"text":"Lombardino's is perhaps the best hidden secret of University Avenue's west side. The low lighting and warm interior belies the chipped paint wall mural on the outside of the building.

By a quick glance of the menu, you can tell they like to feature seasonal ingredients, and a quick taste confirms their freshness. Overall, the quality of food was top notch, both carefully arranged and seasoned. My dinner companion and I tried both red and white sangrias, and would recommend them. While a bit pricey for the budget conscious, it's perfect for a low-key but special meal."}
{"text":"So \"kid sister\" loves this place--and it seems like it might be a hot spot on a normal night with a normal server. 

Let me say in advance--I was incredibly full when we arrived, so I had NO appetite. The menu had a great mix of classic, modern, interesting, and well built. It looks like they are super involved in the local food movement--which is cool. I will leave the food at that. Oh yeah--the wines by the glass selection was pretty sweet. 

Now--our server. it was so random. He used his pen to gesture at the menu in a freaky way to see if we had any questions about the menu. The service was wicked slow. He never asked us if we wanted drinks. He took our appetizer away before we were done with it. He tried to take my entree--but I threatened him with my fork (not really, but tempting). 

Anyway--totally weird service."}
{"text":"Really, this is the quintessential family Italian restaurant but with an upscale twist. Prices are higher but so does the ragu involve a long braise of veal and pork, not hamburger. The bartenders are great, drink selection superb. I enjoyed the house salad with a terrific dressing, the terrific bread accompanied by superb olive oil. The best soup is something is expect at home, just what I needed on a cold tired night."}
{"text":"The complex flavors of Lombardinos's dishes leaves one wanting to sit and savor each taste. I highly recommend the Chicken or Orchiette. Get the dessert sampler too!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lombardinos 5 or 6 times over the past two years. We just went again on Wednesday to celebrate my birthday. I had the beef special. As in the past, the beef was nearly perfect. The kids had the bolognese which was very traditional (I lived for a year in Bologna) and tasted great. The seasonal salad was good and the wines interesting. The service is always a little slow and wacky, but we've always had a good time. My wife had the fish special and the herb-potato puree base was delicious but almost too rich to do more than look at. While I love most of the food, the fish reminded me that maybe they sometimes try to push the flavors too far. 

We like the pizza as well, but there are a number of places in town that have high-heat Neapolitan style ovens now. So, that's less of a draw. It's the prices of the entrees that make me wince. We now only go there for special occasions."}
{"text":"Went on a date to Lombardino's. It was my first time coming here and I was impressed by the buzz in the restaurant and the nicely dimmed lights. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. I personally like that. Busy restaurant = must be good! My date made a reservation for 7 o'clock and requested a corner table. Ask and you shall receive. For dinner I ordered the Orcchiette with Fraboni's sausage and rapini. I enjoyed the sauce and the pasta. The best part of the dish was the spicy sausage. However, I did not enjoy the rapini. The \"splash\" of brandy was overwhelming for me. If I order this dish again, I will simply request no brandy. My date ordered the Linguini with clams. There was an abundant amount of clams in his dish and he seemed to enjoy his dinner. We both ordered drinks. I got a Moscow mule (no copper cup), and he ordered a Marker's Mark old fashion (on point). Our server Tad did a great job. He was very proper and polite. I asked for more time to look over the menu and his timing was perfect. I plan on returning here and I look forward to trying the Bolognese. A guy sitting a table away ordered it and it looked great. I do recommend you make a reservation, especially since on a weekday night it seemed busy."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in Madison. Hands down. Always good always packed, so make a reservation. 
The apps, pasta and pizza are always outstanding. Wine selection is great."}
{"text":"Surprised to find such good food inside what looked a bit like Bucca di Beppo's on the outside. Excellent meal here with locally sourced foods. Eating with my family who farm nearby, they were able to agree with the authenticity of the listed farm names. Warm pear salad, bolognese, and panna cotta were all good."}
{"text":"I could write a novel about Lombo's...I have eaten here almost many, many times. I studied at UW. After to moving to Chicago and then Miami, I always eat at Lombardinos when visiting Madison.

The food here is a mix of traditional and what I would call creative/traditional Italian, mostly northern Italian with a few regional inserts. The wine list is immense and the staff is really knowledgable about the menu and the wine list.

Notable: To find a restaurant that changes its menu every 2 to 3 months is a hidden treasure these days.  Its nice to eat with fresh ingredients with dishes that make sense in that season.

Try to eat multiple courses by sharing some items or asking if you can have a half order.  They have always been accomodating to get me a half portion of something that make sense without wasting food.  I like to get (or share) a half salad, a half pasta and a full entree. You should never leave without dessert.  Just eat here, its memorable, tasty and feels like home."}
{"text":"We had a light dinner there on a weeknight and were seated immediately. The atmosphere was dark, warm and romantic; the wall paintings and decor reminded me of the Italian Village in Chicago (http://www.italianvillage-chicago.com/).

We both enjoyed the food--I had the market tomato and goat cheese pizza, and my fiancée had the margherita pizza. The crust was crisp and the food was simple but flavorful."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place. I went in, very excited from the reviews, praise from friends and facade claiming its superior Italian cuisine. 

Upon coming in, making light of the interior, I felt like I stepped into the wrong century, and the guests dining there confirmed that. I think I was the youngest person there. Our waitress was extremely inhospitable and uncomfortable. After finding mold on our starting bread, she told me to just, \"scrape it off.\" Uh, no thanks, I managed to lose my appetite after you heavily examined and breathed on my food. 

The food did not live up to the hype-- I would go to the exhausted Tutto Pasta on State St over this place any day."}
{"text":"What a gem.  You feel like you travel to another place in time.  Excellent service and food.  I had a caesar salad and the cheese ravioli with lamb ragu.  It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  I overheard that it is the oldest restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Omg. Absolutely amazing. Everything from the perfectly cooked and seasoned asparagus milanese to the tender beef filet with veal reduction was unbelievably awesome. The beets, garlic scapes, pea shoots... Everything was impeccable. Couldn't have asked for better service either... Especially since we didn't go there until 930pm. I would give this place 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience at lombardino's. I was seated rather quickly followed by a glass of water... Soon after the waiter introduced himself once he seen I had a moment to glance over the drink menu... Order a glass of rosé, calamari, and the eggplant Napoletana... During my meal I said what the heck and ordered a glass of prosecco.... Dinner was fabulous only gripe was my calamari was a wee bit salty but that didn't stop me from devouring it..."}
{"text":"I have been going to Lombardinos for almost ten years now several times a season and as other places had come and gone their pasta and steaks have never dissapointed.  Regularly changing menu keeps it interesting.  Since the Magnus is not as attractive as it once was this is my go-to place for special occasions and visitors.  

I would suggest the two half portions of pasta to try out one of the standards and whatever the current special is.  The Calamari appetizer is so far better than the standard that I can no longer order it anywhere else without being highly disappointed.  The few times I have had room for a bite the deserts have been great.  Beware, the after dinner infused drinks can lay you out!

I have not been to Italy but the only place in Madison that even comes close to the authentic, quality cuisine at Lombardinos is the Greenbush, and they are more of a quick bite with a drink kind of place."}
{"text":"Having been to Lombo's maybe 100 times, we might expect to be occasionally bored by the fare.  This latest meal, however, once again wowed us.  It was the starters that were a revelation.  The lamb sweetbreads were grilled and served over creamy polenta, garnished with a garlicky dressing and arugula.  The truffled potato soup was rich, balanced and a mouth full of perfect flavor.  The caesar, then the speck and potato pizza were, as usual, perfectly done.  But those starters were a jolt to the senses and some of the many reasons to keep on returning to Madison's most consistent and original restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible food!
The tomato sauce on the pasta tasted as though it haven't even been cooked yet but was just out of a can. My eggplant Parmigiana was inedible and the sauce although different than the one on my daughters pasta was still horrible. My husband's Bolognese sauce, he seemed to enjoy. I was so hungry when we got here I could've eaten a piece of cardboard. This was our only meal of the day and we had worked all day moving first my son from his dorm to his apartment and then my daughter from her old apartment to her new apartment. Even with that said this food, we couldn't eat! Go elsewhere do not waste your time eating here."}
{"text":"This is such a quaint, authentic Italian place!

It was our first time visiting and I had made reservations for a Saturday night based on other reviews. We arrived to a very tiny parking lot (about five/six stalls) and were lucky enough to snag the last space. FYI: The doors do not open until 5:00pm 

We started with the Spring Green Salad which was suggested by our server. This is not your average 'green salad', it is better! Watercress, peas, slivered almonds, goat cheese, and a wine/lemon dressing made this refreshing salad an instant favorite. 

For dinner we had the Orecchiette and Goat Cheese Ravioli. The Orecchiette consisted of pasta, Italian sausage, and rapini. It was so creamy (but not too heavy) and I savored every bite of sausage. The ravioli was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and a more than satisfying portion.  

The only disappointment for me was the menu selection; there aren't enough choices."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about Lombardinos. I have heard good things about it here and there and finally went to dinner there a few weeks ago with two other couples. Honesty, It was terrible. My food wasn't anything I couldn't make myself at home. They don't have a huge selection, I had Spaghetti Bolognese, my Boyfriend had the nightly special and the rest of our group had the eggplant Parmesan. Not one of us particularly enjoyed our meal and the service was just OK, the waitress never introduced herself and was very brief with us. We were seated by the door and there was quite a draft each time a customer would walk in, which wasn't very comforting. I wore my jacket at the dinner table for the night. I would not recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Easily the most consistently best restaurant in town.  Great food. Wood fired grill makes the meat dishes come through. Great wine selection. Inventive specials and a menu that changes with what's seasonal and fresh. Also a great bar scene with talented and funny bartenders and regulars that are much the same."}
{"text":"Neat folky atmosphere.  Hostess said they \"would try\"to fit us in at 4pm..... They did. Food was good and tasted of quality but I expected more flavor. Dessert sampler pannacotta was luscious but the tiramisu and cake were a bit dry.  Would try again but not my first choice for Italian dining."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and both times were bad. My friends have raved about it but I just don't see the allure. I think it's dingy, grimy, and has that old, dirty feeling. The booths were not in great shape...torn seats and such. Some people are into that broken down, 'authentic' atmosphere. Look, I don't want to dine in a sterile surgical suite, but I'd like to be assured that my food won't be seasoned with cobwebs as it's carried through the filthy dining room. And if I'm going to pay this much for dinner, I'd rather not have cracked vinyl rubbing against my ass while I eat. Just sayin'.

The first? time I ate here, I'd made a reservation for me & hubs. We arrived on time. The place was packed. Our table wasn't ready. We stood around awkwardly near the windows trying not to loom over other diners (because there's NO place to wait if the bar is full and it was a cold winter evening). Then another couple walks in and the hostess GIVES AWAY OUR TABLE!!! So now we're waiting even longer...maybe 45 minutes WHEN I MADE A RESERVATION. I didn't make a scene but I told them this was BS. They gave us each a free glass of wine for the inconvenience. Dinner was okay. I had a seafood pasta dish that okay but it didn't blow me away. I think it tasted better than it really was because I WAS SO FREAKING HUNGRY. Hubs felt the same about his entree. We split a cannoli and I remember thinking that it tasted like the oil it was fried in was rancid. I have never had a cannoli that I didn't like until I had theirs.

Hoping that this bad experience was a fluke, I didn't completely write them off.

We came back a couple years later and this time they did NOT give away our table! We tried the calamari?. It was disappointing. Honestly, the only place in Madison who does a great calamari? is Murimoto at Hilldale. Hubs had the special; a gnocchi made in-house. I had a pasta dish with fried eggplant. Hubs liked his food but mine had a LOT of oil in it. I mean a LOT, like they must've literally thrown my fried eggplant into the bowl directly out of the fryer soaking wet,? because it wasn't even good olive oil pooling at the bottom of my bowl. It was the cheap vegetable oil you would fry something in. I've been cooking for 35 years so I know the difference. Luckily the oil pooled to the bottom of the bowl, but I was full after a few bites because of the calamari? and bread. I knew I could fix my entree if I took it home and drained the oil, then added some more veggies and pasta. I asked the server for a box. He said he'd take care of that for me. Then he took my dish and THREW MY FOOD AWAY.

I just paid $16 for that, asshole! I only ate 3 BITES!!! Why would you throw it away??? And NO, I don't want dessert. I want the dish I just paid $16 for! But I'm not going to complain because if you make me another one to-go you'll probably spit in my food.

Look--I tried. Twice. I'm SO done with this crappy, dirty restaurant where the staff is so inattentive that they give away reserved tables, drown your food in cooking oil, and throw away what you paid for. The cuisine is so hit-or-miss. It is a sad little restaurant coasting on nostalgia. It relies on its clientele overlooking the fact that it needs a good interior power-washing from head to toe. I'm sure that's why they keep the lights so dim...so you don't see the dust or the stains on the carpet.

As to the high ratings, I think this is what happens when a business was something special back in the 80's and the older patrons don't want to admit that it's gone down the toilet because #nostalgia. Nostalgia makes everything taste better...like your mom's Velveeta mac n cheese vs one made with a 10-year aged cheddar.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well...I'm never coming back here again. There are too many other delicious options in Madison to waste my time and money here.

The wine list was good."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here for my wife's birthday last night. The server was attentive but not intrusive, and the noise level was fine. Everything was great, but I would especially recommend the seasonal specials for the best, freshest flavors!"}
{"text":"I've tried their pasta and, more recently, their pizza, and both were very unremarkable, which has been quite disappointing considering what I had heard from others. The pizza in particular seemed bland and tiresome."}
{"text":"This is a cute homemade Italian food joint that's a bit on he nicer side. The atmosphere is welcoming. When I called they quoted me a long wait, but their ended up being a two top in the bar area so I was able to sit right away. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice dinner or date spot because it does get pricey with food and drinks. They have a nice wine menu and a colorful menu. I got an eggplant dish which was excellent and I ended up taking home half of it."}
{"text":"Lombardino's is a terrific restaurant and their attention to detail really shows. I had the Insalata Caprese (with fresh, local tomatoes and delicious prosciutto). The ham on the salad wasn't exactly authentic, but it still tasted great. 

For my main course, I had the Tuscan fired fillet - also great and served with local vegetables. I suppose the price ($38) was a bit steep for such a small portion. 

For dessert, I had the tiramisu, also really fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, Lombardino's espresso machine was broken, so I couldn't enjoy local Collectivo coffee with my dessert.

They have a reasonable wine list and the service is very good (keep in mind they're only open for dinner)."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian food. Especially love their salads and breads. Never been disappointed with any dish they've served. Nice atmosphere and wonderful staff. One of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I had scheduled a reservation for 8:15, didn't get seated until 8:30... I sat at a table with my partner another half-hour without ever being greeted. I decided to take my business elsewhere. As a Madison native I have always wanted to check this place out. Won't be back any time soon..."}
{"text":"Food was decent. I know Madisonians have a bit of sticker shock on the prices, but I wasn't too phased - the portions seemed pretty large. I enjoyed a pizza which was flavorful though a little doughy around the edges for my tastes. Nicely dressed salad. Best of all? An expert Negroni. Wine selection was a bit shallow as I recall, so had to tough it out with a Barolo. Funky old interior, a bit cramped, but hearing conversation at the table was never a problem. I'd go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian spots in Madison. The atmosphere is very intimate so it's a perfect place for a date. The service is very good. Last time we waited ten minutes past our reservation time and they apologized and gave us an order of fried calamari on the house. Since then, we've always order the fried calamari with our dinner when we go as it is very delicious! However, the pricing is quite on the expensive side while the portions don't quite match it."}
{"text":"This is still my favorite restaurant ever!  We recently went to Chicago and ate at places like The Girl and the Goat and Acanto and guess what?  Although the food at both places was delicious, Lombo's remains better in my book.  Lombo's continues to serve food that is the best in Madison.  And don't forget about the best drink in town...the orangecello martini.  Brad, the bartender, knows his stuff as well.  I have a love affair with Lombo's and I'm proud of it."}
{"text":"I've always heard mixed reviews about Lombardinos, but after a few trips myself, I've figured out the secret: don't go into this thinking that you're going to get a standard Italian-Fettucini-Alfredo meal.  The pasta is so-so, bordering on bad.  The rest of the menu, from the steak to the seafood to other random things, is absolutely fantastic.  The portions are large and satisfying and there is a good, yet reasonably priced, beer and wine menu to accompany anything.  The service is about average, but the lack of attention lets the dark, quiet atmosphere take over and creates a very intimate and enjoyable experience.  Save room for dessert because the berry panacotta is a great end to a very filling meal."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant - one of my faves in Madison. Quaint, romantic Italian restaurant in near west side near the hospital. Good for couples and smallish groups. Absolute favorite dish: Eggplant Napoletana. Eggplant is lightly battered with delicious Carmelites onions, paired with a wonderfully complementary tomato sauce spaghetti. So delicious!! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Was there on Halloween and all the staff was in costume ."}
{"text":"If you are searching for some good Italian or a sweet date spot, Lombardinos is it! Darkly dimmed dining areas filled with laughter and exceptional customer service.

You usually have to call and make a reservation, but I found that coming around 6 and heading to the bar for a table has worked best for me. Thankfully each time I have come there has been a separate table by the bar open with no wait time.

Their bruschetta is to die for! Great calamari. I have ordered their steak, which by far was one of the best I have had dining out in Madison, their lasagna is great, roasted beet salad is amazing, and if you like seafood their seafood tagliatelle is delicious.

I really like the table set up and dimmed lighting, it def sets the mood to enjoy others company and lay off the bright cell phone in hand. Enjoy, you cannot go wrong with their menu."}
{"text":"Been here three times so far and the most recent visit was the best yet. We had the roasted octopus opener. Perfectly done tentacles, not rubbery, with a very flavorful tomato sauce with chickpeas. It was a perfectly Mediterranean dish--could have been southern French or Spanish, in good way. Wife and I shared a fig/pork jowl pizza. Gorgonzola completed the three flavors of the pie, all strong but balanced. Good balance of crisp and chewy on the pizza. Shared the scallops with parsnip and mushrooms and a side of roasted broccoli. Perfectly seared scallops, tasty wine reduction, mushrooms with good bite to them. The broccoli was a good accompaniment, drizzled with a bright red sauce, I think it was like a roasted red pepper cream, or something. With a touch of hot pepper. 

We both had the nightly special by-the-glass bianco. Crisp and dry. We usually don't go all out but this night each had a dessert and cappuccino. She had the butterscotch and salted caramel thing while I had the bocca nera, a flourless chocolate cake. Both were really good and tasted and felt fresh.

The service was friendly and competent. There was one gap in attention, nothing serious--the restaurant is really too small for guests to be forgotten about. I don't say this often about pricey meals out because it is reasonable to be nitpicky when paying $50-60/person or more, but we had a basically flawless dinner."}
{"text":"Like everyone has said, the vintage atmosphere gives a romantic and relax evening. They also have a unique and wide drinks menu.

The bread, despite being cold, had a moist and chewy texture, which reminded me of Hungarian cheese bread. The olive oil was high grade--it was green with a strong flavor of the fruit. We started off with calamari, which was fried just right with fresh graded horseradish and marinara.  We had Pappadelle w/duck ragu and Orecchiette w/Fraboni's sausage & rapini. The pasta were fantastic in the sense that the flavors were well-balanced instead of being over-powered by cream and saltiness. If you're used to Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden or Red Lobster, you may find this bland.

You can taste the wine and the spices in the sauces. The flavors are subtle but distinct and mix well with each other."}
{"text":"Although I've dined at Lombardino's before and it's probably a three-or-four star meal, I need to give two stars due to the poor service I received on a return visit. I called for reservations a few weeks ago, and the restaurant's voicemail instructed me to call back during business hours or leave a voicemail. I called back a few times during business hours, but still did not connect with an actual person, so I left a voicemail requesting a reservation. I did not receive a call back. I showed up in person several hours later and asked what the wait would be for my party. The host, upon hearing my name, said she had received my voicemail but forgot to call me back. She said there was no way they could seat me until almost 10 PM - four hours later! That was unacceptable to me and my group and I went elsewhere.

I totally understand that mistakes happen, and I would have been okay if there had been some attempt to squeeze us in or accommodate us in some way. But the attitude was \"sorry\" and that was basically it. I would have been fine waiting 10 or so minutes while they tried to figure out if some type of dinner arrangements could be made - but it was pretty much, \"you're out of luck.\" I was pretty disappointed because I enjoyed my last experience at Lombardino's, but I don't know if I'll go back due to the poor service I received.

P.S. I should have just used OpenTable :-)"}
{"text":"Cozy, casual, fun, affordable, good quality food.

When they fire on all cylinders you'll receive calamari without a hint of grease, wonderfully nuanced (and homemade) al dente pasta, often served with fresh seafood. 

Brick-oven pizzas are very fairly priced and are among the best in town. The watercress and goat cheese pizza last year was a creative and unusual standout. 

Avoid their bolognese, which is too greasy, bacon-y, and salty. If you're looking for pasta with a ton of ground meat in it you'll enjoy the dish, but I found it to be a mediocre rendition without requisite mirepoix flavoring. A one-note plate.

A recent special of puttenesca with shrimp and cod was outasite good, as good as any pasta dish I've ever had. 

Cannoli is sub-average, mix drinks aren't spectacular but are quite strong; they had a terrific homemade 'hard' iced-tea-lemonade in years past that the drink menu misses.

They're not redefining the meaning of Italian food but they do great pasta and breads and it's always busy and happening here. One of the best places in town for a date before a movie."}
{"text":"Um, I'm a little disappointed this wasn't as good as the reviews said. Maybe it was an off night?

We started off dinner with the fried calamari appetizer. I like to drown mine in lemon and then soak it with the marinara. This tasted so good we thought it was gonna kick off dinner with a bang.

Not. 

J had the Spaghetti Alla Bolognese--I chose this for him and he gave me the stink eye when it didn't come out as expected. It came out as a mountain of pasta that looked really delicious topped with the parmigiano-reggiano cheese. But all we could taste was the cheese! So overwhelming that it left a bad after taste. I mean, I LOVE cheese--but come on.

I ordered the Orecchiette With Frabonis Sausage & Rapini--again, it looked so creamy and tasty when it came out. I was really excited about the abundance of sausages in the dish. Sadly, it was way too salty. I tried to mix it well to disperse the salty flavor but I think that made it worse. The cream was really good though--too bad the rest of the dish made me feel so thirsty.

We were both so dissatisfied with our meals that we only took about 3-4 bites of our dish. Our server, Kristin (I think? She was great throughout the night, btw), was kind enough to offer us other entrees to order but we declined. Not sure when we'll be coming back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Don't be turned away by the gaudy interior. The food here is exceptional. My husband and I go here for all of our special events (birthdays, Valentine's Day, etc). I love Italian food and this place is one of the best in town. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went there at 5:30 as party of 3. There were 5 people in restaurant with at least 15 empty tables but we were told we couldn't be seated until 7:00. We asked but there was not a party booked for the night. Obviously they are doing so well they don't need more customers."}
{"text":"Lois no longer works here, but I hear the food is still good...."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first Lombardino's experience!  I liked that the atmosphere is dark-grotto-retro-Italian-restaurant-y, but still managed to be classy.  

I had a glass of chianti and one of their specials, a seafood risotto.  The risotto sauce was stunning.  It had lemon and mint in it alongside peas and chunks of tomato.  Also included were shrimp, mussels and scallops.  I've always hated mussels, so was hesitant about this dish...but the mussels were truly the best I've ever had.  They didn't taste brackish like they've always tended to at restaurants in Wisconsin.  My boyfriend had a tomato-based sauce with eggplant and mozzarella di bufala.  He was nonplussed by the dish, but I really thought it was fantastic--the sauce was complex with a nice, spicy bite to it.  He had a glass of fruity syrah, which was also good.  We rounded off dinner with a piece of chocolate espresso semi-freddo, which was accompanied by creme anglaise and three huge, tart raspberries.  Heaven.

The service was friendly and attentive (but not too much so), and the ambience was romantic.  Other than that the entrees are a bit too small for how expensive they are, I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey and I am Italian.  This place is great, end of story.  As far as the parking? Park a few blocks away and walk, it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. Whenever I get the choice of where to eat I pick Lombardinos. I have never been disappointed with any of the food and the waitstaff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the food and wine. We have ordered the bruschetta (rich and flavorful), eggplant parm, orecchiette with fabroni's sausage and rapini  (this is a white cream sauce with brandy, very surprising and rich), and the chicken which my boyfriend says Gordon Ramsey would approve of."}
{"text":"GREAT Italian Food. GREAT Service. 
Location Ok - street parking and if you are lucky one of a few spots behind the restaurant. OK when the kids are not in school - plenty of street parking.
Ambiance Ok - seems a little dated, which some might find charming. Very dark in the restaurant.

A decent specialized menu to order from. You can get half orders of pasta for one dish if you want to try two! YUM!!

I got half Orecchiette with Frabroni's Sausage and Rapini and half order of the Eggplant Napoletana - Both were perfect portions and perfectly prepared and presented (see dark photo) Notable, the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the eggplant was crispy and juicy. The sausage had a nice mild flavor..not too much fennel seed flavor which is FINE with me. Not a fan of the fennel seed.

The calamari was delicious - crispy and tender, not chewy. Devoured by all.

No room for dessert. I would love to go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I'm going to sum up every review that's been written about Lombardino's: it's ridiculously good. 

If you're looking for a place for a romantic dinner date with great food, knowledgeable service, and a cozy atmosphere, this is it. 

For those (like me) who aren't very fancy, here's how to get the most out of your Lombardino's experience: 

1) Make a reservation via Open Table (or call). This isn't a snooty place, but it is small and there's no real waiting area. Make a reservation and you'll be fine.

2) Look nice but don't overdo it. Nobody there is in an evening gown. But they also aren't wearing sweat pants.

3) Order a bottle of wine. If you like reds, my suggestion is the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo. You'll thank me.

4) Order an appetizer. My suggestion is the Antipasta Misti, essentially a meat and cheese tray with toasted bread and a pear spread. 

5) Order pasta. The pizza is good but the pasta is fantastic. Ask your server what they recommend, they know their stuff. You can order half of one pasta and half of another. 

6) Order dessert. You can't go wrong with cannoli or tiramisu. 

7) Take your time. It's not weird for dinner to take 2-3 hours. 

For a party of 4 (and we ordered everything from wine to dessert), our bill was about $130. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends to catch up after a long semester. My first impression when I got in here was that the decorations were pretty cool, and the whole atmosphere was very cozy and intimate -- a great place to take someone on a date. 

We started off with calamari for appetizers, which was good and had nice and crispy batter but was a bit on the salty side. As for the main dish, I had the spaghetti bolognese and my friend had the rabbit ragout. I thought the spaghetti was alright. It was satisfying and it was cooked correctly, but I was just not into the flavors. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing. I also tried my friend's rabbit dish and that was definitely interesting. Rabbit is very richly flavored and a little tangy. I think that dish was probably better. 

Overall, I thought the atmosphere was great and the service was good, but the food was just okay."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week and will be coming back again! 

The food was simply amazing. I got a shrimp and muscles appetizer. This cost $5 extra (they have the option for sub in courses for a bit extra), but it was worth the price. Really pretty and the creamy garlic sauce made the dish. I asked for extra bread so I could eat more of it!

For dinner, I got a Parmesan crusted chicken with a basil pesto. The chicken was cooked perfectly so that it was nice and juicy. 

For dessert, I ordered a pan a cotta. It was good, but I'm a chocolate gal so not my favorite. 

My biggest complaint would be the spacing between tables - the next table was only a foot away or so. Also, parking was challenging but we found parking in a small lot up the street. 

Overall, great experience. It's a cozy place with unique decorations. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Out of this world.

Several years ago this was a dark and dank hole that served a poor excuse of American versions of Italian food.

Today they use fresh, local, seasonal ingredients to make true Italian cuisines.  Service is pleasant.  Desserts are worth the wait (especially warm chocolate cake).  Will continue to return here."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison for 10 years and never went. Returned for a conference and my group chose Lombardinos. I am glad they did! 
I had the \"little ears\" pasta. I think it is orecchiette pasta with spinach and sausage. Very yummy although the touch of brandy was \"stuck\" in the spinach and I got a mouthful. 
I also ordered the olive appetizer and enjoyed it very much. Everyone enjoyed their meals! And our waitress was awesome and funny!"}
{"text":"Summary: Certainly worth a try again, an absolutely hit on one dish, a slight miss on another. Pricey, but worth it for a special occasion. 

Went to Lombardino's last night with a group of 6 and had a great time. The best dish goes to the pumpkin with walnut risotto that my friend ate. I tried a bite and it was absolute heaven. I got the orecchiette pasta with sausage and a garlic cream sauce. I thought that it was good, but it was far too thick and creamy. Don't get me wrong, usually I love thick and creamy sauces, but this one just went over board. I think the problem was that they over cheesed it on top, which then blended into the sauce to create an overly thick sauce. 

The wait staff was very attentive and the presentation was great. I would certainly take someone here again, but probably only for a special occasion. It was a bit pricey on my salary (entrees about 20 dollars) but certainly worth a trip at some point."}
{"text":"Really fun old world \"east coast\" Italian restaurant food. 

Okay - before I go any further - the food was fantastic. 

Now for the story . . . my co-woker and I needed a place for a late night meal. To plan our talk for a conference the next day. We arrived at 8 pm and were greeted with a less then welcoming hello from the host. She instructed us that the restaurant was full and there were \"no openings\" (odd - because I saw a few empty tables throughout our 3-hours in the bar area). She gestured toward the bar and said it was open seating. Not exactly a great first start to our experience. 

Boy am I glad we stayed. The bar tender, who also became our server, was awesome. He helped to drive us around the menu. Made great recommendations for food and drinks and was very friendly. Exactly what I had hoped for in coming to Lombardinos (based on a referral from a super foodie buddy).

We had a mix of dishes - of course starting with the calamari and moving to a fantastic green bean salad. I had the goat ragu over homemade ravioli - wow. While my co-woker had the scallops over fresh vegetables - also delicious, Really great American-Itallian food (yes - you read that right - Lombardinos is not a purest, old-world Italian restaurant. It is more like an old-world American-Italian restaurant). The plates reminded me a lot of the sort of places we went when I was a kid with my Italian grandfather.

The atmosphere is a real kick-in-the-pants. Its dark and a bit of knick-knack overload; but, it works. It really works. The low slung ceilings and miss-mash of soft hued primary colored walls - make the place feel a bit like a set from a 1950's film. Add to the mix fantastic food and delightful drinks and Lombardinos offers a very enjoyable meal.

Go - you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is downtown and still manages to have a parking lot, so THAT'S awesome. They had a lot of Italy-themed decor, which walks the line between quaint and overdone. Our waitress was kind. She told us \"I'm running on your schedule\" which was especially noteworthy, as they were closing in 40 minutes. However, she seemed a bit annoyed that we didn't order any fancy drinks or dessert. She also wasn't the one refilling our drinks or checking on us half the time, so that was confusing. Oh, and the place is super dimly lit - to the point where I was almost uncomfortable eating my food as I could barely see it. 

Their menu was full of delicious sounding dishes. They rotate dishes in and out based on season. When we visited, they had the \"tomato menu\" which seemed to source local organic tomatoes. I ordered goat cheese ravioli, which came topped with tomato sauce and pecorino cheese. The flavors were delicious. The dish could have used more variety in terms of texture. The goat cheese was soft, and the pasta was overcooked so overall the dish was mushy."}
{"text":"We have been going to Lombardinos for over ten years and it is consistently the best restaurant in Madison.  They have an awesome base menu which does not change supplemented by a rotating seasonal menu.  The food is always incredible from appetizers to desserts.  The staff are friendly and knowledgable.  

You will feel comfortable here whether dressed for a special occasion or stopping in for a more casual dinner.  Reservations are a good idea.  

Overall, I love that they have fantastic food without the pretension of many of the places on the Capitol Square."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Madison, hands down.  

Bar is better than the dining room.  Service is professional (which is unusual in this town).  

Pizza is a little known gem. 

Food is outstanding, unique and very well done.  Menu changes.  Wine list is reasonable and well curated.  

My only complaint is that its an older crowd and clears out early."}
{"text":"I ended up here on a Wednesday night when realizing that planning to dine downtown during Concerts on the Square is pretty much impossible if you are going by car. My friend wanted Italian, so we headed back to Lombardino's. 

The place was packed, but there was room by the bar at the small cocktail tables. Not exactly the most ambiance, but we were hungry and were too busy catching up to even care.

We both got a glass of white sangria, which was average. I ordered the Chicken Under a Brick, and a Caesar salad(which our server recommended). The salad was nothing special. Too much cheese, although the croutons were good(but when is toasty, fat laden bread bad?). The chicken was crispy and the polenta was creamy. Good combo, but nothing wowed me. My friend had the spaghetti, and didn't even comment on it. Not sure if that's good or bad. 

Maybe I'm just picky, but given the price tag of the night, I think I'd try another location before coming here again."}
{"text":"Always a culinary experience to dine at Lombardinos!  Best eggplant in town.  We went for our Girl's Night Out Christmas Party and it was impossible to make a bad meal choice--from pizza to pasta to dessert.  Already looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"On of the best Italian places me and my hubby ever had a pleasure dining at. 
Returned for my birthday! All the guests were as impressed as we were!"}
{"text":"Classic Italian spot that's been a fixture in Madison for a long time.  We decided to go there based in the strong Yelp ratings.

This was my first visit after hearing about it for some time. Overall I felt the atmosphere was quaint in a classic sort of way and while the service was very good (based in part on my usual \"water\" test-they kept the water glasses full) the food left me a little flat.

We ordered the \"classic\" cesear to start but asked them to leave off the olive tapenade and hard boiled egg (neither of which are part of a classic cesear), and it was very good-just enough dressing and a little bit of zing. Their house Italian bread and olive oil was also a nice accompaniment.  Unfortunately, Our entrees were nothing to write home about. I had the spaghetti bolignese and my spouse the squash ravioli. My pasta was luke warm and the sauce was just ok in terms of flavor. My wife's ravioli (a dish she orders whenever she finds it on the menu) lacked the character and flavor found at some of the other spots she's had it. Overall I'd have to say this is just ok-very Americanized Italian food and nothing special.

This is one of the few times when I feel the overall rating in Yelp is overstated."}
{"text":"I like Lombardino's. I do not always like everything they have, though.

Lombardino's is a sensible restaurant near the UW campus that uses fresh ingredients and changes their menu seasonally--if you come in at different points in the year, you will not be able to find the same dish you fell in love with a month or two ago, potentially.

I've been here three times and it's pretty solid, but not always a home run. The best thing I've had here was a White Sangria (May) and a spinach pizza (October). Their Red Sangrias aren't slouchy, but they don't taste as fantastic as they could--they lack a little bit and it shows up in taste.

The desserts I've only had once, but what I had was amazing. This place is great for upscale, but affordable dining."}
{"text":"I have never had Italian as good as I did when I went to Lombardino's. We had a reservation for six people at 9pm, and we called at 6pm because the party size shrank to four, but we unfortunately couldn't move the reservation up, most likely because they were booked as it was a Saturday night. We showed up at 8:30pm and were seated immediately. Our server was a little awkward but he checked back numerous times to make sure everything was great. The four of us ordered different things (two pizzas and two pasta dishes) and shared, so we each tried a few things on the menu. We stayed away from some of the seafood and beef tenderloin types of options because they were considerably more expensive. I personally started with the spaghetti alla bolognese, and the moment I began eating it I was taken aback as I had never had spaghetti anywhere near that tasty! The other pasta dish and both pizzas were both excellent as well. The wine was priced about the same as any other restaurant similar to this one. The alcohol menu had quite a few wines and cocktails available, so there were many options depending on what food you ordered. Can't wait to come back here and explore the menu some more!"}
{"text":"When I saw the outdated exterior and decor of this restaurant, I was a bit worried. Once my entree arrived, I understood why this place is a Madison institution. I ordered a primavera pasta with seasonal vegetables (spinach, artichoke hearts, broccoli etc), and I cannot express how good the sauce was. It was a lemon cream sauce but it wasn't heavy, just light and tangy and acidic and the best. For the quality of the food, it was pretty inexpensive (although I'm from chicago where prices are outrageous). 

I am taking a star off for the decor and the Caesar salad, which was authentic with the egg and anchovy, but overdressed in my opinion. It also had this dark mystery dressing in addition to the traditional Caesar - we could not figure out what it was. All in all though this place was great and I would definitely come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great Service- I had a great server that was very attentive without being intrusive.
Adorable decor- very Midwestern Italian campy (that's a style right?).
Very homey- tables are numerous and close together. Take the time to say hi to your neighbor stranger!

Okay, let's talk about the food.
Meh... Although I was not very adventurous on this visit.
What I tried:
Brussels sprout salad- lovely, lots of crunch, generous toppings and a tasty vinaigrette.

Butternut squash soup- very thick and hearty. About what you would expect.

Spaghetti alla Bolognese- it's spaghetti with meat sauce. My dad could make this (context: my father is a nice man, but a pretty awful cook. I love him very much).

Winter linguine with clams and mussels- I'm going to say it... almost as good as the Olive Garden (there are a few unclassy things in life that I like and Olive Garden is one of them)

Pizza with wild mushrooms and lardo- great thin crust, tons of cheese. Mushrooms were flavorful. Biggest disappointment, lardo is not Italian for bacon. Rookie mistake. Lardo is fat back. When the pizza came out, I just thought it was cheese that hadn't quite melted. Nope! Although the texture was not off putting and was pretty flavorless, knowing I was eating strips of plain pork fat gave me the heebee jeebees. How is this different from eating a strip of bacon you may ask? The all-important hunks of cured meat dispersed in the fat, that's how.

Tiramisu- good, the whipped cream was over whipped so was greasy, not a huge portion. I recommend not sharing, unless you like passive aggressive fighting with loved ones. Another alternative is hitting up a grocery store for Haagen-Dazs's Tiramisu gelato, which is amazing, or the Tiramisu at the bakery counter at Metcalfs (1/2 the price, 4x as big, and 90% as good)."}
{"text":"Small, cozy, intimate non-chain restaurant right next of University Avenue, close to University Hospital. Great place for family gathering that offer Italian food. The staff was extremely helpful and really nice while accommodating some people with food allergies.
The food was great, not particularly a fan of eggplant I did try the eggplant napolitana because it just read well on the menu. And I have to admit it was excellent, cooked to perfection and very yummy. I was able to bring left overs home and had it the next day, still great."}
{"text":"Saturday. Make sure you have reservations. We needed up sitting at the bar for dinner. It was so busy with only one person behind the bar who was catching up on table orders; we ended up waiting a good 5 minutes before we were greeted, asked if we were eating at the bar or waiting for a table. Not his fault; the other bartender was in the back stuffing blue cheese into olives. They seriously need to consider a 3rd person behind the bar. 

Appetizer | Calamari 
Delicious, crispy, and filling. Plenty of lemon. Great tomato sauce but too much horseradish plopped in the middle of the sauce.

Dinner Entrée | Orrichette
The sauce on this pasta dish was incredible in the first two bites. A white creamy sauce with perfectly cooked pasta. The sausage was plentiful. I really didn't like the rapini in the pasta. It was a bitter bite each time so I left the rest to the side. I loved the way the dish started but then it didn't go so well. Each bite got saltier for some odd reason. I needed to take a sip of water after each bite unfortunately. 

The 4 stars is for ambiance, service and calamari. I was so pleased at first with the orrichette but then became disappointed. 

Note | They had a separate special menu and was out of the lamb ragu. Hopefully they have it next time. 

Parking | street parking because their lot is limited."}
{"text":"Ambience could have been a little more pleasing.  The restaurant itself is a little cramped but the food does make up for it. The Bolognese pasta dish was authentic and had a great flavor to it. Calamari was a small portion and needed seasoning but nice touch with the horseradish. Ribeye was nicely cooked to medium as requested just a little charred on the sides."}
{"text":"Wow.

Just got back from Lombardino's.  I arrived with my date and we were promptly seated at a bar table.  Our waiter, Matt, appeared and greeted us.  Apparently he had some sort of prior relationship with the person I was with.  No big deal - I'm here for the food.

I ordered drinks and an appetizer, as well as their signature pizza.  I hate arugula so I ordered it without.  

After taking our orders I never saw our waiter again.  I sat with an empty glass for 15-20 minutes while he sat milling around the bar, occasionally making drinks.  When my pizza finally came, it arrived with EXTRA arugula.  I sent it back and waited some more, still receiving zero attention from our waiter.  Finally I pulled aside another waitress and told her to get the check.  Immediately thereafter the correct pizza arrived, which I sent back.  The waiter who spent half the night doing nothing came over and asked if anything was wrong.  I told him we wanted the check and we were leaving.  He was a smug asshole the entire time, going so far as to box up the pizza and depart with a snarky \"Take it or leave it we don't care.\"
 

This guy either sucks at his job or he was carrying his personal life into the workplace.  Totally unprofessional.  It's unfortunate, because I believe the reviews when they say the food here is delicious, but I will never dine here again."}
{"text":"A Madison institution I always wanted to try. Finally ate there tonight and really wanted to love it but it was just ok. I won't go back. 

The atmosphere was excellent old school Italian. The bread and olive oil were outstanding.  

The meatball appetizer, mushroom polenta and horseradish beef ravioli were meh.  The feature pudding desert was equivalent to Applebee's."}
{"text":"May be my favorite place in Madison. Great ambiance -- not pretentious, homey, but with a hint of irony. The food is top notch, and Bennet is the best bartender I've ever encountered, anywhere. And I'm a lush, so that's saying a lot. ;-)    Few places in Madison can match the food, and none have its combination of friendliness, service, quality and relaxed ambiance."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. We visit here for special event like BD etc. this time, as almost every visit, the food was very good. 
We both order the soup of the day ( asparagus) which was very very good. We had couple appetizers and main course, and tiramisu at the end. 
HOWEVER: as we start getting our food, a big group come in and our waitress serve them as well. Since they were about 12.......he didn't have time for us at all!!!  
No mater what, and also other waitresses were available, we had zero service!  So food is 5 stars but with this level of service - sport - but you get only 3 stars."}
{"text":"Don't reserve your table online. Tried today, received a confirmation email, and got to the restaurant only to be told it would be another 2.5 hrs. Apparently the online system doesn't sync with their in house system. If your going to have online reservations it needs to work with your in house systems. Pretty disappointed and eating at home now as every place in town is booked up!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place while looking for a place to get some good italian food in Madison. It was SO GOOD. I ordered the veal garganelli and for dessert, the apple doughnuts. These aren't things i would typically gravitate towards but wow, such good flavors! This chef really knows what he/she is doing. Go to Lombardino's! Order these two things! :)"}
{"text":"\"Exquisite\" is a word that comes to mind. Since our first time here during last summer's restaurant week, which was just wonderful, we've been eagerly anticipating eating here for Winter's restaurant week. I'm not normally a fan of apples or dried fruits. I downright hate them. I will not buy them at the grocery store unless someone in my family requests them. However, Lombardino's has managed to turn two fruits I hate into a magical eating experience. To start our dining event, we chose the Winter Fruit Antipasti, which is a soppressata salami and gorgonzola cheese with marinated apple, pear, dried fig, and apricot salad. Marinated in what syrupy sauce, I have no clue, but it was beautiful and delicious.  For the entree, my fiance chose the Marsala Mushrooms and Spinach Pasta and I chose the Milk-Braised Jordandal Farm Pork Shoulder. We had no clue pasta could taste that wonderful! And my meal just melted in my mouth...literally. I've never had a meal that has done that.  The pork was cooked just right and the polenta with the pork braising jus was just so meltingly creamy. For dessert. we couldn't make up our minds and ordered all three - the Pistachio Cake, the Bocca Nera, and Lombardino's Tiramisu (they gave us the third dessert free of charge because our reservation was late and we weren't horrible and impatient about it.) The Pistachio Cake came with sour cream ice cream and a cherry compote. I never would have though sour cream ice cream could be a thing, much less a delicious thing. Eat all three together (cake, ice cream, and cherry compote) and you've got a delicious mixture. I enjoyed the Bocca Nera, but the chocolate was a bit too rich for me. Their tiramisu was just divine.. 

Last, but certainly not least, our server was wonderful. Chelsea has a sincere and cheery smile that was just heart-warming."}
{"text":"Felt like I was in an Italian restaurant immediately by the the welcome by the gracious hostess, and immediate seating. Obviously well trained, she seated incoming patrons around the restaurant instead of stacked on top of each other, to insure diners could relax and converse. We immediately had water, and we're greeted by our waiter, without question one of the most professional I have had. The menu was true Italian, no reheated Servo food here. Price point is \"date night\", yet not special occasion, and reasonable, portions fair. Service attentive, friendly, European. Great coffee. My companion liked his pork chops, I was taken aback by the ragu in the beef and bacon stew with horseradish tavioli. The dessert menu had something for everybody, instead of \"just cheesecake\" and Tira misuse that has sat too long. Now, I won't have to miss the wonderful Italian restaurants of the East side of Milwaukee. Tell Nonna I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in town! I come here for the pasta and pasta only. It's so hard to find a restaurant in Madison that properly seasons and cooks the pasta, but Lombardino's got it down to an art. The flavor and texture of each individual noodle in perfect, and they're so creative with the broths and sauces in top. Great seasonal menu featuring locally sourced ingredients. This is my go-to spot for showcasing Madison's culinary scene to any out of town visitors. 

You can bring your kids too as the restaurant is reasonably noisy."}
{"text":"Review your bill. The Stuzzichino Menu from 5pm-6pm offers special lower prices, but an unexpected higher total on my bill caught my attention. I checked the charges and found the discount was omitted. I was told I ordered at 6:11pm, which was after the 5-6pm discount timeframe. I checked my watch and it was 6:15 and I sat with bill in hand. I asked how I ordered at 6:11 if the current time was 6:15 and my meal was finished. I was told it was a glitch. The server then told me she fixed it so it was ok. No apology. Maybe it was just an error.  

Also, as I entered, I was offered the regular menu and told the discounted menu was just a dollar difference, but I compared menus and that was not true, either. 

The Caesar was good. The pizza with figs, Gorgonzola and hog jowl was good when I took the figs off. My palate isn't that sophisticated, I guess. 

Other than the issues mentioned, the experience was pretty pleasant."}
{"text":"Had the calamari & pizza lombardino. Calamari was not up to par. Coating was not crispy and dipping sauce was so basic and lacking in flavor... Would've been good at least with a mayo based with garlic and lemon. But the pizza lombardino was ultimate disappointment. It was a waste of arugula when the entire pizza was drowning in grease... Probably didn't take in to consideration the cheese would produce additional grease...? The crust was delicious. Sadly, did not even take leftovers. Dessert moscato- marchesi di gresy 2012 was delicious. So there's the two stars. It's overrated."}
{"text":"A very nice gem in the Madison area.  Had the Family with me and we were looking at colleges (UWM).  We got very hungry, and I liked the reviews at Lombardino's.  So off we went and let me tell you, knowing Italian food as I do, Chicago and all, This place is worth the stop for authentic Italian cuisine. Family all ordered what they wanted, I started out with a very nice Montepulciano Vino. Ordered the Grilled Calamari. Some ordered Lasagna, Pasta dishes with Veal Parmagiana.  Service, Ambience, attention to detail was very good.  Worth a stop.  Ciao & Cheers!"}
{"text":"Lombardino dinner with good companies was a welcoming scene at the end of a cold, rainy Wednesday (in April, sigh).

This place makes me feel so relaxed (get the table #4 - end booth in the brick section). The wine they had on special was so delicious, and the our server was so pleasant and attentive. I like old-school service and atmosphere in restaurants, so this was very well-suited for me. 

On to the food. Appetizer calamari was good. I can't claim that it's the best - I prefer higher ratio of calamari to breading, but the seasoning was good.
Pasta dishes vegetarian Pappadelle and eggplant/tomato spaghetti was good as well. Again, not out of the world fabulous, but deserving of 3-4 stars. 

3 of us shared a desert plate - my favorite was sour-cream ice cream. That was 5 star yummy.
Yep, I broke all my vegan rules, but it was worth it. Expanding horizon is always fun."}
{"text":"Consistent. Nice wine list. A little too cutesy in the decor, but the best Itailian place in Madison. The spag Bolognesse is just about a perfect dish."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.

Good food. Not trying too hard. Just good. This is what I love about Madison.

We started off with the pork belly. And while I'd love to say this is what nabbed me, it was the polenta. The creamy polenta, flavorful cabbage and crunchy pork belly blended together well. I could have eaten this as a meal in itself.

We then split a pizza and an entree. For starters, you can do a half and half pizza! What a great option for those indecisive people out there who read into a menu too much. (pointing a finger at myself). We tried the barbecued octopus pizza, which was tasty, (but I'm always iffy about sweet and spicy) as well as the mushroom, Frabroni's sausage and fontina pizza. The latter won us over, but is for a mushroom lovers.  What I should be mentioned is it's cooked to a beautiful, crunchy perfection in their wood-burning oven, Neapolitan style. In my opinion, the best way. I have had pizza here before and it made my tastebuds happy that it is consistently this delicious.

We finished off with the pan seared sea scallops. Four large, perfectly crisp scallops served on top of surprisingly light mashed potatoes. I found myself full but taking little bites of the potatoes and tarragon-short rib reduction just because it was delicious.

I should also note, we were both guided toward perfect wine choices through their knowledgeable staff. Much appreciated.

I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place, so we went here for my girlfriend's birthday.  It was the first night of their new menu, so the only real problems I had should be taken lightly since they're works in progress.

Reservation was listed as it should have been, and we were sat almost immediately.  Our server was there to get our drink order (a bottle of Syrah Blend...Cusumano I believe) quickly, and she explained the specials.  We ordered, got our bread allotment, and was off to a smooth start.  The wine was very good by the way.

The food was hit and miss, but again, this was their first night with the new menu.  We split a caesar salad, which was tasty and what I'd think of as a normal portion AFTER being split between the two of us (which they did in the kitchen).  The only problem I had was that the pumpkin ravioli tasted like pumpkin pie ravioli.  WAY too sweet, which made me wonder if they had tasted this version lately (a previous version was apparently even sweeter).  The Fraboni Sausage pasta dish was good, but didn't jump off the plate or anything...probably a good thing : )  Seriously though, it was a solid dish.  The best dish, by far, was the Hereford Filet.  We inquired as to where it was from, and I guess it's not sourced locally.  Regardless, it was perfectly cooked--medium rare--and the accompanying mushrooms, onions and sauce were delicious.

We were honest about all of this with the server, who received our commentary well when we were asked how everything was.  She also noted how the kitchen liked the constructive feedback since it was the first night with the new menu, etc.  Even if that's not true, it was nice to feel heard.

We didn't do dessert, as we have another local place that we like to frequent for that.  The desserts on the menu looked ok though, for whatever that's worth.

I think that 4 stars is definitely within reach for me here, but 3 fits this experience well.  It was \"A-Ok\".  I will definitely come back here again.  The ambiance is nice, it's quiet for a larger restaurant, and everyone knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorites in madison. The bolognese is fantastic. I've been here at least 25 times and have never had a bad experience. Service is knowledgable and polite."}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent pizza, terrific calamari, outstanding specials, great wine list sll in an authentic retro setting.  Best bagguettes in Madison.  (For take out at $3 each if you want a take home treat.)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice seasonal menu with variety of pasta/meat options. Food had nice flavor and pasta was perfectly al dente. On the pricey side for the quality of food though"}
{"text":"First of all, our waitress was very nice. But, it took forever to get our wine, once we ordered it. The bread and dipping oil was awesome! Delicious!
Then, our waitress gave us the wrong food items.  SO, we just switched them except not realizing just how hot the soup bowl was! WOW!    
The actual meal was good.  Very tasty!  Then, we sat and waited for a long time for dessert.  They were busy.  We understand how that can go.
Then, I requested a box to go for my leftovers. Well, our waitress wrote down the the name of my dinner on the box, but, it wasn't my dinner inside the box. Have no idea whose it was.  Gross. It wasn't even close to anything anyone of us ordered at our table. Needless to say, I threw mine out.  More attention to detail is what is needed. Sad to throw out a lot of a meal, especially for what the prices were. Atmosphere was fun!  We had never been there before.  But, I have to say for what they charge, as many issues as we had, we won't be back anytime soon, if at all.  Very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, Lombardino's is one of the best restaurants in Madison in terms of taste and value. I've eaten at Lombardino's about 25 times in the last three years and the food has been consistently excellent. 

The menu is a combination of seasonal and signature dishes. The food sublimely combines authentic italian cuisine and techniques with inventive seasonal flavors. The portions are satisfying without being overwhelming.

I highly recommend the caprese appetizer, beef carpaccio appetizer, eggplant capanata appetizer, ORECCHIETTE Pasta with FRABONI'S SAUSAGE & RAPINI dinner entree...

I could go on and on but all you really need to know is that this place rocks Balls!"}
{"text":"I end up going to Lombardino's semi-often. It's a bit of a mix between old-school and chef-y Italian. Think longstanding old-school Italian restaurant building, with modern chef-ed up menu. 

They do a good job on the fried calamari but FYI that's horseradish in the marinara *not* parmesan cheese. I dunno what's up with midwest Italian places adding horseradish to the calamari equation. I once went to a place near Lake Geneva that gave COCKTAIL SAUCE instead of marina. That was quite a surprise. 

Most recent couple visits have been solid. This last time I had the horseradish beef ravioli and my wife had the marsala mushroom tagliatelle. Generally the pasta dishes here are not overwhelmingly large but I appreciate being able to try a few things over the course of dinner. My dish, I know it's horseradish ravioli, and I get the idea they were going for, kind of a steak sandwich with horseradish cream sauce in ravioli form, but it was a bit horseradish-forward. I still enjoyed it but I think to be truly memorable I'd prefer a more savory ravioli with a *hint* of horseradish and some other bright flavor to balance out the beef. 

I appreciate their pizzas and changing up the menu, good to share as an app sometimes as long as you're willing to commit to a carb heavy dinner. Which is fine, occasionally. 

Overall, I've always left a Lombardino's feeling happy, although I have to remind myself it's not always the cheapest, and sometimes we're like, \"oh hey let's go get dinner somewhere, oh hey Lombardino's, cool,\" and next thing you know by the time you have apps, entrees, drinks & split a dessert it's $125 after tip for a dinner for two. Which is fine for the quality of food you get but for some reason in my mind I think of it as more casual of a place and forget that in a way, it's a \"special occasion\" type dinner.

Pro tip: if you can't get a reservation, you may be able to chill in the bar area for a bit then camp out on a couple stools and have a nice meal. The decor in there with the tile is nice to look at."}
{"text":"Mrs. T and I went here for our anniversary awhile back and we definitely will be back to mark other special occasions because -- holy cow -- these guys are amazing.

We had both ordered off of the seasonal menu because everything on it sounded amazing.

I had a braised pork and housemade mascarpone ravioli in a white sauce. The pork had its own strong flavor, it was well balanced with the smooth and light sweet of the mascarpone, and it was a symphony of flavor when you added the sauce.

Alas I can't remember what my wife had for her entree but she got stuffed kalamata olives as an appetizer and at the time she claimed she could've just eaten several more of those appetizers and walked out a happy woman.

Big on flavor -- Lombardinos is a couple of steps above your regular italian fare in Madison."}
{"text":"A gem of Madison. Great food and pizza. My personal favorite is the orecchiette with local cream sauce and sausage.

I benchmark calamari across the world against their fried calamari. Often this Wisconsin joint wins."}
{"text":"Without question the best and most consistent food in Madison. When I read these reviews I'm consistently amazed by Madison's preference for style or perceived \"coolness\" over substance and taste. This place is amazing! My wife and I enjoyed or anniversary there last night and decided to go small plates...braised pork cheeks over polenta, the best calamari anywhere, pizza Lombardino (prosciutto and arugula), and a half order of house made pappardelle with truffled mushrooms....all were amazing, not to mention wonderful desserts grilled ginger cake with homemade pumpkin ice cream and a caramelized banana and nutella crepe. I've probably been there 10 times and have love it everytime. Please throw out any misconceptions of this being traditional old school Italian. The food is creative and tastes incredible!"}
{"text":"Had an early (5pm) dinner with a friend here last night.  Good service, good food.  My friend LOVED it and can't wait to go back.  I wouldn't rush back anytime soon, but I'd have no problem eating here again either.  Here are some of the highlights:

- Bread & olive oil were just OK.  Bread was cold. There was no salt or pepper on table to season the oil.

- Calamari was a pretty large portion, but overbreaded and underseasoned.

- Eggplant Napoletana was a huge portion and delicious. Linguini picchi pacchi had a good ratio of seafood to pasta.

- Panna cotta was delicious and came with lots of fruit.  Chocolate espresso budino was thick and rich, but had a gritty texture (I'm assuming from the espresso) and the hazelnut cookie crisp was cold and not so crispy.

- Nice wine and cocktail list.

- Server was friendly, efficient, and helpful.

Even at 5pm the place was packed, and we were the youngest people there by at least 20 years.  Closer to 7 when we left the median age was dropping, and the place was still jumping."}
{"text":"I had an amazing dinner here! It was an experience more than just food with fresh tasting local ingredients and an amazingly crafted cocktail. The wood fired trout was the most amazing piece of fish I've had in my entire life! Would also highly recommend their dessert. We tried several and were in bliss! The service was good and the ambiance felt like Venice."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food. I travel across the country eating at high end restaurants. I've also lived in Italy for 6 months. Lombardino's was excellent. Spending money here makes sense."}
{"text":"Yum! Went here on a Sunday night, and it was delicious. We got seated immediately which was great, and the servers were very friendly and accommodating. The food was rich and delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have visited this place countless times over the years and can tell you it's a solid establishment due to the consistently well prepared food and drink. Lombardino's also tends to hire folks whom are well poised, not bubbly or perky. Simply an observation, perhaps it's more of an affect due to the the low lighting and small dining room. Most nights you'll need reservations. They produce seasonally unique dining menus and nightly specials. This is a pricey place, so just be aware you'll drop some dough. However, they let you order 1/2 portions of any of their pastas so you can eat less, or if you're like me you can just eat more than one kind of pasta! 
Cons: their dirty martinis tend to taste garlicky. Not my thing. 
Pros: wide variety of foods, always been good, consistently. Allow for 1/2 orders on all their pastas!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled if you remember a run of the mill italian place from your childhood.  Ownership change 10ish years ago put lombardinos amongst the best in Madison."}
{"text":"We stopped in due to the fact that it was right across the street from our hotel. What a nice surprise. We had the mushroom tagliatelle, pasta bolagnaise , calamari veal. All were very nice, our waiter, Kurt was very helpful in helping us decide."}
{"text":"I wish the olive oil and bread wasn't cold. Otherwise it was quality.
Seats are pretty tight; would hate to be overweight in this case.
Food was pretty good. Would like to go back again to try something else."}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous, from the yummy appetizer to the end dessert. Great wait staff."}
{"text":"I blame myself. My expectations were high. Not sure why, but they were.

I found no fault, per se, in any of the dishes we ordered, yet I wasn't blown away. I didn't have that eager-for-the-next-bite kinda feeling that I always hope for; everything just seemed average.

As usual, our party ordered an appetizer of calamari to enjoy alongside the complimentary bread and olive oil. No complaints. Though I didn't dig into either too much.


As far as entrees, we ordered:

*Butter pasta and parmesan

*Wood-grilled paprika sausage and octopus w. red potatoes, chickpeas, swiss chard, san marzano tomato, and saffron aioli

*Chicken milanese of parmesan and breadcrumb chicken w. salsa verde and fried egg, served on polenta

*Orechiette with fraboni's sausage and rapini w. roasted garlic-steeped cream and a splash of brandy

*8oz cider brined pork loin chop w. yukon golds, seared escarole, grilled lemon & tuscan olive oil 


Of everything that we ordered, what most stands out for me as enjoyable was the pork loin chop. I was able to try a few bites and quite enjoyed the dish. 

So I wouldn't rule this place out right away. I plan on giving it another try, as some other dish may pleasantly surprise me."}
{"text":"Eaten here multiple times. Amazing, dim lit, warm, classy environment. There Cesar salad is always a great start, and there specials and seasonal pastas are my go to. Every entree I've had has given me chills."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant in Madison.  Last night had the lamb ragu with linguini- excellent!!!  Pizza Lombardino is always a winner."}
{"text":"I love Lombardino's.  The food is not authentic Italian.  Rather it is Italian that has taken on a Midwestern twist.  Which is fine, but you just need to go in with that attitude.  The interior is romantic and charming.  The food can be a little on the heavy side.  Sometimes a little too rich with a tad too much cream and too much cheese.  Still solid overall."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Lombardinos....I want to like you so bad...but! Ok turn up the lights! Starting with having to use the flashlights on our phones to see the menu should have tipped us off! When you can't see your food at all it's really too dark especially when you start wondering what the dark gloppy stuff is on your plate ! Five of us dined last night with a whopping $355 bill before tip and the waitstaff couldn't have been less engaged- doing their job but so dis-interested in our dining experience and ill-informed it was laughable! \"Oh gosh I forgot what was in the special again\" the scallop dish used small scallops three to be exact instead of the proper size #10s for a dinner entree at $29... the red peas?? Huh??? Were hard and raw and tasteless and the roast parsnips hard, we couldn't see what else was in the dish but all three of us left it at the bottom after we ate the tasty scallops- I was pleasantly surprised when I was told I could do two 1/2 entrees and got to try the rabbit ragu and ravioli (delicious) and my old favorite eggplant parmesan napoleon (tasty but you're not cooking your eggplant enough as it's hard and raw in the middle!) when posed with appetizers suggestions to share for five we settled on calamari and the bruschetta after I asked the waitress to add to the order so there were enough for all of us she presented two plates with two pieces of bread on each and a knife! What??!?! Salads were tasty and fresh- not sure if we misunderstood how the ice cream dessert was supposed to be ordered but when the five tiny single scoops of salted caramel ice cream arrived we'd wished we'd have ordered more! Is that really how it's served? A golf ball scoop per person or were we supposed to order the three scoop dessert and mix the flavors...again- stepford waitress and her giggly explanation left us wanting more of the delicious ice cream but by then she was no where in site- our reservation was at 7pm and we were the last guests in an empty ghost town of an aging Italian restaurant at 9pm! Will come back again probably but would really like to be wowed like the old days! At close to $450 including tip (two bottles of wine) things should have been stellar and visible!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp extremely average $32 for pasta bolognaise a Caesar salad and a small glass of Chianti for $17 I figured the pasta would be homemade nope out of a box I asked if the Caesar salad was traditionally made since it was a laCarte I was told yes I ordered it one minute later the very average pre-made Caesar salad appeared I'm from Chicago so I know Italian this is a step above olive garden"}
{"text":"We went for dinner, and just loved it.  I had 1/2 ORECCHIETTE with FRABONI'S SAUSAGE & RAPINI, and 1/2 SPICY SAUSAGE & CLAMS, and hubby had WOOD GRILLED PAPRIKA SAUSAGE & OCTOPUS.  Both of us loved our dishes.  The sausage and clams have a very nice fire to them.  Get's ya sweating just a bit.  The Orecchiette was just plain delicious.  I would order both again.  I love the fact that they will let you do 1/2 & 1/2 orders of pasta!  Hubby loved his Octopus.  Said the sausage wasn't anything special tho.
For dessert, we had the Brioche french toast, and hubby had a chocolate pot de creme.  Both were quite good.
We will be going back."}
{"text":"Not much to add. An older established Italian restaurant on the west-side. Not snooty. No need to be all dressed up but OK if you wanted to make it special.  Excellent food. Service was great. The Spring lamb ragu on pasta was rich and wonderful. The fresh white anchovy pizza was exceptional. I paired it with an Italian pinot noir/cab blend.  Perfect!  S.U. had seared scallops on a beef ragu on bacalao (salt-cod) mashed potatoes. Wow! 

We're only in town for a few days but I'll try to make it back for another pie."}
