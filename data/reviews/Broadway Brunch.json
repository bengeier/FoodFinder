{"text":"Fantastic all around, GREAT food, good people and a cozy atmosphere. Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"Great little resteraunt. Awesome food, friendly staff, fast service and great prices. Try the mixed grill - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere feels like an old school diner. Everyone is always so friendly even the other customers. The food is delish...I drive 25 miles one way to eat here and it's worth the trip every time!!"}
{"text":"Is the best restaurant in McKees Rocks and maybe in Pittsburgh so if you're looking for a good restaurant okay prices and good food then Broadway brunch is your place to be"}
{"text":"I declare Broadway Brunch is now... one of my favorite spots for breakfast!! Ample off street parking nearby, welcoming d√©cor inside ( I love the hometown \"rocks\" prints on the wall), seat yourself and not a moment later greeted with a friendly smile.  I decided on the \"extra\" special, which is 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, home fries or hash browns and 1 pancake which was huge!  The pancake was really delicious and so fresh but too big for me. I couldn't finish it.  Everything was great but the bacon could have been more crispy as requested.    I love that mancinis bread is offered on the menu... being from the rocks.. that's always a bonus to me. I dont feel the quality of the food was similar to a \"greasy spoon\" type place .. I thought it was better than that.  What a good vibe at this restaurant. The food and service was excellent I will no doubt be visiting again very soon!  Thanks Broadway Brunch!"}
{"text":"It seems every time I eat here the food is even more disgusting than the previous visit. The product quality is terrible. You can taste how cheap everything is. First they switch their sausage supplier, which is a fellow small business within the community for garbage crumble. Now they've changed their already declining home fries to these cheap mini potatoes. Which were served to me practically raw. It's an absolute shame that the owner lives with himself knowing what a scam that place has become since he purchased it. They need to work with some soul in their."}
{"text":"Very quaint! Stopped here for lunch while traveling for work, and I felt like I was in a diner in the 1950s. Had a grilled cheese and fries - the food was good and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Broadway Brunch and we were NOT disappointed! I found them on Yelp and read the reviews and thought we should give it a go. Everything was delicious, and I'm a very picky eater. The coffee was wonderful and my eggs were just right. I can't tell you the last time I ordered eggs over medium and actually GOT eggs over medium. No burned crusty edges or anything! And the bacon, oh the bacon, It was perfect! This place is a gem and I can't wait to bring my mom and sister here next time they visit. The owners RJ and Kelly were super nice and even came to check on us to make sure everything was good. They are also in the process of remodeling to give it more of a 50's feel. If you're looking for a great little homey feeling diner with great food and affordable prices, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food at a reasonable price!  The cheeseburger was as big as my head and delicious and the onion rings were just as good.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and quick to refill drinks. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my weakness and thus place does it. Country fried steak and eggs with biscuits and sausage gravy, filling and great! Waitresses and all staff are friendly. Owner is always around chatting it up with all the visitors. He is a chef and it's obvious that he loves his job and restaurant.  It's a shame the area of McKeesport that this place is in our it would most likely get more visitors. Hopefully this post may help because it is a great place for lunch and breakfast."}
{"text":"Holy breakfast burrito!  Huge! And amazing! Not to mention the staff is incredibly nice :)"}
{"text":"I'm new to Pittsburgh so I wanted to try out all the local spots first and let me tell you... This spot is definitely worth a try! It's a cute diner with a lot of local charm. The prices are awesome and the food is even better! I had the cinnamon raisin french toast with the home fries and a coffee. All of it was really good. I'm not a complainer but I'm picky and honestly...I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I highly recommend you stop by and give it a try! You can thank me later. ;)"}
{"text":"My dad grew up in McKees Rocks so whenever we are back visiting relatives we stop at Mancini's. This is right down the street and we have never stopped here. What a pleasant surprise for The Rocks. Great breakfast specials, mixed grill was superb and of course they serve Mancini's which makes the best French toast."}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic atmosphere... friendliest owners ever!! The VIKING'S Breakfast though WOW!!!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Service, food, charm...all-in-one place! Home cooking...you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Last 3 times I have been here haven't been good.  Raisin toast was dry and stale.  Potatoes were cold. Service was good. I gave it a 5 star before.   But I won't be back.  Too much inconsistencies."}
{"text":"Marges is tucked away in the delightful Pittsburgh neighborhood of Mckees Rocks. This place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950's, and half my grandmas kitchen.  The seating room is accommodation, the service prompt and courteous.The prices are fantastic and so is the food.  I had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents, I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.  My friend had a succulent, buttery French Toast. Simple, but they nailed it.  I would return."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once and that's enough.   The atmosphere is cozy, the wait staff friendly and fast and the prices were reasonable.  Unfortunately the food wasn't very good. I was served over cooked eggs with raw bacon and the biscuits were stale.  I don't know if there was an inexperinced cook or just bad luck, but bad food is bad food."}
{"text":"On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.    Inside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).    One random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.    Not only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong."}
{"text":"Found this place on a Sunday looking for breakfast.   The food was fantastic and you get you get a decent sized portion.    Very inexpensive for what you are getting.  I've been back since my initial visit and the food was just as good.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great small town breakfast spot Highly recommend George's Mixed Grill ... Delicious"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years but the new owner makes a world of difference.  Great bargain and better breakfast. You can't go wrong with straightforward good food made well. In an area known for great basics these guys get it right.  Take a trip to Stowe hunry."}
{"text":"Service is always great and the food is like mom made. It's a greasy spoon type of place, but I love it. Prices are great and you leave FULL! Give it a try"}
{"text":"Need a great breakfast? With amazing bread? This great place is a diner With its simple design of old photos on the wall  Plus a old fashion counter to sit at I came for breakfast  Friendly waitress was there instantly with a hot cup of really good coffee The menu has the usual egg offerings omelets n such  What stands out is you can get Mancini bread toasted or French toast  Yes the bread is that good  Easy parking on the street  Great diner"}
{"text":"Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger/Cheese/Bacon w/ fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes....were huge!"}
{"text":"Great service! Unbelievable food!!!  I had the Kelly Special, a little bit of everything   and everything, absolutely everything, was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite. New name (Broadway brunch), but the same great food. Good coffee.quick service, friendly waitstaff. Good home cooked foots at reasonable prices. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, so lock your car doors.    Local foods ( Mancinis toast, Riccis sausage). Atmosphere is loud, smokey and a bit greasy, but the delicious food is worth it.  You can't beat Marges place for a great deal. 2 eggs cooked to order, the best home fries I know of, crisp hickory bacon, Rocco's sausage, hot buttered Mancinis toast and vanilla French toast...$6.99  I hope it never changes by going upscale or healthy ( organic, vegan etc).   Parking meters are 10 cents an hour."}
{"text":"The true test of a great breakfast place is its ability to produce the perfect over medium egg, the whites cooked through and the yokes, unbroken, warm and runny. Many places have either produced broken or rock hard yokes (over hard) or runny whites (over easy) in their attempts to create an over medium egg, but Broadway Brunch completely nailed it! I'm so glad I found this little breakfast treasure trove and look forward to visiting again on my next trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A must visit classic diner with great service, food and coffee! Lovely family owned and operated business. Love the story behind the business that the owner was proud to relay."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and fast (our waitress practically ran to the coffee pot when she saw our mugs were empty). We ordered breakfast: a ham and cheese omelet for me and poached eggs for my wife. The omelet was a nice size and actually had the ham and cheese mixed within the egg which is always a plus. My only complaint would be he Mancini Italian was the home style, and not the wide, full-sized Italian. It's a shame because they are only a couple blocks from the Mancini bakery."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for breakfast and lunch!!! It's a small diner with 50s-esque decor, and the best servers in town. The food is awesome...no matter what you get. We usually do breakfast-great omelettes, sauage gravy, home fries (amazing,) pancakes...even the toast is delicious. The burgers and wraps are fantastic too. What we love the most is the service. If \"We Treat You Like Family\" wasn't already trademarked by Olive Garden, these guys would own it. The servers are so damn friendly! Even if you're not seated in their section, they will still come over and top off your coffee, and give you a cold refill. My husband and I walk in and they already have our drink orders on the way (maybe we go here too often...) Definitely recommend this place. Eat here!!"}
{"text":"I loved this little place! You can't go wrong with anything you order. I love the family feel and the look. This is a true spot that you can be treated like a local and be joked around with as if they know you even if it's your first time. You might be asking well it's a breakfast place why would I give it five stars? Because they do it right!"}
