{"text":"Great new Mr. Hero! Super clean, friendly workers and not mention amazing sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Decent, hot sandwich for a good value but the wait time is about 15 minutes to get your order.  Much slower than other places. That the minus. Plusses: hot food, good sandwich, clean store and amenities, friendly service, well designed, plenty of parking.  6-10 bucks out the door. Area is dicey so go for lunch but stay away after dark."}
{"text":"I came in to pick up some sandwiches for the homeless men and women I take care of. I usually make them myself but, I'm having a pretty tough week.

I went in and ordered a few meals. The order wasn't much. You should have seen how excited my guys were. 

The restaurant itself was clean and the staff was wicked friendly. 

The people I help were extremely grateful for the delicious food. 

I'll definitely be back. Thanks for the speedy service."}
