{"text":"This place is absolutely the BEST!! You will not encounter one thing I their many that is not good. Their teriyaki sauce is to die for. I mean everything is delicious! They are all so friendly, fast service and they make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best, most authentic, Chinese food since we lived in Beijing. We frequesnt Big Heng so much that they started buying our favorite sodas (at the grocery store) to have cold & on hand for when we're there (about once a month)! THAT is Customer Service!! Egg Drop Soup, House Fried Rice and Lo Mein, Orange Chicken, Beef & Broccoil are A-Mazing!"}
{"text":"They portion size was very little the food wasnt that good and the lady was kind of rude."}
{"text":"Awful! That's the only word I have to describe the food. My brother and I came in and both wanted lemon chicken. He ordered first and then me, they then suggested we not order the same entree? So I had to change my order. I ended up ordering the chicken broccoli dinner plate. When The food arrived, I saw why they suggested to change my order. They were out of the chicken. The lemon chicken looked like breaded chicken patties you get in the frozen food section that was cut up into squares. I've been here before with friends and the lemon chicken never looked/tasted this horrible. The food was not even hot, it was barely warm. My broccoli chicken was chewy. Never ending. It was cold as well. My brother was furious. I barely ate a small section and I always finish food. We boxed up our order and left.. I tried to get my brother to tip at least the minimum but he was so furious about the food that he signed his signature and left.  I will never eat here again. We usually eat at Yan's on 91st Ave & Thomas but wanted to venture out. Big mistake. We are going back to our usual awesome little gem.  Sorry Big Heng, you served us nasty scraps and you know it."}
{"text":"Very good, even after it sitting out for an hour when I got home from work..... Will def order from there again!"}
{"text":"If you like Chinese cuisne and don't have a ton of money to spend, this is the place for you! 
The friendly staff keeps the drinks filled and the food is fresh and yummy, dispite the old, tired look of the place. Great lunch specials with egg roll! 

If you are thinking of fast food and want to spend $5 on lunch . . . be smart and give yourself a giant upgrade for the same cash, . .  head to Big Heng"}
{"text":"Our new hot spot for cheap, good Chinese lunch specials.

Good portions of food all for about $5. Dinners are a few dollars more.

Nice and clean and friendly / attentive ."}
{"text":"This place was fast, cheap, and had great-tasting food in HUGE proportions!  

I gave it 5 starts based on the food and the service.  

The decor left something to be desired, it was clean, but old and uninteresting.  However, the price was so good, I overlooked it!

We ordered the Crab Puffs Appetizer and Egg Rolls, Szechuan Beef, and Dinner Combo of S&S Pork and Lo Mein.  They brought us Egg Drop soup on the house.  The crab puffs were great!  The beef could have been spicier, but I'll know to ask for it next time.  

If you're looking for great Chinese carry-out, or a quick dinner for two (or ten), this is your place!"}
{"text":"Best chinese place I have had in the valley


I have been eating here for years. The waiters are very nice. They often know many of the customers by name. They always remember our drink order and food order. They are very quick on refills etc. The food portions are huge.

Dont let the looks fool you. Yes it does look like a dump. Its been there like 20 years... give them a break :) Try it out"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try, since seeing Big heng has great reviews. But in all honesty we were nowhere near pleased, and it saddens me to say I will never go back. We ordered Pot stickers, House Lomein, cup of Hot sour soup, Kung Pao 3 with steamed rice. The Pot stickers are weirdly steamed then stir fried to add the black burn marks around em, quite chewy. My cup of hot sour soup came to me with chips already placed in it, which I found to be odd, and what surprised me more was when I decided to dig in, no pork, no piece of shrimp. Just tofu, juice, and chips. No sour, no spice. I like to eat my chips on the side so they do not get soggy but I didn't send the soup back. The House Lomein was dark, it had a salty burnt taste which upset my boyfriend, he just packed up the noodles didn't bother to take another bite. Now for the Kung Pao 3, that was the only entree we liked. It was a bit salty but I got pass that by drinking it down with a lovely Dr.pepper, which that was a plus. Other than that, I was not to pleased. I suppose this place is not for us."}
{"text":"Have not had a bad meal here yet. Dine in or carry out, Big Heng is the best Chinese food in AZ!"}
{"text":"Ugh...finally I always complain when I'm dragged to this place..too much gross food for such a lil price...people you must not be stuck in a lil world of big hen..venture out .."}
{"text":"Let's keep it simple. It's really good! Get the Mongolian beef and any lo mein. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I ordered egg rolls, sweet and sour soup, and the main course of sweet & sour chicken with white rice.  All was good but i thought the chicken felt more like eating beef jerky."}
{"text":"Just like the other reviews fast, cheap, and good! Outside looks a little shady but great deal!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and everyone I took with me loved it. Great food and service with reasonable prices. Something important to me was that they always rated very high with their health inspections. However, the last few years they've gone seriously downhill and consistently rate very low with their health inspections. I no longer eat here. I continue to check their health inspections as I hope they'll turn things around and once again be a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Better than Dragon Island! You will not find better crab puffs. This IS the best place you can find for inexpensive Chinese food. Great on price, even better on flavor. Will be back time and time again. WILL NOT FIND A BETTER LUNCH SPECIAL!! My favorites include chicken chow mein, Kung pow chicken, Mongolian beef, beef with broccoli, the BEST teriyaki chicken, sesame chicken and their sweet and sour dishes. We first discovered them years ago at their Peoria location. Couldn't review a better place!"}
{"text":"After giving this place a couple more shots, I've found that the shrimp in lobster sauce (spicy as all hell) is good. Still not impressed though."}
{"text":"Big Heng for the Big Win!
I had the BBQ pork Low mein and fried rice. Delicious.
Great food
Great service
Great price
Go!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Peoria.  After reading the reviews gave this place a shot.  I ordered emperor's chicken,  garlic chicken,  orange chicken, from the lunch menu, and bbq pork fried rice. The garlic chicken was not what I was expecting because it was saut√©ed with veggies in white sauce but it was still good. I really have no complaints.  All was good and I will go back.  Was it the best? Neh, but good enough to eat again. I will say far better than most places here in Az.Good portions. Friendly workers.  Good prices. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I love lots of vegatables. They made the chicken with vegetables but added curry sauce. Whoa, never had so many veggies in a one dish. Took 1/2 home for another meal.  Loved it."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese food places in the area. Love their egg rolls. Emperor chicken is good but the curry chicken was kinda weak. Not bad just not great. Always really fresh taste. The food at most local Chinese food joints nearby taste like they have been aging the food in a pile of socks under their bed. Only real complaint is with the fried rice. Powerful weak showing with their fried rice. Step it up Big Hengs."}
{"text":"This place is FAST, delicious and priced right. They are so friendly in the restaurant or take out. I love the orange chicken and crab puffs. If you order take out a lot, they throw in extras. I can't force myself to try any new Chinese places though because I know it won't be as good."}
{"text":"Been coming to Big Heng for over 10 years. Love it, usually get the orange chicken with fried rice."}
{"text":"Great food at really great prices! Two meals for around 20$. And they give you a great portion . Definitely more bang for you buck. Terrific service every time. I highly recommend it. I love it great spot in my favorite town! The Sweet and Sour Pork never disappoints . The atmosphere is always friendly."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I first moved to Peoria (I was in 3rd grade... so the late 90s?) and it is STILL my favorite Chinese restaurant. Every time I get Chinese, I compare it to Big Heng and I have never found anything comparable. 

Some of my favorites: Teriyaki Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Garlic Chicken, Curry Chicken, Orange Chicken. The egg drop soup is the BEST. The PuPu Platter is so good (I love the beef skewers). They have the best egg rolls. Seriously the best. Crab puffs are amazing (they actually have crab in them, what a concept) and the best pork fried rice. 

I used to ditch 4th period (I went to PHS) every few weeks and go to Big Heng with my boyfriend. 

I have since moved away (first to Flagstaff, then Queen Creek and now living in Goodyear) and we still make the drive at least once a month to eat here. 

They do use MSG in their cooking, which is the ONLY reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5.

The food is cheap, fast and it is always delicious. Lunch (served 11-3 I believe) is probably the best value (my SO and I can eat here during lunch for about $12) but dinner is great. The specials are more expensive at dinner, and limited, but you can sub the entrees for a fee."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! We enjoyed Kung Pao, fried rice, lemon chicken amd egg drop soup!"}
{"text":"Great chinese food.  This restaurant is fast, without sacrificing quality.  We are always well taken care of when we come in, or call for take out.  We have had the emperors chicken, sesame chicken, orange chicken, and egg drop soup.  All are winners!"}
{"text":"Good food and great prices. Even better customer service.  We have been there a handful of times and have been pleased with our food and the service on each occasion."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to meet a friend. They have a good variety of lunch entrees. The food comes out fast and the prices are good for the amount of food you get. The only thing that I didn't like was how much MSG was in the food---I guess it's expected in a Chinese Restaurant, so I'll just have to make sure to ask for no MSG if I go again. 

The place is pretty authentic though, so if you are looking for a good Chinese food this is a good place to good. Personally, I just don't like a bunch of MSG in my food."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices.  Dinner combo's for two are a good deal!"}
{"text":"The new owners were very friendly and accommodating.  My favorite waitress Winnie is still there! Yeah!  The food was fast, fresh and quite yummy!  I ordered the lunch special - Szechwan  Chicken. Perfectly spicy!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, that, over the years, my love of Chinese food has waned.  I'm just not used to eating such heavy food anymore and for the most part have replaced Chinese restaurants with Vietnamese and Thai (though there's no comparison between the latter and Chinese).  However, after reading the reviews on here, which said this restaurant was the closest thing to the NYC version, I couldn't resist trying it.  Having grown up on Long Island, I had my fair share of Chinese restaurants and I, too, think the best in the country are to be found there (and, to a lesser extent, San Francisco).

The star of this place is the pu-pu platter.  Hands down the best for a mere $9.90 for two people.  Spare ribs with plenty of meat on them; large -- but albeit greasy -- egg rolls; skewered meats that in no way resemble most of the pu-pu platters in the Valley, where, if you're lucky, your skewered meat and ribs will resemble something some other customer ate 80% of the way through and was kept out of the garbage to be put into some poor schmuck's order the next day (and that's if you're LUCKY; don't ask what it'll look and taste like, if you aren't!).  

The hot n sour soup certainly doesn't skimp on meat and other additions to it.  But while it was good, it didn't wow me.  For the main dishes, we had Kung Pao Three and the Emperor Chicken.  Both were a bit salty, but that was our fault:  we don't use salt at home, so --- as you've read in my other reviews --- we should've remembered to say \"no MSG or salt, please!\"  Other than that, big portions; big pieces of meat.  Just be aware that, unlike kung pao dishes, the Emperor Chicken has NO vegetables in it (if that's important to you).

Service was stellar and I had no problems leaving a 20% tip on the total (subtotal and tax combined).  The server was friendly and gave lots of advice.  In fact, I would describe her, too, as being typical New York:  we can be very standoffish; but once we get to know someone or want to get to know someone, we can be very familiar and overly -- but genuinely -- friendly very quickly.

The restaurant is very well lit, but not obnoxiously so.  I don't know why -- no doubt some personal, buried memory -- but well-lit Chinese restaurants always remind me of the Christmas holidays, so it felt warm and comfortable to be in so well-lit a restaurant.

Overall, while the food  -- with the exception of the pu-pu platter -- didn't wow us, this place definitely ranks up there in the best of Chinese restaurants in the Valley.  Well worth the drive from Goodyear and its \"late\" hours are an absolute godsend in a \"city\" where most restaurants close down by 8pm or 9pm, even on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's the only Chinese food place we eat. The people are always nice and the food speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"Family run business.   We have been enjoying the food for more then 10 years.  Hot and sour soup that will cure any cold.  Fantastic  terriacki chicken and a number of tofu dishes.   Big servings and a family friendly setting."}
{"text":"The only good thing they have is their crunchy noodle and egg rolls. Everything else is lacking seasoning, and flavor. Really hoped to finally have found a good chinese place here is AZ but didn't live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"This is great Chinese food sit down and take out great speedy services and friendly.  Food was made to order and has great american chinese food fare . Can't go wrong with this place . We were served (large crowd ) lunch special and regular dinner was at lower end on the price scale . That is an A++"}
{"text":"We didn't come in with high expectations for this Chinese Restaurant in Peoria. Not many pictures on Yelp and decent reviews so we figured, why not. 

Overall it was average. Everything tasted the way it should've but not of high quality (think fast food take out). The egg drop soup was bland and the egg roll was mostly vegetables. The only thing we almost finished was the fried rice on our combo plates.

Don't drink the ice water unless you get a lemon or something because Arizona's finest was off today."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome lunch deals for a huge amount of food! 
Lunch comes with soup, wonton, egg roll, fried rice and entree! For 5.50! And we had leftovers. They even customized my dish for 50 cents more. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is exactly what you would expect. 
We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"the food is OK at best had the mo shu beef of something like that it was on but much flavor had to add bot sauce to taste something the beef and broccoli was OK too no real flavor it doesn't taste bad it's just not for me my for the sun city folks now the service is 5 stars all the way it was busy when we were there and never once had to ask for anything the server even ask what we like about the food and suggested something to order next time we came in will try again"}
{"text":"Quickly seated with prompt service. I ordered the sesame chicken which was delicious, the sauce was perfect with the chicken breading lightly crispy! Recommend if your in the area to stop by!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Restaurant. My Wife and I come here often. My favorite is the crunchy Sesame Beef, and of course the Egg Rolls, but everything on the menu is CRAZY GOOD. We have been coming here for 15 years, and have never ordered a dish that didn't taste amazing."}
{"text":"This place has the best beef and fried rice in the valley, and the second best in the country. It seems to be family owned and operated, with familiar, courteous staff. Dine-in or take some for the road!! Now i'm hungry...."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have found in this area. It is cheap, huge portions and really good! If you get take out and you tip them they give you a little extra something =) like a couple free egg rolls or crab puffs. So very good! Quick service to! My husband always gets the House Noodles or the Moo shew Pork he loves them! The sesame chicken and the emperor chicken is always good. I recommend!"}
{"text":"A Favorite for Years!!! Their house lo mein is the best I have ever tasted. I have tried so many other places and this is by far the best! Even though it is a hole in the wall strip mall, it's clean, friendly and well worth the trip. Add some egg rolls and crab puffs YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service good portion of food it is very fast and good food if you are around and in a rush for a quick bite try this place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My family and I have been coming to Big Heng for Chinese food since we moved to Arizona 14 years ago. They have fast and friendly service and it is one of the best places for authentic Chinese food. Although I don't come as often as I used too, this is the only place we come for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Big Heng is a family favorite. Prices are reasonable, service is reliably prompt and staff is cordial. The menu is extensive with varying degrees of \"heat.\" Kung Pao Shrimp with Crab Rangoon, Egg Roll, hot 'n sour soup make a delightful lunch with two or more meals left over. The iced tea flavor prompted me to ask how it is made, \"Lipton,\" I was told.  Groups of diners large and small are welcomed and unrushed."}
{"text":"This place so far is the best place in the area that I've found. Moved here 6 months ago and always on the look out for a good Chinese place. Will continue looking so if anyone has any suggestion... I will come back to this place. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of \"Never judge a book by its cover\" On the outside it may look rundown and cheap, but once you walk inside, it's so beautiful its almost breath taking. The food is reasonably priced and the service is great. I have been going to this place for years, and no matter how far I move, I still try to make it ever few months."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place. Everything is delicious and so, so affordable. Your food is ready so quickly too. I've been coming here for about 10 years now."}
{"text":"O my gosh amazing food. Service awesome,  huge portions very great prices!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Never had a problem with the service. Its the best in my opinion. The pork lo main is awesome. Always get the sweet and sour pork too. Big portions at a great price. Don't hesitate to try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick pretty decent Chinese food. I would say this is Chinese fast food in the restaurant setting. I will for sure be back, but my expectations are not high...they need to be pretty low to have a good time here."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. The food is great - typical New York style Chinese food. The staff is friendly and I always feel like they remember me even though we mostly take out. They will customize if you ask them to and the service is fast. If you order $25 or more they throw in crab puffs (misspelled \"crapuff\" (lol) on their menu!) or egg rolls on the house. I regularly recommend this restaurant to friends and they all rave about it and introduce to other friends!"}
{"text":"Great food! I was disappointed that when dining one hour before closing, the waitress was very pushy in collecting our plates. We weren't even done and she kept asking if she could take this or take that. She approached multiple times in less than 20 mins. I finally told her sternly we were not finished and she walked away mumbling under her breath."}
{"text":"Obligatory ENG101 assignment; however, my feelings are genuine and I do love Big Heng. 
___

  Everyone has been at a point when they just wanted some good, cheap food. Maybe they cannot be bothered to cook or they are on a lunch break, still their desire is simple: to quell their hunger and to satisfy the palate.  People in the Glendale and Peoria area would be happy to know that there is a charming, hole-in-the-wall place to satisfy their needs. Big Heng is the go-to Chinese restaurant due to its affordability, service, and, of course, the food.
Big Heng is a family owned, Chinese restaurant located on 75th and Peoria that has been open for over twenty years. It is open every day for lunch and dinner for dine-in and takeout. It offers Pepsi products and alcoholic beverages as well. Many locals have gone so far as to say that it is the best Chinese restaurant in town. One Yelp reviewer had said that they \"have tried different Chinese restaurants over the past year or so but they always falter somewhere along the line.  Whether it be in food quality or service....or both, Big Heng is still the best around!\" (P., Vinnie).
   Most people want to be able to go out to eat without breaking the bank, but this restaurant is so cheap, it is available to anyone. All lunch items are available for less than six dollars. Lunch includes a large, piling plate of food with a choice of white or fried rice, an egg roll, and the entr√©e. The rice is fluffy and light, and the egg roll is crispy, yet moist on the inside. Additionally, guests are also served a cup of egg drop soup with wontons on the side.  With so much food for such a low price, this restaurant has an excellent value that would make patrons feel that they had gotten their money's worth. 
      The wait staff of any restaurant can either make or break a guest's experience, and Big Heng's staff will be sure to provide excellent service. Big Heng has some of the friendliest staff in the area. The ladies there will absolutely come to know their customers and their families. They are absolute sweethearts; they are incredibly nice, polite, and treat guests as their friends. They will even ask their regulars where their usual dining companion is if they are missing. On top of being so personable, they have incredible customer service. The staff has such quick service that customers can expect to have their lunch in less than five minutes. Guests shouldn't worry about asking for anything because the staff is sure to have already taken care of it or have asked if anything was needed. They are also very knowledgeable about all their items and, if asked, will even give customers advice on how to cook their own Chinese food at home. The staff of Big Heng puts many restaurants to shame and should be the standard for waiters. 
      Naturally, the main focus of Big Heng is, of course, their delicious food. The restaurant offers food for every palate and diet. Big Heng prides itself in its variety of Chinese fare; it has Mandarin, Szechwan, Hunan, and Cantonese cuisine. Of these dishes, there are vegetarian, Kosher, and healthy options. The food tastes special; it is like the dishes are not easily replicated and that it can only be found there, yet it tastes oddly familiar and comforting. It is a very unique dining experience.The food- appetizers, main course, and the sides- are all well-seasoned, carefully cooked, and has great flavor. Unsurprisingly, with food like that, it leaves guests satisfied and coming back. The sesame chicken is a particular favorite of many guests; the chicken is perfectly breaded, dulcified in a sauce with an impeccable blend of sweet and savory, and is topped off with toasted sesame seeds. If chicken is not a particular favorite for someone, there are beef, shrimp, and pork dishes as well. The Lo Mein is well seasoned and the noodles are the right consistency, not too chewy or flimsy; it is what a noodle should be. The variety of Chinese cuisine offers amazing flavors and displays the talents and passion of the kitchen. 
   As great as Big Heng is, if there was one thing that could be improved, it would be its atmosphere. Admittedly, the ambiance is not great; it is located in a shady strip mall- the kind of strip mall with a rundown laundromat and questionable looking bar- and the inside is a bit tacky. The d√©cor is cheap and pass√©; it is not exactly the type of place to have a nice date at. However, looks are not everything and it should not deter guests away. Sometimes it's the ugly oysters that produce the shiniest pearls, or it's the ghetto restaurants that have the best food. 
    Big Heng is an excellent Chinese restaurant that boasts an affordable price, excellent staff, and delicious, varied food. Considering the generous portions, it is a great value that manages to be of quality. Everyone in the Glendale and Peoria area should give Big Heng a visit to experience their unique, affordable Chinese cuisine and wonderful wait staff."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for as long as I can remember. Great Chinese food at a reasonable price. The lunch special is a great deal, and all their meal portions are huge. The staff is also extremely friendly, we always have good service at Big Heng."}
{"text":"This place was ok don't think I will come back but it was pleasant experience: 
The orange chicken is overwhelming sweet, and it over took the flavor of the chicken. The rice was good and the broccoli beef was ok too. They had Pepsi products but they also had can coke which was awesome. The service was friendly but the food was not as good as I was hoping. Guess I will continue to search for a good Chinese food restaurant. 
The best thing was the chow mein"}
{"text":"The food is truly a 3.5 but I rounded to 4 because of the service, portions, and value. I tried to order from Little Saigon several times and it just went to their voice mail. Finally someone picked up but the little bastard said Little Saigon was too busy to take to go orders at the time. So I went on yelp to find somewhere else in a pinch. I have seen this place before and the outside looks really suspect. 
I ordered beef and broccoli, chicken and vegetable stir fry, and some crab puffs. Picked it up in 15 minutes. The lady was extremely nice. She gave me some extra hot sauce. Then when I left a tip she seemed as though she was shocked. She said to wait right here and came back with a bag of two free egg rolls. I guess people don't tip often for take out. Anyhow, I told my wife I sure hope the food was good cause I loved that little older lady in there. 
Got home and it was pretty tasted. Everything was very hot, fresh, and had a pretty good flavor to it. The only thing I would have changed was a little spicier and a little less sauce but other than that it was great for pick up in a pinch. 
Best of all. They gave me enough food to feed a family of five and all for under 20 bucks!! Now that's what I'm talking about. Left over Chinese for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall at the end, it's a nice little treasure. 

My first visit since moving to Arizona 2 days ago, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality. The egg rolls were good, same with the beef and broccoli and BBQ pork fried rice.  While my father ((70's)) didn't like the beef, he later told me that since he has been down here he doesn't like any of the beef avaliable here. So I take his meh review of his beef lo mein with a grain of salt. My mom was pleased with her sweet and sour chicken. 

Will look forward to my next trip now I have a menu to look at and pick something else"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 2 1/2 stars.

Pros:
Excellent food & service.

Cons:
We were served expired beer, if they aren't rotating their product it makes you nervous about what else they aren't rotating back there.


Like I said excellent service and food! I have never been sick after eating here but being served an expired beverage put a huge blemish on an other wise spotless record."}
{"text":"First time there, and we had  good experience! We ordered for a large party and it was fresh and ready in less than 10 minutes, portions are enormous and very reasonably priced. I am a sucker for chicken fried rice and it was of the best I've ever had! I enjoyed the potstickers, very meaty. My husband got the orange chicken and he felt that the breading could have been crispier, but really enjoyed the flavor. My guess is that it was made fresh and put in to-go containers which may have caused it to steam and soften by the time we got home. I found that the hot and sour soup was oddly too smoky in flavor, but very rich. All in all I am very happy with this experience and can't wait to go back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"This dive delivers!  The best chinese food that I have had in the valley.  Prices are ridiculously cheap, food is awesome and the staff treat you like family once they get to know you.  I love this place."}
{"text":"So I call in and ask if they have tofu. They say yes. I ask if it's cooked. They say yes. I ask for low mein with tofu on top. She said she couldn't do that. I asked for tofu on the side and just plain low mein, she said she couldn't do that. I had to twist her arm by asking the simple question \"are your cooks not competent enough to throw some tofu on top of some noodles?\" and she said they were, then she goes on to tell me that if we did that then it would cost 4 dollars more. 4 dollars for tofu. Tofu is cheaper than meat. I asked for the tofu extra crispy THEN she goes \"oh yeah we can't do that\" so I just asked her to have the cooks cook it longer than they normally do and she said they can't do that. If they literally can't do some really really basic simple stuff like that then that's sad. I hung up at that point and went to good china."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the fat Asian lady that looks like a man, was rude on the phone to take our pick up order.  I didn't think anything of it other than they were probably just busy. When we went to pick our food up, she forgot to put our order in.   She then said it would only take two minutes to cook. Yeah right.  She wanted us to pay right away, I told her that we would pay when our food came. She rudely rolled her eyes, and seven minutes later, no food. Cancelled my order.  China Grill up the road is just as good, if not better and they are much nicer!  My co-workers have spread the word and we now go to China Grill."}
{"text":"If you have a big appetite, Big Heng does not disappoint. The portions indeed are huge. The Yelp reviews here were accurate. I have never been an Egg Drop Soup fan, but because of my daughter's love for this American Chinese creation and the reviews on the soup here, I decided to try the place out. Once again, it did not disappoint. I like this soup so much that I will come back here to carry out this comfort food for sick family members. It was simply delicious. Don't forget to add pepper.

Tonight, we ordered the #1 Dinner Combo with Sweet and Sour Pork, Mooshu Pork Crepes, and Hunan Chicken. They portions are huge. The egg roll was standard American Chinese fare. The Crab Puff was tasty, little crab, lots of cream cheese. The lo mein had a lovely texture, but lacked distinction. The fried rice was okay. The Sweet and Sour Pork had too much batter and the sauce was a dousing of the store bought sauce that they serve with the egg roll. Because of the photographs, I thought the Mooshu Pork would taste more like Peking Duck. The crepe was authentic and so was the sauce that it came with. The filling however was a salty stir-fry of scallions, bean sprouts, fried egg and strips of non-descript pork. Finally, the Hunan Chicken had great ingredients but the gravy was overwhelmingly soya sauce and corn starch. They honored my request for no MSG or Monosodium Glutamate

The servers were fantastic, mostly Cantonese speakers. I felt like I was back in Hong Kong. They were friendly and helpful. When I requested to go boxes, they insisted on packing it up for me. They give me tips on where to get good dim sum. I really wanted to rate Big Heng higher. The service and soup was 5 stars. The rest of the main dishes were on a 2-3 star level. Hence, the 3 star rating. I will definitely return for the Egg Drop Soup."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years! Love it! Cheap prices for big meals. Definitely recommend sweet and sour chicken or teriyaki chicken. Also the egg drop soup and egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat inexpensive Chinese food and the wait staff are very friendly!"}
{"text":"The food here is soo good!! Had the vegetable wontop soup and fried rice and it was delicious I highly recommend this place will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Everything taste like soy sauce.... the soups and crab puff wontons are the only good thing."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for a long time and it's one of the best Chinese food places around. It's a moderately sized dinning area with a few tv screen up. There are several booths around the sides. They have some large tables, one with a lazy susan and then smaller tables filled in everywhere else. They do serve alcohol. They have a lot of items on the menu that's split up by the type of meat. Prices are pretty good for the amount of food you get.

The people here are great! Everyone does a good job here. The servers are always there to help you.

They are located in a very small strip mall at 75th and Peoria. Even if you don't see lines for parking you can park in the middle as well.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone. They have great food with great people!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent prices. Excellent vegetarian options and good service! My new regular spot"}
{"text":"We have been ordering Big Heng food for years. Recently I gave up meat and consider myself a vegetarian. I have had the bean curd vegetarian dishes which I thought were very tasty until tonight. My husbad got the food. He ordered the bean curd dish and after eating through a little of it I noticed there were several pieces of chicken in it. So needless to say I won't order anymore from Big Heng. That is pretty careless."}
{"text":"Wow, how bad is bad! Had chicken chow mein, it was greasy, egg roll soggy, rice was bland, wonton was overcooked.  I have searched for a good chinese restaurant have read reviews and still Im at a loss.  Is there no such thing in this area at all.  Drove quite a ways to try this one as I have many others, guess I will have to give chinese food up completely, just tired of being disappointed."}
{"text":"It had been a while since i last went to Big Heng and finally made my return this past weekend. I first experienced this place 4 years ago. Their lunches are insanely cheap and the lunch options are plenty. I like the teriyaki, and their veggie dishes like the Hunan chicken. I like to ask them to make it extra spicy everytime. I have also tried their orange chicken. Its pretty tasty and not your usual Panda Express orange chicken. It really seems like real oranges in that sauce. Lunch comes with soup, egg roll, two wontons w/ meat btw and fried rice (substitute soft noodles for $1). I gotta say though that they have the best Hot Chili Oil i have ever had in any chinese place, they really ferment it. Becareful with their spicy mustard, its has the wasabi effect if you know what i mean. Service was excellent as always, super kind and attentive. Big Heng is one of those comfort chinese food placess"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Big Heng! My husband and I have tried many of their dishes and we've never had a bad experience! It is by far the best we've found in the valley!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Chinese food and they are really fast. The place is always clean and the staff is so friendly. I love all of the ladies there like family because they just treat us so good when we go. My favorite thing to get is the shrimp chop suey with brown sauce, pork fried rice and the dinner fried shrimp because the batter is so good. I don't think I have ever had a bad experience here and I like that. The food is awe some and the prices are great too. If I remember I will take some photos next time I go in."}
{"text":"This used to be the highly rated Dragon Island but, I'm told by Jolene, our server/cashier  that the owner moved to Tempe or Mesa and sold the business to Big Heng.  According to the staff,  Big Heng kept all the cooks and staff so the food is the same as Dragon Island.  I went on their second day of opening.  I was treated to a egg drop soup which was very good.  I had also Mongolian Beef which was very good.  Service, provided by Jolene, was excellent.  I'll go back this weekend and try something else to see if it's routinely good.  Will bring my wife.  At this point, I'd highly rate Big Heng on Glendale.Ave."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Glendale/Peoria, Phx have hits/miss Chinese sit-ins but this place was super accommodating and really delicious Chinese food! Their food was NOT OILY compared to other place and their servings can feed more than 1 person and to top it off, we went there during lunch hour thinking portion was going to be small but much to our surprise they were huge portions! Really friendly staff and really tasty Chinese! I suggest the sweet and sour pork!!!"}
{"text":"Got our food to-go so I can't comment on the inside (I waited in the car) but man, my car smelt aaaaaaaamazing. Between the 4 of us, we had Moo Goo Gai Pan, Kung Pao Chicken, House Fried Rice & House Lo Mein. Hubby didn't care for his Kung Pao, there didn't seem to be much chicken in the dish. I loved the light taste of the Moo Goo, it's a nice change from normal fried greasy style chinese. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for a very long time and I love this place!! The food is excellent! The service is great! You can't get better Chinese food anywhere else! I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys chinese food and a great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Definatly my new favorite Chinese place!!!  Egg Drop Soup is yummy.  I recommend the Seseme Beef!!!  Very friendly staff and huge servings.  You don't leave this place hungry!!!!  Food taste very fresh and served fast and hot!!!  Highly recomend!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST Chinese restaurant I've ever been to in my life!!! I've never had seasame chicken that was yellow/white yuck!! Also they wouldn't give me a To go box the lo main tasted like straight pull I will not be be going back and in fact I'd I had money for a lawyer I would sue them"}
{"text":"We came on a Monday night there were only 2 other tables in there. The lady who took our order had very short hair. My sister has been there before and I had not. We got the crab puffs and we each got orange chicken. The food was good. Nothing to rave about however. The service was terrible.. Unfriendly and she forgot a few of the things I asked for. She also never came to check on how our food was after it came out. I would go back with my sister since she lives over there and maybe try some other dishes.. But I definitely would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I decided that we needed to try this place after reading Yelp reviews. Who doesn't love yummy, but cheap Chinese food? This place hit the spot! The food was really good, we had plenty of leftovers, the prices were stellar. This is probably the best Chinese food place we have found living out here so far, and we will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were just in for dinner tonight. We were seated immediately and the entire crew was so fast and efficient and friendly! Many check ins to see if all was good and refills came almost immediately! the egg rolls and crab puffs were some of the best we have had in this state so far. i had the orange chicken which had a hint of spice and the tangerine sauce they used made it completely unique! Upon leaving with leftovers we were even given more rice to add to our boxes. At the end I received a fortune cookie with no fortune so the waitress  left and came back with several more for me! we will absolutely be eating here again and would highly recommend to all :)"}
{"text":"Serves is so bad, got 4 small boxes and paid over $25, no crab puffs, no fortune cooks, and wrong rice, my boxes looks oily and fingerprints like someone forgot to wash their hands, rude people!!!"}
{"text":"First off, loved this place. It's kind of a hole in a strip mall place but when you walk in, it's clean and everyone is friendly. My friend said she's been going here for years and said it was consistently good. She even had her rehearsal dinner here. Here? I'm kind of a Chinese food snob and didn't expect to like it as much as she did. But I did. The egg drop soup was great-they put a bunch of fried wonton strips on top and sometimes there is bigger pieces of egg white and it is just really good. I had the Hunan chicken, they said it was spicy--and by gum! it was :) And delicious. We had the flat noodles instead of the rice and it soaked up the sauce from the chicken--so, so good. And plenty of veggies with the chicken. My only hesitation is with the egg rolls that were kind of...clunky-almost like they had been made ahead of time and then warmed up. But I'll be back and try all the other goodness they serve. Oh! And it's good inexpensive Chinese food--2 for lunch, tea (a dollar extra) and a bit extra for the noodles vs rice and we got out for $16. Yes, I will be back--and you should go! Trust me :)"}
{"text":"Got the diablo chicken!  Amazing.  Was here for dinner and got a ton of food for less then $10.  Crispy chip appetizer soup and egg roll came and a crab puff with my dinner.  The crab puff had great flavor.  The diablo chicken was spicy but not too spicy.  These guys don't skimp on the food or the flavor."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years.  Always had great service and food has been really good.  We usually are waited on by Winny, she is the best waitress there.  We went there today 5/15/16, with some family members during lunch time.  Service was horrible and food was not as good.  Usually when Winny is not there it seems that we get really bad service.  Disappointing :("}
{"text":"Just as delicious as Dragon Island was. Very good service, yummy food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area by far. Super fast, super cheap, just as it should be. Called in my order for Hunan Beef, Orange Chicken (Asked them to make it spicy), and crab poofs. Was ready in 10 min and came in at $20. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Like Taric said, Big Heng is good enough. They give you more than you can eat for spending very little and it truthfully is better than the majority of Chinese around that I tried. 

We ordered two lunch specials and they start bringing us piping hot egg drop soup and as FAST AS CAN BE they bring out our lunch entrees. 

I thought the hunan chicken was better than the Szechwan Chicken. That Szechwan sauce was mild and flat to me and the vegetables were mostly celery and green peppers but the canned bamboo shouts in this dish bothered me because I kept tasting can.

Like I already said the hunan chicken was better and I might have given four stars if this was the only dish I tried. The sauce was better, the vegetables in this dish were better, this dish did have heat to it.  Both meals had a nice vegetable to meat ratio and both were piping hot and everything seemed fresh.

Big Heng close to Tolmachhoff Farms so you might want to check them out if you stop by here.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to have lunch.  It's pretty affordable like most real Chinese restaurants.  I order the same thing at every Chinese restaurant...the Mongolian beef.  I am on a mission to find the best Mongolian beef in PHX.  This one was fine.  Not much to the decor."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going here for over 10 years and it's delicious every time. They are good people and go over and beyond to make sure you are happy. Portions are huge and it's half the price of most other places. There isn't anything that I wouldn't reorder! Great work!"}
{"text":"WOW. This place is amazing. The lomein is the best I have ever tasted. Food was super hot even by the time we took it home. The house chicken is the best chicken dish I have ever had. Everything has really great flavor and was really hot. I usually order orange chicken but I think house chicken is my new favorite. The sauce is just so good and the chicken was nice and crispy."}
{"text":"I had the orange chicken i judge all Chinese food by their orange chicken n this was nasty . Im from California this was the first place i went too it just wasn't for me i used to it a certain way n it was not normal to me."}
{"text":"Came to Big Heng's, as I've heard great reviews for mandarin cuisine. Was promptly sat, and waited over 15 minutes for the server to return to take our order. After several attempts of eye contact and waving at other servers/ restaurant employees... We still sat hungry, with our waters. At the 20 minute mark we left, and will never return again."}
{"text":"Soooooooo I used to go to this place was I was a small child and just went there for the first time in about....7-9 years last night. OMG YUM! I love love love their food. I ordered a dinner special (there's 4) and they give you sooooooo much food for $7-8. I got the sesame chicken, fried rice, chicken lo mein, crab puff, and egg roll plate. It also came with egg drop soup. I LOVE egg drop soup, but most places don't make it good. They made some of the best I've ever had. Next time I go, I am just ordering a big bowl of that. Anyway, I had to pay an extra $1.50 because I substituted the sesame chicken for the teryiaki chicken. No biggie, it was still a steal! My BF got the sweet and sour pork with fried shrimp and lo mein and fried rice. He loved it too. He said their hot mustard was the hottest he's ever had.......and then ran a train on it :o) Only thing I didn't like was the bathroom. But hey, who rates a restaurant on that?? It just stunk and was also used as a storage closet. Anyway, if you're out this way, stop in. You'll get amazing food for an unbelievably low price. No wonder they've been in business for 15-20 years."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past and it was good enough to come back back 3 years ago.... I regret that decision now. The egg drop soup was good and so were the eggrolls but the main entree was orange chicken and it was disgusting! I literally almost gagged at my first bite. It was cold and not appeasing at all. I had to get up 2 times, nobody ever came to see how I was doing, Im usually not one to post reviews but, today was very disappointed and i wont be returning."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers! Just moved into this neighborhood and decided to give Big Heng a try. The name alone is enough to get me to eat there, because really, who doesn't love a big heng?  My kids devoured the sweet and sour pork. I like that they put the sauce on the side so the tempura pork is still crispy when you get it home. The egg drop soup was quite flavorful. I like the house fried rice - it's probably just soy sauce and rice really, but it sure did taste good. I've been in Phoenix for 6 years and this is only the second Chinese food experience I've had that made me say, \"yes, I'd go there again.\"  The only thing I didn't really like was that the snow peas in the shrimp with snow peas were a bit soggy. But I can live with that knowing that everything else was a hit with the whole family. And the Dinner for 4 served 5 easily with enough leftovers for lunch for 5."}
{"text":"Doing business in the neighborhood.   Found this gem on Yelp.  Orange Chicken for lunch.   Awesome. Staff friendly and courteous. Highly recommended them if you're craving good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I love this place it is my favorite Chinese food establishment to eat at Whiny is awesome."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome food. Ordered take out, was ready very quickly. Big portions. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First off, you get your money's worth at this place! The lunch specials come with a good serving of your entree, 2 big scoops of rice, an egg roll, and some fried wontons.

The food itself was okay. The beef and broccoli had a lot of flavor, the Orange chicken was way too sweet, and the sweet & sour sauce was nothing special. I also had a cup of wonton soup that was very good! 

Overall, the food was just alright, but with prices this good and quick service, I will be back for lunch to try something new!"}
{"text":"I bought a dinner combo fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and lo mien.Everything was good I can't complain.will probably visit again"}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least 50 times over the course of my life. My parents used to take us here (4 kids) and get the hunan dinner for four. 
The reason why this restaurant keeps us coming back and has me referring all of my friends is because you get a big bang for your buck. That, and the food is outstanding.
Try the sesame beef and the emperors chicken. It is seriously to die for.
I am in North Phoenix now so I spend a little extra drive time, but it is worth the drive.
I love that it hasn't changed and it doesn't need to. It is my favorite little hole-in-the-wall! BTW, I was just reading reviews on Yelp to see about trying a new fun restaurant for Valentines day. I typed in Big Heng just to see what people think about it. LOL 
If you don't like Big Heng, then I don't like you :D"}
{"text":"Well its kind  Of hard to displease me When It comes to restaurants but the employees ( 2 females always upfront) were absolutely the most disrespectful human beings my mother and I have ever seen!!!  One lady; while I was asking a question had this awful look on her face like she was answering a question from a piece of dog shit!
Next my mother asked the other lady politely if she could have a side of hot mustard to go but as My mother tried explaining that she didn't want mustard packets and that she wanted the actual mustard from the kitchen the lady literally turned around and walked into the kitchen while my mother was in mid  Sentence ... Needless to say, it was not correct....
Orange chicken was chewy like rubber and had no flavor except if you like chewing rubber fructose syrup. Anyways the only thing that is decent is the sesame chicken and for that they get 1 star that's it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, its actually called \"Silver Dragon\" and they do not deliver....I had the Chicken fried rice, and my daughter had the Sweet & Sour Chicken. My 5yr old was impressed by how quickly the food came out lol very authentic dining!"}
{"text":"Always a great dinner big tables great for families.
It's our neighborhood go to place"}
{"text":"Ordered the crab puffs, General Tso's and pork fried rice. Everything was delicious! Took our food to go so I can't account for the service but ordering over the phone and picking up was quick and easy. We will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"WOW.......nice hole in the wall Chinese place. 
I loved the food, waitresses are nice and courteous. There is one that is a flirt and funny.LOL 
Few things i love here are; 
Wor won ton soup, All i can say is wow. Besides this place i don't know what other place serves the Wor won ton soup. i was used to it in Cali. 

The house fried rice is the bomb, tasty very tasty. 
the wifey loved the the stuffed crab puffs. 

The house sweet and sour, very delicious!!! 
Beef broccoli, very tasty. 
Egg soup is exquisite. 

I'm planning to go back and try different dishes, but so far it has not disappointed me. 

One draw back but is worth it is its way in Peoria and I'm in east phx, LOL"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, always thought it was my hunger that made it seem so delicious but its not. Came here on a Saturday night and saw many people here. Service is fast, place is clean,  the food is always delicious and the prices are just right.  I love this place"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My fianc√©'s family has been coming here since it opened, and I've been coming here for the last few years. The staff are friendly and recognize regulars. The food is very good and quite affordable. I particularly enjoy their egg foo yung and their vegetable dishes."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but the food is still as good as I remember it. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I would recommend to anyone in this area."}
{"text":"Every few years I feel like an update on Big Heng is necessary.  Why?  I don't know.  New Chinese restaurants open.  Old one's close.  Big Heng is still here and better than them all.  The food, service and prices are still the best around.  The prices may have gone up a touch but they're not out of bounds and still well worth it.  I have tried different Chinese restaurants over the past year or so but they always falter somewhere along the line.  Whether it be in food quality or service....or both, Big Heng is still the best around!  I know the place is in a dated strip mall and it doesn't look good from the outside (the decor inside is dated too), just go in and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Clean and fast service. Food was good, fresh and tasty. Lemon chicken wasn't what we expected and wouldn't order that but the plain fried rice was tasty. Lunch plates were reasonable and very filling. Won tons were good too. Husband liked the egg drop soup that came with the lunch, I liked that it came with pi chips. Will be back!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING..... This place used to have a location on 19ave & Glendale and they were decent and the service was good. That location closed, but I think they made the wrong choice. This place has been around for years, maybe they were good back in the day, but not today. YUCK!"}
{"text":"after eating chinese food in NYC for over 40 yrs. I've spent the last ten looking for that taste. The Big H comes close. So far the Moo Shoo Pork is my favorite, Give the place a try."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. This place is ok. I try to avoid it because I get headaches after which I think are because of the msg. I don't go here often. Prices are ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place in the Phx area. It is a dumpy building and by no means fancy (in any way). But the food is amazing.....especially the house lo mein, beef chow fun and salt/pepper shrimp. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Good Food. Great Prices. Excellent Service.
Best chinese food in the area!

They are super fast and they give you huge portions, been going to this restaraunt for several years now and have never had any complaints with service or food. 
Five Stars."}
{"text":"Big Hen seemed promising due to the great reviews I had read. I drove here thinking I'd be satisfied! The food here was mediocre. Me and my partner tried the chicken lo mien, sweet sour chicken, egg rolls, and fried rice. Though we didn't really like the above we found the chicken teriyaki, and egg drop soup to be delicious. We came back with two food boxes for the dogs! I'll stick with Cantong Dragon on 75th & Indian school!"}
{"text":"So i read most of a reviews and this place seemed promising. First of it looks a bit run down but i do think its family owned. Second, the prices were average but you are not allowed to substitute the rice for lo mein and the lo mein was $7-$9 depending on if you wanted meat or not. Third we got the sechwan beef and the Emperor's chicken both were supose to be spicy and they were far from spicy. The food lacked flavor, unless a lot of salt counts as flavor for you. You could taste the corn starch used to make the chicken crispy and there was more veggies and sauce then beef in the other entree. The food did not taste  very good and i will never go here to eat again and will not recomend to others for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered Lo Mein noodles, sesame chicken, sesame beef, teriyaki chicken, won ton soup, bbq pork with snow peas. The food was so delicious and yummy!
Great food and great service."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great locally owned place for Chinese food this is the spot!  My family and I have been enjoying their food for years and so far no other place in the valley comes close for me.  Their egg rolls and crab puffs are perfection! Their portion sizes are huge and the food is amazing.  Some of our go to orders are the sesame chicken, teriyaki chicken or the emperors chicken.  Egg rolls and crab puffs are a must.  The bbq pork fried rice is perfect and the plain order to soft noodles makes for a great meal.  There is always plenty for left overs, just make sure you get extra sweet and sour for the left overs"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great prices. The food here is amazing and the service is exceptional. They have the best egg foo young I have ever eaten among other things."}
{"text":"We just moved to the Glendale area.. My fianc√© and my mom were craving Chinese food... So after all these mixed reviews on yelp we decided to go give it a shot.

Ok so we orders egg drop soup which was delish. An order of egg rolls omg they reminded me of the egg rolls you would get from nj/nyc. We also got lo mein, orange chicken, shrimp in lobster sauce, garlic chicken and moo goo gai pan with chicken.
Tasted unbelievable so much flavor not too greasy. 
They give you such huge portions that it look like we barely touched any of the food so now we have leftovers for the next day. 
Amazing spot a must try !!!"}
{"text":"I've gotta say that I'm going to be tough on this place, because I loved and miss Dragon Island, and consider the owner a friend.  However, I'm happy to say that the food is, as previously mentioned, more or less the same (the barbecue pork with snow peas was good, though the sauce was thicker; the egg-drop soup was good, but also had more egg in it than before, and both of these things are fine).  I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Az hands down. Great food excellent prices. Never a bad meal. Portions are large and always fresh!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 15 years, you get a lot here for your money.  It is a better deal than any other restaurant like it.  You can feed your whole family of 4 for under $20 with ease.  

I love that they offer free hot tea, it is always good plus, and most of their lunch specials are just $5.45 and come with soup, rice and a lot of food, so much that I am usually stuffed when I leave.  

As is custom with most Asian places, they have a separate menu for dinner, that is about 50% more pricey.  But don't feat they have dinner specials for $8 that are almost twice as big as the lunch ones, so big that we usually split just one and then order a large side of rice and a small appetizer and our whole family is stuffed, usually with leftovers, and all for way under $20.  

Their service is quick once you order, I usually know what I want before I even go inside, so the 5 min or so it takes before they take your order is a bit long.  As soon as you order you get soup, then 2-3 min later your food is there...really just 2-3 min...."}
{"text":"I really dig this place. Just good affordable Chinese place close the my house. The lunch specials are great and priced not to be beat. Good soup and you get an egg till and a main course. Bring someone and order more to share because everything I've ever ordered is really good. My advice is try the orange chicken it's really really sweet and different from most places so you need to order something spicy too, to kind if compliment the sweet. Also you have to try the sweet n sour shrimp (sauce on the side) it's so good!! Definitely one of my local faves!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese in the phx area I've had so far."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and both times it was awesome.  The first time I had the sesame chicken dinner and today I had the orange chicken dinner.  The sesame chicken is excellent here.  Most places I've had sesame chicken it just taste oily.  Heng's sesame is very sweet, honey-flavored, with a bit of ginger - very pleasant.  As is pretty normal for Chinese restaurants, the orange chicken isn't anywhere near spicy but you can have them spice it up more.  Great crab puffs and fried rice here as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The only Asian restaurant I enjoy eating at. The service is outstanding and they always great you with a big \"HI\" and smiles. The lemon chicken and the broccoli and beef are my absolute favorite. Love that they offer free crab puffs with a to go order."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get take out .  The restaurant was totally empty,  I should have taken that as a sign. I asked the girl at the counter to tell me what was in a dish.  She directed me to look at the picture as if she had something to do other than to gossip with her friend.  After the wait we got the food home & it was very bland & unsatisfying.  The teriyaki chicken sauce was like water (very thin).  They sent a couple of spoonfuls of chicken for our lettuce wraps.  If we had sat in we would have at least got a small box full of meat .  The cabbage in the lo mein wasn't cooked properly.  Just an unsatisfactory time, which began with awful customer service.  I guess you have so many customers you can afford to treat them crappy."}
{"text":"My favorite west side Chinese food  their portions are huge and prices are cheap. We did take out today and I swear the portions are bigger! Each lunch special comes with white or fried rice, an egg roll, 2 won tons, and a cup of egg drop soup. If you order take out you don't get the soup . We added a quart of egg drop soup for $2 . Such a deal.."}
{"text":"Found this place today by Googling \"$5 lunch Peoria AZ\"...and the Yelp link popped up.  It was a bit out of my way, but I had the time today, so I thought, \"what the heck!  It got good reviews!\"

From the looks of the building and surrounding businesses, I was a bit leary, but most Yelpers gave this place 5 stars, so I had to give it a try. (that's why we \"yelp\" this stuff, right?\"

The place was much nicer inside than judging from the outside. It was pretty nice inside - not dark, dreary, or stinky!  Quite the opposite! 

The place was bustling with activity; waitresses were busy serving and seating the lunch crowd.  The place was hopping and continued to throughout my 30 minute lunch.

After placing my order of Moo Goo Gui Pan, a bowl of egg-drop soup quickly arrived (it did not mention soup on the menu).  It was just ok.  It was simply broth and egg. No standard peas or carrots in my bowl. It had little to no taste, but a bit of Soy sauce fixed that.  The thing I DID like about the soup, was that it came PIPPING hot, little fried wontons on top of it, and served with WARM sweet and sour sauce - and my favorite kind too! (I like the red, not the orange sauce).  That was a nice bonus!  

My food was delivered very fast and again, PIPPING HOT.  The serving size was nice and the presentation was nice too.  Came with an egg-roll and one fried wonton.  The flavor was VERY good...nice and garlic'ly!  Extra points for FRESH mushrooms, too!

The waitress never came back to check on me and no hot mustard was on any of the tables nor offered to me...tried to catch a waitress, but was unsuccessful.

The food, ambiance, flavor, service was very good. I would recommend this place...and the price was $4.85!!!

Since this place was a bit further than I like to drive at lunchtime, I will stick my my old fav, Shangri-La on 59th Ave.   Much better soup and not in the 'hood.  I'll gladly pay the extra buck.

If you are in the neighborhood of Peoria Ave and 75th Ave....stop in any give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great food & awesome service. Lunch specials are great bargains too, from $4.75 - $5.95They include entree, fried rice, won ton, egg roll & soup."}
{"text":"been fan since 1999..  food is always great! and staff is always friendly.. except for this older lady.. she has her moments where she will be yelling at someone in the kitchen.. lol!  same staff since i have known the place.. 

it might not be the fancy or most attractive looking Chinese restaurant, but you will get plenty of quality food that will satisfy your hunger..       

try sesame chicken..  or honey glazed walnut shrimp..  mmm good!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese good I've had. Fast and hot every time. Have tried just about everything on the menu and all of it's great. Little dive of a place that is so unassuming. 
Great place."}
{"text":"The best lunch value in Peoria / Glendale area. Soup, entree, rice, fried wonton, egg roll, and fortune cookie for $5.75. Pot of hot tea for $1 extra.

Service is friendly and too fast sometimes exceeding proper pacing, entree arrives before you finish your soup, but at lunch most people don't care."}
{"text":"New to Phoenix from Pacific NW. Found Big Heng on Yelp. The food was pretty good and the portions were great. Had some misunderstandings and paid a little extra for things that normally come with a sit down Chinese meal - i.e., egg drop soup. Also had to ask repeatedly for mustard and sesame seeds, again, these are usually staples that just come with the meal where we are from. We had the kung pao chicken and a combination dinner (#3). The food arrived immediately which made me wonder about the freshness, but overall the food was good and we will go back."}
{"text":"Fast service and great takeout! The orange beef and walnut shrimp are fantastic."}
{"text":"Big Hengs is the underdog restaurant you can't help but love and look forward to coming back for more.  Granted, as most others have mentioned, they place is anything but sexy. However who cares?  The food quality and quantity is as good as it gets.  The prices are so cheap I guarantee you'll do a double take.  The staff is some of the nicest I've ever met, and the atmosphere is interesting to say the least.  It only took my very first dining experience at Big Hengs to give them the crown!  Everything is good, but my favorite is the Walnut Shrimp."}
{"text":"I've eaten here over the course of  many years with my family. The staff treat us like family and make us feel welcome. This is the first place my grandparents would want to go to when eating Chinese food.  The portions are big and the cost is reasonable. The food tastes very good."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time growing up. Since then I've lived in Southern California and Boston, before moving back here. I don't know if i changed or the food changed, but it completely lacks flavor beyond salt.

We ordered cashew chicken, emperor's chicken, vegetable lo mein, vegetable fried rice, and egg drop soup.

The cashew chicken was drowning in brown sauce that does nothing for it, but it was marginally better than the emperor's chicken.

The emperor's chicken is marked as a spicy dish, but there wasn't a hint of spice or any flavor in the dish.

The vegetable lo mein and fried rice were not as disappointing as the entrees, but they certainly aren't reasons to come back. The fried rice also contained mushrooms which isn't a crime, but worth mentioning for those who don't like them.

The egg drop soup was probably the best item we ordered. I don't have much experience to compare it, but it was a good consistency and a good value.

Sadly, we won't be returning. I've always gotten great service there and I'm happy for their success, but it's not for my family."}
{"text":"We love this place, no doubt they have some great food & service. Prices are right & portions are huge!!"}
{"text":"First time there and it was great.  Food was really good.  A little out of the way for us, but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"We are extremely picky when it comes to food. We have never dined in at Big Heng. Always take out. My wife is more concerned with cleanliness of an establishment then the quality of the food. Which actually work hand-in-hand with each other. Her take on cleanliness is non fatty grissley pieces of chicken, shady chunks of beef etc. Big Heng passes her test. Not only is the food nice and clean, but it's All made to order. The sesame chicken, even after my 12 minute drive back to the house, stays crispy. The egg rolls are divine, and the hot and sour soup is amazeballs. If you spend $25 tell them you have a coupon for free crab cheese wontons. It's on their to-go menu that you can detach. When we want good Chinese and don't want to spend PF changes money, it's Big Heng time!"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food at prices you can't find anywhere else. Service is amazing. This place is always busy and never had a bad experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and my daughter LOVED IT! Great service, great food nice atmosphere.  Definitely will return anytime I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"Do not order the salt and pepper shrimp it's not full head shrimp they use little shrimps. The service is good the beer prices are cheap. Soup was great rice and veggies were fresh wasn't a big fan of the meat dishes felt they could of used higher grade meat and fresh meat. Ok for basic Chinese restaurant. Prices a little high for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here later in the evening to satisfy our Chinese cravings and we're not disappointed. The crew was very friendly, the portions were large and the food was very good!  I was not sure what to expect from the exterior, but I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"This place has been here for years, Im usually afraid to try new chinese places. Good size portions, lots of options, but food lacks flavor. The crab puffs should just be called cheese puffs no crab no flavor, sweet sour pork and teriyaki chicken same no flavor. One thing that was great was the service, the waitress was awesome. Dont think we'll be back"}
{"text":"Service was ok and food wasn't any better.  The Orange chicken was ok, however the egg drop soup and fried rice left a lot to be desired.  Price is pretty good for a big lunch.  I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"First time here. Good solid choice for Chinese take-out or dine in. Lunch specials are insanely cheap ($4.75 - $5.50) and come with choice of soups, egg roll and fried rice!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Oriental Place to eat. Egg rolls and crab puffs are excellent. I usually get house special fried rice/extra spicey. All the food tastes great, I'm a creature of habit. Excellent service too! If you're in the area give it a try. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"You can either pay $8 at Panda Express for the same old BS, or you can go out of your way to a place like Big Heng and get a crab puff (and oh, their crab puffs are amazing), an egg roll (hell, all their appetizers are freaking good), chicken chow mein, fried shrimp, AND sweet and sour pork. All on one plate. I DARE you to finish a full meal here, because *I* can't, and I'm pretty good at eating.

You will never hear me say Big Heng has the highest quality entrees, but you will hear me say it's good enough, and they give you so much, with a smile, that it's worth it every time.

Seriously, just look at their menu and tell me you can't find something you like.

Thank me later.

PS-If you dine in, get the plum wine!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, spiced well... fairly priced. Very clean establishment. Can't ask for much more than that!!!"}
{"text":"This place by far is the closest to New York City Chiense food (and at a great price) you will find in Phoenix Metro area. My family Heritage is Jewish, and if you want to find great chinese food, look no further that a Jewish New Yorker we can smell good chinese a mile away.

Big Heng's is what I call a hole in the wall. but they have hit it out of the park,  the servers are really from china and are a hoot, and they do a great job even when they are super busy. 

Our hole family goes at least once a month and we sit at there largest table that has the built in lazy i orger 6 to 8 dishes and we eat family style.  Our family favorite is their Pu Pu plater appitizer.   My kids from a very young age all ways thought the name was funny, but they love the Pu Pu.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"By far my favorite in Peoria AZ area.  My family have coming here since 1992.   Beef w/ broccoli,  kung pao chicken,  any fried rice,  mangolian beef,  skewed stick chicken,  chow phun and garlic chicken are mouth watering good"}
{"text":"First time here.  Very fast, yet pleasant service.

Delicious food.  May be my first choice for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Just moved to Peoria. We've been stressed out from the move and we also both have colds. Picked up lunch from Big Heng on impulse. Not only was it delicious, I swear it has medicinal properties or something because we're both feeling better now (let me enjoy the placebo effect, okay?). We ordered the egg rolls, egg drop soup, house fried rice, moo goo gai pan, and cashew chicken. The portions were generous, and the food was fresh and had great flavors, not excessively salty or drenched in sauce. So glad we live near this place. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. Big portions and the best lo mein noodles! My family keeps coming back and never disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to always come here and the food was always great - never really any complaints. I went back a year later and I was very disappointed. The orange chicken was disgusting & the texture was awful. The fried rice tasted like rubber. It's kind of sad because this place used to be really good."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for decades. My father brought me here, and now i take my kids,  and everyone I've talked to about this place had loved it to.  I've tried just about everything on the menu by this point,  and so far it has all been great.  And the service is by far great,  fast service and once your order is in your soup comes right out.  Then as your finishing your soup, your food shows up.  Overall i and my family love this place.  Def come in for the lunch specials 11 am to 3 pm is the best bargain."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch or dinner or even when I just wanna do take out. The food is always Amazing!!!! The people working are typically pretty great too and always trying get what u need or want fast! Everything I have ever tried has been super yum only thing I would say has been not so bueno was on evening trying place phone in orders being put on hold forever was kinda annoying but hey there busy because people luv there food so I get n I'll wait lol its worth it!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've found here... they accommodate special requests like brown sauce on my chicken and broccoli like they make on the east coast/midwest. Fried shrimp, crab puffs and egg so soup are YUMMY!!! Also love the sweet and sour chicken. .. crispy and all white meat."}
{"text":"First off.  This is no fancy gourmet Chinese food.  This is Chinese fast food.  Keeping that in mind, it is good.  I find the Lo Mein there addicting.  I'm not a huge Lo Mein fan, but the way they season their noodles,  leaves us craving more.  The service can be a little challenging with some employees due to the language barrier, but they are always attentive.  I took my kids there last Friday night and we had our dinner out within 3-4 minutes of ordering.  We had Sesame Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein, bother were great.  We saw the staff sing happy birthday to a customer, first in English, then a Chinese song that I'm assuming is typically sung during birthdays.  I hope they keep up the delicious food!"}
{"text":"My family has come here for years and the staff has been there even longer. They all know us and know exactly what we like and how we like it.
I am always willing to try new things. I let Winnie surprise me and she knows exactly what I'll like everytime.
I always make sure to visit when I am in Phoenix.
Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Exterior might make you think this place wasn't great but you can't judge a book by its cover. The teriyaki chicken was awesome. I substituted the white rice with a side of noodles. The crab puffs and pork egg rolls were delicious. Good sweet and sour sauce, too."}
{"text":"The Big Heng gives you a great deal of bang for your buck.  It's not gourmet Chinese food but it is good and plentiful.  If you're looking for an exceptional Chinese meal you probably need to go to Scottsdale or some other high rent district but if you're hungry and you need to fill a void on a budget this place is the best.  The service is exceptional and the employees are more than friendly.  I'll come back here when I'm hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years, but I felt it necessary to review now. Some of the people working there have been working there for years, and I couldn't love them more. Now, food time! If you ever want a mouthblowing flavor mix, try getting the szchecuan anything and an order or orange chicken. The two sauces are like an amazing double dose of awesome in your mouth hole.

I always get an order of egg drop soup when I go. It's a small cup, but it's a perfectly sized appetizer.

Beef and broccoli is solid, egg rolls are on point and every meal so far has been great in it's own way. If you are ever around here, you won't be let down."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place around here! Great food but not so great service. The place looks clean in the inside but the outside looks deceiving."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in quite a while so hopefully not much has changed, but this was my favorite place to get take out. The beef skewers, house fried rice, house low mein and several other dishes are simply amazing, especially when the outside looks very much like a hole in the wall. The only thing stopping me from eating here more often is the fact that it's so far away from my house. We always ordered a ton of food for pick up and were never disappointed. Hopefully I can make my way back soon because I haven't found any place that compares."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Prices are also not bad. Customer service is an A+. Always very pleasant when you ask for something extra. I got the orange chicken and white rice, that was pretty good and my husband got the house chicken and fried rice, now that is something you need to try. We are going back for sure. Oh and the egg drop soup is the real deal. Delish I must add the whole experience. Way to go!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service, and priced right! We come here often and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"My family has been visiting Big Heng for about 20 years.  The staff has been the same too.  They know us when we come in.  It is very nice and feels like a family environment.   Service is always quick and the food is always great too.  We LOVE Winnie.  She is the best waitress and  has watched my kids grow up."}
{"text":"I am giving Big Heng 5 stars not because it is truly 5 star gourmet Asian cuisine. I am giving them 5 stars because it is a true diamond in the rough. It is in an old rather unattractive building, but that is deceiving- the service is as good as it gets and the food on the better side of sit down Chinese food, the portions are way larger than I have ever seen at similar Chinese restaurants are the prices are very low. I am just amazed at the low prices for this quality and quantity of food. That is why they are always packed. try for yourself- you will become a regular"}
{"text":"Wow this might be the friendliest restaurant I've ever experienced. Our waitress was so sweet. Our drinks never went empty, and we were checked on repeatedly. She even suggested what to order next time. 

I'm not a real big Chinese food fan so I really can't compare their food to other spots. We ordered the crab puffs which were tasty but I've had much better. Orange beef was pretty good but not spicy enough for my taste. It came with steamed or fried rice. I added a side of lo mein noodles because I was craving them. Those were really good. Hubby ordered shrimp lo mein and really enjoyed his meal. Serving sizes were really big and prices were reasonable in my opinion. 

We will definitely return. It's a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"It was alright. The lo mein was very good. The orange chicken was actually kind of gross! It tasted like something you buy frozen in a bag. The lady who took my order was abrasive and rude, and they have high prices. I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 15 years. That ought to say something! Anyways, I have never had bad service or bad food. I've tried just about the entire menu and everything is good. If something is ever wrong, they're quick to fix it. All the waitresses have been there since the beginning of time and offer the best service. Definitely my go to Chinese restaurant. The egg rolls by far are the best EVER made."}
{"text":"Been looking for some good Chinese food and I have to say this place is pretty good.  We got the noodles and it was very fulfilling. The egg rolls are GREAT! I haven't had egg rolls that good in forever.  And it's also affordable. Did not realize how cheap it was till I got the bill.  Only thing I didn't care for was that it was busy and so it made it harder to get the waitress attention."}
{"text":"Very good food !! Service was also excellent.  I would highly recommend this place to eat .  The food came fast and the people were very attentive.  Thank you BIG HENG  for a wonderful meal"}
{"text":"The service here was good.  There is nothing to complain about the food here; my wife is a bigger fan of it than I am.

The portions were generous and the prices were about on par with any other chinese food place in Phoenix.

I recall that there's only about four dinner combo meals which are a combination of some of the same things over and over.  This is probably the only reason for me that I don't give it four stars (or go back more often).

It doesn't look impressive inside or out, but that shouldn't stop you from checking it out."}
{"text":"They don't deliver to us, but this has happily been our go-to place since we moved into the neighborhood!

The portion to price ratio is outstanding and the food is amazing as well.

We always get a gigantic order of the pot stickers because they are the best my household has ever had!"}
{"text":"We love it here. Old school Chinese food and nothing pretentious. Everything we have tried is goodm Love the lo mein and sesame chicken. Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and a very friendly staff. I would have to suggest there orange chicken or teriyaki chicken"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate in the restaurant on a Saturday for dinner. It was not crowded inside but had quite a few people picking up orders to go. We got egg rolls, broccoli chicken, and emperor's chicken. Unfortunately, neither is us was happy with our food. We ended up bringing it home to our dog. The one thing that was good was the service. The food came out faster than a fast food restaurant and our server always made sure our drinks were full."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the food was very delicious and the service was great. I had the orange chicken (if u like it more spicy u should ask as it was super sweet and not spicy). It was soooooo inexpensive ($5.75 for lunch) and came with rice, an egg roll, and a cup of soup. Such a great price for good food! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here once every few weeks back in 2010, and loved the orange chicken lunch. Came back today after relocating from east valley, same recipe, same amazing taste. The eggdrop soup is a cure for hangovers and colds. Love that stuff! This is my favorite little spot. That staff is always friendly. It was nice to see some familiar faces from 2010. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite in the valley! I live around the corner for 18 years now and hands down the best food! There teriyaki chicken is the best and their egg roll are to die for!! Thank you for the many years of feeding my family kids and grandkids! You Rock!!"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for lunch. Their soup was delicious but broccoli in my husband's meal taste like chemical. I will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Was a little apprehensive when there were very few people there on a saturday night, but was impressed. Food was fresh and had good flavor. Whole restaurant was very clean. I have tried a lot of chinese in the valley trying to recreate the chinese i could get back east. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Super cheap and by far the best Chinese food in Peoria or Glendale. Sketchy-ish strip mall, but totally worth it. The salt and pepper shrimp or emperors Chicken are a couple of my favorites."}
{"text":"My fianc√© family has been coming here ever since the moved to Arizona (18 years) & this is my favorite place to go when we are on that side of town! Tons of vegetarian options & good ones at that! Always a pleasure, always perfect whether you get take out or stay.
My favorites:
-broccoli & mushrooms 
-vegetable chop suey
-lo mien 
-I had the chicken lettuce wraps before going vegetarian, amazing w/hot mustard!
-fried rice no egg"}
{"text":"The cashew  chicken, fried rice, sweet & sour pork and crab puffs were all amazing.  The customer service  was top notch.  I continue to search for Chinese food in the area and this has to be the best so far."}
