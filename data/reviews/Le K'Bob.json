{"text":"NDG has possibly the highest concentration of Korean restaurants in Montreal due to a high Korean population in the area. There is a lot of choice here, and some of the local Korean fare is excellent. K'Bob is a new addition to the mix and one may expect that it would be hard to stand out in the area. However, the food is absolutely excellent with some innovative offerings I have not seen elsewhere. The standards are done exceptionally well, and I find that their Korean Fried Chicken has the best combination of crispy outside and juicy inside that I have tried. I think their spicy offerings could be a bit hotter, but that is me. There is currently no liquor license and I really hope that changes."}
{"text":"Decided to forego the AYCE (all you can eat) Mon Ami down the street and try Le K'Bob. From the exterior, it looked promising. Korean fried chicken and bibimbap, what's not to like? The interior has a modern, almost sterile look to it. Not necessarily my flavor, but no complaints. The young man serving us seemed somewhat new at the food service game, but I've been there before so I gave him a pass. We ordered the sweet and spicy fried chicken and the bibimbap. The chicken was solid, had a bit of a cinnamon twang to it, but could've used a little more kick. We used the hot sauce that came with the bibimbap to dip the chicken in, and that made all the difference. Speaking of the bibimbap, it was also pretty solid, maybe could spen more time getting crispy in the clay pot, but otherwise pretty good. Overall i give this place a solid 3 stars, but unfortunately for these folks it'll be hard competing with their neighbors at Mon Ami."}

{"text":"Expert cooking, tasty food and very friendly and accommodating service. I had the spicy squid, tamed down to 70%. It was delicious but I would go to 50% next time, it's really spicy. Food was well prepared, very fresh. Family run business. Decor is very pleasant."}
