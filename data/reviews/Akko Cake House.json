{"text":"This bakery has a very nice boss; she is kind and respects her works and every customer with care. The breads, cakes, cookies and everything are fresh made. The cheese are delightful. The prices are reasonable and adorable."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese hot dogs buns, so I went and got some here.. and  now I hate my life. But I love me some Chinese hot dog buns!  They have a good variety of Chinese pastries that are baked fresh every day. The coconut buns, red bean buns, and ham & cheese buns are among my favourite and they're reasonably priced.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Japanese cheese cake, mango mouse cake, cocnut buns, almond cookies. This place it so underrated! My family and I go here to get out birthday cakes cause they make them so well (especially the mango mouse cake). Their Japanese cheese cake is really so good! It's light and fluffy and not too much cheese! Kind glad not a lot of people know about it, cause then other wise it will turn into an Uncle Tetsu with a long line outside! I love this place, its a hidden jem asian bakery."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese cheesecakes in Mississauga for $6.50 only!! No need to line up for Uncle Tetsu"}
{"text":"The bakery is pretty typical to your average Asian bakery. Personally I have not really tried their breads, so I can't comment on anything in particular.   I do, however, go for their freshly baked cheesecake - no it's not the creamy ones you get at restaurants... it's more like Japanese cheesecake or the pound cakes you bake at home. It has the appearance of a pound cake, feels light like angel food cake, spongy fluffy texture, and has that nice egg-y smell/taste to it. They usually have it baked for the afternoon - it's best to get it asap as on busy days they sell out of the cake and it tastes even more amazing when it's warm! Not too expensive either, around $7ish for an 8\" size."}
{"text":"This place is just steps from my school. Decided to give it a try one day as I was craving carbs, and I couldn't be happier for doing so! The hotdog buns are off the chain! I got them warm and fresh, and they taste as good as they smell and look! Looks like I'll be going here every day on my break now!"}
{"text":"I went here for the Japanese cheesecake based on previous reviews.  I was not disappointed!  The cheesecake was moist and delicious.  I paid $7.50 for the cheesecake so the price has gone up a bit since the previous reviews. They had many other desserts as well including coconut and egg tarts and a variety of buns.  I haven't tried the other desserts yet but I will be sure to do so the next time I'm here.  A gem of a find!"}
{"text":"small shop. cheese cake is super, you jave to order in advance. other buns are so so."}
{"text":"A little bit pricey compared to other locations in Mississauga however, well worth the money. Great bbq pork buns, fruit cakes, Egg tarts. Not a great selection if you dont come in early and they do cash only so make sure you've got the money!"}
{"text":"This is one of only a few good Chinese bakeries in Mississauga.  On a Saturday morning the place is pretty busy.  Get your fresh baking early or you may face an empty shelf!  My favourites are the coconut buns, crispy flakey egg tarts, the filled cake  rolls, and the Japanese cheese cake.  Give it a try and pick up your groceries at the No Frills next door while you're at it or have a delicious bowl of wonton soup for lunch from Wonton Chai in the same plaza!"}
{"text":"The bakery food here is just off the hook.  This place has been around for some time.  They were doing Japanese cheese cake for a while now.  Way before uncle tetsu came along.  I actually prefer to get my japanese cheese cake fix here.  No need to wait 2 hours and i prefer this one better.  I also love their coconut riceballs with redbean inside!  Food 5/5 Service 4/5 Convenience 5/5"}
{"text":"This place has the best mini egg tarts. Unfortunately they often sell out rather early in the day. I have not had better egg tarts."}
{"text":"This review is for their Japanese cheesecake. We came in at 8:30 AM just as soon as the Japanese cheesecakes were ready and fresh. We ordered 3 cheesecakes. Each is only $7.   The cheesecake is delicious and not too sweet. Not as sweet as Uncle Tetsu. It is very rich and really filling. If I am craving Uncle Tetsu's would definitely just go here instead.   I recommend trying out their japanese cheesecakes. This is a much cheaper alternative and bonus: you can get as many as you want!    Review 29 of 100"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese bakery in Mississauga! I remember coming to get freshly baked coconut buns with my mom when I was young and till this day, they are still tasty and the same as before. Come on the weekends for the yummy raisin buns and remember to try their fresh mango cake in the summer. I really enjoy their chestnut cake and this is one of the few bakeries that have chestnut buns. They also other buns and items that you don't often see, walnut bun and small egg tarts.  I really love this bakery since everything is sooo fresh and the quality is still the same and consistent.  Definitely recommend this to those who haven't tried this Sauga gem!!"}
{"text":"Their Japanese Cheesecake is the real deal!! For $7 for a whole cake it can't be beat. So airy and filling at the same time, not too sweet and not too cheesy either!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to this place, he had placed an order for a cake, for a friend's birthday.  I would never have known the bakery have been there, I've been to the plaza many times before, it is very hidden away.  As you open the door, you are hit with such a beautiful aroma of fresh baked goods. I literally drooled and tried to hold myself together.   Staff are friendly and extremely happy, they are so welcoming.  They are reasonably priced, I find the baked goods are a little smaller than most bakeries. I ordered with my eyes and my nose. I couldn't help myself. But it is worth it.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree that this place is pricier than other Chinese bakeries in the GTA, but the straight-out-of-the-oven freshness of the pastries and buns make up for it. Be warned that it isn't a large bakery (selection is smaller than average), but what they do, they do decently.  I've visited this place many times growing up, and they're always quite busy, especially on the weekends. My most recent visit was on a Saturday afternoon, and they had just restocked shelves of pastries that emptied out by lunchtime. I picked up a tray of warm coconut buns (soft and deliciously chewy) and a couple of large almond cookies ($1.00 each). They also have an assortment of other pastries that include chinese donuts, Japanese cheesecakes, egg tarts, fruit cakes, butter cookies, and a selection of buns.   Overall, the selection is average, and presentation isn't the most organized, but whatever they do have is nice and fresh. Not a bad option for Chinese pastries and buns in Mississauga (close to Square One, and right beside Erindale GO station). There's ample parking, as it's located in a large plaza."}
{"text":"***This review is primarily for Akko's version of Japanese cheesecake, made popular by places like Uncle Tetsu/Love Me Sweet.***  I've gone here for decades, but less often in the recent years well, because...eating sweet breads ain't the best for my waistline.  Once in a while though, for breakfast/snack, it's ok!  Anyway, based on a recommendation of a friend/Yelp reviews, I found out that Akko makes Japanese cheesecakes as well.  A coupla weeks ago, I tried Love Me Sweet's (Markham) version.  And I have had a piece of Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake months ago.  Honestly, there wasn't much difference between Tetsu's Vs. LMS ($11, no limit).  Both were light, fluffy, slightly cheesy.  Tetsu has at least 2 flavours, while LMS has a coupla too, but the day/time I visited, there was only Original left.  I don't know how much Tetsu's is 'cause I refuse to stand in that crazyass line, then be limited as to the number of cakes I can buy.  All marketing hype, methinks, similar to when they pull out that velvet rope, and have some intimidating security guard outside a club!  Akko's version?  Only $7, no line whatsoever, although if they sell out, you may hafta wait for the second batch (what happened to me), only 1 flavour, same light 'n fluffy texture, BUT less sugary/cheesy.  I actually didn't taste any/much cheesy.  So the version you prefer really depends on your palate.  Honestly, I think this is more than a solid replacement if you can't, or like me, refuse to jump through hoops to experience Uncle Tetsu's!  Bakery seems to be family-run, only Chinese ladies are always replenishing the buns with hot ones, so why not support local?"}
{"text":"Great bakery!! Coconut buns here are the best. Been getting birthday cakes here since I was a kid.  The downside, they're closed on Tuesdays and their inventory of baked goods disappears quick. After 6pm there's usually hardly anything left. So come early if you can."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Chinese bakeries in Mississauga (Oriental Bakery comes close as second). Their pastries and cakes are fine. Had their tiramisu cake as my birthday cake for two occasions. Highly recommend it! Not too sweet but it still hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Picked a variety of baked goodies both savoury and sweet. As a quick little snack you cant go wrong with the hotdog bun, was decent, it hit the spot. We also picked up some egg tarts, pineapple buns and coconut peanut butter pastry. All were decent but not out of this world. Your average asian bakery, decently priced.  We also ordered an assorted fruit birthday cake for my bfs sisters birthday. No issues, the cake was great and everyone enjoyed it. The family has ordered cakes from here before and have had good experiences."}
{"text":"BEWARE when you buy swiss rolls! Bought a coffee+vanilla swiss cake roll... Some issues I found:  1) the coffee section of the roll was so dense 2) the cake was definitely NOT fresh.   *Also, the Napoleon cake roll was NOT fresh-tasting. Who knows how long that has been sitting there. It was dense + not crispy at all.   They should have known better than to sell this cake roll. Dishonest.   I think they should be transparent about when the cake was made by stamping on the ACTUAL date the cake was created on the box, otherwise no one would know how MANY DAYS the CAKE ROLL has been sitting there.   Never will I go there again to buy cake rolls. Get them from TNT SUPERMARKET - 6 minute drive away."}
{"text":"One of many Chinese bakeries in Mississauga, but perhaps the oldest one.  Regulars flock here to get quality buns and cakes. It's consistently good and reliable.  Only wished they were opened later and better stocked later."}
