{"text":"Maybe the bad reviews had an effect. We ordered the fish Tacos and then ordered them again.  Friendly staff, fresh, flavorful Tacos and inexpensive.  We will return."}
{"text":"We were on the way home from a day of shopping when we noticed the Taco Bell was no longer a Taco Bell but a new Mexican joint. The restaurant was brightly lit from Shea and you could see as you drove up that there were only two other families eating in the restaurant.  Right when you walk in you'll see brightly colored decor and a very clean restaurant. Everything looked pretty tidy. After viewing the menu board at the counter, we decided to get a quick snack which meant no rice and beans combo plates but just 1 chicken taco, 2 shredded beef tacos and a quesadilla.   The price was just right at $1.00 a taco and quesadilla. Can't beat that price. The girl at the front counter was friendly and brought our food out within 5 minutes. The shredded beef taco (crispy) had a nice amount of beef and was overloaded with lettuce and hardly any cheese. It came with a small container of green and red salsa on the side. Both salsas were very watery and had no fire to it. Taco Bell hot sauce packets have more fire.  As far as the tacos, the tacos came out hot but there was a strange \"after taste\" once you kept biting into the taco. The chicken taco also crispy had the same taste. We both couldn't really pin point what it was but it was between a soapy taste or something that was on the skillet and had cooked into the tacos. The after taste was in both the meat/chicken and the shell. When it came to the quesadilla, while it was served hot and cheesy, it was very light on the cheese. They def could of beefed up the cheese.  When it comes to service, the front counter staff was nice and very helpful in getting us extra salsa. The price for all this was $10.00 including 2 nice size drinks and a tip.  Hopefully they can get the kinks out as it would be very convenient to have an affordable Mexican place in FH."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Fresh.  Nice portions.  Easy quick $1.00 tacos or larger ones.  Chicken tostada was piled high and yummy !   Exceptional friendly service !!!"}
{"text":"We were kinda excited having a new mexican resturant in town but I have to say it was a complete disappointment nothing was tasteful trying our meals ..beans tasted like Soy chicken flavor was off and rice   mushy no flavor. Sticking to corner competitor."}
{"text":"Sat at the drive thru window for five min. No one answered and it was open. Pulled up to the window for another five min and no one helped me. Left with no service. Highly recommend NOT going to this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something delicious or edible, don't come here. If you are looking for a taco shop that knows what tacos should taste like, don't come here. If you are looking for a taco shop, that knows what tacos should be made of, do not come here. After a day of hiking and playing at the splash pad, we were hungry, and stopped here on the way back to Phoenix. Burritos, tacos, quesadillas were ordered. They all had something in common: they were very juicy with what tasted like canned tomato soup. The food is at my feet, uneaten, and I am sad. It takes a lot for me to not eat a burrito; I have been vanquished by this drippy bundle of gross old folks home tomato soup. We are so far from home, two babies crying, and all I can think about is how hard this place has failed."}
