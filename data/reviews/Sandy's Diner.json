{"text":"Amazing chicken souvlaki and Greek salad!! Very cheap I would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Generous and fresh portions. The 2 ladies working were very cute and nice. They gave us complimentary coffee cake and korean kim chi!  Had the breakfast special and chicken teriyaki. Really great place, I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I love everything about Sandy's Diner. Most of all I love the people, they are some of the sweetest people I've met. The food is delicious, it is like having a great home cooked meal.  This is a go to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Sandy's never seems to have a line which I don't frankly understand considering the fresh ingredients and flavourful dishes this place has. Most meals are under 10 dollars including the breakfast special 5.99 (comes with coffee before 11), bacon eggs toast and potatoes. So good. Not a single complaint about this place."}
{"text":"Here on vacation for a month and Sandy's Diner was the first place I've visited for breakfast. I'm very simple when it comes to breakfast; so in a city that's full of extravagant breakfasts, it was nice to find his place.   The food was amazing and the portion was better than expected for the price. From perfectly seasoned to amazing scrambled eggs, the food was just great all around. They've made what seems like such simple items taste like something exclusive.   I'll definitely be back a few more times before I return home."}
{"text":"Their homemade banana bread is amazing! Just the way mamma made it~"}
{"text":"Tasty and inexpensibe breakfast place tended by the owners. Fresh ingredients. A great find among this industrial park area. Blink, and you miss it, whole-in-the-wall packing a flavor punch."}
{"text":"Super nice ladies, super warm atmosphere. Food was worth every bite. Portions were humongous. I got the bibambap and my boyfriend got the 4.99 all day breakfast (sausage). Spent less than 20 bucks for breakfast with amazingly friendly people."}
{"text":"Sandy's is fantastic !  I work close by and this place was a recommendation by multiple coworkers.   Sandy and the other staff are super nice, and the food is exactly as you'd expect from a great diner. I've ordered many things from here: chicken sandwiches, fish and chips, and banana bread. All are very fresh and delicious.   The restaurant is clean, & the bathroom is spotless.   If you're looking for more than just good food - a great experience AND yummy lunch - Sandy's will not disappoint !!"}
{"text":"Having read the reviews, I decided to give this place a try. Upon entering, it took approximately 15 minutes before I was even greeted. It took a further 15 minutes to place my order and obtain my food. I understand this place is short-staffed and I came in during lunch, but this is something that you should fix. I would not recommend anyone to come here if they have a tight lunch schedule.  I ordered the korean spicy pork combo. The meat felt undercooked and chewy. It was hard to chew and difficult to swallow.  In addition, there is a lack of eating space, so be prepared to take out and eat in your car in their parking lot. This wouldn't be a huge problem for me if the wait and food were decent."}
{"text":"Came across this place after my lash extension and omg this place is definitely a hidden gem!!!! The owner are 2 cutest and sweetest Korean grandmas. During lunch time this place is pretty busy yet the food still comes out fast and tasty. Ordered bibimbap and the marinated beef was so flavorful. Also ordered sandwich and salad to go as my dinner. And the total comes out to be $16! Can't beat the value and the homey vibe here is just priceless. Will come back if I'm around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I work close by, and have tried many of the surrounding places. This is by far my favourite place for lunch! The portions are big and the prices are reasonable. Not to mention, the ladies who work there are ADORABLE! They are so sweet and nice. My favourite is definitely the Spicy Pork with rice, but everything there is good."}
{"text":"The food quality is amazing for the price. All the meat there are barbecued first using the real fire. That real smock taste feels?amazing!!All the menus there are good."}
{"text":"Recently moved into the area, so our hunt for the best breakfast deal begins!  We came for the $5.99 breakfast special. We were greeted by the kind and hospitable Sandy herself. She let us choose where we wanted to sit. It was a little chilly inside, so we kept our coats on till we got our coffee and tea (self service, creamer and milk are in the refrigerated case next to the coffee/tea station). Dining area and washroom are nice and clean, TV is set to the news, regulars are friendly, WiFi is free.    The breakfast special is availalable till 11am and comes with 3 eggs, 3 sausage/bacon/ham, 2 slices of toast, home fries and coffee (I subbed hot tea). I noticed when I walked in earlier that the bacon was already precooked and sitting in a tray. The food was standard diner quality except for the delicious home fries and their tasty home made hot sauce. Rating 2.5 for the barely warm food, bumped up to 3 for the value and the sweet attentive service."}
{"text":"One of North York's *best* kept secrets. Tucked away, surrounded by industrial complexes, is a quaint diner with some of the FRESHEST ingredients you will EVER find. All the food tastes home made and far from the processed ingredients we're all so used to. I *highly* recommend their Bibimbap and Bulgogi; pure authentic perfection!"}
{"text":"Not the best \"eggs, sausage and home fries\" I've ever had, but tasty and good value for the money when you consider coffee is included in the $4.99 tab. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"4.99 breakfast special: 3 eggs, 3 of bacon or ham or sausage w/ homefries  Home fries are great. I went with the sausages and they weren't the regular small breakfast sausages, they were thicker and tastier.  Eggs over easy done right.   There is a reason this place has been getting 5 stars.   ohhh.. and then a couple days later, went back for their Bulgogi sandwich. Not bad, could have used more sauce though.... still, this place gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find!   I found that proverbial needle in a massive haystack called the GTA!  This place is quite a great little diner. Located in a nondescript industrial area, Sandy's Diner delivers great value and a nice home feel. I walked in and found two older ladies busy with getting ready for the lunch rush.  It must be a rush as one of them was getting dozens of styrofoam packages ready for catering and walk in. I was there before 11AM and wanted breakfast.  They have a breakfast special - $4.99 for 3 eggs, sausage/bacon, home fries, and toast + COFFEE!!!!!   Made fresh to my liking and served to my table where one can enjoy a little downtime and wifi. Meal was great.  Breakfast done and I got myself a fresh baked slice of Banada Bread!  Who makes fresh baked anymore!?! This place also serves a variety of lunch items and for those who want different than diner stuff, they serve Korean home cooked meals!  QQF!??!  If you find yourself famished and lost...even H'angry (Angry due to Hunger), then find yourself a seat here.  I am making this my go to breakfast spot when I have early meetings that  make me miss my breakie!  Probably try their home cooked items too.  Cheers..."}
