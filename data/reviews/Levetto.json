{"text":"My wife and I love this restaurant! This is our favorite restaurant in the area..really love the location as it's super convenient for us!  Great simple food at great prices!  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What a surprising discovery thanks to yelp.

It's about 10 min. drive from my house and I never knew it was there.  Both the pizza and the pasta carbonara that we had were delicious and different.  It was tasty and better than our regular restaurant - abruzzo  (which also has good pasta in richmond hill).

Generous portions that left us very full and satisfied.

It's a small, quaint place and you can tell the chef/owner's take pride in their service and food.  Definitely going back and this is saying a lot as we have a lot of good italian restaurants in the region.

In comparison, I've been repeatedly disappointed in Il fornello in region.

Only catch is that it's a small restaurant so if you have a large party; it's unlikely that they will be able to accomodate you."}
{"text":"Best Rigatoni I've ever had! Died for it! It uses beef ragu which is so tasty and delicious. Love it so much!!!!
Tried Affumicato pizza. Thin crust, and whole wheat makes it a lot healthier. Smoked bacon and mozzarella cheese are perfect with tomato sauce. I asked for fresh pesto on top. Nice!
Price wise is reasonable."}
{"text":"The hottest ticket in (China)town! Ordered the bucatini which was perfectly al dente and delicious. Also tried the peking duck pizza which was the bommmbbbb! Great portion sizes, friendly staff, and an overall cool vibe. Will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"I ate Calbo and Fungi pizza but it was too salty
There're good price and enough to eat but that's all"}
{"text":"The last four times I ordered from here my food was terrible.  So bad that I couldn't finish it.  I used to love their food.  The braised beef rigatoni was delicious. But the last two times I had it the beef was so chunky and gross and it all had a metallic taste.  Yesterday I decided to try the tagliatelle it also had a metallic horrible taste and k could not finish it.  My husband got fumicato pizza that smelled burnt.  

Even worst experience this time.  I ordered the pizza shown in the photo below with just now sausage and got the most unappetizing most disgusting pizza ever.  I specifically ordered my pizza for the fennel.   Absolutely the last time ever."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian casual dining restaurants in Toronto. Excellent food, very reasonably priced and super friendly staff. Love, love, LOVE Levetto!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in two days - I think that might be enough for my review but OH BOY this place is delicious. I went for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend and shared the Patate pizza, the Carbonara pasta and the Caesar salad and it was all DELICIOUS. The next night I was just joining a friend for a glass of wine (I got the Chianti and it was a delicious wine), but we ended up sharing the Panna Cotta too. It's a dessert lover's dream - I recommend it for sure 

The Carbonara pasta had SO much bacon in it and the portions are large - it was fantastic. The pizza was delicious too, the crust is so crispy, and the toppings were super fresh and flavourful. The people working there are super friendly and my roommate and I ended up chatting to them for a long time too. 

Super cool place, great food, even greater prices and the people are super nice and friendly. I recommend to check it out for sure, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little pizza chain! Come here on occasion as it is a chain and there are many other pizza joints around here. There isn't much seating but most people take out anyway! 

You can order salads, pasta bowls, pizzas and desserts and everything is around the $15 mark per dish! They also offer larger group sized portions for 6-8 people! 
 
I enjoy the fact that they are able to make substitutions based on allergies and won't hassle you about it!"}
{"text":"Just finished one of the best spaghetti carbonara i have ever eaten. The portion was enormous and the succulent peices of bacon plentiful. We started with the funghi pizza, which was also amazing. The space is nice and open, with a great view of all the activity in the kitchen. Between dishes, the chef also finds time to check in and offer both insights into the dish and an affable smile. This is one of the better Italian spots in all of downtown toronto and at a much lower price point. It isnt fine dining, but the pizza and pasta would be up to the challenge of many of Toronto's best spots."}
{"text":"We took the family for dinner after some activities.  First of all its a small place about room for 24,5 tables of 4 and 4 singles at the bar.  This place is more of a cafe than a restaurant.  You enter choose you food and pay then a server brings your goods.  I gave the place a 3 because the food was good for the value.  The pizza was good.  This is more of a take out type place.  The cabonara was good and for 10 dollars what do you want.  My wife had trecce which she liked.  The kids had a margarita pizza which was ok.   Five of us ate for 50 dollars for fresh pasta made in house and a large pizza."}
{"text":"The cashier left me hanging and went home, i was waiting for a while with no attention."}
{"text":"Visited Levetto for the first time as part of a special group dinner.  Was excited as my friend has a great prior experience.  My experience here on was far exceeded - the restaurant is simple, clean and modern looking - very pleasant to be in.  And the food was great and tasty  had the opportunity to try a number of menu offerings that was shared with my group - was particularly impressed with the carbonara and rigatoni pastas, and the soppressatta pizzas.  I think this is the best Italian I have had in Toronto!  Also, for dessert the coconut cake was excellent.  Also, service from Dev was perfect!  I look forward to my next visit! :)"}
{"text":"Visited Levetto for the very first time had dinner with my husband and dad. The menu was nice and simple which it should be, the price was very reasonable!
What we loved about the food was the taste and presentation.  

You must try there pizza! It was one of the best gourmet pizza I had in a very long time.

I recommend this place to all pasta and pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best pizza you could have in Toronto. The Margherita pizza has a good texture and isn't as dry as the other pizza joints. Spaghetti Carbonara is nice, pasta is al dente topped off with good flavours."}
{"text":"Maybe we just caught this place on a bad day but not a lot good to say about Levetto last night. Ordered a pizza and the carbonara, pizza was the only part of the meal we were impressed with and why it has a second star. The carbonara was poisoned with pepper which was such a shame as had great potential, was only eaten because we were starved.
Deserts were fine, nothing special the main issue with them is we were looking forward to them which drove us to wait for 30mins for service which never came. The restaurant wasn't busy so cannot understand this one."}
{"text":"We stopped by during our drive through Toronto hoping for a good dinner. When we arrived, we were greeted by a bustling restaurant and a relaxed atmosphere. It took a little longer than expected to put in our order (about 11-13 minutes) due to a single server working 8 tables, but it was well worth the wait.  We received our salad and pizza about 5 minutes after. The caesar salad tasted very fresh and the sauce was tasty. The sopressata and basil pizza was amazing with a great crust and a nice addition of flavor from the basil. The rigatoni with the beef ragu tasted better than I imagined. The beef ragu sauce tasted just like my mom's ragu which was surprising and comforting. The dish I ordered, the carbonara, was slightly over seasoned, but the texture of the pasta and the balance of flavors between the bacon and scallions made up for those mistakes. Overall, my entire family had a good dinner and we walked away happy with what we thought was an inexpensive $70 dinner for four."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and pasta. One of the best I've ever tried. The dishes had a nice meat to pasta/pizza ratio. You can also tell their ingredients are top notch (literally the smell of freshness hits you as you walk into the door). 

The service was also second to none. As others have noted, one of the owners came by to make sure all was well and even offered a small treat for our little one. 

Highly recommend the Peking duck pizza and any of the pastas. 

We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We visited the College and Dovercourt location where the staff was friendly and attentive. We had the margherita pizza, the pomodoro and the trecce pasta. The trecce was loaded with goat cheese and delicious! We finished up with the tiramisu which was a nice finishing point for the meal! 

Overall Levetto offers great food, great portion sizes and all at a great price! 

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. Service was prompt and the food was quick to arrive. Ordered a duck ragu pasta. They have a good selection and the portion size was adequate. I can see this being a good spot for take out."}
{"text":"Both pizza and pasta are delicious. I have tried the Smoke Prosciutto and Salsiccia (pizzas) and both were fantastic, the fist is sweet and the second one has some heat. 

The Carbonara pasta is my favourite, I haven't tried one that good in Canada (my fav is from my city Medellín), and now I always craving it. I went two weeks ago and my companion made a mistake ordering the pasta and they brought me one I didn't want to! I told the server and she was happy to change it for the Carbonara at no extra cost! So no disappointment. 

Desserts are good. Fair prices. Excellent quality. Bottle beer/wine available. Simple menu."}
{"text":"Had the cavatelli pasta and panzanella salad today......mmmmmm... delicious!! Been here a couple of times and slowly becoming my go to place. Cafe ambience with friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was fresh. Made from scratch on the property. One can see them make it right in front of me. Chefs are entertaining too. There were lineups waiting for their pasta dishes. They sold out of pasta! Only knock: they need more seating!"}
{"text":"I recently tried this place for the first time and was so impressed. I was welcomed the minute I walked in by the friendly ladies at the front cash, and even the cooks! The pasta portion sizes were amazing for the price you pay! I highly recommend this place for dine in an take out! Keep up the great work Levetto and staff!"}
{"text":"I found this place thanks for to all the delightful Yelpers out there - and I'm glad I did. This place is reminiscent of small eateries that I tend to enjoy downtown, but rarely find way way way uptown. Either my dear Yelpers are holding out on more of these or they don't really exist. The place has a great vibe about it and I find it perfect for a quick meal, without feeling like you are in a food court or fast food joint. 

We ordered the ragu pasta and a medium pizza for two. More than enough for 3! Both came out delicious and hot, ready to be devoured. Tons of bacon on the pizza, a true winner! A thinner crust would be nice, it was almost \"pizza hut\" height!

My minor hiccups were a poorly maintained washroom (no paper products, dirty and soap that comes out of a sauce bottle!), and I was not immediately aware that you had to sit yourselves down and then order at the counter. No big deal and not something that will prevent a revisit when the need for yummy Italian hits.

A final note, the servers are very friendly and helpful, even if it is not table service per se."}
{"text":"Great fresh pasta. We had the rigatoni with braised beef which was delicious. The pizza is Romano style which has a crust that is like flatbread but a bit thicker. We had the spicy salami (soppressata) pizza. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. Service was average compared to other casual eating spots like A3."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time last night and loved it. We split one pasta dish and one small pizza and that was more than enough food for a meal. The pizza was great(we had the Peking Duck-the meat was delicious), but no more so than some of my other favourite pizza places. The pasta on the other hand was just fantastic. We had the buccatini with bacon and the noodles were so fresh. The dish had lots of flavour though I could have easily just eaten a bowl of the noodles by them self as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"German is a master in the kitchen, best pasta I've ever had. Gotta try the carbonara, its to die for. Pizza is killer too, light but filling. Super friendly environment, will be back often."}
{"text":"Get spot. Although small, the food is great. The pasta portions are great and the ingredients fresh. The pizza was a bit more expensive (16 for a medium). Could have used more cheese but still tasted fresh. This is more of arising crust pizza as opposed to a thin crust."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few weeks ago after a friend recommended it. When I walked in I noticed there was not much seating (maybe 5 tables). I ordered the carbonara and my friend ordered the cavatelli. The food took a while, maybe 15 minutes, considering there wasn't many people that ordered before/after us. 
You could tell the pasta was homemade. It tasted great. The carbonara had a lot of bacon and cheese in it, which is great. And the cavatelli was also very good (I'm not a big fan of ricotta cheese but I loved this). 
The portions are huge, I had enough left over for lunch the next day!
All in all, it's a nice place with great, homemade food. I will definitely be going back to try all the pastas and a few pizzas."}
{"text":"I tried this Sunday afternoon around 2pm to have a late lunch.  The food is wonderfully fresh.  Especially the pizza, the crust is thick but you can feel the bread is fresh and the pepperoni is not the salty and crunchy, but rather soft with lighter taste.  That's the meat I appreciate.  But the one I appreciate more is the pasta, I pick Rigatoni (Roman pasta), the good think is their sauce is strong but with the pasta is just right.  Its sauce fills inside almost each one of the pasta.  But the Carbonara spaghetti is really freshly crewy (usually freshly noodle and spaghetti has this kind of crewy)  Ok, the size of the plate is not small and I am a big eater compare to a lot of people.  Two slices of pizza can probably fill up someone's 50% of your stomach.  So be careful the size you order !!! :)

Last thing I really want to mention is the owner is care about his customer more than just to earn money.  Originally I went there on a day before last Sunday for some kind of special celebration.  Since, my wife really recommended me to go eat there, give it a try.  Well, that day I am not quite happy because their computer system is down and their orders are in chao.  And they miss my order and make me wait for almost half an hour and still without the food.  Well, the owner are there refunds me the money and offer me a credit (not small amount and enough to order 2 big pizza there) for my next meal.  Alright, I know he is suffering with system too so I told my wife I will give it another try another day.  Otherwise I won't even bother to write that long and to give him a thumbs up.  What I care the most about a restaurant is not the food, what I really care is their caring and attitude to their customers.  I will come back to try some other pasta."}
{"text":"This lovely place is simply amazing, the portions are huge and delicious, price is very cheap compared to other Pasta restaurants and the servers were very pleasant and nice. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is so good and they have gluten free pizza. Excellent value and the staff are so great. We do take out from here often. The owner is also a great guy and knows how to treat his clients. We always order the carbonara and a salad. Huge portions!! Their tiramisu is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and their fresh pasta! My partner and I ordered a small pizza to share as an appetizer. It was amazing, one of the best in GTA. It had crispy crust, with Italian sausage, red pepper and pesto. Their pasta I tried, was absolutely delicious. 

Not only the food there is great, also the service. The staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends."}
{"text":"I'm not one to normally write reviews.. however, I felt that this one was necessary. I have been living in the area for a very long time since Levetto opened and I have been a frequent customer. Lately I have been noticing a change in quality and care put into the dishes. I used to go in quite regularly and dine-in but recently the staff have not been as friendly or attentive as they used to be. You can clearly tell they are just there for a pay cheque. Now, I stick with the take-out option. Which brings me to my next topic. Tonight I ordered the Carbonara and a Roasted Radicchio salad. I guess you could say I am a carbonara connoisseur, I come from an Italian family. The carbonara I picked up tonight was VERY UNDERCOOKED. Correct me if I am wrong, but nobody likes eating hard noodles. The bacon and scallions were the opposite -overcooked. The whole carbonara was scrambled. It really couldn't get much sloppier than that. Not sure if the person who made it was new or what the deal was. The staff should be fully trained before putting out half-ass dishes. The salad was still okay but they have definitely made a change of ingredients in the white wine vinaigrette. The portion size of the salads have definitely went down in size too. I used to be able to split a salad with my boyfriend and now I can finish one all to myself. I find it odd how the salad bowls have remained the same size however, the contents are never consistent.  I feel bad saying this as I am a loyal customer but I feel that the management needs to be aware that nothing is really consistent. I will continue to eat here I just hope that the food quality and customer service can get back to the high standard it used to be. Not surprised I am seeing other low ratings on here as well."}
{"text":"Five stars all around. The pizza was amazing (and noy just for the price but for any price) as was the coconut cake I had for dessert. The staff deserve a special mention, really friendly and laid back service."}
{"text":"Ermahgerrrrd!!! The most satisfying pizza I have EVER had. Their half portion is around $8. Grab that and a drink and that's a dinner. So so so good. Havent tried the pasta, which is freshly made in house. Gonna try that next time.
Service is mostly self-serve, though I find that it depends on who's working."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my 2 daughters. Food was delicious and the service was also very good. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is a little piece of heaven in Toronto. 
Unlike any other italian place I've been to. The pizza crust is quite unique with square slices, and it's filling yet light. The pasta is as fresh as it gets and gets made daily according to the staff. For the quality and taste you get the value for your money is high. Everyone needs to try it out at least once! Spicy soppressata is my favourite !"}
{"text":"Amazing neighbourhood pasta and pizza restaurant.  Prices are quite reasonable and the food delicious.

I came on here to specifically rave about the Gluten-free pasta.  We had been waiting patiently since they opened to have a GF option on their menu.  And WOW...the wait was worth it.  

Was speaking to the owner/chef who told me they had worked a long time to get the recipe just perfect for their gluten free pasta offering.  It did not disappoint.  Not dry, or overly chewy or tasteless at all.  My gluten-free eating girlfriend was quite impressed, and I had to try a few bites as well, and I could not tell the difference vs their regular pasta.

Highly recommended...and a welcome addition to the hood :)"}
{"text":"not very impressed with this place. not authentic Italian to say the least. have tried almost all the pasta dishes and only enjoyed one. the pizzas are fairly decent."}
{"text":"I had the carbonara, prosciutto pizza and panna cotta. They were delicious! Highly recommend them. I can't wait to try other items on the menu. It didn't get 5 stars because of the slow service.  The server seemed nice but not attentive as service you would get elsewhere."}
{"text":"sudbury location was good so wanted to try out this one.  pizza and carbonara were great as was the service"}
{"text":"Food is super tasty, and good size portions. Definitely recommend the rigatoni. 
We went for dinner (~7:30pm), only tiny complaint was that the lights were very bright. Would've been nice to be dimmed with candles on the tables for a more evening ambience. Will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at the great price. It is an upscale version of a fast food restaurant. You are going to the counter to order and pay and food be will served to you if you are eating in. 

Pasta made from scratch makes a huge difference. Food is simple but very tasty. Service staff is very attentive and pleasant.

I am not huge pizza fan in general so I did like pasta much more than pizza while pizza was good as well."}
{"text":"Service is poor. We walk in and they look at us like they don't know why we're here. Once seated, we have to signal them to order. And once again ask for them to bring our drinks."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Trambusto, and I must say it was an excellent experience.  

The place is small, but it has a very homely, cozy feel to it.  Even the tablets they use to ring you in are surrounded by a natural looking wood.  

The staff is friendly and quick to greet you.  

And of course the food was the best part.  We had the pizza, rigatoni, and spaghetti.  

The pizza was probably the best pizza I've ever had (save for SONNY's in Glacé Bay, Nova Scotia).  It was nowhere near as greasy like all your typical franchise pizza places.  The crust/dough was light, crispy, yet soft/fluffy (for lack of better words).   The sauce was delicious.  And they use real mozzarella balls; although the cheese isn't spread across the entire pizza, it's just enough and just right.  Definitely recommend the pizza. 

The rigatoni was to die for.  It's mixed w braised beef ragu, and the sauce was just right.  I highly recommend this one - it'll likely be my first choice the next time I'm there. 

The spaghetti was good.  Wasn't my favourite out of the three items we tried.  The sauce was good...wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  Perhaps it was a tad too sweet.  Or maybe it just couldn't compete w the rigatoni!  

Definitely recommend this place.  Prices are reasonable if you are used to cheaper pasta/pizza...but definitely a deal and worth the price if you're lookin' for a wicked gourmet type meal.  

I think they only have a few locations in the GTA.  

I wish they had one in the Durham region.."}
{"text":"I live very close by to this restaurant and was always only passing by. It looked like a busy spot with the hipster feeling. The menu is short and straight forward with the option of mix'n'match past type for example. I didn't know that even the pasta is made from scratch until reading some of the reviews. One afternoon I have decided to bring my friends. Gosh we were hungry that time :-) We ordered tree pastas. - the beef one: very hearty, I like more spicy food, this is mild and filling; - the goat cheese one: no spice either; cheese is making it very creamy; - the dill one: I loved the idea of dill in Italian pasta; but with an extra order of chicken as topping the portion was underwhelming. At the end of the day we thought it was good but only worth to come once and that's it since the ratio price for value wasn't exceptional. Upon getting off the table two chefs approached our table (I assume they overheard our verdict) and offered free deserts: - panna cotta and coconut semolina cake with pistachios. With this I think they have won me over and I will come at least one more time. Now that I think about it. In the direct surroundings of the restaurant it is probably the best place to go for a pizza pick up since you can't measure it with Pizza Pizza or King Slice - lol!

Thank you Levetto to be so down to earth and trying some tricks on the customers to feel special!"}
{"text":"So my initial experience at Levetto was a bit underwhelming. However, I tried it for a second time after management assured me it'd be better. Not only was my initial concerns about the Rigatoni quelled by management but I had the pleasure to try the dessert and wad thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and just like my first visit the food was amazing. This time I ordered a smoked bacon pizza with arugula and toasted almonds. The arugula was placed on top and not cooked into the pizza. Love that. The sauce was sweet and flavourful. It's had dates or fig in it. The sprinkling of toasted almonds was such a surprise treat. Had one slice in the car. Can't wait to get home and have some more - perhaps with a plate and a glass is wine versus the top of the pizza box on my lap. 

Highly recommend the salads and pasta. Great portions and prices and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Having lived in Rome, I am a pasta snob....I've  had the bucatini amatriciana and the carbonara...both delicious and authentic"}
{"text":"I stopped in because I had a wicked pasta craving but wasn't expecting too much. The person at the counter (Alyssa) expertly guided me through the menu and aided my decision (Trecce). She was very positive and set a great tone to my visit. The food took under 10 mins to prepare and I was blown away by the sizeable dish. From the homemade pasta to the fresh ingredients, it was very balanced and flavourful. 

So glad something this tasty and affordable opened up in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Went there Friday night for a Margherita pizza for take out.  Comes in two sizes, small rectangle and large rectangle.  Order didn't take long as it was relatively early and they weren't too busy yet.  

The pizza looked great and can't complain about the taste.  I'm however not crazy about the focaccia/crust that they use.  To me it ends up being airy and dry.  The middle soaks up the sauce, cheese but the outside doesn't get much and dries up.  If I were to guess, I'd say the crust/bread is baked or sourced somewhere else before hand and then assembled and baked again in the oven as the orders come.  It makes sense, it simplifies things and speeds up the orders as only the cheese/sauce needs to melt rather than bake the dough.   I'm just not sold on it."}
{"text":"Disappointed! 
We went there early Saturday evening after reviewing some of the comments on Yelp. The website had great pictures the menu looks pretty great and the prices was also great. We thought it was a casual dining restaurant. we didn't mind the self seating and the ordering of our meal from the cash at the front. When we got there was a big screen TV showing how the pasta and a pizza were made and it all look really fresh and delicious. However to our surprise the pizza dough with already pre made (cooked) and all they did was put fresh toppings on it and rebuked it in the oven. That to me is not fresh. Fresh means the pizza dough is made to order. The only thing fresh was the toppings and the freshly grated cheese on my pasta . This is equivalent as you could get to getting a frozen pizza and putting it in the oven at home. The pasta  we ordered was  Carbonara and they claimed to have it made it fresh however it did not taste fresh more like the pasta was pre cooked.  For a Saturday night when we ordered there were already items that were already sold out or didn't have enough ingredients to make it so that was disappointing and limited our choices on the menu to order . The staff was friendly and courteous but all in all this experience was much like eating at a mall food court."}
{"text":"I'm honestly completely obsessed with Levetto, when we first discovered this place we ate there 3 times in a week.  
I agree that the service is somewhat confusing but we figured it out pretty quickly.  
Portions of the pasta are great, I can usually put away half my pasta to eat later and the price is fantastic. 
I really like the Carbonara and Trecce pasta's and the Smoked Prosciutto pizza. 
Honestly that's the only pizza I've had there because thinking about it is what usually makes me think of eating here."}
{"text":"The delivery of our order took an hour and a half and was freezing cold. The staff and the manager were not very professional and simply offered a $25 voucher then told me they would call me back later."}
{"text":"Awesome pasta, decent priced, and open on Sundays as some places are not (Fusaro's). Had great Pomodoro, can't say anything bad about it. Definitely a new favorite in town."}
{"text":"Great food, and welcoming atmosphere! I definitely frequent this place :)"}
{"text":"The food is top quality and prepared well. It's not pretentious and the portions are generous. They even treated us to a desert. Pizza and pasta I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Deliciously fresh Italian food. I've driven out here and had lunch on maybe three or four occasions and dinner once. Each and every time,  it has been either empty or partly busy but it has a good flow of customers picking up takeout orders and can fill up quickly. They have a good sized menu - not too big so you know their stuff is fresh and not too small that even finicky or diet restricted diners can find something.  There's  a list of salads, a list of pastas and a list of pizzas, all reasonably priced and all a good sized serving. Three adults sharing a salad,  a pasta and a medium pizza leave full and content for around $35. The pizza is a thicker Roman - style crust, not a thin Neopolitain crust, but amazingly good. Worth the drive to get there and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Awesome place - pasta was a 5 star (trecce was well made with nice balance of taste and a nice spice kick). As for pizza, I usually don't like thick crust, but the dough was really light and tasty. Be warned, portions are huge and it is hard to stop:)"}
{"text":"Great food - gracious when we had a special request! Loved the pea pesto pasta - subtle and different! Will go back."}
{"text":"Recommended by my daughter, I find this place is one of a kind.
More like a fast food type service but very good food. Staffs are friendly too.
Freshly made pasta makes the my order completely diff.
Will come back again"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location!  I had a salad, pasta, and pizza.  There was a large group of us and Levetto accommodated us perfectly.  The person serving us was really nice and patient. 

It is a super cool spot that is right downtown.  Id say one of the best restaurants in the city.  The food is so good and very well priced.  The portions are plentiful as well!  It is literally some of the best Italian I have ever tasted.  The coconut dessert was really different and super tasty.  I also highly recommend the pasta with the sweet peas.  

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever! Ask for extra sauce bottom.  Their crust is light and fluffy but crispy. Please trust me and try it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Uber Eats Toronto Review:

So I've ordered from Levetto 3 times now via Uber Eats. I'm an extremely picky reviewer and I have to say, they have knocked it out of the park all 3 times. Ordered at lunch, 7pm and 9pm, always the same, always consistent.

The carbonara is my personal fave. Right amount of cheese, right amount of bacon (guanciale if you will) and not overly creamy. I crave this pasta. We've tried the rigatoni, the bucatini, all great, can't go wrong. The pizza, as many have mentioned, is the real star. From the margherita to the pollo to the duck, all 3 have been memorable in their own right with an amazing crust to boot.

Now, here's where they go above and beyond. Each time we've ordered, they've included complimentary panna cotta's. I know, I know, what's the big deal. Beyond the fact that it's a wonderful touch at the end of a meal and that it's FREE, it's also a nice surprise. I had my parents over for dinner and ordered Levetto in and they were just in awe that a restaurant would do this. Since it's free, I'm assuming it's a \"throwaway\" if you will.. nope, quality, flavour and texture, all ON POINT. In line with the rest of the meal.

Overall, I'm always pessimistic when ordering from these new delivery services, but due to work/life balance, I often finding myself relying on them. I, along with Uber Eats, have a gem here."}
{"text":"I went to this place expecting and was a bit hesitant at first because of the lack of tables and counter ordering service. After I figured out what the place was all about I started to realize what I smart idea it is and was excited to try the food. Ordered pizza and pasta and was not disappointed. The pizza was crunchy and flavorable and the pasta was just amazing. Great place for when you're on the go and good prices and portions too! A must eat."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend last week. The food was so much better than i expected. Really big amount i couldn't finish it and really tasty also very affordable. 
The menu is a little limited but if you want something not on the menu like fettuccine Alfredo just ask for it and they will make it.  
This place was so busy ! the amount of take away they deal with is crazy. 
The only reason i gave a 4 star is because they were so busy they were unable to deal with the people who wanted to sit in, so we pretty much had to fend for ourselves. 
So i would suggest going on a different night the staff said it was busy thur, fri & sat."}
{"text":"Great food and you cant go wrong whether you are in mood for a lighter fare salad or hearty pasta. Pizza is amazing with a crust that is just out of this world. Make sure to leave room for tiramisu as dessert, I'm sure you leave a clean plate , yum!"}
{"text":"I was told to visit this place from a friend living on dovercourt. He explained it simply as a proper Italian establishment with great flavours. One day after a miserable drive home from work I decided that I would bury myself in carbs and fall into a food coma. I ordered the Carbonara and Rigatoni pasta. Boy was I not disappointed. Both of the dishes were plentiful and full of flavour! My gf and I split each dish down the middle and were easily able to finish all the food. That being said we were completely full and comfortable in our \"comfy clothes\". We will definitely go back and try their pizza this time."}
{"text":"It used to be one of my favourite pizza restaurant in thronhill wood. I give 1 star since it really really disappointed me for many times this summer.

1. Not sure whether they changed the chief. The quality of the pizza went down sharply. They started to put less ingredients on the pizza to save some money but it is ruining the taste.

2, The pasta is fresh cooked. However, they charge 4$ to add chicken breast (5 slices of chicken) on a 10$ medium size tomato sauce only pasta.

3. I ordered an affumicato last week and the bacon is really burned! I showed to them and they said it is smoked bacon and it should be that way. Come on, can you change your menu to burned black bacon!

4. They only have one old paper pic menu left and put the sign \"don't take it\". A customer stand besides me picked up that menu want to discuss with his wife, the cashier yelled \" Sir, Please don't take it with you\". Lol , come on, too poor to get more copys of order menu?"}
{"text":"First time here and I was beyond impressed!! Location is small and cozy.  Came on a Saturday night for a quick dinner with my husband and my sister and her family. We started with an arugula salad with dried apricots and pumpkin seeds, followed by a plate of pasta each. Salad was huge and bursting with flavour,  and the pasta (which is made fresh daily) was divine. Sauces are fresh and loaded with deliciousness. Pizzas are amazing, crust light and fluffy and crispy. Staff here are so friendly, attentive and accommodating.  I will definitely be coming back!!!! Keep up the great work Levetto!!!"}
{"text":"Great taste, fast and attentive service. 
We had two pizzas: smoked prosciutto (was very good, kind of too sweet for our taste, but overall was a good experience), and a soppressata (this one was fantastic). We also ordered a Carbonara, which was really good as well.
I will be back many other times."}
{"text":"Best funghi pizza I've ever had! A mountain of mushrooms with garlic white sauce absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch.
Their funghi pizza is awesome. Make sure to check in using Yelp mobile app to get one free dessert.
We also tried Carbonara Pasta and Patate pizza.
They were very tasty too."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Rigatoni and fungi Roma pizza recommended. As they mention, the pizza are more like a deep pan crust. For dessert, we tried the panna cotta which was not too sweet( just how I like it) but unfortunately seem to have split. Not the best, but it was free with yelp. The environment is a little canteen-like, good for lunch, take out and casual brisk dinner.  Underground public parking near by. Priced right, good portions."}
{"text":"Levetto is a welcome new entrant into the fast casual dining space and has just opened two locations in the west end of Toronto including one in the Art Condo building on Sudbury street (this is the location that I visited). 

The menu is comprised of pastas and pizzas, and salads. 

The pizzas are roman style, with a airy, crispy (and almost lightly fried) crust and toppings that range from traditional (margherita) to bougie (smoked prosciutto with medjool date sauce). All of them are very good but being a traditionalist with pizza my favourites were the margherita, the soppressata, and the affumicato (bacon + mushroom). 

Pastas feature in-house/from scratch noodles  and the portions are very big so go hungry (or take home some leftovers). Standouts for me are the spaghetti carbonara (they jam a lot of delicious bacon in there), cavatelli with pea pesto (very fresh spring flavours) and the bucatini with spicy tomato sauce and guanciale (if you feel like bold flavours). 

As for salads, I haven't really tried them (you don't win friends with them) but I saw some one order the roasted radicchio salad and it looked delicious. 

Now full disclosure, I know the chef here, but that doesn't sway my opinion as I'd still be here all the time on nights that I don't feel like cooking (and every time I've been to the Sudbury location it has been jammed with local condo dwellers... so they must be doing something right). 

In short, the value prop is very strong as you are getting full service restaurant quality Italian delivered at a significantly lower price (and the chef staged at a Mario Batalli restaurant in NYC so his Italian cooking chops are good).  Toronto needs more places like this (ie. good, whole food that's inexpensive and served in a warm and unpretentious atmosphere). 

Check it out. Highly recommended.

{"text":"Trambusto is a newly opened, modern-Italian entrant into the rapidly growing fast casual dining space (ie. the space that falls between fast food and full service with Panera being the most prominent example). 

The menu is divided into salads ($8-$9), house-made pastas ($8-$12), and Roman-style square pizzas ($6-8/$10-14/$20-28 for individual, shareable and group sizes respectively).

My wife and I got a chance to go here for the soft opening about a week ago as we are friends with the Executive Chef for the company. As a result we got to sample a number of the dishes and were able to a good idea of the menu. Dishes we tried  were:

1) Panzanella - tomato, spinach and Fior di Latte salad with house made focaccia croutons. 

2) Bucatini all Amatriciana - bucatini pasta with a big flavoured, slightly spicy red sauce with bacon and red onion

3) Cavatelli pasta with a sweet pea pesto, fresh ricotta and truffle oil (the latter of which gave this dish a luxurious touch - it was my personal favourite).

4) Smoked Prosciutto pizza with Mejool Date sauce, arugula and toasted almonds

5) Affumicato pizza - pizza with good quality smokey bacon, tomato sauce, mushrooms and scallions

6) Patate pizza - a white pizza with potatoes, ricotta, rosemary and truffle oil

In short, we had a great experience at Trambusto with each of the dishes exceeding our expectations in terms of their quality.

I thought the menu was well balanced, with some creative pastas (eg. sweet pea pesto) sharing space with more traditional offerings (such as a traditional spaghetti with pomodoro sauce, a rigatoni with Wellington county beef ragu etc.). The portion sizes were generous (with pasta being enough for a standalone lunch/dinner and a shareable pizza being enough for two people to comfortably split) and perhaps most importantly the ingredient quality in each dish was also very high with an obvious focus on keeping things fresh (eg. house-made pastas, good tasting produce) and high quality (eg. truffle oil, real Fior di Latte etc). 

All in all, the value proposition at Trambusto is very good, with full-service restaurant quality food being delivered at a fraction of the full service price. 

I think this concept is going to prove to be very popular, and with several additional locations in the works this will likely be soon coming to an area near you so stay tuned. 

Highly recommended.

{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today with the hubby after my friend recommended it to us.  She had tried their location at Liberty Village and raved about their funghi pizza. 

This location is pretty small and has maybe 5 tables and a bar area.  You order at the front first and then they serve the food you.  It looks like it's more of a take out place than a sit down restaurant.  

Interestingly, the menu they had on display didn't have the funghi pizza and so I inquired about it and they said they do make it but it just wasn't up on the menu yet...not sure if it's just a new item to this location or something? They said that the funghi pizza would take about 30 minutes and so we decided to order it and take it to go and order some other things to eat there instead. 

We ordered the panzanella salad and the carbonara.  

1) Panzanella salad: Delicious and very large.  It had an abundance of baby spinach, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced red onions, foccocia croutons and buffalo mozzarella and a light olive oil based vinaigrette.  Altogether, perfect start to a meal.  Wasn't too heavy and was perfect for sharing for two. 

2) Carbonara: The pasta is freshly made and you could definitely tell - it had the perfect chew.  Fresh pasta makes such a huge difference to the dish.  It came with a ton of bacon and had a nice creamy sauce.  Overall, really good dish.  I was worried it would be too salty because some other reviewers said the bacon made the dish too salty but in fact we thought it was perfect. 

We tried to order the coconut cake as well but unfortunately they were out.  So instead, they gave us a panna cotta on the house (so we got 2 panna cottas instead of one coconut cake).  I don't think my husband and I have ever actually had a panna cotta before and we really didn't know what to expect.  We thought it was ok, had the texture of flan or the Chinese tofu dessert (tofu fa) and had a very strong cinnamon taste to it.  There were some macerated berries on top.  Overall, not our favourite but we really didn't expect to get a free extra dessert so customer service was fantastic. 

We got the medium funghi pizza and of course couldn't help but have a piece before we left the restaurant.  The crust is thick and crispy.  It's reminiscent of foccocia bread to be honest.  There are a ton of mushrooms on top with shredded parmesan cheese.  We felt it was like eating cream of mushroom on a crispy pizza crust.  Also, we felt it wasn't flavourful enough and needed some salt and pepper.  Once we added some salt and pepper, it was near perfect. 

Overall, we both really enjoyed Levetto and would totally come back if we needed a pasta fix. The price was decent for the amount of food that we got - overall we spent I think 41 dollars for everything including 2 drinks.  Definitely one of the better Italian places we've tried and dare I say it was better than Mercatto and Terroni's downtown."}
{"text":"This place is another proof that quality food does not need to come with a high price tag. The food reminds me of my trip to Italy. In fact, they import the flour from Italy for some of the dishes. Affordable and delicious. We very much enjoyed fresh pasta and tiramisu. I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best lunch place in the area I've found so far. It's not pretentious the staff are friendly and helpful and the things I've had there have been very good. They definitely shine especially when compared to other places I've tried in the area!"}
{"text":"My favourite pasta by far is the Rigatoni which is slow braised beef in tomato sauce with hand made pasta. What a great place, I recommend a store expansion as it would be even better if the restaurant was bigger. Thanks for always having great customer service and having great, quality food. I LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Went to Levetto for lunch. Let me tell you, exceptional pizza. Real top notch stuff. The crust is thick and doughy (if that's your thing), but crisp on the outside. The toppings? Equally fantastic. The cheese was plentiful and stringy, while the veggies were crisp and succulent. We also had a salad to split (they don't have individual size salads, which would have been nice), and it was fantastic. So all in all, an amazing dining experience.

However, it's time for the \"sandwich\" part of \"compliment sandwich\". The service was just truly horrible, and not in the way where the food comes out a half hour late. Our server was prompt and efficient. She was also exceptionally sassy, coming across as angry and condescending. In fact, the general mood of the staff can be best described as \"overwhelmingly melancholy\". Frankly this didn't impact our enjoyment of the food, but it was frustratingly mediocre service.

All in all, definitely a recommendation, and very reasonably priced, but prevented from being over the top by the employees."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review back on the 10th of July, 2015. After my first ever review, the owner contacted me, and apologized for the quality of the food. He was very caring, and I must give kudos to him for contacting me. Not every owner out there contacts someone, and wants to follow up. The few who do, are the ones that do care about their customers, and their overall quality. 

I went back there today to give them a second try, and this time ordered the Tagliatelle pasta. My colleagues also came, and both ordered the Caesar salad and the Soppressata pizza. It was busy inside as it was lunch time, but we were able to get a table. After 10 or so minutes of waiting, the orders came in one by one. 

Well it was time to see if the quality of the taste had improved, and lo and behold it was. The pasta was cooked perfectly this time to my liking, the tomato butter sauce was great and tasty, not too light, not too heavy, and the sweat peas and grape tomatoes were cooked properly. I actually enjoyed my meal thoroughly, and left the plate empty. 

My colleagues also enjoyed their meals and so did I. I can definitely say that this time around, it was well worth the experience, and I will be coming back for more to satisfy my hunger."}
{"text":"I normally never write reviews. However, the last two times I've gone here I've been SO disappointed with the food quality and change in prices, and unimpressed with their service I just have to. 
About a year ago, my boyfriend and I discovered Levetto since we moved into a building down the street. And when we first ever tried it we couldn't believe how amazing it was and at such great prices! We raved about it to all our friends, and they all started going there as well and loved it... 
I'm not sure when all the changes went into place there, but we hadn't gone for a couple a months and decided to pop in for a quick dinner one night. And WOW were we disappointed! My favourite dish which was the Trecce used to be $7.50... it's now $11!? We used to be able to order two pastas and a small pizza to share for under $30. Our last visit, just ordering two pastas alone came to $30. And then on top of that they don't serve you, we had to ask for cutlery and water, and waited for our food for over 30 minutes... and it wasn't even busy. 
I noticed a couple other reviews of regulars who feel the same disappointment as I do with their service, quality, and prices. It's truly so disappointing. And for people who never got the chance to experience Levetto before all these changes, it's really unfortunate. I don't ever want to waste my time or money going back there."}
{"text":"Had a problematic experience previously. The owner of the restaurant contacted me and it has now been resolved.

Went to the restaurant with a couple of my friends and the food was amazing. Definitely recommend the rigatoni and fungi mushroom pizza!"}
{"text":"Brand new business in Richmond Hill and a nice welcome for fast, tasty gourmet Italian eatery.  In the brief time since its opening, Trambusto has been gaining a reputation as a tasty fast food Italian eatery and the place to try even if it is a bit out of the way.

Former Premier, Mike Harris is one of the backers and this location is the test location. The goal is to have over 20 locations in the GTAA over the next several years and the intent is to revolutionize fast food/pizza joints. Pizza joints with a liquor license!!

I had the fennel salad and my lunch date had the roasted radicchio salad with chicken. We split a pizza and I have to say, it was delicious.  Being of Italian background I'm picky as hell when it comes to my tomato sauce and my pizza crust.  I had no complaints.  Salads were a generous size in nice deep bowls and one pizza was enough for two people and it was hot and crunchy and served on a wooden cutting board.

When in the 905 area check this place out. I had only 30 mins to order and eat. I was impressed and the wait staff were welcoming.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Levetto offers a very casual dining experience where one can come and enjoy some hearty food. The portions are plentiful and reasonably priced but overall the food lacks depth and flavour.

We ordered the Carbonara and the Cavatelli pasta dishes which were both a little on the bland side. The pasta was perfectly al dente, there was the right amount of sauce but the flavour unfortunately, was not good enough to bring us back.

The staff are very friendly and service is excellent.

Ambience: 3.5/5  
Staff & service: 5/5

{"text":"What a surprise it was to find this little gem in the suburbs. Consistently delicious meals and friendly service. A must to check out for pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"Small joint but good eats! The only thing that caught my attention was the messy front counter..."}
{"text":"This location is listed as wheelchair accessible, but it is not. My boyfriend and I did not try the food because we wasted time getting here only to find it had a huge step. Keep this in mind if you have accessibility needs; the website lies."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch during the week. The pizza was good , crispy on the outside and soft and rich in flavor closer to the center. Came with a friend and shared a small Peking duck pizza and a carbonara pasta. Pasta was okay not bad but probably coming back to try out the different pizza options! 
Also vibe was nice kinda empty for the rush hour lunch time but I was fine with it since my friend and I could actually chat without having to scream across the table."}
{"text":"Delivery was so disappointing. Pizza wasn't even cooked. Tasted Iike raw dough. Very disappointed considering I went out of my way to order from them through Foodora."}
{"text":"Good food in the suburbs can be hard to find, but this place is definitely a winner.  The food is great, but it really is the balance of price and quality that makes this place a true winner.  

The pasta is fresh made, the pizza is on point and the service is very friendly.

Great location for a family dinner, I will definitely try take out next."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Everything is made fresh to order. Rigatoni was amazing! Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Price point is very good as well. a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Clean spacious despite the relatively small space. Many interesting pizza and pasta options. If you like the flat bread style crust and cool ingredients this place is for you. We got the pizza Salsiccia pasta  tagliatelle with lobster. The pizza was great the lobster was a tad fishy but much better than other places I've had it. Service was quite friendly.  We also got the pannacotta for desert.  Our table-mates got the tiramisu but they thought the our pannacotta was better."}
{"text":"Great place around the corner from us. We drive by this place all the time and finally decided to go in. Pizzas were tasty and made on the spot and quickly. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to Levetto for the first time today. Had the carbonara and the smoked proscuitto pizza. They were both great. The carbonara had a generous amount of bacon and it was not too heavy. The pizza crust was nice and soft. The atmosphere was open and friendly since it's an open kitchen. Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"There's quality in the food here. Fresh food is always served and delivery people are always pleasant. There nothing bad to say about this establishment. Our work will cater from here once and a while, so that's how I discovered Levetto. My personal favorite?  The margherita  pizza! Saucy, but not too saucy,  the perfect amount of cheese and topped with garnish. Brownie points for symmetrically cut squares."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to Sudberry location and I ordered a pizza ,the chef was the Indian girl and I really got the best pizza ever On levetto history, I do commend you guys to visit the store on Friday night because they have the best chef  she can make pizza on GTA
I love levetto"}
{"text":"Ok, I have tried many Italian restaurants of different price range and I got to say, this is by far the best pizza I have ever had. And I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it. My friend suggested this place, it was kind of out of the way, out in Liberty Village but now after trying it, I want them to bring it to my neighbourhood!

The set up is, there are seatings to eat, you order up in the front and they will bring the food out to your table. Their portions are quite generous. Between the 3 of us, we ordered a small pizza and 2 pastas and we couldn't finish it.

Funghi pizza - Portobello, oyster & cremini mushrooms with mascarpone, roasted garlic crema. It smell so good and tastes so good. The crust was crispy, it wasn't super thin but it was baked perfectly, not too dry and crispy. The toppings was filled with pieces of variety mushrooms. The mascarpone merged in perfectly with the mushrooms and the roasted garlic was so delicious. It really bring out the mushrooms and made the difference between the other pizzas I have had. We regret not ordering a bigger one so that we can have more.

Carbonara pasta - Smoked bacon, cracked black pepper, egg, scallion, grana padano. Another delicious dish, freshly made pasta, chewy and not soggy. Not too creamy, crispy bacon mixed with egg and scallion. It was so good, the only comment would be that it got cold pretty quick.

Trecce - Garlic infused olive oil, chili flake, sundried tomato, goat's cheese, arugula. I am not a fan of goat cheese but the dish was still delicious mixed in with the sundried tomato and olive oil. Having fresh pasta really makes the difference. We were so full and satisfied with our meal. When the bill came, I was actually shocked at how inexpensive it was. Didn't have to pay the high end price yet the food was much better. The service was great as well. I'm still craving more of that pizza right now. Need to make another visit soon. :)"}
{"text":"First came to this street mall.  From the outside look, it seems like a restaurant, but indeed it is more cater for take out. There are only 5 tables inside the store plus the bar area.  As there is no double door for this winter, sitting there is quite an cool experience. I can see all people with their outerwear on.

The look of the kitchen is very stylish and modern.  Within such a small kitchen, there are 6 staff working there.  There is a big stacker pizza oven enough to bake at least 6 large size pizza.  

Rigatoni is with beef ragu, grana padano and chive. Using grana padano makes the pasta less salty than Parmigiano.  The base is a tomato sauce.  It is thick and with lots of beef ragu makes every piece of rigatoni comes with meat and sauce that is so tasty.

Salsiccia pizza with Italian sausage, tomato sauce, shaved fennel, roasted red
pepper, chili flake, black olive, Fior di Latte, fennel fronds.  The Fior di Latte is sticky that it doesn't seem to spread evenly on the pizza.  Surprise to us is the fennel on top of the pizza which tastes like cabbage.  Others like it a lot but average for me.

I will definitely try it for other items on the menu.  For the coming summer, it will be good to sit there to enjoy the atmosphere.  The price is between a take out place and a restaurant.  The quality of the food is better !"}
{"text":"Great little spot. 

Gf and I came a while ago on a cold night. Lots of tables to sit and eat, it seems 75% of the orders are takeout. I might be one of those in the future. Now that is not saying the service was low, it was good. I would just rather sit home and watch tv. 

I had Bolognese dish and it was great. Well made. Gf dish was good too."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Funghi pizza alone! So good that this was my first choice after a half marathon! Mushrooms were plentiful and the truffle oil was used just right! I made the order over the phone for a large pizza & was given a medium. After realizing we paid for a large they gave a large pizza on the house! Tried the Vaughan location and the Funghi pizza was a bit disappointing. This location has the best pizza"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant, with a very good value for money.
Dishes come in ceramic tableware, with stunning food plating.
Large range of Salads, Pastas and Pizzas. 
Obviously the Pizza is the main event, but the Pastas are pretty tasty as well.
The very modern look and feel of the place disconnects a little bit with the authenticity of the food. But except this little detail, I would definitely recommend Levetto for a true Italian dinner"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and had different pizzas. I have to say I don't see what the fuss is about, they use some sort of oil that gives the food an unpleasant taste that overpowers the actual pizza. I agree with comments about bad service."}
{"text":"I have my weekly craving for the spicy pizza. 
Always great service but always a line up.
Go à little early as you may wait to get in."}
{"text":"I rarely give reviews unless if they were really bad or exceptionally good. And this was exceptionally GOOD. Hands down the best pizza I have ever had! Service was great, place was clean and cozy. The smoke prosciutto pizza was AMAZING! Definitely will be back and try the other dishes :D"}
{"text":"Small place that feels more like a lunch cafeteria than a dinner restaurant, but the food was A++!! I usually like my pizza with thin crust but this one here has a thick, crunchy, wonderful crust. I am drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Levetto is my go-to place in Toronto when I'm craving Italian food. Great portions, fresh, reasonable priced, it's just a reliable place to get my Pasta or pizza fix.

The rigatoni is by far my favorite, but the carbonara and the bucatini are also delicious. The tagliatelle left me craving more though.

Pizza wise, the crust had that beautiful crisp that comes from oiling the pan- soooo good. I like the affumicato or the funghi best. the smoked prosciutto has a very sweet fig or date sauce which is delicious but since I personally wasn't anticipating it, it threw me off the first time I tried. Worth tasting though for something new and different. 

Salad wise, the panzella and the roasted radicchio are recommended"}
{"text":"Levetto is a fabulous casual eats restaurant just north of Kensington. They have a nice focused menu offering Italian food at reasonable prices. I had the peking duck pizza and my friend had a carbonara. Both were well cooked and seasoned. I loved the flavour in the Peking Duck Pizza with crispy duck skin and duck meat. The tomato sauce was replaced by a sweet and salty glaze. Overall a mouthwatering dish. 

We shared a tiramisu for dessert which was less appetizing. They used madelines soaked in espresso however we found that the madelines were actually frozen not fresh and they hadn't been fully defrosted prior to being served to us. It was disappointing to say the least. 

Overall would definitely go back for the mains but maybe hold off on the dessert."}
{"text":"Came here one night when I was seriously craving for some carbs. My boyfriend lives nearby and we decided to stop by for dinner. 

We ordered the Carbonara for our pasta - it came with an abundance amount of bacon which I did not mind at all -  I loooove bacon. Very tasty with black pepper, scallion and cheese. The portion size was huge as well.  

For our salad, we got the Panzanella - grape tomatoes, croutons, red onions, spinach and basil. It was dressed nicely and complimented our pasta very well.

We also ordered a small soppressata pizza (spicy soppressata, basil, and tomato sauce). If you havent noticed, we wanted to pig out. We weren't able to finish the pizza, but if I had more belly space I would have devoured it in seconds. 

Levetto is a take out style joint so you order and pay first then you can enjoy your meal after. For the price, its a fanastic deal for what you get. The food is top quality as well. As Schwarzenegger would say... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while browsing on yelp. One of our best finds yet! As a mushroom lover, I had to try their funghi pizza. One bite in and I had died and went to mushroom heaven. The combination of he freshly grated Parmesan, truffle oil, variety of mushrooms and marscapone was amazing. The pizza was so airy and fluffy I felt like I was biting into a crispy cloud. Also ordered the affumicato pizza, which didn't compare to the funghi, but was still good, and the carbonara pasta. The made from scratch pasta was perfectly cooked to al dente and had fresh ingredients. We also tried the coconut cake and tiramisu - both so good. I am so impressed with this place. Dishes are priced well, excellent value for money. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Saturday night with no reservations, welcomed by friendly staff. Seating area is relatively small, but bright and casual/informal. Order at the counter including beverages, then staff bring water and food once ready to your table. Take-out was brisk as well, about 30-40% of the food being prepared. One salad (Roasted radicchio), and two medium (6 slice) pizzas (spicy Soppressata, and Funghi). Salad was prepared and presented almost immediately, and was huge - enjoyed all but the radicchio - a bit too bitter for diners taste - but enjoyed nonetheless. Pizzas followed quickly as well, and ingredients were notably fresh, and very tasty. The spicy sausage was just that, and tomato sauce perfect. We will definitely return to try the pasta. Recommended for pizza/pasta lovers!"}
{"text":"One of the best pasta places I've ever eaten at in the GTA. Their pasta is made fresh everyday! It's well seasoned and has an incredible texture that springs back with every bite. Their pizza is also off the hook! Baked on a more breaded style crust, it's crispy texture and delicious flavor leaves you wanting to finish every last bite! Highly recommend the Funghi Pizza! Also LOVE that they don't bake the basil into the cheese for their margarita pizza, so fresh! Huge salads, enough to stand as their own meal or be shared. All this goodness comes at a price that is too good to be true! You'll never expect to pay over $18 for any single item, even if you choose to add lobster as a topping! Their portions are well weighed; a pasta and sharing a small pizza will fill you up nicely.

There is not a lot of seating because it's more of a canteen/takeout style environment. The staff are really friendly too. STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU HAVE YOUR MEAL AT THE RESTAURANT! We've had takeout a few times but I feel like the steam inside the containers changes the pasta's texture slightly."}
{"text":"Had the beef ragu rigatoni. Was pleased to hear they could easily make without added salt. Pasta cooked perfectly. Delicious."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great. The date sauce on the pizza is excellent. Supeissata pizza also great.
Winter salad fresh and tasty. iInteresting menu items.  Thanks to Lewis the server for awesome service."}
{"text":"We went there on a friday nite.  It was packed with people. I was standing in line and realize how understaff they are.  Regardless of that, these staffs are still friendly and be efficient as much as possible.  :) 

We sat down for a table and ordered a Rigatoni pasta, affumicato pizza, and the tiramisu.
 
The rigatoni pasta was amazing.  The sauce was just so good.  The pizza tastes good, yet because we both liked thin crust, so we thought it would be better if it was on a thin crust! 

So the tiramisu came. It doesnt look like traditional tiramisu but it tastes great!!  With the berries on top, never knew it would be that tasty!!! 

We will come back again!"}
{"text":"Came on Tuesday for dinner with a few friends, the place was pretty quiet and casual. I ordered carbonara (14 before tax & tip) and it was good. The portion sizes are pretty fair, I was able to save some for take-out. As part of the yelp promotion I also got a free panna cotta which was pretty good, they had a raspberry (sparkling?) sauce that paired really nicely with the creamy panna cotta."}
{"text":"You order than you go to your table and the food is brought out to you. I ordered the carbonara, romaine cesar and bacon and mushroom pizza. The carbonara had green onions on it instead of parsley which was not a good mix. The pasta tasted like packaged ramen noodles. Flavours were so off. Cesar salad was not worth $9. You had to toss your own salad but the dressing was pretty thick. The pizza was ok. Will not be coming back. Some pros: restaurant was however clean and decent pricing overall for Italian food. The chef in the back making the pastas had some mad skillet skills"}
{"text":"We called for pick-up and the woman on the phone was polite and patient. I wanted the Funghi pizza but they were out of mushrooms. Instead we ordered the Verde (it was delicious with plenty of toppings) and the Pollo (also good but with fewer toppings... especially lacking in sundried tomatoes). We were told it would be ready in 15 minutes for pick-up but it actually took 30+."}
{"text":"Impressed. Everything from the pasta, to the pizza, to the dessert is fresh and made to order. I watched them dip the lady fingers in the amaretto for or tiramisu... Very delicious. Small pizzeria feel, table service not standard; but the service was accommodating just the same."}
{"text":"Excellent pizzas with simple, good-quality ingredients. I especially like the Funghi and Palate pizzas paired with a salad. As others have mentioned, the prices are really reasonable especially given the food quality. Two small pizzas and a salad to share with no drinks works out to $30 or so.

The ambience is quite casual and no-fuss. Nice for a weeknight meal and get-together with friends.

The only thing I think they could improve is letting customers know when they are out of certain ingredients. For example, yesterday night we ordered a grilled radicchio salad. There were a couple small pieces of radicchio, but it was largely a mixed green salad. On another visit, we ordered the panzanella salad which the menu lists as having basil leaves, but couldn't find (or taste) any when we received it. It's understandable that some ingredients may not be available due to the seasonal nature of the items, and we would probably have chosen other items on the menu instead."}
{"text":"Had this mad craving for spaghetti the other day, so I hit up this place on Yelp. They had an amazing online catalogue in which everything looked delicious, and I ended up ordering 1 pasta, 1 pizza, 1 salad, plus 1 desert. Yes, all for me;)
Of the 4 items, my favorite was by far the salad. Which was a surprise since salad isn't even real food in my books!! THAT's how good it was. It had strawberries and veggies in it, and came with the most delicious dressing EVER. A perfect balance of sweetness and sourness, and the texture was just incredible. The first bite reminded me of home, and I'm not even Italian!! Strawberry salad, you may just have converted me, I am officially a salad-lover now.
The other three items were sadly forgettable. The pasta was way too creamy, and they didn't even have vinegar in the kitchen?? Pizza was okay, only had potatoes on it so it was kinda boring. For dessert I chose panna cotta, and again, it was very rich. Fortunately the blueberrries on the side had enough sourness to balance it out, as I managed to finish this one.
Overall it was a solid meal, nothing was particularly bad, and that salad REALLY stood out. The interior was nice, lots of natural light and food that actually look appetizing! And you just gotta love the price. Will definitely return again to try out other items on the menu:)"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are generally pretty good 4/5, and pastas are not bad 3.5/5 (not as good as 100% hand made pasta - a bit harder and less \"chewy\"). But their service really leaves something to be desired 1/5. 

We've been to the restaurant 3 times. First time was an okay experience. The second time we were waiting at the door for 5 minutes without anyone coming up to greet/seat us, so my wife and I just left (I promise we didn't look like we were there to cause trouble or get a free meal =P). The third time, it took us a while to get seated, which was fine, but it took way too long to get our bill. We asked our waiter and another waiter twice for our bill, while our waiter just stood at the cash machine looking puzzled for what was at least 15 minutes, occasionally talking to/serving take-out customers (they were not any busier than usual). I decided to just walk up to pay only to be told that he would bring the bill to our table. Finally, when the bill came and I took out my credit card, he said, \"can you please come up to cash and pay?\". I exchanged a puzzle look with my wife and we both laughed. We really haven't experienced something like this in a while. Now we're left wondering whether we should ever revisit the restaurant.

Levetto management, please train your staff better!"}
{"text":"Food: 9/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 9/10

5 stars for what it is - a fantastic place to come if you're looking for a casual dining experience, but great food. 

I opted for the carbonara pasta (loads and loads of bacon!) and my friend chose the cavatelli. Both portions were more than generous and we had to pack leftovers to take home.

Worth checking out their website as they have beautiful images of all their food so you can really pick with your eyes - www.levetto.com

The service is very casual. If you're dining in, you pick your seat and order at the counter, but they do bring your food to you.

THE BOTTOM LINE: take it for what it is - a casual Italian dining experience with really great food."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when my friend suggested Italian food on Spadina (Chinatown). Man oh man, blown away!!! Such fresh pasta and pizza. The pizza dough was so fluffy but crispy, and oh so buttery. The noodles were prepared perfectly and magically absorbed all the yummy flavours of the other ingredients. Definitely going back to Levetto in Chinatown. Almost forgot to mention that the service was top notch! Great experience :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have eaten at Trambusto twice now.  The first time, just the two of us, and most recently with our 3 kids in tow.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the food is fantastic, and the price point is equally great.  Their staff is professional, efficient and very courteous. It's obvious that they've invested and developed a great hiring and training process.

This location is very small, but if you do have to wait for a table, you can have a glass of wine, or a beer at a reasonable price.  They offer 4 wines (two red, two white) all very fairly priced at $25 for a bottle.  There are also a couple of different beers to choose from.  In my opinion, this is a truly great concept (great, affordable food, lower overhead of a small location) when you factor in the high amount of residential devolpment in the area.  From what I've seen on my visits, they're building a very good take-away business.  

The pasta is made fresh daily, and the quality of ingredients is very good.  I would put any of their pizza or pasta options on par with higher end Italian restaurants that are happy to charge far more than Trambusto.

Of the dishes that we've tried so far, my personal favorite is the Rigatoni which features a braised beef ragu, which is both hearty, and utterly delicious.  As of our visit on Saturday, by girlfriend has decided that the Spagetti alla Carbonara is going to be her \"go to\" cheat meal.

We've tried 4 different pizzas, and they are all equally delicious.  The crust is very light and has a nice crisp finish.  My favourite pizza is the Affumicato, the kids loved the Margherita (plus dry-cured pepperoni).

My girlfriend and I eat very healthy during the week, and we've designated Saturdays as the day for our \"cheat meal\".  So far, Trambusto has taken the #1 spot on our list for that meal, as we can pretty much cover all of our carb-bases from their menu, without having to spend a ton of money doing so.

As of our visit Saturday, they've yet to offer dessert, but rumour has it there's a Tiramisu in the making.  I'm absolutely positive that it will be the final piece to gaurantee I fall into an incredibly deep and well deserved food coma.  If your cheat meal can't put you down for a couple of hours...you're just not doing it right...Trambusto is most definitely doing it right."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but I have tried this place twice at this location, a few months after its opening and a year later.  My friend and I ordered the Pollo Toscano and Salsiccia pizza on the first visit and second visit, I brought my mom with me to give this place a second chance and ordered the same thing.  Both times the pizza crusts were super dry and slightly burnt. The pizza itself was quite on the bland side and needed a touch more sauce. It was disappointing because I've tried the other location in Baden and my experience there was so much better.  The staff at this location needs to be a lot more hospitable in my opinion."}
{"text":"If I could, I would have given this place 6 stars! The food was delicious and exceeded my expectations. 

I had very high standards for this meal as Levetto was recommended by a friend. He brought us for dinner last night and ordered Romaine salad, Fungi and Peking duck pizza and Bucatini and Carbonara pasta for us to share. They were very accommodating as we had someone in our group that doesn't eat cheese/dairy. They put the cheese on the side of the pasta and only put cheese on half of the pizza.

The portions were quite generous and the flavors on point! Coming from NYC, I have to say, the pizza and pasta are solid. We all enjoyed our meal and appreciated how fast the food came out and how fresh everything was. The chili oil complimented the pastas really well and loved how fluffy and thick the crust of the pizzas are. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The place is tranquil, cozy for meet up or have a meal, with excellent food which of a fair prize"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for some time now. Decided I had to go after seeing my cousins snapchat of the delicious food as well as getting good reviews on their food. Went with my boyfriend for a date night on a weekday evening. As we walked to find the place it seems a little hidden on Sudbury street close to Dovercourt. The place was small but modern looking. There was a huge table occupied by a big group celebrating someone's birthday. 

We got seated at a communal long table with metal stools. We ordered the pasta Carbonara $10.50, the rigatoni with braised beef ragu  $13, a medium smoked prosciutto with sweet date sauce, fresh arugula, fior di latte, and toasted almonds $15, and got a free dessert for checking into yelp when dining at the location and we decided on the warm brown butter coconut semolina cake. 

Everything came out in a timely manner. The Carbonara was pretty good although bland tasting if you have the rigatoni first. The rigatoni was my favourite, it was full of flavour and quite meaty. The portions don't look so big but they are! The plates are just huge! Perfect for my bf since he has a huge appetite. We also really enjoyed the pizza. It was sweet and salty, crispy and airy. The dough reminded me of some sort of bread. I was able to eat it all, it was that good! My bf told me he found his new favourite Italian spot. 

The service was great, the waitress kept coming up and checking on how we were doing and how the food was. Not to mention the delicious free dessert that saved us $6
I would definitely come here again and recommend this place to other people as well!"}
{"text":"Good food - quick casual Italian halfway between a sit down restaurant and fast food. This particular location on Sudbury is kind of bare bones on the inside so may be better for takeout than dining in. They also serve wine and beer if you do decide to stay in but overall vibe is very casual and I found the interior to be almost  cafeteria-ish."}
{"text":"*UPDATED REVIEW*

I have upgraded my rating to 3 stars based on the food alone. I want to highly commend the owner and staff for their willingness to act on my customer feedback. That is a sign of a good business. 

Levetto's owner invited me to try the same meals again at their expense as the kitchen had been retrained. We went back to the restaurant on a quiet Sunday evening about a month after our initial visit (unannounced to have an unbiased experience). Both dishes were executed better. The Funghi pizza came with all the components and we could taste the garlic and cheese. It was overall enjoyable. The Cavatelli pea-pesto pasta was properly al dente. We could taste the dish as it was meant to be. Unfortunately, it just too bland for our taste. We also ordered the Trecce, a pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese, which was much more flavourful and overall enjoyable. We ended the meal with a very good warm brown butter and coconut cake (would have again) and a not very good (biscuit was too soggy, berries were freezing cold) white chocolate tiramisu. 

Levetto's still has some work to do but they are moving in the right direction! 

Customer service - 4 stars
Food - 3 stars 

***************
FYI My rating system is as follows:
1 star  - couldn't swallow the food 
2 stars - terrible food; we managed to swallow
3 stars - food was average
4 stars - good food; would eat here again
5 stars - great food; we're def coming back with friends

My rating is for food only. Decor and service are not part of my rating system. If I do happen to mention either, it's because they were either so outstanding or so horrible, they were worth mentioning. 

Now onto Levetto...

We ordered a pasta dish (Cavatelli) with pea pesto and a pizza (Funghi) with 4 kinds of mushrooms. 

The pizza did not have any marscapone or roasted garlic crema on it, although that was how the pizza was listed on their menu. The pizza consisted of mushrooms, bread and a light dusting of cheese (by that I mean mini dust particles). The entire thing lacked flavour. It was not worthy of the title \"pizza\". All this for 15$. 

The menu described the pasta dish as pea pesto, baby spinach, roasted red peppers, white truffle oil and a dollop of ricotta. The texture of the pasta was overdone. The flavour of the pasta had no balance. It tasted like mashed up peas and nothing else. The texture of said pesto was chunky and did not pair with the pasta. There were hardly any veggies in the dish (2 skinny pepper strands and 4 leafs of baby spinach). The ricotta added zero to the dish. The white truffle oil was nowhere to be found in terms of flavour. However, there was a huge amount of an unknown oil in the bowl and the pasta was literally floating in it. We ate a few bites and then left the rest. We never throw food away (too many hungry people in the world) but this time we had to. It was that bad. We didn't even want to take it home to try and fix it.

This restaurant's 4.5 star rating was the reason why I chose to visit this place. I should have read the more recent comments more closely before going. Recent reviews say that something has changed. Sadly, I ended up finding out the hard way."}
{"text":"Levetto opened a location in Chinatown recently and I was sceptical at the beginning. Italian food in Chinatown doesn't make much sense, until you remember that there are a ton of new condo buildings going up in the area.

In terms of food, it's fast-casual pizza and pasta. Nothing amazing but good quality food at reasonable prices. My go-to is the pasta carbonara which is easily enough for two meals, and it's pretty good value at $12.50. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza we ordered (the Soppressata). While the ingredients were of very high quality, I didn't find it had much flavour to it. Next time I'll try the Peking duck pizza, as I did pick the blandest pizza on offer after all.

While this Levetto is new and the staff are clearly still learning the ropes (slow service, meals coming out 15 minutes apart) the value and overall quality of the food earns them four stars in my books. Once they get the hang of things, I can see this place being one of the best places to eat in the area for delicious, good quality food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend yesterday for the first time. Its a relatively small place with about 4 tables or so only. I noticed most people ordered to takeout. 
My friend and I ordered the Carbonara pasta and the Fungi pizza. I personally enjoyed the pizza more as I love mushrooms. I normally prefer my pizza with some sort of tomato base, but this pizza tasted awesome without it."}
{"text":"Quiet clean space, friendly staff and Peking duck pizza!!!

I was skeptical about the Peking duck pizza, as Peking duck is not easy to make but after I've tried it, I know I would be coming back for more. The duck on it were definitely not Peking duck, but with cucumber, scallion and hoisin sauce it did a pretty good job on resembling Peking duck, replacing the thin rice tortilla with pizza dough and adding cheddar is such a clever idea. Cheddar goes surprisingly well with the hoisin sauce, cucumber and scallion makes the pizza quite refreshing, the crispy duck skin satisfied my junk food craving. This new twist on the traditional food is genius.

Funghi turned out to be exactly how I wish it would be. Creamy and full of shrooms, really don't know what else to say about it, it was good.

The only flaw I can think of was the pizza dough, tasted like they were pre made or reheated, it is probably just me tho...

Right now the hype is all about the Peking duck pizza, but the pastas here really worth a try. Pastas and salads here comes in a generous portion. I had the Cavatelli, mind blown... Tried some from my friend's bowl and kept me thinking about it all night. It is a lightly seasoned pasta with pea pesto, ricotta, red pepper, white truffle oil and baby spinach. I don't like peas but dayuuuum it was good

Other than the great food, what gave this oasis in Chinatown a solid 5 star is the service. Yay another pizza joint I will frequent.

Tips:
-Peking duck pizza is only available at the Chinatown location, it taste the best when hot and fresh
-Reservation is available, there is a table for 12 at the back of the store.
-Also available via ubereats and foodora."}
{"text":"Small and cozy place that serves EXCELLENT food!!  Pasta is super fresh, and pizzas are thin and perfectly made!  I think only this location serves the Peking duck pizza - which is amazing!!  We had that, the funghi/mushroom pizza, the proscuitto/arugula pizza, tagliatelle and carbonera pasta - all delish!!  Would def come back!  And service is awesome - both James and Nick, the restaurant owners, are lovely!  :)"}
{"text":"In the past I've had good experiences with Levetto, but recently the quality has really declined. Got the Trecce for takeout tonight and it was awful. The sun dried tomatoes were burnt, the pasta was brown and there was hardly any arugula. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I swung by Levetto tonight to check it out, since it's new to our neighbourhood. I had  the Funghi Pizza, which was delicious and an amazing value at 7$ for a \"personal\" size- a generous portion for one person. The toppings were super fresh and as I am a bit of a stickler for pizza crust, was happy to find it was served on a thin crust- still doughy but with a good crispness. 

An appropriate selection of wine and beer for the intimate space- four different wines, and two different Italian beers to choose from. I started out with the recommended  class of Chianti, which had a nice balanced sweetness and switched to try a bottle of Perroni Beer- both served well to complement my meal. 

As the main was so good, I couldn't help but finish off my experience with one of their three desserts, settling on the panna cotta and a espresso. Again a great portion- shared between myself and a friend- and a great blend of flavours between the berry coulis and subtle cinnamon finish. I cannot speak more highly of the staff- got a chance to speak with Chef/Manager German, as well as our server, who were beyond friendly and approachable. Thanks again guys for the amazing service and experience- will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"As being from New Jersey( pizza central in the USA) I gotta say this place has great pizza and great customer service."}
{"text":"I love Levettos, the pizzas and pastas are so gud. It tastes healthy, not sure if it is... Like that feeling of \"yo I ate some aesthetic health stuff\" kind of feeling? In pizza form? and it's, yes. Just, yes.
You have to order up front but that's no problem because it's not a big restaurant. 
The servers were super friendly. 
If only my house was planted right next to levettos. 
Yea I love it here."}
{"text":"I ordered the Carbonara pasta, Rigatoni pasta, and the Smoked Prosciutto pizza. I liked the consistency and texture of the Rigatoni pasta. The Carbonara pasta was a little bland but the bacon helped balance the flavour. The Smoked Prosciutto pizza had a nice thin crust and was quite tasty. We got the free dessert from the Yelp promo and ordered the coconut cake dessert. It was a little too sweet for my liking. Overall, I would come back again. The service was great!"}
{"text":"This is a great pasta and salad joint, I specially like how they hand make the pasta every morning before the restaurant opens. The portions and sizing are very generous and you definitely get what you pay for. It's a nice and convenient location though the inside is a little bit small. It's not like you're Typical sit down restaurant more of an order at the cash and then sit down cafeteria style. They have many different varieties of pasta is what you can top with many different sauces. The salads are also very extravagant and have many toppings and different styles. I find myself coming back at least once a week"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! 

I've been to the Levetto in Waterloo, and had high expectations for this location. 
And I was not disappointed!! The rigatoni was made to perfection; delicious meat sauce, just the right amount of parmigiana and HOME MADE PASTA!! Thinking about it makes me drool. 

I'll be back again!!!! Definitely recommend this hidden gem to all Torontonians!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food every time. I come here almost once a week and the food never disappoints. My favourite on their menu is the carbonara with fresh grated cheese. I have dined here and gotten delivery several times and never had a bad experience. The chef at this location is super friendly and he will make sure you get the best pasta whenever you come in.

The dining area is a bit small but very comfy and cozy. You'll always get a seat even without reservations. 

Love levetto! Can't wait to come back again for their famous carbonara. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love this levetto location! It's cozy and the food is amazing. The service is always so friendly here. This location has limited seating but they're not as busy here so you don't have to worry about not getting a table when you drop by!

I come here on a weekly basis to either dine in or get takeout and every time the experience was great. I love how all the levetto locations have the open kitchen concept where you get to see the chef cooking your food right infront of you. 

Their pastas are the best in toronto in my opinion. I love coming here when they have $5 wine specials! They also have a offer and deal for each day of the week too!

Love the food and service here! It's honestly top notch!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the LVRA I had heard of this place a couple of weeks back. Last night a few of us were feeling something but didn't know what and pulled up Yelp to see Levetto listed near by. We order the spicy Sopressata pizza, a Caesar salad and the Trecce pasta. We used he Yelp check in for a free tiramisu desert (woot!). 

Honestly some of the very best food I have eaten in a LONG while. My companions agreed. We were all enjoying the food so much we hardly spoke and has leftovers were today which were just as good. I can't imagine ordering pizza from anywhere else in the future, to be honest! I don't eat pasta all that often but whenever I crave it this will be where I go for that too. The pizza was crisp but fluffy somehow, mouth watering and scrumptious. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and basil... To die for. If I had to pick a least favourite it would have been the salad. Still good but compared to the pasta, pizza and desert very basic. Tiramisu was very tasty and the perfect end to an incredible meal. 

I highly suggest you check this restaurant out if you've not been and are considering. It blew me and my taste buds away!"}
{"text":"Had the pizza funghi, carbonara, pea pesto cavatelli and the rigatoni. Still daydreaming about the carbonara and the generous amount of bacon. I am literally salivating as I write this. Tried their tiramisu and panacotta for dessert which were both ridiculously delicious as well. It's amazing value, as the portions are huge and they don't skip on ingredients (BACON LOVERS).... please don't ever change! We came on a Tuesday night so were able to get seating for our party of 4. Be aware that seating is very limited."}
{"text":"Fast-casual dining. Good for takeout and if you are looking to have a quick bite. I had the smoked prosciutto pizza and a glass of wine, both which I would not recommend. My friend ordered the fungi pizza and it was a winner."}
{"text":"Reasonable priced pizza with good portions great for sharing and you can tell they put a lot of thought in the ingredients. The Fungi Pizza was amazing!! Decent restaurant to relax and chat with your friends, this restaurant is clean as well... which I find is quite rare in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"It's a tiny place, lots of take out orders seems like. Small numbers of seating available with both counter and tables. I loved the food. Around lunch time, lots of high school students come in, so if you want to sit down to eat, you might have difficult time.  Still, good food though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I've never been to a place where you get so much value! The fresh pastas are so delicious. Perfectly cooked pasta with fresh ingredients... And don't be fooled, the portion sizes are big! 

My date had the pomodoro. The sauce was very bright with fresh flavours... And for $8! Delicious. 

I had the Tagliatelle with butter tomato sauce ($10 with a $5 lobster add on). Though both were tomato sauce they had such different unique flavours! And I thought the lobster portion was definitely generous for $5!

Fungi pizza was to die for! So much flavour and a doughy, yeasty-yet-airy crust for lack of a better description! 

Our server/cashier (owner?) was super kind to us and brought a berry panna cotta for dessert on the house. WOW!!!!! Best panna cotta ever. So decadent, creamy and velvety with a tart berry sauce and some sort of cinnamony crisp on top! MUST HAVE!

This is a casual \"take out\" establishment which does not take reservations FYI. Top notch quality of food and super fast friendly service! I will have to resist from coming back weekly if I want to watch my figure!

If you didn't already gather from this GLOWING review... I HIGHLY recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite, although they have a sit down area as well. Food is good - I would come back."}
{"text":"Used to be an affordable place for a family meal but prices have gone up an incredible amount.  Will not be returning until this is reversed."}
{"text":"DD driver seeks refuge across the street @ Levetto!!  good eats,  great wine (just one glass) and excellent music!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, reasonably priced in a lovely location! Came by for lunch with a colleague and got the Funghi pizza (portobello, oyster & cremini mushrooms with mascarpone, roasted garlic crema) and it was amazing! The crust was incredibly fluffy (a little too thick though), the shareable portion was huge and reasonably price.

Delicious pizza - would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Simple self-serve Italian franchise just north of Chinatown. Everything about this restaurant is great:

1) Casual environment
2) Great food - homemade pasta and the Peking Duck Pizza!
3) Relatively quick
3) Reasonable Prices

I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they were overwhelmed on a Thursday night with Uber and other deliveries leading to a few issues that happened that affected my table. However, the franchise owner/manager was very kind and genuine and made it up to us by reimbursing me for my meal and offering us two desserts on the house. Because of these actions, the restaurant is now in my good books and exemplifies what a customer first approach should be like.

Some minor suggestions to the restaurant: 

1) Do not accept reservations if it is a self-serve operation
2) Not to sound cheap, but putting a tipping option in the credit card machine when some customers pay upfront may not be the best idea especially since it's self-serve. Difficult to assess service and food quality before sitting down to enjoy the meal. Either do not have a tipping option if customers pay upfront or have one if they pay once the service is rendered.

Definitely will come back here again because of the food and service, but hopefully some of the operational kinks will be ironed out. Since there is has been an uptick in food deliveries with all of these new apps, I hope they have a plan in place to ensure their service and food quality do not deteriorate."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!
We had the pollo toscano pizza and the carbonara pasta. Carbonara was good but nothing special but the pizza was really the seller.
Definitely wanna come back to try more!"}
{"text":"Delicious pasta, amazing pizza and a cozy atmosphere. They make the dough and pasta in house, and you can really taste it. We got the smoked prosciutto pizza and the carbonara pasta,  they were both so good! Fresh ingredients and the mix of flavours were just amazing. We had to order an extra carbonara pasta so we can take it home. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Usually really really good. However, today got the Trecce which I've head before and loved. This time I asked for pea pesto in it, which I've had recommended to me. It ended up being really dry and they forgot to put arugula. So its literally just pasta, pesto and sundried tomatoes. Really disappointed but the pizza is still great. Nice service."}
{"text":"I love levetto been here many times everything has been excellent each and every time I come here I went here a couple days ago again food was excellent ordered the mushroom pizza, rigatoni, Caesar salads and my friend ordered his pasta also. so food was excellent service was horrible. we ordered which was great we also had drinks it sat on the counter for a good 5 10mins before I just decided to get up myself because it obviously wasn't going to come. the food came which was great minis my friends pasta they completely left out the goat cheese when I asked the person behind the counter lied to me and said o I put it in its at the bottom but I'll give u more. there clearly wasn't any period. so what I love about levetto is that they offer u free dessert for checking in which my friends and I have always got. this time was different first he said he can only give us one of each because they were low, fair enough we had 6 people but we've always had no problem getting 1 per person. he brought only one to our table the coconut cake. I thought they were still prepping the other ones so we waited another 10 15 minutes finally realizing he wasn't going to make it even though he had all the ingredients on the table ready to be made. I never really thought much about service at restaurants but man I was very angry this time around. safe to say this will b a restaurant I'm going visit a lot less especially the Sudbury location."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I always get the mushroom pizza. I'll always come back to this restaurant I love this place and always recommend it to anyone for a quick dining pasta. Always yelp gives free desert if you check in!"}
{"text":"Incredibly fast service - the one server there last night was so efficient, friendly and unflappable. Simple, unpretentious decor. Some places overdo their sauces - not here. Your taste buds don't feel steamrolled with a million flavours. I loved the pizza crust, not thin crust, but delicious."}
{"text":"Levetto came to our attention when we were mindless looking for a casual dinner place after a long day of exam and meetings. A homemade pasta and pizza just sounds too good to pass, so we made our efforts to Levetto. 

It's mostly designed for takeouts (there were numerous takeout bag by the ordering counter) however there are enough space for a quick or not sit down dinner. As we went on a late weeknight, there was only one group of customers in the restaurant, so we shameless took over the whole restaurant. The server/cashier girl was very nice and checked on us every time she brought out our food. 

We ordered a small Funghi (mushroom) pizza and Rigatoni pasta for dinner and of course the complementary dessert. The pizza was really really flavourful, nice thick slice with crunchy bottom, just what we needed, a homie pizza. The smell of the mushroom is heavenly, the way it melts in your mouth is so sexy. The pasta was equally delicious (I was full after 2 slice of pizza, so only had a few bites, may not be enough to fully appreciate the pasta). Sauce wasn't too heavy, and the beef was so soft, wish there could be a tad more cheese and pepper to it. We had to pack up half of the pasta home to leave room for dessert. 

This is where they lost the star on me... Worst tiramisu I ever had, be that brown butter and coconut cake partially made it up :)"}
{"text":"Really love Levetto. We started going to the one in Thornhill and I was ecstatic when we moved downtown and found their locations exactly 7 mins away from us (same as our home in Thornhill). It pretty much meant we made the right choice when we picked our new hood.

I love the food here. In the winter, I'm all over this place. I did the to-foodies passport and got the lamb Ragu lamb, with hints of mint. Omg it was so good. I wish they would put that on the menu!!! But regardless, I still love it. 

The food is the same as the other location with some minor inconsistencies but it really depends who makes the pizza I guess. Our usual is the mushroom pizza and the affumicato pizza. Sometimes the mushrooms are scarce while sometimes the bacon is limited. You never know. But still, we go back. I love the mushroom pizza... as I'm writing this I'm thinking about some takeout. 
It's inexpensive, great quality and regardless of any inconsistency, it's still delicious. We've ordered the veggie and chicken pizzas for family dinner as well and it was a hit. 
Sudbury location  has quite a bit of seating too, compared to Thornhill. 
There is the check in deal for dessert- JUST DO IT. You won't regret it!! Once I got my free dessert with takeout And the girl at the counter was so great, she gave me specific instructions to prepare it when I got home."}
{"text":"Keep coming back again and again. Love the pizza, named by my husband \"the best pizza we've ever had\""}
{"text":"I ordered the rigatoni to go. When I got home and opened the container, I cannot explain you how much excess oil was dripping through the pasta. There was an inch of oil at the bottom of the container, it was revolting. 

I can assure you I will not be going back. On top of all that, they charge extra for Parmesan cheese, which is ridiculous. With all the Italian options in the city, I don't know why anyone goes back to this place."}
{"text":"Came back here after a disappointing visit and my experience was much better. The pasta was cooked to perfection this time, and service was friendly. Glad I came back and gave this place another chance."}
{"text":"Fresh made pasta, excellent pizza! Just the right place to satisfy my Italian craving"}
{"text":"Hmmm, now my pasta was not al dente but a bit mushy. I got the carbonara and it was lacking in salt. The pizza could have had more topping on it, few bits of sausage and the rest tomato sauce. Nice ambience and I cannot comment on other offerings. I'll say I won't come back in a hurry."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. The dough unique, the toppings fresh. Pasta was some of the best ie ever had. Braised beef rigatoni was perfectly al denté. Service was very friendly and quick. Nice urban music to compliment a nice setting. I can't wait to visit Toronto again so that I can come back here!"}
{"text":"The food is quite delicious, huge portion size and inexpensive! The ambiance of this place isn't quite like a high end restaurant but it is very nice still!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Pasta is made from scratch and the prices are amazing for the quality a d qaunity you receive. It was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try the pizza or another pasta dish"}
{"text":"Chef Shahir has put together a fantastic menu at an incredible price point!

Two of us had the Romaine, Carbonara, Rigatoni, and Coconut Cake. All were full of flavour, well cooked (especially that homemade pasta), and more than filling. 

Add two cups of wine and it was a great meal for two in our cozy neighbourhood. I would highly recommend Levetto and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just what we needed was an Italian restaurant like Levetto with its no-nonsense fast-food style with a clear menu and quick service. The room was bright and airy at this location with a clean sleek look and clear sight lines along the open kitchen and bar seating up near where the cooking is happening. Since it was frigid and windy that January evening, with few people braving the weather, we were the only table after the other one vacated and the temperature seemed to be chillier in the restaurant than what warm Italian food should be enjoyed at. They needed to add a double door or at least a To-style curtain in front of the doorway to stop the cold draft from coming in. 
The carbonara was delicious with the smoked bacon not greasy and the pasta cooked to a nice al dente perfection. I also tried the pizza which was tasty and had a nice chewy crust making it easily devoured. The casual atmosphere went well the cab sauvignon. They had a neat Yelp check-in offer of a free dessert so I ordered the Tiramisu which was different and a little lighter than the usual with its ladyfingers for the cake part.
Keep in mind Italian food like this is rich and hearty and best enjoyed slowly so don't expect to rush in and out.
Kitty corner from the YMCA so you can time your meal out with a visit to the gym. Watch for a new location in chinatown coming soon."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for a long time and finally got the chance with a few friends last Thursday evening.  We came here around 7pm and there were still a few tables open.  This is a pretty casual place - many come for take out.  You order the food at the front and then they bring the food to your seat.  I ordered the chicken tagliatelle (as they ran out of lobster...which I was pretty disappointed with) my friends and I shared the arugula salad

Chicken tagliatelle - tasteless.  The pasta was initially nicely cooked but when the lady came by and asked us how our meal was, I asked for more sauce and then she took it back and added more sauce but over cooked it. I honestly thought she was just going to give me some sauce on the side - the pasta was a bit wasted afterwards. Also the chicken strips were the kind u can buy from your local neighborhood grocery store - not something made in house.   Wasn't too impressed with that 

Arugula Salad - a bunch of grocery items thrown together. Nothing I can't make at home.  The dressing was also kind of tasteless. 

All my friends had the same complaints - that the food needed some salt/taste.  I was a bit disappointed.  I'd prefer to go back to tostos quickfire pizza for pasta near my work but this is a cute little neighbourhood joint."}
{"text":"The place is small with barely any wait staff, but that's what gives this a boutique, chef run joint. The open kitchen further gives it a very authentic feel and gives you a chance to see the chef prepare your dish. 

The food was excellent. Not a very big menu but again, that's the point. 

The Affumicato pizza... Beautiful smoked bacon and a very crispy pizza base made this a hit. The Panna Cotta was a bit flat but was still delicious. The pistachio and coconut cake was quite different (may be semolina based). Crisp crust and soft inside. A bit too sweet for some but good overall. 

Priced quite well, this is going to be one of my favourite neighbourhood joints. 

My only suggestion.... Slightly quicker service (clearing the table, serving water, etc) would get this place 10/10."}
{"text":"In a rush? Naturally, you might drop by the Pizza Pizza for a quick slice, but why not consider an upgrade and treat yourself to a pie at Levetto instead?

Levetto presents itself in a more upscale format although the model resembles a fast-food chain. In other words, you can walk-in, glance at a menu, order and pay, and either take a seat in the restaurant or take your food to-go.

Let me set some expectations for their pizzas first. They make Romana style pizza, where the crust has a nice, crispy bottom and a light, airy centre. Libretto fans - I know you love your Neapolitan pizza (I do too!) so keep an open mind when you order a pie here, ok?

We were recommended the Smoked Proscuitto pizza, which had fresh arugula, Fior de Latte, toasted almonds and a sweet date sauce. This was such a nice combination for the taste buds! I love sweet and savoury together, so the proscuitto and the date sauce hit the spot. And the toasted almonds added a fantastic crunch to each and every bite!

We also wanted to try one of their pasta dishes so we opted for the Rigatoni, which had slow-braised beef ragu, grana padano cheese and chives. Simple and delicious. (I rarely ever order pasta dishes so I can't vouch for whether it's \"authentic\" fare or not, but it tasted great to me!)

If you can't finish your food, and don't be surprised if that happens because the portion sizes here are pretty generous, you can ask for takeout boxes at the cashier. There was a TV that was looping this video of one of their desserts being assembled while we ate (smart marketing, Levetto team), but unfortunately we were already too full. Next time!

Overall, I had a great experience dining here. Glad to have another neat pizza/pasta spot for the next time I'm craving!"}
{"text":"Great food - We had the spaghetti carbonara, a small funghi pizza and a small spicy soppressata pizza. Everything was very fresh and tasted fantastic. 

The staff was also very nice. 

The restaurant is small (maybe 10 or 11 tables). We dined in, but takeout would be a great option too, and really, it seems like it was built to be primarily a takeout place. 

They deliver, but only if you're within a block or so if the restaurant. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have Levetto pizzeria in our neighborhood, so when my husband and I noticed Levetto on Spadina we were really surprised, it was totally unexpected in the middle of Chinatown. Besides, we didn't even know it has multiple locations... We really like Levetto in Vaughan and it was a lunchtime, so we decided to check this one too. We ordered Salsiccia pizza to share and it was finger licking good! So good that my husband and I fought for the last slice (we ended up splitting it) and seriously considered ordering the second one! We also had espressos and they were quite good too. This place will be on the top of our list for places to eat in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Levetto is a walking distance from our house and it is our family night out place. Their pizza is amazing, our favourites here are funghi pizza and smoked prosciutto pizza. The service is very fast and the staff is friendly and good with kids. To be honest, I am almost hesitant to recommend this hidden gem as the place is very small, I think there only 5 or 6 tables. But they certainly deserve 5 stars..."}
{"text":"What could have a gold mine has become an inconsistent , poorly run , unfriendly staff , with mediocre disappointment off the menu.l would never recommend this place even if it was the last pizza place in town!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pickup from the Sudbury location thinking it would be a quick and easy dinner. 

I was told it would be 15 minutes, and when I showed up after 20 I still had to wait another half hour for the food. When it did come, they had made the wrong pasta and spent another 10 minutes remaking it. 

Pizza was good, pasta was just alright, but none of it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Folks we have winner here for pasta dishes when one factors in the value proposition. This was a last minute dinning decision. The place is in a residential area with not much nearby and seems to be thriving on the locals. The take out was just buzzing with one take out after another. We were dinning in so got to witness the huge turn over. The seating is OK I guess as it doesn't seem to be designed for that. 
We decided to order a pizza and a pasta dish. 
First the pasta Trecce was top notch and the freshness just shows. The sun dried tomato and decent amount of cheese provided harmony. There was a bit of oil at the bottom but at these prices its will be hard to beat.
Now for the pizza we ordered the verde. This one didn't fare well as I am not a big fan of thick crust. The ingredients were fresh so can't argue that the skimped there. If one likes thick crust pizza this might be to your liking. 
We also got a dessert freebie thanks to Yelp checkin offer. We had the white chocolate tiramisu. It was just average IMO.   
All in all a great addition to this area and with a value proposition its 4 stars all the way. I will be back for more pasta."}
{"text":"Damn! Hands down one of the best Italian meals I have had in Toronto.

Known for their homemade pizza and pasta, this place is amazing. When I go to a restaurant, I tend to order meals I can't make at home. Pizza and pasta are one of those things that I tend to avoid when I go to a restaurant. Not that I don't like it, I just think I can make it better at home, but Levetto? Wow. 

I had their salsicca pizza, it was topped with sausage, roasted red pepper, black olives and fennel. It was pretty amazing. The dough had a great texture, it tasted fresh and the toppings were full. Delicious. My fiancé ordered the spaghetti carbonara and it was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten. I cried as I forked mouthfuls into my mouth. It was heavy, flavourful, and just delicious. 

If you want excellent Italian food, stop at Levetto. I can't vouch for other locations, but this one is so worth the trip. Stop scouring Yelp for another Italian place and just GO!"}
{"text":"Took a Smoked Prosciutto pizza and Carbonara pasta to go and both were fantastic. The combo of the arugula, the smoked prosciutto and the almonds added a bold flavour to the pizza, and the carbonara was thoroughly marinated/coated, and well liked. Their sizes are also very convenient for taking it on the run, and Would definitely come back for the carbonara."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the quality and price of the food here. We had the radicchio salad, Peking duck pizza, and the spicy pasta. 

The Peking duck pizza was sublime. Generous pieces of flavourful duck in perfect harmony with the dough and cheese of the pizza. The diced cucumber are a very nice touch. They bring to mind classic Peking duck wraps. 

The pasta was flavourful and wonderfully balanced. The handmade noodles were chewy and fresh. A real joy to feast on. 

My only complaint would be the salad - the ratio of leaves to almonds and dressing was lacking. 

All in all, we paid $36 for the three dishes. An amazing deal for the quality. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and never disappointed! The rigatoni is in my opinion the best pasta dish! The only issue here is that I'm always confused when I'm here. Is it self serve or not? Do we pay first or not? This place needs to make up their mind."}
{"text":"We visit Levetto often because it's conveniently close to home and is one of the quiet and chill out spots near WQW. 
My wife is a huge fan of the thicker crust, me not so much, but the tastes are perfect. Nothing is overly done, no fancy stuff, just fresh great tastes."}
{"text":"I love getting food from here to go. This place is perfect. A small little place with just a few tables, but the big thing is being able to take this amazing Italian food home and pretend like I used my kitchen for once :-)
Last time I got the Carbonara; one word for it would be AMAZING. The way the flavors all blend together is fantastic and makes me want the bowl to never end.  My son and husband shared the Pollo Toscana pizza. They both enjoyed it as well. Not to mention how all of this amazing food comes at a pretty reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Having tried almost all the other locations, it only seemed fair to come try out the Chinatown Levetto location. 

As a party of 3, we got one of the few tables in the restaurant tucked away in the Chinatown area on a Friday night. 

Levetto is a half service restaurant so you typically walk in, get seated, order, pay and then food is served to your table. 

My friends and I all went up to order on separate bills. We started with sharing a romaine salad which was very generously portioned (as is all their menu items). 

My friends both got the carbonara which arrived as we were finishing the salad. However, my rigatoni did not arrive for the next 10-15 mins. I decided to go up and check on my order and as it turns out, they had missed my pasta so they had to make it as I reminded them. 

At this point, my friends were done their pastas and I was still waiting but I was luckily not as hungry since I had some of the salad. 

As we continued to chat and wait for the rigatoni, we saw one of the waiters pick up a pizza and rigatoni. However, they didn't realize I was still waiting for mine and gave my rigatoni to another table. Having noticed us looking, he quickly realized that the pasta should have gone to us first. Due to the large mix up, they refunded my meal and also quickly made a fresh rigatoni for me. They also offered us a coconut cake on the house. 

Overall, I thought they dealt with the situation well and as always the pasta was exceptional (al dente and super flavourful). Had it not been the mishap, I would've given full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love love love Levetto!!

I first discovered Levetto at the Waterloo location and I have been in love with this franchise ever since. The portions are humongous for a super affordable price ($10-14 approx). The Toronto locations are not full service but more half service since you order at the counter and then either get take out or stay in at one of the few tables they have at the location. I would recommend trying to eat at the restaurant if possible as the pastas aren't as good when ordering take out, depending on how far you have to travel before enjoying the food.

I've tried several items on the menu over my numerous visits but my favourites definitely have to be the rigatoni (which is super heavy but so worth it) and the Funghi pizza. 

For a lighter option, I would opt for the carbonara but I must warn you, the pastas do tend to be more on the saltier side so beware!

Fingers crossed that they continue to open more locations around the GTA."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big fan of Levetto.  I've been to all of the downtown locations.  

This Chinatown spot has only been open for about a month and a half and serves the \"famous\" Peking duck pizza... The duck skin should be crispier.  Aside from that, the pasta and the mushroom pizza are just as good as I remember.  

The one surprise was the brown butter coconut cake.  Damn, that was so good.  I don't normally eat desserts but this one was definitely worth a mention."}
{"text":"Tried the carbonara, and it was possibly the best carbonara I've ever had. The texture of the pasta is quite unique, and the portion size is very generous."}
{"text":"The first couple times I came to this location about a year ago  and got a salad, ragu pasta and pizza. It was all delicious and good value for what you pay for.   

The past couple times getting the ragu pasta has been a massive disappointment. The noodles look like they have changed and no longer have those ridges on the outside and the bite of the noodle did not taste as good. 

The bigger disappointment was that there was literally TWO pieces of beef in a what was supposed to be a meat pasta.  This has happened twice now. 

The good times I got food here the pasta was loaded with meat and the noodle had a good bite and texture.

I had high expectations getting food here because the other experiences were great. I don't understand if the quality control has gone down? I feel like I got ripped off with what I got. 

I really enjoyed the ragu pasta the way you had it before. Unfortunately, I do not think I will be coming back unless the quality control ramps up."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place so far in Toronto. 

The pizza here is really good. It's different to what I'm used to eating... the crust is really thick (kind of like bread). I'm usually a thin crust guy, but I did enjoy this crust. They are quite liberal with the toppings too, which is nice. 

Large size is about twice the price of the medium, so we decided to get 2 mediums to try different types. I'd say that 2 mediums is too much for 2 people, but 1 won't be enough. Maybe next time we'll try a medium & pasta. 

Restaurant looks pretty cool inside, although its small. Don't come with a big group, as there are only 3 tables that sit 4 each, as well as seating at the \"bar\". May get takeout next time. 

Big parking lot. 
Accepts credit card"}
{"text":"Do I have a love for pizza? Yes, yes I do. Which brings me to Levetto on Sudbury! A small venue with a trendy interior and eats for all. It's got long tables for seating, so go up to the counter, place your order and grab a seat. Don't forget your drink at the counter!!! 

We sat down and waited. We had made a reservation, so they knew we were coming. We had a group of about 15 AND it was busy, but half of the food arrived and then the rest about 15min later. It was a kind of awkward. Luckily, some ordered more than 1 item, so they didn't starve.  

The food did not disappoint.  

Everyone who ordered pasta raved and enthusiastically tried to share with everyone because the portion was so big and they had ordered pizza too. When the gal from Italy says it's good pasta, it's good pasta. For pizza, I ordered the Pollo Tuscano. A perfect size for 1 person. It had chicken, sundried tomatoes, tomato pesto, red onion and fresh basil. The toppings were fresh and tasty, very flavourful. The star here was the crust. So buttery, fluffy and crispy. Out of all of the pizza places I've been, this crust is my favourite. Someone gave me a slice of their Patate pizza. I'd never had pizza like it. It had thinly sliced potato, white truffle oil, ricotta cheese, rosemary and green onion. I expected it to be heavy because there was potato and ricotta, but it wasn't. It was OK. It wasn't as flavourful as I'm used to, but I'd never had a white pizza before. I'm told as far as white pizza standards go, this one was pretty awesome. 

An added bonus to us checking in on Yelp, gave us free dessert! WOO! I got the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Cake. It was covered in pistachios and coconut icing. It was small, but you couldn't finish it. Many of us were sharing desserts because they were so rich. The cake was moist and had just the right amount of coconut. About halfway through the cake, I was done. It became too sweet, but it was a nice finish to the savoury pizza. 

My favourite pizza so far! Wish I lived closer so I could pick some up."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  I've tried two locations in 6 days.  I really don't understand why this place isn't packed.  I actually do know why:  It's the location... 

We came here for a late dinner, around 9pm on a Friday night and it was completely empty.  Yes, there were a few take out orders here and there, but for the quality, portions, and value, Levetto just can't be beat.  Five of us ordered 4 pastas and one pizza to share.  So much food and so tasty too!  Thanks to the Yelp check-in offer, we got one dessert to share (we couldn't even finish it).  

I really wish they would open a more central location instead of these low foot traffic, out of the way spots."}
{"text":"Me and my bf came here last night and it was such a nice surprise. I've always wanted to love above a shop or cafe or resto  like people in the movies do and be a regular. This is the new dream for here and close enough. It's a super chill vibe and place to go to for a quick bite where if you don't feel like cooking or for grab go to enjoy at home. Everyone is super friendly and service was quick. Very great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Levetto for a really long time now.  I noticed the stellar reviews (consistent with all of their locations) so I was really curious.

It was fantastic!  

My husband and I fully enjoyed the rigatoni with slow-braised beef ragu.  All the pasta is fresh, made on the premises.  We also shared the mushroom pizza which was really flavourful.  To finish, we tried the tiramisu.  Light and not too sweet.  Perfect.  

For a casual meal or for take-out, this is an excellent option.  I'm already thinking about my next visit!  

Check out the artwork on the wall, it is one of a kind!  

P.S.  Henry, Ashley, and Zion (sp?): Thanks for our great meal!!!  See you again, sooner than later!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and very affordable as well. I ordered a personal pizza, along with a pasta dish and the wait time was not long at all. The portions were larger than expected for the pastas though so I would be careful when ordering that, as it was pretty filling. The staff were nice and it was a pretty great experience overall, will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Promo for $20 off your first UberEats order led us to order from Levetto (to be honest...no idea which location, I think all three were available to us to choose from?).  I recognized the name from the stellar Yelp reviews and wanted to try something I hadn't tried before.

Order:
Carbonara pasta
Medium sized smoked bacon and mushroom pizza
Small sized proscutto and almond pizza
(wasn't sure how big anything was going to be. This was way too big an order for 2 people! We could have done a small pizza and a pasta, even.  Medium pizza had eight slices, small had four)

Won't count stars for the ubereats system, but it wasn't bad, came within an hour and they just hand it to you and you're done. This order was $45.00, however, and so although worth it for $25, which is what we paid, $45 is pretty expensive for pizza and pasta!!  

Pasta was soooo good.  Cooked so well.  I liked the smoked bacon pizza better than the proscutto which was ... sweet? Honey-esque.  Still good, just less exciting.  Still hot after being delivered and sitting in the boxes for at least 15 minutes before consuming.  

Overall, this just made me want to visit the restaurant even more, although I'm not sure if I'd get delivery from there again at full price."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places around here that I have seen serving Roman style pizza. The crust is nice and airy as it is supposed to be and they have a good variety of toppings. The best part about the pizza is that it is not extremely greasy.

Levetto is located in the core of Chinatown, where I wasn't expecting to find a good pizza place. The atmosphere is nice and casual with good food; would definitely recommend going there."}
{"text":"Came here for my valentine's day.... 
I wouldn't call it a restaurant but it sure give u the high end quality food. Food portion was generous, presentation is lovely, and the price too $$. Definitely will come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"REVISED FROM: Food is very bland and boring.  Well presented but has no flavour ...nice place cheap prices probably won't rush back.

Went back it is much improved. Good for takeout or eat in, 2 can share a dish."}
{"text":"4.5.

You know what I do when I need to feel comforted? I make a big ass bowl of pasta and curl up on the couch with a good movie.

Levetto was almost as satisfying. Their bowls of pasta are humungous and allow for lots of room to twirl, dig and slurp. My cavatelli had truffle oil, pea pesto, red pepper and spinach. I was in heaven.

Now, I'm a huge fan thin crust pizza, but I rather liked the focaccia crust at Levetto. I tried both the Peking Duck and the mushroom pizza and they both were delicious. The crust was satisfying yet light and airy with crispy edges that tasted of nice olive oil. 

Also tried the Brown Butter coconut cake and really enjoyed the texture and flavour of this dessert. If you don't like coconut, you won't be won over, but I love it. And I love brown butter. This was unique and refreshing for me as desserts go.

I would have given 5 stars, but I don't dig that I have to return to the counter, wait in line and make another transaction to get second drink and I don't want a bottle for myself (at least not in public when I'm the only one drinking). I would prefer if they did table service. It was weird-- they did for the table next to us??"}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant for lunch since I was in Vaughan and wanted to try something different. I'm typically never a fan of Italian food - but because of its outstanding Yelp rating, I gave it a try since I was craving pizza...

As soon as I walked in, I was told that they are out of pizza :( So I got the Carbonera and added extra Italian sausage to it and took it to go. An hour later when I got home, it was still warm, so I opened it up and tried it...

DELICIOUS.

I was extremely surprised by this food! I never thought I would ever like italian food, but this dish at this restaurant definitely makes me reconsider. They put in a lot of bacon, and a decent amount of sausage too. I can't complement the quality of the food enough - it was absolutely delicious.

I'm looking forward to going back to the area just so I can stop by this restaurant again. Strongly recommend it even if you aren't a fan of Italian food (it didn't taste like the generic Italian food you get at other restaurants)."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is amazing. I eat at any given Levetto on average once per week. The woman working here on thanksgiving weekend managed to save my skin. I had placed an order for 4 people through Foodora for the College location at 9PM and set my phone down and walked away after it showed the order was accepted by the restaurant (never had any issues previously). To my famished horror, the order was cancelled at 9:36, around when I expected it to be rocking up, with no reason. Not understanding what happened, I called and spoke to someone from the College location who wasn't able to communicate how the breakdown happened so I'm not sure if it was a Levetto or Foodora error. The person in the phone sounded baffled and kept repeating they were closed. Although I did the thinking outside the box to suggest a solution from the other location, the woman at the Sudbury location was very accommodating and likely stayed late to make sure me and my friends got our dinner. I'm not sure what your name is, miss, but thank you from the bottom of my tummy! You didn't have to make it right, but you did. That means a lot to me."}
{"text":"I really LOVE this place!  I've been here twice for pizza, and once for pasta and I must say that this spot really takes the cake for atmosphere, cleanliness, quality of food, and customer service.

The place is always spotless when I walk in, the servers are always in a good mood, there is always more than enough space to sit and enjoy my food (I usually go early for lunch though, so I'm not sure how they handle dinner service), and the dishes are delicious! Even the prices are phenomenal!!!

I love having this beautifully tucked-away gem all to myself when I'm craving Italian for lunch! 

I highly recommend this place to everybody, and I look forward to sampling the entire menu!"}
{"text":"This is our default restaurant for a quick Friday dinner -- our default order namely:  carbonara and funghi pizza. We tried other pasta and pizza combinations but we always go back to their carbonara and funghi pizza! Their panna cotta is heavenly as well"}
{"text":"Reviewing one dish here, feedback to the company, the lamb pasta is not good! Hardly any meat, very gummy pasta, not very pleasant flavour & expensive. Thumbs down. Bring back the tagliatelle please."}
{"text":"I had an excellent lunch at Levetto. The pasta was al dente, which I like. The bacon was plentiful and had good flavor. The portion was large and everything was very hot and freshly prepared.
The staff was very nice and service was better than average for a counter-order restaurant.
Would have been nice to have some wifi as I'm from the US and had planned to request an über after my meal. I just walked a little after till I found free wifi.
I hope to return on a future visit."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from the Sudbury Street location so I've come in for dinner a couple of times when the grocery situation at home is lacking.  This place does a brisk business, especially with takeout, but the service has been good and our food has been prompt. 

While this is not the best Italian food I've ever had, I would challenge anyone to find better at this price point!  The pasta portions are super generous; if my partner and I order a salad as well, we end up with enough leftovers for lunch the next day.

The funghi pizza is a menu standout- highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After a great work out at Pursuit OCR my friends and I were starving.  One of my friend's recommended Levetto because it was close by.  It's not a big restaurant as our group of nine occupied half the restaurant already.  The nine of us ordered a bunch of pizzas and pastas off the menu and shared.

Pizza's:

Margherita Pizza ($12, medium) - Fior di Latte, crushed tomato sauce, fresh basil.  This was nice and simple.  It had cheese, tomato sauce and a basil leaf on each slice.  

Salsiccia Pizza ($14, medium) - Italian sausage, shaved fennel, roasted red pepper, chili flake, black olive, Fior di Latte, and fennel fronds.  This is kind of like a deluxe pizza that has almost everything.  There was a good amount of toppings and balance of flavors on this pizza.

The pizza's are served classic Romana style in square slices.  I've personally never had this type of pizza before so I was a little thrown off when I took my first bite.  The crust is crispy outside, kind of like a toasted baguette. The dough inside is light and very airy inside since it is 85% water. 

Pasta's:

Rigatoni ($13) - slow-braised beef ragu, grana Padano, chive.

Bucatini ($10.5) - guanciale, sautéed red onion, chili flake, spicy tomato sauce, herbs.

Trecce ($8.5) - garlic infused olive oil, chili, sundried tomato, goat's cheese, arugula.

Carbonara ($10.5) - smoked bacon, cracked black pepper, egg, scallion, grana padano.

Cavatelli with Italian Sausage ($11+$3) - pea pesto, roasted red pepper, baby spinach, white truffle oil, ricotta.

I tried a bit of every pasta and enjoyed everyone one of them.  They were all cooked al dente and had great flavors.  My favorites were the Rigatoni and Carbonara.  You can definitely taste the pasta is all handmade and the freshness of the ingredients.  You can add your choice of Italian sausage or chicken breast to any of the pasta dishes for a little extra.

**CHECK IN ON YELP AND RECEIVE A FREE DESSERT**.  I am extremely happy that the restaurant allowed each of us to redeem a free dessert.  Usually restaurants limit these freebies to one per table.  Thumbs up to Levetto!  We got a combination of the follow desserts:

Panna Cotta (Free) - compote, amaretti cookie, cinnamon.  

White Chocolate Tiramisu (Free) -Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Cake (Free) - espresso soaked lady fingers, mascarpone cream, coulis.

Warm Brown Butter & Coconut cake (Free) - coconut icing, pistachio.

All the desserts were excellent as I enjoyed all of them.  They were not overly sweet and had great texture, taste and flavor.

This is a great restaurant that serves quality food at a great price, I would absolutely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I can't tell you enough how disappointed my last visit here has been.

If you have been a \"habitué\" (regular) and loyal like I have been, chances are you know exactly that something happened, and I'm saying it not in a good way.
The food you experienced before, now is not the same.

I'm very critical when it comes to food. Especially when the cuisine in question is the one I have grown up with and grown into it for over 20 years.
I'm sure that Shahir (the owner) remembers very well my genuine, non filtered feedback when I came to Levetto my very first time. And my opinion didn't change until TODAY (you can see my very first review here on Yelp).

Where should I start? 

First I've ordered a salad, \"the Panzanella\": grape tomato, fior di latte, red onion, house-baked focaccia crouton, spinach and basil.
This salad used to look exactly like it's presented on the web site. Now, when you look at your plate, you are wondering if you had been served with the same item or if you've stepped into another restaurant \"Levetto wannabe\".
The first thing I have noticed was how the fior di latte didn't come in thick pieces/or slices but shredded and \"dusted\" here and there over the top. The amount of mozzarella wasn't even close to half the weigh of only one of the few thick slices the restaurant offered before.
At first glance, thankfully, I could see the cherry tomatoes and the house-baked focaccia crouton but once I've started to pour all over the dressing and mixing the content of my plate, I have realized that while the amount of the croutons didn't change the one for the cherry tomatoes did. I'd be generous to estimate that the salad had 5 cherry tomatoes sliced in half.
The basil made me notice its presence only twice while my mind started to concentrate to the pizza sitting in front of me, hoping better bites. (see the picture of the Panzanella I posted several months ago and you'll see what I'm talking about).

So here we are, with the small margherita pizza. 4 squares of a crunchy dough soon to be soggy, where to see and taste the fior di latte needed the help of a binoculars. Yes, you heard me, because the 4 slices of mozzarella fior di latte were so thin that almost disappeared into thin air. Not what I remember and ate in my previous visits.
The tomato sauce used for the pizza, used to be one of those items that if I could, I would have ordered in a glass along with a straw so that I could drink it. That how great it was. Thick and well balanced, with that slight sweet aftertaste, now turned into something more liquid and more acidic. And I guess that explains why the dough turned soggier in the middle while before remained crunchy.
Just for you to understand what I'm talking about: I remember once I went to buy two large pizze and after sitting in my car for over 20 minutes, the dough was still perfectly crunchy like if it just came out of the oven. Today this was just a long memory that I'm afraid it could vanish very, very soon.

Levetto always impressed me for the passion and the willingness to do the right thing. I lost the count how many times I came and the large amount of people I took and I convinced that this was the closest to the way people eat in Italy at lunch or dinner at home.
Levetto is like my second home. This, in my opinion, is what made Levetto better than many other Italian restaurants: simplicity, right quantity of ingredients and right price. 

I turned a blind eye on the menu that has never changed. Personally, to keep the restaurant interesting, I would have offered a new menu every time the season changed, with new plates that reflected the seasonal meat and veggies that the farms had to offer.

Toronto now has a food scene to envy and its people started to understand when things change at their expense.
Maybe it sounds too harsh but today I felt extremely disappointed and... \"robbed\".
Robbed because we cut on the use of ingredients, flavour (less ingredients = lack of flavour) and money. Yes, money, because my dear yelpers and hungry Torontonians, the prices also have been increased, not much but they did.

I will definetely give another shot at Levetto hoping that this was just... an \"isolated incident\"."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place, so I came to check it out!

The place is a bit small and I was confused as to whether it was a fast food joint or more of a dine in restaurant. Turns out that you have to go up and order your food up front then they'll bring it to your table. The staff were really friendly though!

I got the carbonara and at first bite I thought it was pretty good. Then it got super salty..I found that I had to drink water with every bite. It didn't quite taste as I had imagined (not as creamy, very heavy on salt) and was a little disappointed. On the other hand, my friend got funghi pizza and she quite enjoyed it. It was thin crust with just the right amount of flavour. 

Seems to me that their specialty lies more with pizzas than pastas. Would recommend it to pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Never been to Levetto before, but was near Chinatown and go figure...we chose to eat Italian food in Chinatown. We ordered the Carbonara pasta and the Pollo Toscano pizza. Both were delicious! 

The carbonara was cheesy with lots of bacon! How can you go wrong with bacon? 

But the pizza was the star of the meal. This was probably the best pizza we've had. The crust was perfectly crisp on the bottom and pillowy on top. The ingredients were oh so fresh! The tomato sauce was delicious! Chicken was tender and juicy. The cheese and the basil leaf on every slice to top it off were just perfect!

Service was also excellent. We were seated in the back room as the front was full. We thought we'd be neglected back there but as soon as our jug of water was done it was replaced with a new one immediately, without having to ask. How did they know? 

Can't wait to try to peiking duck pizza next time."}
{"text":"Levetto is awesome! Pastas are very good, filling but not heavy. The pecking duck pizza is very legit. You should also save room for their desserts! So good."}
{"text":"It must be fate that brought me (and my friend) to Levetto. We had a couple restaurants in mind, but none of them had a table available for us at the time. We were cold and hungry, I knew we needed to find something quick, so with the help of Yelp (of course) I decided to give Levetto a try.

In general, it's a cozy restaurant where you could choose to sit at the bar or one of the four tables in the dining area (no reservation available, so you might need to wait a bit if you want to dine in). Moreover, sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the open kitchen from which you can see the chefs baking pizza and cooking pasta. The servers are patient, friendly and the place is generally clean and welcoming.

The menu is relatively small with just a few choices of salad, pasta and pizza to choose from. We ordered a Rigatoni (pasta) (slow-braised beef ragu, grana padano, chive) and Pollo Toscano (pizza) ().

The pizza's oven-baked with chicken breat, tomato pesto, Fior di Latte, red onion, sundried tomato, fresh basil. I really like it. The pizza is relatively doughy and filling but the crust is crispy. It is definitely not an authentic Italian-styled pizza, but the ingredients are flavorful which make it appetizing.

For the pasta, despite the fact that the penne is a bit stringy, the sauce is still palatable.

Side note, they serve nice little desserts like Panna Cotta, Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake, and White Chocolate Tiramisu. Even though we didn't order any, but they sure look good to me.

In conclusion, I wasn't disappointed, and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Went with my brother to Kensington Market Saturday night and while walking around we discovered this gem of a place called Levetto. Since there is one near my house we decided to go in and say hi and check it out  Simple Italian food  at  affordable prices . My brother and I are pretty friendly guys so we started chatting with the staff and congratulating them on their opening. Well before we knew it the owner Nicholas came over and introduced himself and instantly we all became friends.  He is a really cool and nice guy. Eli and I ordered 2 simple dishes . Pasta and Pizza. Both were excellent. Fresh tasty and simple. We filled up quite nicely but than Nicholas surprised us with his specialty pizza Peking duck on the house.Wow what a treat . Delicious!  We felt like we were on Anthony Bourdains show and we're treated like royalty. I wish the owner only good things for this place. Super food and super staff."}
{"text":"We're back on the HUNT for Toronto's BEST! Stop #1 of the pizza pie tour: Levetto

I can't say that I've ever had a love affair with pizza, especially since we're typically inundated with \"greasy for the sake of grease\" slices from your major fast food pizza spots, but after a trip to Levetto, I might be a believer.

Levetto is a small restaurant with a modern feel, near Queen & Dufferin. As an old man at heart, it's the kind of spot that you feel hip walking into, but just short of pretentious. Cool, simplistic decor, with a modest amount of seating, so I'd say limit yourself to a four person group max.

Though we're on a pizza hunt, we dabbled in a little extra because Levetto is also known for their pasta and desserts.
First up we ordered a bowl of Trecce pasta between the two of us. The pasta is served with garlic infused olive oil, chili flakes, sundried tomatos, goat's cheese, and arugula. Since I'm regularly unimpressed by pasta, I was pleasantly surprised with this dish. The pasta was cooked to a nice al dente, and you could taste that it's made fresh daily and cooked to order. It's got a noticeable spice from the chili, which is expertly balanced by the goat cheese that melts over the pasta. And shout out the sundried tomatos, which were wonderfully sweet hits of flavour.

Then came the pies! On the suggestion of pretty much everyone, waitress included, I grabbed the Funghi. As the name suggests, mushrooms are the main act of this show. You'll get a beautiful mess of portobello, oyster, and cremini mushrooms sitting on top of a creamy layer of mascarpone cheese and roasted garlic crema. Also, there's a shredded cheese topping. (Probably parmesan.) This pie can be summed up as a savoury sanctuary of heavy mushroom and garlic flavour. And I KID YOU NOT, once you dive in, you won't even notice that there's no meat! Vegetarians rejoice! Levetto serves romana style pizzas, so you'll get a thin & crisp crust, but unfortunately this is were my one minor annoyance came in. Good luck trying to actually pick up every slice, because some of the crust gets a little wobbly after sitting under the love it supports for too long. It's still very manageable though with a fork and knife. Anyway, I'll finish with the much needed props to how after you've savoured your way inward from the creamy mushroom oasis of the center, you'll abruptly hit a crust that is perfectly crisp around the circumference of the pie. Just give me some of that damn crust on a plate, turn off the lights, and let me enjoy.

I also tried a bit of the Verde pie, which stars their basil pesto and includes: cherry tomato caramelized onions, spinach, radicchio, and Fior di Latte (mozzarella). It's a much brighter pie than the fungi, with some unexpected sweetness, and an overall fresh flavour.

We finished up with a warm brown butter & coconut cake for dessert. Apparently people come to Levetto just for the desserts, but I'm not about that life. It wasn't bad at all, but it was so out shined by everything else that I won't be wasting the calories on it in the future.

All in all, I was really happy with Levetto, plus those prices aren't bad at all. $15 for the large Funghi. $7.5 for the small Verde. Bomb ass pizza, nice service, good vibes."}
{"text":"Levetto... A restaurant in my neck of the woods that I finally had the opportunity to try.  At first glance, this place seemed very informal, relaxed, and quick... And it was.  We entered the very small restaurant, ordered off the wall menu (I only noticed after that they had card menus right next to the cash), and sat down.  I suppose this place is more of a takeout joint, as they only have 4-5 tables seating max 4 people each, and a small bar seating area.  I found out some time later that this place actually delivers, which is cool, because Italian restaurants generally don't do delivery (they do however deliver to a limited area, for around $6 delivery charge).  

We ordered just the Pollo Toscano pizza.  Came out quickly, and at first glance, I wasn't sure the pizza actually had chicken on it!  Very little chicken, but a lot more cheese.  The dough seemed crunchy but flaky, which was nice.  Not a thin crust pizza at all... I guess that was ok.  All ingredients seemed fresh.  After glancing at the table next to me (where the patrons ordered pizza and pasta), I'd probably try the pasta next time.  Portions looked pretty big (enough to share), and fresh.  I'll give this place another shot for sure!  Overall, tasty pizza, but I haven't tried enough to give this place a 100% justifiable rating."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza place in the middle of Chinatown. We ordered four different types of pizzas to share: the salsaccia, toscano, funghi, and the peking duck. 

The peking duck pizza had small shavings of duck, a sprinkle of cucumbers, and drenched in sweet paste sauce (traditional peking duck sauce). As a result, the sauce really overpowered the tastes of all the other ingredients. 

The salsaccia and toscano were really typical of other comparable pizzerias. Fresh ingredients and a solid dough mixture were definitely exemplified in each bite.

The best was the funghi. As a fan of white sauce pizza s and mushrooms, this pizza did well to satisfy both my cravings. The creamyness of the white sauce base complemented well with the different mushrooms. 

Service was a bit slow, so don't expect too much!"}
{"text":"I've tried Levetto at other locations before and really enjoyed it. I came to this location to try the exclusive Peking duck pizza. My friends and I were kind of disappointed...I believe we felt it was nothing special cause we're familiar with the hoisin sauce taste. I personally prefer the margherita and affumicato. The one in the picture is the Yukon gold potato.

Their salads are wonderful too...definitely meant to be shared with a few people. The one in the picture is the Misticanza. I'll have to come back again to try their pasta. 

Overall, everything on the menu is very affordable (~$8-15) and I like how it's self-serve. This location has a room at the back dedicated for special occasions."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the pasta here. We tried the braised beef raggatoni. It was a little bit on the heavy side, but tasted really fresh and portion size was great. Pizza was also pretty good, especially considering the prices. Great as a lunch or dinner spot."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pasta , 3 stars for the pizza.

Their fresh made pasta is delicious and fairly priced between $10-16. 

My go-to order is a base pasta of pomodoro sauce & rigatoni noodles with added cherry tomatoes, peas & mushrooms. 

I ordered the spaghetti once and the noodles were overcooked and mushy. Ever since, I have stuck to the rigatoni which has been perfectly cooked and consistent in the last 4 pastas I've ordered. 

The pasta keeps me coming back, but the pizza is disappointing."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with great taste pizzas. We try their pizzas, but don't have room for pasta. All pasta and pizzas are fresh made daily. Environment is a fast food style restaurant, but the taste is very good. There is a few tables and bar table for dine in, but they usually do pick up orders. And the servers are all kind and friendly. We will definitely come back~"}
{"text":"I really liked the concept... high-end take out. You order at the counter, sit down and get a delicious meal brought to your table.

The atmosphere is friendly, though the place was absolutely freezing. I was happy to see they had wine, but they had let their liquor license expire and couldn't serve any the day I was there. Set an alarm on your phone, guys, I need wine!!

We ordered the lobster pasta, the beef pasta and a pizza. All were very very good. They had no problem with our dairy allergies. The pasta was well made the sauces were great, particularly the lobster one. I loved the crust on the pizza. It was like it was deep fried on the bottom... crispy and light. 

I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"On Monday afternoon I dropped in with some coworkers for a working lunch. 

We placed our orders and took a seat. I ordered a Panzanella salad which is basically a spinach salad with grape tomatoes, focaccia croutons and mozzarella cheese. It's a really big salad. Enough for one person as a meal or if you've ordered a pasta or pizza you'd need to share it. 2 of my coworkers ordered the Romaine and added chicken for their meals and the 4th person ordered a Margherita pizza which is a large rectangular pan pizza. 

The food was tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Location: 9001 Dufferin Street Vaughan ON L4J 8X2
Price: $
Service: Great

So almost after a year, I was invited back to the restaurant. I came back with an opinion mind and I was glad I did come back! It was a brand new feeling and people there were so welcoming. 

Their main focus are the double P's, which are pastas and pizzas. Their pizza dough and pastas are made fresh daily. I love italian food and I died of happiness when I had their Rigatoni- it is seriously to die for! The Rigatoni is a slow braised beef ragu with grana padano topped with chive and a light topping of cheese. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente- just how its suppose to be!! I also had their special pizza (it's not on the website menu but will be on soon). If you're a fan of garlic bread and mushrooms (portobello and button) you will love that pizza- which I forgot the name of... However, you can ask the servers there and they will be glad to answer! That specific pizza is not made with a tomato base- it was highly delicious.

Next time I visit, I want try the things on their dessert menu! 

Verdict: I'm a fan!!"}
{"text":"The Carbonate was really good, a bit too aldente for my taste but overall it was an enjoyable dinner. Also prices are reasonable. We ordered 2 pasta and a small pizza am a Coke for $40."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place a 4.5. Have dined in and ordered through UberEATS. Quality of delivery is just as excellent as dining in. Their pizzas aren't my favourite but they're still pretty good. However, their beef ragu is hamaaazing, the pasta is made in house and you can tell !! Quality is superb. I've also had the pistachio cake and it's yooom! Docking 0.5 for my dine in experience due to my experience with the employees. I didn't realize it was a self serve type of place and they didn't bother to really explain it m. They also seemed bored/aloof while taking my order."}
{"text":"Quietly tucked along the busiest street of Chinatown (Spadina), Levetto is an authentic and cute little Italian place just around the corner from Kensington Market. 

With a party of 5, we ordered three pastas (2 carbonara, 1 bucatini) and two pizzas (1 pollo toscano, 1 verde) to share. One thing I can say is that the food was definitely fresh. The pizzas were both generously topped with fresh and colourful vegetables, and the dough was baked to a nice plump and soft crust with crunchy edges. I really enjoyed the pollo toscano pizza because it had large chunks of tender seasoned chicken and also, let's just take a moment to talk about THE CHEESE. It was so beautiful how the melted oozing mozzarella left this stringy trail with every bite, as if it were saying to me \"No, you can't leave me, you have to come back and finish what you started\"... I'm salivating just thinking about it. 

Their house-made pastas were also quite good, but rather unique. The texture of the noodles resembled Asian-style ramen more than anything, as they seemed to be egg noodles and had a bounce to the bite. A few people within my party of 5 didn't like this pasta due to that reason, but I found it to be neutral. I mean, overall, the flavours were good, it was sauced to the right proportion, and there was more shredded cheese to top it all off (mhmm cheese..). 

My only criticism for this place would be its price. For a \"purchase at the cashier\" type restaurant, I'm not sure the food is worth its relatively higher price point. Especially considering its location and its competitors in/around Chinatown and Kensington, I probably wouldn't pick this place as my first choice."}
{"text":"Finally reviewing Levetto,  which we've been frequenting for the past year.  I have to say that I love the pastas and salads and while I'm not a big fan of the pizza, my wife loves the pizza .   Portions are big and the prices are very inexpensive ,  I'm actually shocked that the food is so good for a casual Italian restaurant. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ottimo!  Shared arugula salad, rigatoni, and margarita pizza.   Food is fresh and perfectly prepared.  This place is a gem.  I wish there was one closer to my house."}
{"text":"We ordered sopressata pizza and trecce pasta. Loved the soft crispy dough that almost melts in your mouth. This would be one of the best pizza places I've been to in Toronto. Both their pizza and pasta tasted simple clean and delicious! Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I've been to good Italian cuisines and I've been to really delicious excellent Italian restaurant. This place falls a bit short from being good.

I have to admit that the staff are a friendly bunch but the service is a bit off due to their ordering methods. Pay now, pay later, here's your food, where's the cutlery, can I sit here? What is this place? Serve yourself or am I being served? Pick one rather than trying to be different and unique. I'm here to enjoy the food, not chaos.

The food. Thumbs up on the fresh pasta but the dishes was not cohesive and was confusing like the service. Their pastas are a little more seasoned than I'm used to and the portions are a little more than I can handle. I've had the rigatoni and the carbonara on separate occasions. Both times the sauces were overly reduces making it too salty. The large amount of bacon in the carbonara made the dish too salty, and what's with the raw green onions? It somewhat balances out the saltiness but it gave it an Asian fusion taste to it. The pizza are more to my liking. The Dow is a bit thick but it's cooked to my liking. Can't resist the fungi pizza - it's my favourite here."}
{"text":"Food was good, however service could of been a bit better. They were busy and one of our orders was incorrect. We had to get our own utensils to at one point to eat our food."}
{"text":"Very nice place, mostly for take out but the atmosphere to dine in is great:) Food was delicious, service - fast, and pleasant. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is very good ! I tried the pasta dish with braised beef , it's really good! I need not to say more because other reviews has covered all in terms of how good this place is considering the good price from each dish. I say must try if haven't already!"}
{"text":"\"I thought this was TO finest\" -Friend

My stomach was growling and I wasn't feeling Chinese or anything too \"grubby.\" I came here on a Thursday afternoon into a fairly empty store. Like any other downtown restaurant, the space ran deep despite its small storefront. 
The process works like this: order at the cashier, pay, take a seat, the servers bring you your meal. Levetto has a variety of pizzas and pastas. We ordered the Bucatini Pasta and the Pollo Toscano Pizza. The Bucatini contained guanciale, sauteed red onions, chilli flakes, and a spicy tomato sauce. The Pollo Toscano was topped with chicken, sundried tomatoes, tomato pesto, red onion, and fresh basil. After ordering, you collect your utensils - they had both metal and plastic cutlery. 
My friend and I sat right beside the window, the best spot in the house! I like how they brought us a pitcher of water and would refill it when it was empty. 

The food:
-Bucatini pasta: crunch from the guaniacle (Italian cured pork, like prosciutto), pasta had a nice consistency and length per strand. The pasta was coated in a thick tomato sauce that had a perfect blend of spices. 
-Pollo Toscano: everything was good besides the fresh basil. It does look good (especially for photos) but personally, not a fan of eating it. 

I've visited their other locations and in general, I find that their stores are quite consistent with their dishes."}
{"text":"First time to try out this restaurant today. 

Let me start with the decor. 
I loved how intimate the place is and decorated nicely. I also loved the black and white graffiti wall outside of the restaurant :) with their red Logo. There are 4 tables in the restaurant and a couple of chairs at the bar. However, I did notice that a lot of people order to go. I also noticed that they receive a lot of phone calls and I assume they are for pick-up orders. There were a lot of people who came and went so there were always tables available. I don't know what it's like during the weekend.

Service. 
I really don't have any complaints. The lady who helped us was really nice. I also got a free dessert :):):). 

Now food. 
I decided to get the Patate and Rigatoni. The patate was a pretty crazy flavored pizza.  It had thin slices of yukon gold potatoes, ricotta cheese as its base, and truffle oil on top. It was tasty! As for the Rigatoni, they did run out of the Rigatoni pasta, but I substituted it with Spaghetti. I must say that it tasted authentic. The pasta was delicious on its own. The sauce and meat complimented the pasta nicely. The serving was also pretty large. Thennnnnnnnnnn,,,, for dessert, I had their yummy tiramisu. Nommmm!!! :) So so good. I wanna come back for it and drink coffee with it. I will post photos. I have never had tiramisu presented to me the way they did. It looked and tasted delicious. 

I will be back :)"}
{"text":"My new go to for pizza. One of the best pizzas I've ever had in Toronto. Had the affiliate pizza with smoked bacon and it was delicious. I can really tell that the dough was freshly made and the pizza was made fresh from the oven. The smoked bacon was delicious. What could possibly go wrong with bacon? And the cheese - the cheese was so good and so perfect and when you bite into a slice of pizza, you can taste the cheesy goodness. For $14, it's definitely a big portion for two - very very filling. You can even share it with 4 people. Because the ingredients are made fresh and the food has quality, you'll definitely get full easily. Definitely worth a try. 

I also like their wonderful take on the tiramisu. I expected the cake tiramisu but we got a cookie tiramisu that was semi-hard but still delicious. The cream filling wasn't so heavy and the coffee taste wasn't so strong. It was great with the blackberry and  a little sauce. 

Haven't had the chance to try their pasta but when I was looking at the menu, I was already drooling. My boyfriend and I were going to get pasta but the pizza made us really full (for $14, it's pretty awesome) so we couldn't go on anymore. I'm definitely coming back here!  

Great food with great atmosphere. Very small but it has a great vibe to it. Definitely looking forward to come here again!


-------

The owner actually personally contacted me on Yelp the other day thanking me for writing such a positive review and gave me a complementary pasta dish on my next visit. I came and I got the Rigatoni pasta and it was really delicious. In addition, I also got the smoked prosciutto and it was also just as great. The Dufferin and Rutherford location has a wonderful staff and I can't wait to visit again. Thank you for your complementary pasta. Very generous of you!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.   We love the homemade pasta and pizza but we typically just get the margarita pizza and Pomodoro pasta.  I wish we didn't live so far.  Every time we're close by, we try to eat here."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the food is really good here.  I've had the pizza before at an Elite event not long ago so I sort of knew what to expect as far as that went but this time around I was going to try some pasta as well.  

The set up of this place is casual.  You go up and order and pay at the counter and they'll eventually bring what you ordered to you.  This type of set up is not uncommon at all.  It reminds me sort of what Stoney's Bread does except here they don't give you a number I'm guessing because the place is small and they'd know who has what based on the quantity of sit down areas they would serve.

Our area was a larger put together seating area to seat about a dozen of us.  I went up to the counter and ordered an arugula salad and medium potato pizza for my wife while I had ordered a large spicy soppressata pizza and a pasta carbonara for myself.

The sizes of the pizza are by number of slices.  Each slice is about 5 x 5 inches (square).  Smalls are 4 slices, mediums are 6 and a large is really 2 mediums at 12 slices.

Now as I said the food was good and I really liked everything.  One thing that is quite noticeable is this place is busy and our server seemed sort of inundated.  Another person who was with us who had ordered a beer ended up bringing it with herself back to the table after ordering.  I had ordered a Peroni (bottle) and had to wait for a good 15 to 20 minutes before getting it.  I had asked our server for my beer or if I should go up and get it and she said she'd bring it to me.  It took longer than I had wanted needless to say.

The food came at different times for our table but my large took up a lot of the table.  I had asked around if anybody wanted a slice as it was a lot and I had wanted to share, some were able to grab a slice and try which was nice.  After our food had pretty much been eaten for the most part everybody was done and we were sort of concentrating on the baseball game on the TV near the front counter.

I had gone back up to the front counter and ordered a dessert for my wife (tiramisu) which was free with the Yelp check in and I had ordered her a cappuccino as well as I had ordered a San Pellegrino blood orange soda which is my favorite.  Again, I should have probably asked for my can of pop instead of returning to my seat.  Maybe about 15 minutes later our server brought 3 tiramisus out and we were passing them around.  My wife didn't like it that much as she said it was a little heavy on the rum.  I don't really care for dessert really as I just tried a small piece.

My wife's coffee still wasn't made.  Maybe it's just me but when you get your dessert and you order coffee they usually come at the same time or the coffee is first?  I had asked our server again if we were going to get our drinks and she said she'd be bringing them.  My wife eventually did get her coffee but my can of pop still wasn't brought to me.  This is a good 20 minutes after I went to the counter and paid for it which is about 20 feet away from where I sat.

Eventually I was guessing that my server forgot I had ordered a can of pop with the dessert and coffee so I just went up to the front counter again and had asked somebody about it.  It's sort of an open kitchen so I can see the server doing something else to the side as well as others working making dishes etc.  My pop was sitting at the side of the counter where it was finally handed to me after waiting for 2 other things (coffee and dessert) that had to actually be made.  What I was waiting for was in a can ready to drink and I didn't get it until I finally had to go up and ask for it again and I was thirsty and sort of fed up at that point.

I had also asked for a box for our left overs because I had an entire 7 slices left, enough to fit into a medium box.  The dishes sat on our table for a good 30 minutes+ after everybody was done.  

Now it's sort of obvious that this place is busy but I really didn't like the service here.  The food was good, very good but I just can't get over having to wait for drinks after asking numerous times.  If I had known it was going to be such an issue I'd stand at the counter and wait for it until they gave it to me if that in fact is what I'm supposed to do.  I'd rather have it handed to me right upon ordering than the order being either forgotten or taking anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes or never unless I eventually go up and ask for it again.

I'm not a fan of having dirty dishes living on the table for the entire time especially planks taking up all sorts of space in front of us while we're trying to figure out where we can put our dessert dishes down to be able to eat from them."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Italian food tonight so my fiancee and I ordered from levetto via uber eats. 

We ordered small patete pizza (potato pizza), spicy sopressta pizza and the funghi pizza as well! We also ordered Carbonara pasta as well for  lunch the next day.... but we were so hungry we devoured almost everything!

In a small pizza it comes with 4 decebt size square slices. Flavours were not overwhelming and toppings were generous. Our favourite was the sopressta... had the right amount of spiciness and also their tomato sauce was quite tasty and homey!! Funghi pizza is always a must get for me anywhere and the mushrooms and white sauce was very good. The pizza itself is super crunchy and is light! We didn't enjoy the potato pizza as much but we're glad we got to try it (or else we would regret it!)

The Carbonara was done perfectly.. and had a generous portion of bacon in it as well. The take out container was a fair size for the price you pay as well.

Price is very fair. 7 to 8 dollars for a small pizza and 12 dollars for the pasta. Even with delivery the items tasted very fresh and good! Overall great delivery experience with levetto"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is no where to be seen. It's like eating in a cafeteria in an office building. If you want food eat here. If you want an experience this ain't it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place!  It's so close to my house, and touts itself as the gourmet option over the Brass Taps.  The pizza was pretty mediocre.  It wasn't the thin crusted variety I was hoping for, and the flavour wasn't anything special.  The pasta was just okay, too.  I probably won't be going back because the price is a bit high for the value."}
{"text":"Dropped by the College St location for a late lunch.  My partner & I ordered the Affumicato and Salsiccia along with 2 glasses of house red and the warm coconut cake to go.  The pizza was excellent perfectly baked with a generous amount of toppings.  The sauce had a nice tang to it and the bacon used on the Affumicato was crisp and smokey but not greasy at all. Ditto for the Salsiccia--the sausage used was not greasy but full of flavor.  What we additionally liked was the crust.  It was airy with a crisp finish and didn't leave us with a heavy bloated feeling afterwards. 

The show stopper for me was the warm brown butter cake.  It was the nicest dessert I have experienced in ages. The cake was moist and not too sweet and could easily be eaten on its own.  The icing, coconut and pistachio bits compliment it well.  The cake is stellar.  Staff are good folks, very friendly and approachable. Prices for the quality of the food is more than reasonable. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"we went to the mac and cheese festival and was completely unsatisfied so we decide to search of a local restaurant in the area to find this gem of a place.   we go out for a lot of pasta and Italian food but we stumbled onto this place we didn't expect it to be this good.  The price was reasonable and the tiramisu had was delicious. I liked that it was a cute little place that's kind of casual but not an entirely full restaurant.  If we were to come to this area again we would definitely eat here. I love it. 5 stars.

Food 5/5
Price 4.5/5
Venue 5/5"}
{"text":"Just ordered through UberEATS and the food was tasty. Based on the photos on the app and the prices, I was expecting tiny portions. But Wow the portions are massive! Pasta is made in house and mixed with simple fresh ingredients. I was a bit disappointed with the pizza though - the crust was very dry and quite thick. Not my style, but then again depends on personal preference."}
{"text":"In town from Chicago on business. Had a taste for good pasta but didn't feel like going out or paying double price for inadequate room service. The romaine salad and carbonara pasta did not disappoint. The servings are large. With the salad and pasta, it's easily a meal for 3 people."}
{"text":"Pro : Excellent Portion & Price 
Went twice and each i was satisfied .

Con : Service could have been slightly better I dont like to pay and have to give a tips before being served, but for the food nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect 
Had an amazing pizza   Everything is fresh and tasty.   Can't believe I've never eaten here before.    Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great staff, super accommodating with kids too! The margherita pizza had a wonderfully crispy, yet light crust. Also if you have kids who like pasta with butter you can rest assured; our guys said it was the best butter pasta they've ever had. To those who know what it's like to have picky kids, this place is a godsend."}
{"text":"I've seen a few of these places around, looked pretty good so I decided to give it a try. Fresh pasta, pizza and some decent sounding desserts.

To say I was disappointed would be a massive understatement. 

We got the Ragu pasta, Carbonara, a pizza and the 'Warm Brown Butter Coconut Semolina Cake'. I'd usually use this part of the review to write about the flavours but there weren't any to speak of (unless you count a metallic aftertaste).  

The pizza was reminiscent of Pizza Hut except last time I checked Pizza Hut has the brilliant idea of actually cooking their dough. I am pleased to formally induct them as a proud member of the Undercooked Pizza Club

Did I say Dessert earlier because I meant Desert, the Warm Brown Butter Coconut Semolina Cake was.... hold on I need a glass of water just thinking about it. The experience of eating this was like having a large handful of sawdust repeatedly thrown in your face. Already dry as a bone the coconut and pistachios shavings on top were the icing on the cake - from hell."}
{"text":"With everyone talking about the Peking Duck pizza, I had to give it a shot. We got both the peking duck pizza (which is this location's exclusive specialty item) and the Smoked Prosciutto pizza. I thought that the peking duck pizza would just be a neat novelty but it was a delicious combination of sweet, savoury, and deliciously crispy duck skin! It definately feels like I am eating the traditional dish with a nice twist to it!

The Smoked Prosciutto pizza was also very good. The sweet date sauce added another dimension to the smokey and salty prosciutto. It was a great treat. 

To add a cherry on top of the incredible meal thus far, they gave us two complimentary Panna Cotta. Which was delicious in my opinion because I love cinnamon. Overall this was a nice experience of causal italian dining with a specialty item to die for!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! I've been hearing a lot of good things about levetto. 

A must get is the peking duck pizza, it really does taste like the real thing! The carbonara pasta is also tasty, but we were too full to finish it so we took the rest home.

There is limited seating so best to come early or on a weekday."}
{"text":"Wow, can't wait to come back here and try more! This was our first visit - had the carbonara pasta, funghi pizza and marguerita pizza. All were delicious but especially enjoyed the pasta! Not sure what the dessert was called but absolutely loved it - cake with coconut and pistachio on top. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Levetto just opened up near my house and I love it. Not only do they offer a pretty wide variety of cool pizza flavors but their staff are extremely friendly, the service is crazy fast, and they even offered us complimentary desert! 

Despite being an italian restaurant located in China Town, Levetto does almost everything right. I tried the funghi pizza and a meat based pizza and loved it. It was slightly charred, doughy, and full of flavor. Would definitely order again.

Oh, and did I mention it only took 10 minutes for me to order and pick up my pizza?"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great vibes and good times! 100% recommend going here for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Very nice pasta and pizza. Got the beef rigatoni and a large pizza to share (forgot the name). The pizza was sooooooo good and crispy on the bottom, the cheese was perfect and toppings were generous. My fav has to be the pasta tho - the rigatoni was perfectly al dente and the sauce adhered to it so well. There was lot of beef and it was very tender and soft. Portion was very generous as well. I'm picky with my pasta and this one was probably one of the best I've had so far. Def coming back!!"}
{"text":"We came here on our infamous quest for perfect pizza. 

This place serves square shaped, thick crust Romana pizza. I ordered Pollo Tuscano (chicken). Crust was thick and flavourful. Chicken was fresh. Expect stretchy cheese with every bite. You can tell that this place does not cut corners when it comes to ingredients and is more interested in making a great quality pizza rather than simply making a quick buck from potheads.

Prices are very reasonable. Sizes are a little tricky, small = 4 slices, medium = 6 slices, large = 12 slices. In case you are wondering, yes small should be enough to fill you up. Remember to leave room for complimentary dessert upon checking in.

While this cozy place is mainly for takeout orders, they sure put on efforts to accommodate our dine in experience. Proper plates, bowls, and silverware. I was impressed by how the staff handled our table of 8 even though they were getting takeout orders left and right. They serve Alcoholic beverages here. Clean, modern washrooms.

Overall great place. I strongly recommend Levetto to those who like 'em thick (I'm talking about the pizza crust). Perfect for takeout and catering."}
{"text":"Maybe 4 1/2 but good fresh food and solid portions. Ambience is functional that's my only critique."}
{"text":"I don't know why they closed the Trambusto restaurant on Yelp, it just changed its name, they confirmed this when I was there last.  Not really fair to them since they have near perfect reviews.  If a moderator reads this, they should consider combining the two.

This differs than many of the authentic pizza joints opening up.  It's not the  Neapolitan style one might expect.  Rather this one is based on Roman cuisine, which for Pizza differs quite a bit.  The dough is deeper and has a different texture.  At first is wasn't keen, but it has grown on me and now I highly recommend it.  Their pasta is all fresh made.  I typically get the tagliatelle, which I add lobster two (although half the time they are out of the lobster).

Website says it's\"fast food prices\", but I would say its sit down restaurant prices.  They do have some seating but the take out is the same price."}
{"text":"At the invitation of the owner, we paid Levetto another visit. We ordered the Sopresso pizza again, this time it came with an abundance of fresh toppings and the same amazingly fresh and crunchy crust. We decided to leave out the Salsiccia pizza as we suspect the spicy pepper might not have agreed with our stomach last time. Instead we took the opportunity to try their famous ragu beef rigatoni and it did not disappoint. We will be back again and again! We appreciate that the owner took the time to address our concerns and the receptiveness to our feedback."}
{"text":"If they would answer their phones occasionally I'd give this a 5/5. But they only have 4.90/5 (;'p)
Anyway,  funghi pizza = cheesy mushroom heaven. This pizza is rich, decadent, pretty and comforting. 
The tagliatelle, with fresh peas and just the right amount of tomato... Ughhh. .. delicious, simple and cheap. This is comfort and affordable food!!! I found it! 
The coconut brown butter (don't remember the name?) Cake was outstanding, rich and melts in the mouth with crisp notes of baked coconut... ummm... yyyuuuummmsss. Get this! Always. The ingredients are outstanding for all their dishes, the recipes are unique but will hit your pizza craving, pow!, right in the kissa!"}
{"text":"I'm a long time fan of Levetto!! 
Their Pizza is my absolute favorite in the world! (Funghi & Margherita) I've yet to try the duck Pizza, but I'm happy with my usual orders. 

Upon visiting this location, my whole group of friends unanimously decided that the Pizza is way better than the pasta. In fact, the Bucatini, Trecce, and Carbonara dishes that my friends ordered were not to their liking..(ate a bit, and took the rest home). And as I sampled it, it just did not make for good pasta. The lack of an orgasm in my mouth from the pasta actually made me a wee bit disappointed.. because everything else at Levetto is absolute heaven. 

-The Margherita: the best piece of food I'll ever have.. just my favorite thing in the world. Amazing consistency and really really delicious. 5/5!
-The funghi: awesome as usual, and does Not disappoint. 5/5!


As someone who works at a classic restaurant, I can definitely say that Levetto needs to work on their pasta a bit more.. 
-The Trecce tasted a bit bland.. and the sundried tomato chunks could have been minimized, as they seemed to take over the dish. I dont know what, but this dish needs a 'kick'. 2/5.I believe the pasta was a bit undercooked also.
-The Bucatini that I so love.. the sauce was just not on point this time, and I just did not enjoy it as I normally do. 4/5.
-The Carbonara. Where to start. It tasted a bit 'eggy' for our liking, and was too similar to the flavor of some instant noodles, which we did not enjoy. 3/5.

I however really do commend Levetto for offering such delicious portions, along with toppings that are just utterly satisfying. I KNOW that they will do well , because Levetto is just one of those awesome restaurants that wants to please their guests each time. It's true for their customer service...which is pretty damn AMAZING as usual. 

 -You do have to order at the counter, and tipping becomes optional as you pretty much pay as you order. You have the choice to hold on to your tab, but it just seems natural to just pay for what you ask for on the spot. 
The ambiance here is pretty cool. Rushed, but has a rustic, and homely feel to it. 

 Also, the Semolina cakes are to DIE for. Try it! It cannot be enjoyed with just 1 person, you will need atleast 3+ people to finish this sucker off, as it is VERY rich, and VERY sweet. *Pistachio crumbles*..so beware.. Nut allergic people."}
{"text":"Cannot beat it for the price!!! Fresh made pasta was cooked to perfection with a great al dente texture. The flavor of the sauces were balanced lovely and the whole time I was eyeing the pizza from the table next to us. Will have to come back for pizza sometime. I love that the couple next to us ordered one pizza and one pasta and split it between them. Seems to be the way to go if you want to try both!"}
{"text":"This place resent lay changes their name from team bistro to levito. When we saw the renovation we thought they were closing. My family and I were really mad. There pastas are really great. In our family we have my perspective from a 12 year old my brothers who's a teen and our parents. Just don't get the Cesar salade they really jump you on the cheese"}
{"text":"This is my go to Friday night joint for pizza take out.

The funghi and the veggie pizza are the best."}
{"text":"Meh.. If these guys think they are going to take over  the pizza market in the GTA they have a lot of work to do. We are blessed in Toronto to have so many good Italian options whether it be along College/St.Clair or in Woodbridge Vaughan area.
I only ordered the bacon and onion pizza which for $14 was just ok. The crust tasted like it was mass produced and the toppings were minuscule.
I think these guys would be successful with this product in a market like Indiana or Utah not the 4th largest city in North America that has a massive Italian community. Maybe the pasta is fantastic, but I'm not interested in finding out."}
{"text":"So I tried the pizza there and it was okay??? Like it wasn't the best, but it also wasn't the worst. You know how there was that one person in high school that was in all your classes, but you never really noticed them? They were just there. Ya, well that's how I feel about the pizza. Which, according to a bunch of reviews, is the main selling point of this restaurant.

Anyway.

The four stars is all for the cavatelli pasta. My, oh my. What. A. Dish. A+. 100%. 4.0. 
The truffle oil takes it from 0 to 100. I normally hate ricotta cheese (seriously, why call yourself cheese if you don't taste like anything????) but this is the one and only dish where it actually works. The price for the dish is a bit expensive. (I'm seeing all these comments about great price and I'm just here with my 14$ cavatelli oops. )

Ya. I could honestly go on for DAYS. The cavatelli pasta is a delicious work of art, and if I had Shakespeare's writing skills, I swear I would write sonnets about it. But alas.

Aside from the cavatelli dish (wow, still writing about it, even though I said I would stop), the rest is okay. Honestly, I don't remember much about other aspects of the restaurant (service, other food, price) because, literally, all I think about when I'm at Levetto is cavatelli."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING Service was so friendly and opening, food was exceptional! The pasta wasn't too saucy, but so incredibly rich. I got the bacon carbonara and arugula salad, while my BF got the pollo Toscano pizza and the Alfredo pasta (secret menu item)  could not recommend this place enough. There was a small mix up with our reservation times and they were so apologetic about it we weren't even upset !!! They made sure we were happy!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We waited a while for a table but it was worth the wait! Great ambience and food to die for.  Will go back again SOON!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Levetto last night for dinner and I have to say that this place has excellent service and some really attentive, hardworking staff. The joint was pretty busy but they served us our two romaine salads and medium verde pizza almost as soon as we sat down, and everything was really fresh and delicious. 

Cool story: The manager came by near closing time and chatted with us (awesome guy) and then just gave my girlfriend and I a bag with two amazing pasta dinners that someone hadn't picked up. And as we were heading out, he had the kitchen staff whip up a panna cotta dessert for us to take home too.

tl;dr delicious food at a fair price, give this place a shot you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The beef ragu was phenomenal! Beef was soft, sauce was perfect. The leftovers were even better, the bf was fighting over it lol. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten take out from here so I can't speak for the dine-in service. If you do plan to dine in though, please keep in mind the service structure here...you order and pay first then get seated. 

The pasta is made fresh and cooked to perfection with the tastiest blend of ingredients and pasta sauce. This is my go-to pasta restaurant, second only to Gusto 101. The pizza comes in two sizes: a small with is great for one and a larger one for sharing. I highly recommend the prosciutto pizza - this is my all time favourite pizza and available at all Levetto locations. 

What I like about this location is that they offer a Peking Duck pizza which is not available at another Levetto locations."}
{"text":"Wowww. This is quite the little gem in the heart of Toronto. You pay and order at the front and they bring it to you, so it's pretty much like half-service. The decor was very nice and inviting as well. Has the Italian-cafe vibe. 

-----About the service-----
It's pretty much what you expect from a half-service restaurant; we were out of water for some time but I'll give them a break because the food is on point. 

-----About the food-----
Everything is really good here and the portions are quite large so if you're a hungry fella this is the place to come ! I got the rigatoni and the soppresstata pizza. These two dishes are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The pizza is a must. try. The crust is extremely soft and the full basil on top of each slice gives it such an aromatic flavor, you really wont regret it. You'll get 6 slices for a small rectangle pizza, but it is very worth it in my opinion. 

The rigatoni also did not disappoint. Very nicely presented and packed a bunch of flavor. The sauce covered every single pasta and I would have kept eating if the pizza hadn't filled me up in the first place. 

Overall, a very quality restaurant that is good for dinner. Seating should also not be an issue because they have a few tables in the front and also a few tables in the back. I will definitely be back when I'm in Toronto !"}
{"text":"I've tried their rigatoni and carbonara here - it's okay but nothing amazing in my opinion. I also find that their pastas are DRENCHED in oil, i'm not sure if that's a signature of southern-italian style cuisine but both of my pastas were really oily and fat. I would recommend their desserts though as their tiramisu is really good. The vibe and atmosphere of this restaurant is great especially on nights and I find the service to be great and attentive.

Compared to other Italian restaurants in downtown, the price you're paying is truly a bargain - almost 1/2 of what other pasta dishes would be priced at in other restaurants. On the other hand, it is a bit isolated from the core of Downtown and there's not a lot of space around the area for parking as well. 

I'll come back one day and try out their pizzas after reading through all of these reviews!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is like a hybrid fast casual/sit down restaurant. You order at the cash then your order is brought to you table relatively quickly. I came here with co-workers on a Thursday evening and the place was quite empty so the wait was only around 10 minutes for our food. 

I got their bacon mushroom pizza but unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of the crust. It tasted like a odd combination between delissio and Pizza Hut. The toppings were good though. The tomato sauce had a strong tomato flavour but didn't have much seasoning to it. My coworker got the prosciutto pizza, but be warned, the sauce is made from dates and is quite sweet so it is a bit of an acquired taste. 

The prices were quite reasonable, for a small personal pizza it's around $10 and their pastas and salad are also around that range. Definitely come here and share dishes so you can try a couple of things! 

Also, parking is super affordable in the area. I parked at the Green P lot on Baldwin which only costs $4 total from 7pm to 6am, so if you ever stop by the Kensington market area, definitely park there!"}
{"text":"I ordered some salad and pizza some time. I love the way they cook, and it fresh as always. This place will come on my mind if I want to have pizza. Pizza was tasty and fresh as well as salads By the way, they probably take a bit long time but for me im okay with that :)"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Love their pizzas and home made pasta!! Super friendly owner and staff!! 
Must try their mushroom pizza!! 
The place is very small though. No reservation available. So arrive early and be ready to wait a bit."}
{"text":"I found this place in Yelp reviews but the food wasn't as hood as I expected...the meet the pizzas was very little that I barely taste the duck or italian sausage. Just gave two stars for good customer service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Before coming here, I was really excited to try this placed based on the 4.5 stars review. I really think Yelp reviews are rigged these days. 

We ordered...
- pea pesto with truffle oil pasta. It was super bland and tasteless 
- rigatoni - this was probably the most decent and flavourful dish. Cooked al Dante and tomato sauce was tastey. 
- smoked prosciutto pizza - dough was thick, wasn't hand tossed, you can tell it was a pre made dough as it wasn't chewy. More like a flat bread. 

To top this all off, after waiting an hour for our order, we asked the staff where our meal was and apparently it \"didn't go through\".  We could've been sitting there all night waiting for our meals and they would not have noticed. After the staff discovered out meal \"didn't go through\" no apologies were given. Wow. The three stars I have given is a generous score."}
{"text":"Overall, a great experience at Levetto! The restaurant is clean and has a really modern/edgy feel. At first glance it is quite small with limited seating but they have a room in the back with additional tables (for up to 16 people I would say). I had reserved a table for a group of 6 and they gave us a table in the back room. My only complaint was that it felt a little disjointed from the rest of the restaurant and there was no windows/natural light.

Food: We had the peking duck pizza to share and I had the carbonara pasta. The peking duck pizza was good, but disappointing as it did not have as much duck compared to the promotional photos they had on display. The carbonara was amazing and definitely the best vs. the Cavatelli and Bucatini. The pasta noodles were a lovely, chewy consistency - almost similar to ramen noodles. The sauce was not too rich, which was nice. They give entire strips of bacon which was awesome, but they were not as crispy as the ones in the promo photos. Really good portions for the price!

The staff was very attentive and they even gave us panna cotta on the house at the end which was great!"}
{"text":"The food here is truly excellent. So delicious and a party to your tastebuds. The service is a bit slow (thankfully, we weren't in a hurry), but their friendliness and courtesy when they were actually around was appreciated. Overall, despite a few kinks, we really enjoyed our visit to this location. 

First, parking. There's a Green P located just west of the restaurant, and on a weekday, parking is $1.50 for every half hour before 7:00 PM. After 7:00 PM, the flat rate is $5.00. There's also lots of street parking available around the restaurant (if you can find a spot).

Second, the food. Remember to 'check in' in the Yelp app - you get a free dessert! We ordered the Soppressata (Spicy) in half size ($7.00), the Carbonara ($12.50). We also ordered the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake (free with the Yelp app). Overall, very tasty. The pizza had a wonderful kick, and although the bacon wasn't very crispy, the carbonara was delicious and hearty (heavy on the cheese). The coconut cake was quite decent, but a lot denser than I expected it to be - it's not fluffy at all, and the coconut flavours really stand out. Still, a pretty good meal!

I guess our only issue was the service. They don't check on you very often, and we were confused about whether this is a self-serve restaurant, or a wait-service type restaurant (we still don't know - it was very confusing). We were waiting around 20 minutes to order until we gave up and went to the counter to order (we didn't know if we had to order ourselves, or wait for staff to come take our order). We also had to bring our own plates up to the counter ourselves - we weren't sure if we had to or not but did so anyway since no one came to take them. We were walked to our table when we first came in and introduced to a server, so we assumed it was a wait-service type experience. But, the rest of the evening felt very self-serve, and we weren't checked on during our meal at all. Not sure if it's supposed to be that way? Note: we were the only patrons in the restaurant.

Anyway, service confusion aside, the staff themselves were very warm and courteous when they were around. And the food is definitely worth coming back for. A great casual spot for Italian fare - a solid 4 for the food."}
{"text":"The quantity vs. price is one of the best I've ever had in Toronto! 
We had 2 single-size pizza, one pasta and one salad. We 3 people was so full and did not finish. The taste was great! We love the Funghi pizza most. It's definitely worth of trying! 
Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and dessert. The chef accommodated my being GF."}
{"text":"This is an update for my previous review! A year ago I gave this place a bad review to what have happened however, the manager reached me immediately after I posted on yelp sent me an apology with a gift card of 50$. Thought it is very representative of how good their customer service is! Finally, visited Toronto and was able to get back to the same place to have a better experience and so I had. The servers were exceedingly welcoming. I should say they changed my previous review to a better one. Thank you Levetto"}
{"text":"Generous portions at reasonable prices for unique pastas is the definition for Levetto. I came here as a meeting point on a Sunday afternoon. It's not a huge place, but there are a good number of seats. I noticed a lot of people going in for take-out. Service was excellent; our server knew the menu well and she was very attentive, ensuring that we were enjoying our meal and experience here. Liberty Village is a little out of the way for me, but I wouldn't mind returning if I'm in the west end. Hidden in a sea of condos, you can find a lot of street parking (along with a garage Green P). The pastas were delicious - I especially liked the Cavatelli as I've never had pea pesto before. With a Yelp check-in, you get a dessert; we ordered the tiramisu, which was quite nice.

Good for: lunch, dinner, pasta, groups"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and her baby. It's a small place with 5 tables and seats available by the counter. A lot of people come in to order take-out. Food was delicious. We ordered a carbonara and the patate pizza. The pasta was delicous, lots of bacon and the pasta was cooked well. Love the crust for the pizza. The place was clean and server was nice."}
{"text":"I love trying new places to eat and am totally excited to see a Levetto pop up in the area.  A fast Italian restaurant in Chinatown! What more could you want?

Naturally I had to go try it as soon as I saw it open.  The location although it was small in term of seating was very nice.  I like the decor and design on the wall.  The service was quick and friendly. They brought us water immediately and took our order.  The owner came over to check on us and make sure we had a great time. 

We had the rigatoni with braised beef.  You could tell the pasta was made fresh which is a real highlight of levetto in general. the beef was tender was a nice balance with the sauce.  We also had the Trecce which was very flavourful for a lighter option.  Everyone really enjoyed it as well.  But the real reason I was there was to try something you can't get anywhere else and that is the Peking Duck pizza!  I'm hesitant of places that use other sauces other than tomato sauce, like cream sauce or a BBQ sauce because I find the flavour often over powering.  But the hoisin sauce they used was PERFECT! Cucumber and chives with the duck made it feel authentic to the traditional dish.  The crispy skin flavour was the best part bringing the whole pizza together.  If you are going here you have to try it. I wanted more but we ordered so much I thought better to leave it til my next visit.

The price was great for the service and quality of food.

With that being said we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small little restaurant with a quick take out ordering style. There are a few tables for you to sit and dine at after you've ordered and paid. The menu has different selections of salad, pasta, and pizza. 

We had the Rigatoni Pasta and Funghi Pizza! They were both good choices - The food tasted great, and certainly satisfied my cravings for Italian. However, while the Rigatoni is a decent option, it tasted a bit mediocre and wasn't too distinct to me. I expected more after reading the reviews, and felt as though I could order something like that anywhere. Probably wouldn't get this item again. I really liked the pizza though!! It was delicious, creamy, and tasted different from the pizza I usually eat. Medium is the perfect size to share between two people.

Service was average. Didn't really get a chance to talk to anyone at the restaurant at all, except for when I went up to get my order taken. 

Overall, Levetto is a pretty nice place to stop by for a quick bite if you're in the mood for Italian. I recommend ordering in advance if you don't to wait - It took us about 15 minutes to get our food. I probably wouldn't travel far to come here, but since I live somewhat close, I would probably pay this place another visit to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Best pasta and pizza in Thornhill. Freshly made pasta, quality felt throughout the dish makes this place the best place to go for
Italian in Thornhill Woods. The place is small so takeout may be the option but the food was good and good value. Thank god we will not have to order from Dante's anymore to get a pasta fix. Coffee was also fab but it would be nice if they could add a desert or two or even just a biscotti."}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch southern-Italian style pizza. 

Levetto is a clean and simple space, comfortable for singles to a group of 8. High ceilings, no TV, elegant lighting at night, big windows for sunny daytime. The only poor choice is the big screen menu, which cheapens the look, and is unfortunately part of the first impression you'll get. 

Service is friendly and professional. Even though you order at the counter, your meal is served to you at the table. Dine-in means you get a real plate and cutlery -- only water glasses are plastic. 

The pizza is crispy and flavourful. I had the heirloom tomato pizza , a special the day I stopped by. I'd have it again, or try the fungi.  

Yelp tempted me into dessert, a pana cotta which had fresh berries and little amaretto cookies. All desserts are made in house. 

5 stars! A lovely addition to the Toronto pizza scene."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the pizzas here and the pasta was also good, only small thing about this place is that, the asian girl that was the server was rude to me and my bf. Didn't like the way she talks to other customers and how she just bang the pasta bowl on the table and left"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night and we're able to find a table immediately. There isn't much seating so it may be tough if you came with a large group of people. 
We ordered the pasta carbonara, small funghi pizza, and a large spicy soppressata pizza. Pasta was pretty good but way too creamy and heavy for my preference. The pizza was pretty good as well (really good bread), but it was too oily. 
Prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you receive. 
Overall, pretty good restaurant in the area. The good was just a bit too oily/creamy for my preference."}
{"text":"Rigatoni was perfect, ragu was made well with braised beef, delicious. My teenage son loved the pomodoro - said it was the closest to Italy we've had in a year. He said he'd love for someone to open up this same restaurant back home in Wisconsin! Giving 4 stars rather than 5 only due to seating being very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, fresh pasta, simple but very nice deserts, good coffee, relaxing atmosphere. What else can we ask for? Maybe a little more of wine choices. We wish to have more places like Levetto around."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today because I heard great things and the reviews seemed great. While I do feel bad rating this place 3 stars considering I've only tried 1 thing, I'll probably end up updating this review in the future. Anyways, my first impressions of Levetto were okay. Not bad, but also not amazing.

My boyfriend and I were craving Italian food and we had our eye on this place for a while now. This restaurant is easy to spot while driving down Dufferin and parking is easy because it's located in a plaza. I had originally thought that this place was actually a restaurant (tables, waiter service, etc), but it's actually more like a small cafe. There were 4 or 5 tables with 4 seats each and a small bar you can sit at with another 5 or so chairs. For a Friday afternoon (1pm), I'm surprised that all the tables were full. There's a high school nearby so there were quite a few high school girls hanging around here.

The menu is very small and you have to order and pay up front (some reviews claim that they will take your order at your table but this wasn't my case). I had the single size verte pizza ($7.5) and my boyfriend had the carbonara ($12). It didn't take very long for our food to arrive, and I can see that they make it all fresh! I didn't try the pasta, but my pizza was very delicious! The verte pizza comes with a lot of green vegetables on top and the oil that they drizzle on was deliciously sweet. I only wish there was more cheese, or the cheese was more evenly spread out at least. The single size pizza was just the perfect size for me, but I'm also a small girl and wasn't very hungry then.

Overall, I really enjoyed the pizza and I hope to try a different style next time. Unfortunately, you can't make reservations here so I would suggest coming at an odd hour. The food is fresh and tasty, but portions are just average. Looking forward to updating this review in the future!"}
{"text":"The pizza tastes like cardboard. Please don't waste your money on their pizza. It truly is disgusting.

Their pasta on the other hand is half decent. I used to frequently order it on uber eats for lunch at work. I liked it better before they raised their prices. They used to charge $11 for plain old pomodoro pasta and now it is $14. 

Their desserts are mediocre at best. 

This place is an okay lunch place but I would never want to be taken here on a date. The food is not worthy of sharing with somebody else."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the area! Nice cozy place for a quick dinner. Ordered the coconut semolina cake, extremely dry.....not recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, salad and pasta. Service not the greatest but the prices ate reasonable and its best to order at the front counter. I've been 4 times."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice modern aesthetic. I got the Pesto Toscano pizza and it was pretty good. The pizza crust is thick yet airy, with just the right amount of crunch on the exterior. The pizza would have been 5 stars if it weren't for the olives they used. I usually like olives but these olives were wayyyy too strong for the pizza. They overpowered all other flavors and that was disappointing because it was a great pizza otherwise. I would probably spring for the Margherita next time."}
{"text":"Small little restaurant with about 5 or 6 tables.  Makes great tasting pasta that comes In a good portion for its prices.  Service is good.  Have been back a few times."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant for a casual meal.  Majority of the patrons come for takeout or order delivery as there were  few condos in the area. However, I decided to come try it out after passing by and reading some of the reviews.

There are a few tables and at first, I thought it was like a fast food restaurant where you order and pick-up the food at the counter.  However, to my surprise, we were served at the table like a normal restaurant.  The interior decor is very simple and that mean great savings on food.  We ordered rigatoni with braised beef and a salad to share which was amazing.  Not too full and just right.

Although we opted to only drink water, they have a variety of drinks including pop, beer and wine. I will definitely return for their pizza.  To top off the night, we had 2 of the desserts which were just ok.  As an added benefit for Yelpers, they offer free dessert for your Yelp app check-in."}
{"text":"Great intimate restaurant! Sometimes it's great to go to a no nonsense restaurant especially with a little one. Don't expect waited on, it's \"Hey Meatball\" type of restaurant but everything needed is in close proximity, ie. napkins, forks, knives, etc. I can only give it 4/5 stars because the pasta came out warm although it was quite good and there is no wind shield for the small restaurant so whenever the door opens a gust of cold wind comes in."}
{"text":"TL;DR: I love Levetto so much. Their carbonara is literally too awesome to not try! The only reason that this place isn't getting a 5 stars is their lack of space, since they are only able to host around 5 groups or around 20 people maximum. 

1. Food (5/5):

Yeah, I find that their house-made carbonara is up their on one of the best I've had in the area. The portions are great for the price (around $10). I've also heard good things about their pizza, but I personally favor pizza with thicker crust (though this is probably the pizza a lot of people favor). Please try try try their carbonara and I know for sure that you will not regret it!

2. Service (4.5/5):

Friendly staff that tell you what's good.

3. Space / Seating (4/5):

The place is actually pretty small located near the West Chinatown in Toronto. As a result, there isn't much seating and you might either have to wait for a table to become available or take your food to go and find some other place to eat it. I would say that they have enough tables for about 5 groups of people, or seating around 20 people at most.

------------

Overall (4 - 4.5/5)"}
{"text":"I've been having a weird feeling about reviewing this place since I first stepped inside the building. Perhaps part of my expectations were thrown off simply because I remember the layout of when this place was called Hadley's, and this is absolutely nothing like that. I'm not going to let a previous tenant influence my opinion overall, but I will say that the room seems much smaller now. The bar/open kitchen area is on the opposite side of the room. It also seems much brighter, which makes it seem much more casual than what I expected in going to a place serving fresh pasta and well crafted Italian pizzas.
Perhaps this why their price points are lower than a standard Italian joint, as an order of pasta, a small pizza, 1 glass of wine and 2 bottles of beer came to just $39 post-tax pre-tip.

While I'm not as impressed as some of the past reviewers in the food, I will say it was good. There is a very to-the-point menu of pasta, pizza, or salads to choose from. While surprised by a lack of appetizer options, we moved on past that fact, and still enjoyed what we did settle on.
The beer menu was also very short and boring, with Steamwhistle, Mill Street Organic, and Moretti (aka: all lagers or pilsners) being on offer in bottles or cans. 

Staff were friendly so no complaints there, but I still feel a little something to be desired in my dining experience, so I can't in good conscious give the 5th star on this review."}
{"text":"We ordered the pesto pea pasta and Sicilian pizza - huge portions! The tiramisu cake was very different not sure if I like that kind of a tiramisu or not."}
{"text":"My second try on trecce with chicken. 
It's actually pretty good and flavourful for a simple Italian dish. 

If you don't like saucy pasta. This is the one to go!

Gonna try other dishes next time!"}
{"text":"Levetto came recommended by friends in Toronto. We were exploring dinner options within walking distance and they mentioned that this place was like a pasta bar that made their own pasta! So many options were mentioned to me but being in T.O and aware that nice Italian food was probably all around, they had me at \"pasta\" (especially if it's homemade!). I'm not a big red sauce person so I ordered the Trecce, which was tasty. It wasn't super heavy or greasy and still had a healthy feel to it because of this. Anything with sundried tomatoes & goat cheese, you can count me in! It also had garlic infused olive oil, chili flake and arugula. The goat cheese helped pull it together and the sundried tomato gave it that flavor. Maybe not my favorite pasta bowl of all times but I still enjoyed it, and we ordered our food to go. Nice location. Small restaurant space but still enough to sit and eat. Next time I'd like to try their pizza! We were able to got free dessert with Yelp check-in, so that was a pleasant surprise! As the \"guest\" for the evening, I was happy to make this happen for the homies."}
{"text":"A bit small, but love the style and atmosphere. The price is amazing for the amount of food you get. My friend and I ordered a arugula salad, carbonara and patato pizza. Delicious. All of it. Love the concept of paying before and eating then go. Great service. Friendly and on top of things. Definitely recommend. Would love to see more locations in North York area if possible. Drove all the way to Thornhilll/Vaughan for it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at a reasonable price. Fresh made pasta in house. Friendly staff (Thanks Jerman, Thanks Amanda). Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Andrew jetting in from The Nice Guys , here. 

This was my first and last time at this restaurant. The food was mediocre at best, but the service was the real nail in the coffin on this one. Not only did we wait long to even talk to a server to order our food, we had to clean our own table and grab our own silverware from this establishment. There was a grease spill on our table, I practically slid off the thing when I put my arm down! We waited an hour to get our food and it was lukewarm when we got it. 

If you're going here expecting to have a great time with your family, or maybe end your workday with a cold one with the guys, look elsewhere; you will leave this place more stressed than you did coming in. 

This is Andrew signing off."}
{"text":"Delicious Cavatelli and white chocolate tiramisu. Great service as well! Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for pasta in the vaughan / Richmondhill area. Its always made fresh and the flavors are fantastic. Today I went for lunch with my girlfriend and we both ordered pasta. I had the carbonara and she ordered amatriciana. The carbonara was so good with fresh cheese grated on top and high amounts of bacon. The pasta is made fresh every day and you can truly taste the difference. I highly suggest the carbonara as it's very filling and perfectly creamy."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Maybe I'm missing something, I saw 4+ stars and thought it would be a great place for my fiancé and I to go to for Valentine's Day. 

The rigatoni tasted like chef boyardee and the only thing I could taste on the carbonara was the bacon (granted that's a good thing to some). If the brown sugar cake wasn't sitting there for a month or two they must be using some type of experimental flour because I've tasted envelopes less dry. 

I'm honestly not sure how they got this rating because it's not like the servers were attentive. 

STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Date & Time of visit: Sunday, August 06, 2017 @ 7:00pm-8:20pm
Atmosphere: Tiny, Fast Paced - In & Out eatery.
Cleanliness: Restaurant appeared to be clean, however the cushioned seating had food debris on it. Cutlery, plates and glasses were clean.
Constructive criticism: Wipe down the cushioned seating.
Cuisine: Italian
Facilities: Did not visit the facilities.
Food: My fiancé ordered the Misticanza salad to start. It came with shaved fennel, radish, mixed greens, orange, and fresh dill, excellent size portion. I ordered the Roasted Radicchio salad. It came with fruit, greens, toasted almond, and white wine vinaigrette. Excellent size portion, dressing was the right amount, and flavorful. 

For our mains, we both ordered the large size (6 squares) Soppressata pizza. On the pizza was: spicy soppressata, crushed tomato sauce, Fior di Latte, and fresh basil. The flavor wasn't bad at all. You're not going to get that authentic Italian sauce which nonna makes. Unfortunatly, it was just ok. The pizza could use more flavor. Romania pizza, is usually deep dish in style, so this replicated the roman style pizza fairly. The fior di latte cheese was good. 
Since we were there on a Sunday, Levetto has a free desert special! We chose the Panna Cotta. A seasonal compote, crumbled amaretti cookie, with cinnamon. It was delicious!


Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: We look forward to coming back with our little guy since the menu can be child friendly. Sadly this location of Levetto is not equipped for large groups. We heard about Levetto buy browsing College St. Pizzerias on Yelp.com.
Parking: conveniently located in front of the restaurant on the main road. Since it was Sunday after 5pm, parking was free/
Portion Sizes: Satisfied. We left feeling content! 
Price: Good. 2 salads, 1 alcoholic beverage, and 2 entre pizza's, came out to approx. $65.00

{"text":"Hands down! One of the best pizzas I've ever had... PERIOD! 
It's a very casual restaurant with the most amazing Fungi pizza. Panna cotta as the dessert was also devilishly delicious.  They can also give you yummy chili oil on the side to spice things up when you get to the half point.

I'm coming back to Levetto whenever I'm in the area. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great service, super casual, amazing house made pasta, fresh ingredients and very accommodating in adding ingredients or substituting 
oooh and also is really affordable 
If you are in Chinatown and you want really good Italian food (I know it's sounds kind of funny) Levetto it's the place to go"}
{"text":"The pastas are very.. thick. Yes, they are made in-house so it's fresh but that's all that's good about them.. They have a doughy texture when cooked or at least mine did because it was over cooked.. by the time it got onto my plate it was mushy like a day old pasta. The sauce tasted like canned tomato with some seasoning in it.. like those youtube hack recipes. The texture and flavours had no depth. My friend saw the great reviews and took us here but.. the venue is small and the food was not great. I'll just cook pasta at home."}
{"text":"Great great great spot. Well priced, great service. Simple, clean, pure Italian. Everything fresh. Venue is modern, comfortable, not-pretentious, very welcoming. I've come here with my boss and my family. I will be here often. More venues should be like this. Stellar job."}
{"text":"We originally we're in the area to go to the Mac and cheese festival, but we lined up for hours and the booths ran out of food.  This happened twice. We were so hungry and upset so we decided to leave and find a place nearby. I chose this restaurant because it had so many good reviews and the prices looked good for Italian food.  

The menu is small with sections for salad, pasta and pizza. The pasta ranged from $10-$13 approximately. The portions were decent and filling.  

The space isn't too big, but luckily we got the last table.

Best part is when you check in you get a free dessert. I got the white chocolate tiramisu and it was so delicious!!!!  My husband got the coconut cake which was good too, but we both were fighting over my tiramisu lol."}
{"text":"Solid pizza (verde) and pasta (trecche). We ordered the shareable size between two people. 
Didn't take long to get either and service was very quick. Definitely can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Had the Funghi pizza, Polio Toscano and Carbonara Pizza - everything was so delicious! $14 (6 slices)for a medium pizza and $7 for a small (4) and a huge bowl of fresh pasta. 

When you arrive you order for dine in or take out - there are a few tables and since we went around 6pm there were plenty even on a Saturday evening. The food came quick and everything was fresh and delicious. My favourite was the Funghi pizza being a mushroom lover. The cream sauce was just right without being too salty. 
I added Italian sausages to my bacon carbonara pasta and the dish was not salty too. This place offered a great taste of Italy without being too fancy or expensive. 

It was quite a drive but definitely worth it! I highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Great fresh pasta and pizzas and very affordable prices.  One my favourite Italian takeout spots. 

Love the crab linguine. 

Wine is cheap too if you're sitting in."}
{"text":"I was so surprised by this restaurant. The service was fast, the staff were friendly and the food was absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend trying the toasted coconut and pistachio cake...if you have room! The portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I've been to all Levetto locations now and this one is my favourite, but all of them have been very consistent. Wow the pasta is so delicious and fresh. Love the carbonara, personally. Very rich and comforting. The funghi pizza is heavenly. I can smell that roasted garlic crema from a mile away. Best of all - it's so cheap! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came here as a group for dessert as a recommendation from a friend. Super clean, sleek environment thats perfect for lounging around. Initially we came here for dessert, but noticed on the menu that there was a peking duck pizza! We ordered the panna cotta, walnut cake and the pizza and everything was super delicious! The panna cotta was nice and creamy but the walnut cake was bomb!!! Nice and warm, crunchy outside, soft inside topped off with pistachio bits.  

If there's one thing to order from here though, I highly recommend the peking duck pizza. It seems like a such a unique asian fusion dish though it may seem odd to some. The toppings include cucumber, green onions, cheese, and of course, the duck - yummm! I think this is one of the best pizza crusts I have ever eaten - it was slightly sweet and not too dense.

Service is awesome and pretty fast - no problems here!"}
{"text":"Went as a group of two people on Friday evening. It's a relatively small Italian restaurant serving a good selection of salad, pizza and pasta. We ordered misticanza, funghi and rigatoni. All of them were delicious, especially the pizza (funghi), really well made. 

The staffs were friendly, although i find the service a little lacking. During our visit, they probably forgot our salad dish and had it served at the very end (which was supposed to be our appetizer), and when the dish came up, they mistook our table as someone else's. Also, just when we were almost done with our food, they came up to our table and asked if everything we ordered was served. However, despite all these incidences, they had offered us a free dessert at the end as a compensation.

Overall, I liked the food here and the atmosphere at the restaurant."}
{"text":"The best Italian dish for me signifies simplicity ... simple fresh ingredients combine together to create unique meals bursting with supreme flavours. And all of this you can find at Levetto. 

It's a 'limited service restaurant' meaning you generally order your food in the front and pay for it before eating. You then take your seat and someone brings the food/drinks and plates to your table.  You also have to get the cutleries and condiments yourself.

It's neither a large nor small place, more of a cozy place where you can have a quiet dinner with your SO or meet with your friends.

But it's not the ambiance that makes this place special, it's the food. 

The Soppressata Pizza is spicy and salty in a balance way that's completely addicting.
My favorite is the Pomodoro Pasta ... perfectly simple but oozing with flavours.  I can eat this everyday! 

If you're craving for good Italian food, then you have to try Levetto coz you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Levetto is always satisfies a pasta craving. I have been to all locations and they never fail to provide me with the most delicious carbonara. I recently came to this location as they introduced the exclusive Peking Duck Pizza! At first I was skeptical, but they definitely nailed, the scallioned and sauce reminded me of the real deal. Definitely recommend trying it at least once! Everything else was fantastic as usual and their panda cotta is always a great treat to finish off a great dinner."}
{"text":"cute little fast food dine in. ordered the small mushroom pizza to start, definitely a must try! ordered the small carbonara and it wasn't small at all. had enough for another meal, so worth it. very generous portions for what you're paying for. will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here due to another event that was literally across the street at 99 sudbury. We were a bit early for the vintage so decided to come in to have some small snacks prior to.

I've been to the other location in Vaughan and I personally enjoyed that one more. We ended up ordering 2 pizzas and Thanks to Yelp check-in, we got a free dessert. How can one not love to Yelp? =)

The reason I enjoy Levetto is self serve to cutlery and condiments and its better than foodcourt in terms of quality and service. I would totally be hooraying for more business models that run like this. 

we ordered the margarita pizza and parma ham pizza, they were both just \"A-ok\" i felt it was a bit more oily in comparison to bathurst location but it was still ok. We enjoyed it!

We got the free dessert which was pretty amazing and shared it among 3 people.

Im not too sure if Levetto is a franchise or if it is all owned by the same owner but I would certainly hope the quality can be the same for all the different locations. 

All in all, I personally enjoyed the Vaughan one more."}
{"text":"I got two things delivery through Ûber Eats. I got the Pesto Cavatelli and Spaghetti Carbonara. 

The Cavatelli was sub par at best. But the Carbonara... Was so terrible that we threw it out.  There was very little sauce and it was really dry and salty."}
{"text":"Had a single pizza and a glass of wine. The pizza ingredients were quite good--some different kinds of Italian meats and olives. The crust was quite airy, though I felt it had been burnt at the edges. Wifi in the restaurant was good."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I brought my parents here for dinner tonight and we were most impressed by the unique dishes, fresh ingredients and overall down-to-earth, no attitude vibe of the place. We had the garlic bread, a salad, 3 pasta dishes and a medium pizza. The arugula salad was absolutely delicious and gave us a preview of what was to come. The pasta bowls were HUGE and beautifully presented. We had the carbonara, the braised beef rigatoni and the pea pasta dish. Then we had the pizza with the Italian sausage on it. To finish off, we shared a coconut cake on the house. Everything about this restaurant is simple. An amazing dining experience! We will definitely be back there. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and pasta. So the bread/crust for the pizza is thick and soft and pillowy - sososososooooo good. 

You can totally tell the pasta is homemade. It really soaks up the sauce and and has almost a creamy texture. They also give you a side of parmesan which is the perfect little cherry on top. 

The service is absolutely fantastic - kind and attentive! Water glass was never empty. 

We also had the dessert - white chocolate tiramisu was good but not as good as the warm vanilla coconut pistachio cake. Yummmmm. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Crunch crunch....crunch crunch......(the sound of me eating my pizza).  Pizza should never be crunchy.  Unfortunately mine was.  Le the review begin!

Came here on the famous quest for the perfect pizza.  It's gotten some rave reviews so I was excited to try it.  This is a small place that can't hand large groups - it seems more like a joint for take out.  You also order and pay at the front and then they bring you your meal - they don't have traditional wait staff to take your order.

I'm a simple girl looking for a simple meal.  I find that the best way to tell how good a restaurant is, is by a simple meal.  The fewer the ingredients means the chef must be able to cook it t perfection because there is no hiding the bad taste.  I chose the Margherita pizza.  Tomato sauce, cheese, basil.  Simple.  Well after waiting about 20 minutes for my pizza it finally arrived (my small which is 4 pieces and enough for me.  Medium is 6 slices and I think Large is about 12 slices so a medium would be perfect for most people if you are not sharing).  It was burnt.  And no basil.  No explanation on why no basil when it was dropped off.  So basically I got a cheese pizza.  I went back up and requested the basil but was told they ran out of basil and just had some scraps.  I took the scraps because that's what I ordered. 

As I crunched my way through the pizza I was pondering the age old question - is this good enough?  I came to the conclusion that it was not.   The prices are reasonable and the vibe is chill.  You can get salads (which were actually a pretty big portion) and pastas as well.  The menu is small with a few options in each category - which is nice because I can't stand too many choices - why make life complicated when you can make it with cheese?

I will however try this place again because everyone else enjoyed their pizza and pasta and judging by all the previous reviews this place exceeds at what it does.  Maybe just an off night....no doughs about it  ;)"}
{"text":"Service was very good, friendly. 
3-5 over priced ($15) for rigatonni. 
Noodles overcooked, disappointed."}
{"text":"The lobster pasta was as good as advertised. The coconut cake was out of this world! Everything we had (party of four)tantalized our taste buds. The portions were very sufficient and, as I said before, delicious!"}
{"text":"Food portions are very large for a reasonable price. Wish they had more variety with the pastas and proteins. They are take out and dine in but the servers if you dine in aren't very attentive."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I drove by this place a thousand times but never noticed it. One day I was looking for a decent pizza spot on Yelp and this place came up. When I just entered I was a bit surprised...The place itself is tiny and this is not a full service restaurant... But the food was just great! I got pasta bolognese and my fb got mushroom pizza. Both were very good. 
I'd definitely come back but maybe get a takeout this time"}
{"text":"The carbonara is hands-down the BEST pasta dish I have ever had in Toronto. The pasta is fresh, perfectly cooked. Coated in cream, with crispy salty bacon and green onion to add that oomph. Plus some acidity and fine ground pepper to cut the heaviness. It is divine. 

The only issue I have to say with this location is that it isn't really full-service but it isn't really self service either so it could get confusing. Probably not a good place to take clients or to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"Love this place. 

Salads are large, full of flavour and fresh. 
Pasta is homemade and very, very good. I love the pomodoro with chili oil. 
The pizzas are yummy and its nice to get them in varying sizes. 

Obsessed."}
{"text":"I've been to another one near Liberty Village, and since I was very happy with that, decided to give the Spadina one a try.
Equally if not even better! It seems like there is more room here than Liberty Village, and the location is very central for other things you would like to do after delicious pizza (i.e. beverages).

For each pizza, there is two sizes: a small size, and then shareable (but let's be real, I should of gotten the shareable for myself).

Peking Duck Pizza (small $8.50) - Actually, really really good. The Hoisin sauce that you actually put on peking duck, gave the pizza a nice sweet and savory flavour, paired with the meat.

Paired with a glass of house white wine ($6); can't go wrong with that for a broke student's meal. ;)

What I find can be an improvement is if they offered whole wheat/gluten-free dough as well.

Overall, I enjoyed everything about this cute gem in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when my mom brought me here for a quick bite. She was super excited, but all I saw was small cafeteria style pasta place at the side of a strip mall.

Boy am I glad to be wrong. 

The pasta was freshly made with the perfect amount of chew and the sauces were wonderful. I got the Cavatelli and my mom got the Carbonara. Both were equally delicious. The white sauces were perfectly balanced and did not feel too rich at all.

We waited for some time before our food arrived, but I guess you can't just magically conjure up fresh pasta from the air.

Great food. Would definitely visit again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I blame you Yelpers for setting unrealistic expectations. I had succumbed to your reviews and came in with guns blazing, high as a kite and expected this pizza to change my life! I sincerely believed this stuff would give me wings but I would I have to say it left me a little grounded.

It is refreshing to have Detroit style pizza finally make it's way to the great TDOT. For those who are not familiar with pizza 101 (yes, this stuff was invented by the Chinese and so is pasta!! :P ) the trademarks of a good Detroit pizza consist mainly of 2 things; it's square (wow) and it's made with a Sicilian style dough similar to focaccia bread (light, porous and lacks chew). With that in mind, yes this pizza is a success in terms of representing the Motor City. Without a doubt this pizza is fresh, light and somewhat delicious. The dough is crispy, fluffy and definitely lacks the \"chew\" of traditional stuff. The ingredients are fantastic and fresh. It's a well put together pizza.

Now, on to the complaints. This thing is satisfying yet somehow lacking at the same time. Satisfying in terms of good taste but also lacking as some flavours are quite muted while others are overpowering and one dimensional. What it means is that if you wanted mushroom..mushroom is what you've got and lots of it. Your senses are over burden with this one flavour but unfortunately there's nothing else to balance it. You get an exorbitant amount of olive oil, some hints of herbs and cheese that is felt but not so much tasted. The salad again are very one dimensional. The cheese to greens ratio needs to be sorted out as I felt like I was chomping on a goats cheese salad with sprinkles of green. I am a big fan of big bold flavours and over-the-top amounts of herbs, spices and cheese but only if those can be balanced out with something to cut it. In this case, bold one sided flavours are great for the first few bites but gets overwhelming after that."}
{"text":"We decided to give this location of Levetto  another try and we are glad we did!

We got the Rigatoni pasta which is consistently amazing. We also got the chicken pizza which was very good. We love their pizza dough!

Overall the staff were very friendly and the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"We were very impressed. 

We were in Vaughn rather late and looking for some Italian food when we found Levetto on Yelp. It's a fast casual Italian restaurant with limited seating. You order at the counter and sit anywhere. 

We got a panzanella salad, the rigatoni pasta, a half pizza, 2 wines, and a Coke (the glass bottle kind) all for $62. We were 3 people and we could hardly finish our meals. The pizza dough was very good. The pasta was al la dente and just right.

All 3 of us were very impressed and will be visiting the other locations which are closer to us next!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine at Levetto on Wednesday night with a group of friends, one of whom is the Organizer of a Budget Conscious Restaurant Goers group (Itanni B).
At first I was going to get just a pasta but ended up including a personal sized pizza as well incase I didn't get a chance to come back to the neighborhood any time soon. All of us also got a free dessert because we checked in on our Yelp app so that was a bonus treat :-)

I ordered the Patate Pizza because the description for it stood out among the list of pizzas available. The portion size for the personal pizza that I ordered is enough to fill up someone who wants to enjoy the dining experience but is watching the amount that they eat. And also if shared among four people, it works as a good appetizer and the toppings were distributed evenly enough that for each smaller piece you could taste all the flavors on the pizza. But I think I'm going try out their tomato based pizzas next time.

When I was looking at pictures of the pastas for the Sudbury St location, the Rigatoni stood out as having the most balanced ratio of meat to pasta, as in there was a enough meat accompany every forkful of pasta! And I was not wrong in making a smart choice to get that dish. The braised beef was so tender and it complimented the texture of the rigatoni. And the generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, slowly melts into the sauce and adds some creaminess to it. The Rigatoni had already become my instant favorite even beforeseeing it for real. Coincidentally the Rigatoni seems to be a favorite of most diners because I saw more pictures of this dish on the reviews, and also three of us (out of five) ended up ordering this dish. The restaurant did not hesitate with the amount of cheese they put on some of the pasta dishes and also the pizzas. The Patate pizza also had a good amount of parmesan on it which was also distributed to the sides of the plate, so I could even add more cheese on top of what was already on the pizza. 

For dessert, I had my heart set on the Panna Cotta but ended up picking the Coconut Cake with a really tasty frosting or sauce and I'm not sure what the featured ingredient in it was. And it also had a decent amount of coconut and chopped pistachios on it. The cake itself had the texture and sharpness with the spices as that of a carrot cake but with coconut instead. I'm not a big fan of coconut based desserts and treats but this cake was delicious enough especially with the sweet sauce. But I'm still going to get the panna cotta next time I'm there.

The service of the restaurant was upbeat and the staff there were pretty friendly and also accommodating, especially when we wanted to move to a different table. Hopefully the quality of service will remain the same, you can't go wrong with that, certainly not.
Overall, a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Ambience: 4/5
Cost: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5

I've been following Levetto on insta for the longest time (their Vaughan location) and finally heard through the grapevine that they were opening a location downtown. Came here with my boyfriend one night and between the two of us, we shared the funghi pizza, the carbonara, and the rigatoni (which, by the way, was way too much food for the two of us because the portions are actually substantial, but we devoured every last bite!).

I love love loveddd the pizza; I was afraid the pizza would be doughy because the crust looked really thick when it arrived. It was actually quite the opposite, had really good texture to it without by too dense. I love everything mushroom, so the funghi was the perfect choice. A little bit on the greasy side, but if you're anything like me and don't mind it, then it was fantastic (they also drizzle truffle oil on top, so if you want less grease you can always omit that).

Unfortunately, I didn't care too much for the carbonara. My boyfriend really enjoyed it but I've had better. I didn't like the type of pasta that they used, it kind of reminded me of instant noodles... 

Lastly however, to hit a home run the rigatoni was a really good choice. Al dente with a bite to it and tossed with delicious sauce meddled with braised beef. 

We were placed in the back of the room, which was a bit odd but that could possible be because the front was being rented out by a larger party. We seemed slightly removed from the restaurant and wasn't checked up on that often for more water/to see how the food was. Having that said, we were spoiled by the waiters with some cava and a sample dessert!

I couldn't be more surprised by this little Italian joint in the middle of Chinatown and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My partner & I chose this place for dinner. We walked in but were not greeted until we passed the tables and went up to the register. I asked how ordering and such works in that restaurant and the lady said \"let me start off by handing you some menus,\" so the rest was a guessing game for me. It turns out you order the food at the register and then find seating. I ordered the cavatelli & my partner ordered the pomodoro. The pomodoro was delicious but the cavatelli was missing so much salt and it was like no matter how much I put, it was never enough. Also, it was very oily and not enough of other flavors. The spinach and red peppers had no flavor. The pea pesto is good but it's missing garlic maybe some pepper. It needs something because it's nothing compared to the pomodoro. I requested our table to be cleaned before we ate and the cashier had no problem doing it. The place is small but cozy."}
{"text":"Place is physically small but you wouldn't feel that walking in. Is open concept so it's very bright and at the same time, cozy. The staff are really friendly and the decor portrays a very consistent theme. :) 

The pasta is home made here so it certainly tastes and feels different. Very Italian. :) the menu is smaller than most places, but I think that's even better cause it means they really perfect each dish. 

I had the carbonara. It was a bit too salty with the bacon and the added salt and not creamy enough. But it still tasted great! 

I only wish the pasta was hand made and hand cut the old fashioned way rather than by machine. Would give it that huge authentic wow factor. Same with the pizza dough which is hand made but not in house according to one of the lovely staff. But the flavors great, there's no denying good cooking :) 

Its a little far away for me, but regardless, i'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Gave them another try and had a nice meal.

We ordered the beef ragu, carbonara and the peking duck pizza.

The rigatoni was al dente and reminded me of a gourmet chef boyardee in a good way.  Pasta was chewy and nice with a rich tomato sauce.

Carbonara had nice pieces of bacon (not the maple leaf stuff)  and plenty of cheese.

The peking duck pizza was nicely cooked with ample cheese.  I'm not a fan of hoisin sauce so if you don't like overly sweet sauces, opt for tomato sauce instead.  I got a small one, which is about 4 slices and a good appetizer.

We finished off with the panacotta.  That was the best part of dessert.  

Salads look very large and would get that next time.  Highly recommend!

It's been a few days since I was here and I can't stop thinking about the chewy al dente beef ragu!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing time at Levetto. I visited this establishment with a group of fellow foodies. We were all very excited to visit this place and I must say that the food and the service surpassed our expectations. We were a considerably large group and although there is limited seating we were able to get a reservation. Our server Dev was fabulous and was prompt at getting us all drinks. 

We started our meal with the arugula and romaine salads. I preferred the romaine which had a nice dressing and savoury crispy bacon. For the next round we all shared a selection of pasta dishes - tagliatelle, carbonara and rigatoni. I was impressed by how fresh the pasta was. All the sauces were delicious! My favourite was the tagliatelle. We also had a round of pizzas. I loved the Margherita pizza. 

We were all stuffed at this point but really wanted to see what their desserts had to offer. I shared the tiramisu and the warm brown butter coconut semolina cake with a friend. While the tiramisu was passable the semolina cake had the perfect amount of sweetness. The pistachios added a great texture and flavour to the dish. 

Overall, we had a memorable experience and this place is definitely my new local favourite for freshly made pasta. It also helps that it is really close to my house :).

PS: If you check in with Yelp, you get a free dessert with your meal!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place a few times downtown but have never got around to trying it so I was pleasantly surprised when I passed by it driving on Dufferin.

The place is a little small but there was plenty of seating when I went for lunch. It's kind of a fast-food style restaurant in that you pay first, then they bring your order to you but they serve quality Italian food. 

Me and my girlfriend ordered 2 pizzas (Affumicato and Pollo Toscano) and a Rigatoni to share, which had a slow-braised beef ragu sauce. The portions were very generous and everything was cooked perfectly. The pizzas were delicious and had a nice, crispy crust, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. 

All in all, I definitely recommend this place and I can't wait till my next visit."}
{"text":"Great little spot for casual quick Italian meal. The pasta is very fresh and the prices are pretty reasonable for the portions you get. I'd recommend the ragu rigatoni and tagliatelle. The staff are also very friendly."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, not much seating but pasta is definitely decent if you dine in. We have ordered take out several times and dined in once. The wait time was anywhere between 10-20 minutes. The braised beef rigatoni is hands down amazing. The sauce is tasty, beef is tender and the pasta al sentence - I can totally inhale this dish. We have tried the lobster pasta and the carbonara as well. The lobster pasta was a disappointment - we ordered it as take out and ate it within 15 minutes but the pasta was a big soggy and stuck together. The carbonara (dine in version) looks amazing and tastes amazing and yet the take out version was sorry looking and lacking in the greens you'd typically get on top of the pasta. I think if you crave pasta, and you don't have a large group, dine in to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"Love the place. Food is fresh and server was helpful. Pizza is out of this world! Fresh pasta tastes so much better than  lots of Italian restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Chinatown wouldn't be my first choice to get Italian food, and I'm not normally a pizza person. But Levetto is surprisingly good!
They have super fresh pasta and delicious pizza. The place is nice and bright with friendly staff. We got the blueberry dessert on the house and I'd say it's even better than the pizza!
It's actually a chain with different locations. I'd check the other ones out if I'm craving for a pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great! Servers/cashiers were okay (what do you expect you are in Chinatown) But would def go back for the food."}
{"text":"Picked up two pastas (Carbonara and Bucatini) and also two mediums pizzas (Fungi and Affumicato). I gotta say the Funghi pizza was amazing!! It might be my \"go-to\" choice for Levettos. I definitely recommend trying this pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Would def come back again for pizza! The crust is to DIE for!! Pasta was great, but... The Pizza was the STAR!!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are crazy! I happily had to take half of my rigatoni home. The warm brown butter coconut cake was heavenly! Service was good. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food we had were absolutely delicious. Fresh pasta and the sauce was just tasty. The pizza is not your typical thin crust Italian pizza but it's so good that our kids didn't want to share it with us and finished it. They have a small menu which is great because that means they can perfect each dish. There isn't a lot of seatings so it's a commonly take out place. I like my food fresh and hot so we opted to eat in. The night we were there it was freezing cold and because of their walls was made out of glass, the restaurant was like a fridge. The four of us kept our coats on while eating. Nonetheless we enjoyed the food very much. Will come back another day when it's a bit warmer. ;) finally there's a good Italian restaurant that's comparable to the ones in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. What more can you ask for.

There's a couple tables in here that you can enjoy your meal and have table service if you desire.

High quality ingredients. Generous with toppings. It's definitely worth it to check this place out without breaking the bank. The Coconut dessert is really good."}
{"text":"Peking duck and pizza are two of my favourite foods, so to hear that they were being combined was a dream come true. Levetto was pretty easy to find - just north of Dundas & Spadina. We walked in at around 2pm for a late lunch, and there was only one other table there. Though the space isn't large, the minimalistic interior keeps the restaurant looking spacious. 

You can choose between four or six slices of a rectangular pizza. We opted for two smalls of the Peking Duck pizza and Soppressata pizza, which came to just under $20. The Peking Duck pizza is topped with hoisin sauce, scallions, and cucumber, while the soppressata comes with large basil leaves, dried sausage, and rich tomato sauce. Both were so delicious, with very crispy crusts. 

The servers were all very nice, and I would love to return to Levetto to feature more of their items!"}
{"text":"Self seating and self ordering but they bring the food to your table :)  It is a bit informal, but they make for it with the quality of their food.  

Their specialty is rectangular, romano-style pizza which is done from scratch by the young chefs working in open kitchen.  The chicken pizza is awesome, big chunks of organic chicken, while the prosciutto pizza has so much prosciutto on it my tongue shriveled from the salt (not complaining though) :)  

The dough is amazing and they use top-quality cheese.  The ambiance is a bit bare, but that's the vibe they want to convey.

Prices are great for what you get, and would easily cost 2x much in some of the snobby Italian places on King West."}
{"text":"Just had a Bucatini with Sausages, food it's ok but my opinion for sure not worth the money, sausage is like super small cut up pieces that you can't even see it, what a joke."}
{"text":"I had another opportunity to enjoy this great restaurant with friends.  Our last visit was wonderful so deciding to visit again was a no brainer.  We also wanted to share this place with new friends.  I know it's hard to believe but another fantastic meal was had by all.  The service and attention we had from Dev was unbelievable.   Everything we wanted and needed was always there in a timely and attentive manner.   We ordered food to eat \"family style\".  The Romaine salad and the Arugula salad with the addition of chicken were enough for the 10 of us to share.  The Romaine was made special with crispy speck and the Arugula had a beautiful tangy flavor when married with all of the flavours of the pumpkin seeds, apricots, goat cheese and white wine vinaigrette. We also ordered  a couple of pasta dishes to share. The Rigatoni beef ragu was my fave from my last visit and it was very tasty this time around. But, I cannot say enough about how delicious the Tagliatelle was.  Grape tomatoes,  sweet peas and dill in a very creamy tomato sauce.  We addd lobster which upped the flavor a notch.
Now that should all been enough but being the gluttons we are we also shared and enjoyed 3 pizzas.  The Soppressata did not let us down with its spicy flavor.   The Funghi did not fall short one bit with portobello,  oyster and cremini laying on a bed of mascarpone and roasted garlic crema. So very hard to pick my fave.
As you know by now sharing is what we like to do and desserts at Levetto are very worth sharing.  White chocolate Tiramisu and Warm Brown Butter and Coconut Cake.  Each bite better than the last. Both worth trying!  Kudos to chef Shahir.  
Trust me we will all be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza was better than average the crust and texture of it seemed more bread like since it was very airy. Me and my friend both got the funghi  pizza and it was very flavourful but was even better with the chilli oil. My other friend got the pepperoni pizza which I tried and was pretty average."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Crispy and fluffy crust. Zesty sauce. Giant salads and Coke in a glass bottle. Friendly staff and a casual atmosphere. Take out or eat in."}
{"text":"I ate at Levetto a few weeks ago on the 1st night of my vacation in Toronto and what a discovery it was! I recall having a salad with goat cheese which was excellent, followed by the pasta with sundried tomotoes which was also amazing. My son had a pasta dish which he also loved. For dessert, the very nice staff gave us a piece of walnut cake (I think) which was a very nice ending to the best meal of our trip!"}
{"text":"I don't often leave 5 stars, but I love this place! Their fluffy Roman style pizza dough and freshly made pasta, it's all great. I love the spicy sausage pizza, with fennel and black olives, and the tagliatelle with tomato, dill and peas. So good! And surprisingly not over priced as many other places in the area. 

Definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"I was confused. On one hand, there is not much service, on the other hand they expect you to pay tips? In fact, they ask for tips when you order. WTF?

Got \"Rigatoni\". Er, why do people eat this? No veggies, no meat, just pasta with sauce for $14 + tax = $16? Not a healthy choice, and too expensive.

Most other items on the menu were similar: pasta + sauce minus veggies minus meat. 
Is it me or is it Italians?"}
{"text":"Levetto was a very confusing and disjointed experience for dining in.  

The FOOD itself was pretty good.  The homemade pasta is a bit heavy, but the sauces were quite flavourful.  The pizza had a very nice crust and a generous amount of toppings.  The Salsiccia pizza was delicious with quite a spicy sausage and covered in fennel fronds which were a nice touch.  Quantities are large.  Overall, I would rate the food a 4 star place.  Dessert, a warm brown butter and coconut cake was free courtesy of a Yelp check-in (although there was a bill miscalculation that included it).  It was, however, painfully sweet, and not very good.

Where things fell short was the ordering process.  Sometimes there's a bit of table service, sometimes there's not.   You went up to the counter to order, and were never quite sure if what you ordered would come out of not.  The staff they had there were nice, but they were clearly over-worked, and the place was understaffed.  Food came out at kind of random intervals.  

We also had an awkward moment where immediately after seating us, we were told we'd have to move in 20 minutes for another party with a reservation.  A) That's kind of the thing you tell people before you seat them.  B) What kind of place without table service takes reservations?

The DRINKS selection is underwhelming with no nice beers on tap.  

Overall, the lack of table service really reduced the enjoyment of our dinner.  The food was pretty good, and I can imagine take-out is a good option."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a group of Friends on November 16 at the Sudbury location.  I'll just sum my experience in one word \"divine\".

Title of; Best Waiter Ever goes to Dev.  He was amazing!!

The salads, pastas, pizzas, desserts, Espressos tasted great but the presentation was also fabulous.  

The highlight for me were the salads; fresh ingredients!!  You could see and taste the quality.

I'll be back.  Loved it:-)."}
{"text":"Brought a friend for dinner and the meal was wonderful. The plates her are great for sharing. They have three items salad pasta and pizza. Everything that came out from the kitchen looked like picture perfect."}
{"text":"such great homemade pasta! very reasonably priced! amazing brown butter cake! highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We came here to get take out since we were in the area however we weren't that hungry. Ordered the Funghi pizza, carbonera pasta, bucatini and a panna cotta. Once we got into the car the smell of the mushroom pizza was drool-worthy! I must say the pizza was the highlight, it had a strong mushroom taste coupled with garlic crema and mascarpone cheese, it was perfect. The pizza crust was similar to a focacia bread texture but lighter. I've been craving it everyday since I had it last, it's been a week and it will likely be tonight's dinner. Even though we are about 20 minutes away, it's definitely worth the drive.

Also important to note that the pastas were very good as well. I love how they make their own pasta. Would definitely pick the carbonera over the bucatini though."}
{"text":"Looking for pizza joint in this area and found Levetto; and I'm glad that I'm here!  It's cozy, modern and casual; with a few wooden square tables and a few chairs at the bar.  We come at 5:30 and it's pretty quiet, but it gets busier and busier in an hour.  We ordered the food at the front and they bring the food to our table together with water and cutlery. Panzanella comes in less than five minutes; it's salad with spinach, basil, onion, tomato, fior di latte and crouton.  The salad is crispy fresh and the crouton is light and crunchy.  Pasta is chewy and cook to perfection.  The top notch of today is - pizza!!!  The rectangular pizza lies restlessly in a wooden board and arrives hot with earthly cheesy aroma.  We have the funghi pizza with mascarpone, portobello, oyster and cremini mushroom.  Mushroom is fresh and pizza is crispy, airy  and it's........... just amazingly delicious!!  I've been fallen in love with Roman style pizza!! The food here is reasonable priced and in generous portion!  Service is friendly and attentive; the waitress has cleaned up our table before bringing us the tiramisu and coffee.  I've already been craving for their pizza!!"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow but food is great recommend this place but the dessert needs improvement"}
{"text":"I don't usually buy pasta because it's $$$$, and I'm $, but a couple friends recommended that I try Levetto for their reasonable prices and good pasta. It is a fast service restaurant so you order at the counter and then have a seat. I bought the carbonara (16.95 after tax) and my friend got the cacio e pepe with italian sausage. It took ~15 minutes for both to arrive and it looked grEAT. 

Lots of parmesan on both dishes and a larger portion than I thought. The pasta was nice and bouncy with lots of large bacon pieces. I recently went to a place for carbonara and received 3 tiny squares of bacon, so this generosity made me real emotional. I tried the cacio e pepe and it, too was very good. Disclaimer: this pasta won't change your life, but for the price, portion and taste its reaaally good. My friend didn't finish their pasta and had to take it home because, like it said, it's a lot more than you'd think. I finished mine because I hadn't eaten all day and my appetite is huge, BUT I was very full after. 

Definitely coming back when I have a craving for pasta and a limit on my expenses."}
{"text":"Was cravin' some Italian and I had been meaning to visit this place after reading all the positive reviews so my mom and I drove on down to Levetto to get our carb fix.

The restaurant was in a very remote location tucked away from the major intersections and big streets and it was also quite the mission to find a place to park.

But honestly none of this matters because their pastas and pizza were on point. We had a medium mild Soppressata pizza (eight slices), the Pomodoro AND Carbonara - did I mention that there was only two of us?

What surprised me the most was the portion size relative to how reasonably priced each dish was. The pastas we had were $8 and $10.5 and the pizza was $13 - which is amazing compared to some of the other Italian restaurants in downtown Toronto.

Even with all this said, it was apparent that they did not skimp out on quality ingredients because you could really taste how fresh everything was (hand made dough and everything made to order).

I just wish I could put this gem of a restaurant in my trunk and move it to a more convenient location!

Actually, scratch that because then you would find me eating pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner lol"}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  I shared a Misticanaa salad, and had a personal sized Salsiccia pizza.  The fennel was thinly shaved and provided a nice contrast to the citrus.  The pizza was delicious and well portioned - I took half home!

Because the services was a bit slow, the waitress gifted us a free dessert of Tiramisu, which we packed home and had the next day.  It was really moist and full of flavour.

One of my friends had the homemade pasta which was dense and rustic.

The prices were VERY reasonable and food portions generous.  I would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Cute pizza and pasta restaurant. Their pasta was cooked perfectly! I had the bacon carbonara and there was a lot leftover. The price point was mid-range, but totally worth it for how tasty the pasta was. Service was quite fast since we were there for lunch and it wasn't busy. I knocked one star off because the space was a little small."}
{"text":"We ordered a Bucatini pasta ($10.50), a medium Funghi pizza ($14) and a Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake dessert ($6).  

The Bucatini pasta tasted great.  Levetto makes their own fresh pasta in home made sauce.  The acidity and spiciness of the sauce hit me a bit, but it wasn't too bad.  The amount of sauce was just right.  There was enough sauce to cover the pasta completely, but not too much to be watery.  The portion was sufficient.  The pasta earned 5 stars.

Levetto pizzas are available in regular thickness, not in thin crest.  The Funghi pizza we had was delicious.  There were generous quantity of mushrooms and cheese.  The dough was fresh, not chewy.  The bottom of the pizza had a slight crunch.  The thicker crest was the reason a small pizza was so filling.  I happen to like thin crest a lot, so the pizza earned 4 stars from me.

The Coconut Semolina Cake was quite good, too.  For $6, the portion might look small initially.  Don't be fooled.  The cake was so rich that it took 2 people to savour it.  The dessert earned 4 stars from me.

Levetto bakes the pizza, cooks the pasta and makes the dessert upon receipt of order.  You get freshly made food at reasonable price.  The compromise is the services is slower.  Levetto may be a take out place; it is definitely not a fast food place."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant multiple times, always been a great experience. Food is always fresh, hot and delicious. Great little spot for a quick bite to eat or to take out."}
{"text":"I've had good experiences at levetto, but this time I was disappointed. I love their braised beef rigatoni and have ordered it before...but I couldn't even see the beef this time. I thought to myself maybe they just forgot, but a closer look revealed tiny beef crumbs. NEXT TIME JUST TELL ME YOU'RE OUT OF IT AND I'LL ORDER SOMETHING ELSE! jeez. 

go to the Sudbury location, they have better food/service."}
{"text":"Consistent with the Levetto that I've tried out in Waterloo, their carbonara was on point as well and the portions were as fair as the other franchises.

The environment at this location is much smaller, only fits about maybe 5-6 tables worth of people in 4s, and then a relatively \"bigger\" table by the window side that can seat for 6 people or so I believe.

Their system works by having customers pay first and then they get their meals delivered to them. A little bit more odd, since the paying system will ask you to tip and I suppose if it is semi self-serve, people may not necessarily tip so they would lose out on that portion...

My advice would most likely to change the system by having the server (they only have one) to go around, take the orders, and then provide the bill after the food has been consumed.

They also have a charging station for smartphones by their cash register, in the event you need to charge up your phone while eating.

Overall experience was still great, very filling, and no complaints :)"}
{"text":"Great fresh pasta and salad and reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Will be back often."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband.  The place has a few tables, and you order at a counter and are served at your table.  It's more of express meal kind of vibe, not for a relaxed slow lunch. 

First the good things, clean, very large portions and reasonably priced.  My husband'spizza (soppressata) was delicious, the crust was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sauce was perfect.  They asked if he wanted it spicy or mild, and he chose spicy, and it was a really good level of spice.

I got the rigatoni with slow braised beef ragu.  I wanted a glass of wine to go with it and asked the server what kind he had.  He looked confused and pointed to a cooler, so I read the bottles myself and made a selection.  We sat down and waited, he forgot my wine and I had to go up and remind him.  The wine is served out of a cooler that is adjusted for the type of wine and comes out of a tap on top like a soda fountain.  Unfortunately my wine ran dry in the middle of my glass and started sputtering and splattering everywhere.  Did he stop?  Nope.  Just kept going and tried to fill up my glass.  Then changed out the bottle and filled them rest up and served me the dregs topped off with the new wine.  The server seemed a little lost and flustered to be honest.  

My pasta was ok.   The rigatoni was recommended to me as the signature dish of the restaurant .  The ragu was good, finely shredded and flavorful, the pasta was cooked perfectly.  The sauce was bland.  It needed salt, pepper, something.  I topped it off with pepper and red pepper flakes, and it was much better.

All in all, a solid ok restaurant and a good amount of food for the price.  Based on my experience, get the pizza."}
{"text":"This is our go to every Friday or days I don't feel like cooking or don't have the time. Our family would starve to death if this place wasn't around in the neighborhood. We have ordered from there easily over 50 times now and it never disappoints. Nothing fancy or super healthy, but delicious, fresh and consistent!"}
{"text":"The pasta carbonara was AMAZING and fresh. We ordered a large salad that was fresh, the house dressing was very tasty. The staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"I could eat that peking duck pizza every day.

The pastas were delicious, and in generous portions. They are carb-heavy (I would have liked a bit more veggies and sauce), but overall quite delicious. We each ordered a pasta and shared it 3-ways. I recommend this since the same flavor might get old.

Nice modern decor, the restaurant is a long/skinny type of layout. 

Overall, great place for a chill dinner with some asian-italian fusion menu items. Would come back with friends."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner. It's another one of those, pay first, seat yourself and then they bring you your food type of restaurant. 

I ordered the Bucatini ($12), which was a tomato based pasta with bacon. The portions were generous, and price was good. The pasta was cooked well, the sauce was tasty. Overall, I was quite satisfied with my meal. 

Service was prompt, and I think we were supposed to get our own utensils from the front (whoops), but the waitress brought it to us once she realized we didn't have any when she brought us our food."}
{"text":"After reading some Yelp reviews, we decided to try this place because we were in the mood for Italian and our wallets were in the mood to save. After having one of their daily special salads (kale, pumpkin seeds, thinly sliced radish) and their excellent mushroom pizza (with white sauce, mmmm!) we left with full stomachs and wallets. The medium size pizza was enough for us to have leftovers. We only ate 4 of the 6 slices.

The pizza was different than libretto, which is nearby. Despite the lack of a wood oven, the pizza was still excellent. It was made of a almost puff pastry crust, and appeared denser than it was. As with all pizzas I like, the star of the show were the toppings, not the crust. The white sauce, multiple cheeses, and multiple mushrooms were a great combination. 

The salad was also good and filling. The waiter didn't know which dressing we wanted (or may have forgotten to ask), so he brought over a balsamic and white wine vinaigrette. There were plenty of seeds, which I enjoyed. If you like salads with texture, this is your place! 
I'm told the pastas are also very good, but we will have to return to try them. 

The only downsides: the wine selection is limited (they only had 2 reds when we visited) and they won't have a patio. There's nothing like a glass (or 2) of wine and pizza on a patio.

I highly recommend this restaurant as you get great value with incredible taste. The owner was also a super nice guy."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick birthday lunch.  We ordered Beef Ragu and Lamb Bolognese.  The pasta was freshly made.  Both Beef Ragu and Lamb Bolognese is very tasty and lots of lamb meat.  While the Beef Ragu pasta is lack of beef.  We find that the pasta is a bit chewy and hoping to be a bit softer.  Maybe they need to book longer in the water.  The place is small and limited seats.  So if you want to eat there, try to go there early."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Sometimes, not so much. I'd say 1 in 4 take-out orders are underwhelming, but come to think about it, they must be doing well because I'm eating there enough to statistically breakdown ratios. I can't spell half the menu but the prosciutto pizza is solid, same with the ones with tomato sauce. Don't like the margarita, though. Tastes like some hipster garlic bread."}
{"text":"Their funghi pizza is a must-try! When I took my first bite, the flavors burst in my mouth."}
{"text":"Levetto is easily one of my favourite places in downtown Toronto. Their effortless, casual atmosphere is exactly what I look for when I want to unwind with a delicious meal.

I came in with a group for lunch, and the cashier explained their concept (order & pay for food at the back, find seats at the front). They have menus you can take to your table, but I found the screen near the cashier to be more comprehensive. The meals, as well as water, were brought to my table. 

The food was fantastic. It was a simple meal, but very well made. I had the Peking duck pizza, and which I loved. It was different from the usual selection of pizzas, flavourful, and not drenched in grease (+1!). Another notable mention I also got a taste of: the rigatoni. The small pizza was quite filling for one, but if you have room (or even if you don't), I highly recommend the butter & coconut cake for dessert. It was the perfect amount of sweetness with a layer of toasted coconut shreds and pistachio pieces. 

Good food served by a great team... Not much else I can ask for. I definitely enjoyed my meal, and will be back soon to try other menu items."}
{"text":"**If you have a respiratory disease that is easily triggered by smoke, I would not suggest dining in, as the ventilation was poor. **

Ordered through Uber Eats last year and was really disappointed by the carbonara and salsiccia pizza.  It had arrived cold and the quality really dampered the experience.  However, I blamed it on the delivery issues we were having with Uber Eats. 

After this one take out experience, my boyfriend continued to hype up the restaurant, and I decided to give it another chance.   

We came in on a weekday evening, and the restaurant was a quarter full.  It's slightly odd to see this restaurant among classic Chinese restaurants, but adds to the evolving landscape/community.

The first thing I noticed was the amount of smoke and poor ventilation.  My chest tightened, and I thought if I had asthma, I'd go into a coughing fit. 

Between the two of us, we ordered a small peking duck pizza and trecee pasta with sausage.  Service was fast and efficient.  Food came out very quickly.  It is one of those establishments where you order and pay at the cashier, and the food will arrive after

The peking duck was delicious!  The dough was also very soft.  In terms of the pasta, it was good, but the sausage really added to it.  

For the two of us, it was about $15/ person without drinks.  The quality of the food from the dine in experience was much better than delivery."}
{"text":"We shared a pizza and pana cotta and both were great!! Prices are also very reasonable :)"}
{"text":"I always get delivery but I decided to go in a few weeks ago and was pretty satisfied with the casual yet cozy feel of the place. Our server could've been a little more attentive but the food presentation and flavor were awesome so I didn't mind too much. All in all a good dining experience but nothing super memorable... when I go out for dinner I like a restaurant that has character. The food here is good but think I'll continue just ordering in from them."}
{"text":"Lived in the city for many years and finally moved to the burbs. safe to say I've been to a ton of Italian places in Toronto whether. Take out or fine dining. Moving to Vaughan I wanted a good take out Italian joint that stays true to the recipe without trying to appease the customers with funky menus. This is a short menu, good quality food, always have a good pasta. My fav is the rigatoni or the cavatelli. I go there often. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Levetto est un bon restaurant. J'ai mange le Rigatoni, et c'etait tres bon. Il etait enorme! Mes amis ont mange les pizzas, et les pizzas ont semble savoureuse. Je vais revenir quand je serai proche."}
{"text":"For take out home made pasta it's the best. There are only a few small tables to sit down at and they're usually taken."}
{"text":"I went to Levetto for the first time on Friday, and the line up was insane!  

I had heard good things from a friend of mine that went to the location in Liberty Village, so I wanted to see the hype.

We ordered their specialty Peking duck pizza, soppressata pizza, rigatoni pasta and carbonara pasta.

All the dishes were absolutely amazing, especially for the prices that we paid! Our favourite was the Peking duck pizza, which had a generous serving of Peking duck and topped with cucumbers, onions and hoisin sauce.  It is a must try! You can't get this pizza anywhere else!

We were so full at the end of the meal.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Not bad. But I can't help to feel it's a pop up. I couldn't figure out if it was a restaurant or self-serve Ikea food court. Food is not bad but for the price and lack of protein for 13$ bowl of pasta is not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to at least three of their different locations across the GTA and Levetto's has never disappointed me. 

This location actually is one of the nicer one's to eat at, though they are slightly busier than some of the other one's I've been to. It's in a quiet neighbourhood, with not too much traffic, with some street parking nearby. 

We started with the Ceasar Salad (fresh, with large pieces of pancetta and fresh croutons), and the Arugula Salad (this is bright with goat cheese and fruit to complement the peppery arugula). We had the Soppressata pizza which was more like a flatbread, but still very tasty. The Carbonara was really good (though this is according to my dining mates, as I am not a fan of Carbonara in general), but the star pasta was the Beef Ragu (perfectly done pasta, with a rich tomato sauce and piece of Beef Ragu...YUM!) All the food is always fresh, and perfectly cooked (which is important because I HATE overdone pasta). 

This place always feels like fancy Italian food, without the fancy setting. You go up and order your food which they bring to you. The staff is always super friendly, and they offer good suggestions and are knowledgeable about the offerings. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I've had it bookmarked for ages as I love Italian food but I don't go downtown often so I saved it for a day when I was in the area. 
Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Love love the pasta carbonara, ordered this each of the two visits. The saltiness and richness of the pasta dish really reminded me a dish back home. What they can really improve upon is to serve filtered water in the already fantasic chilled bottles and to unified the portioning of the pastas. Though portioning difference isn't very big, it sometimes irks me. I will definiately revisit this location as a regular whenever I get ths chance. Strongly recommend everything! I am very excited to explore the menu.."}
{"text":"2nd time at this location. On the streets of spadina in china town, weird I know. But the Italian food here is pretty good. It's more of a self serve order at the front and grab your own utensils restaurant. The atmosphere is very laid back but offers high quality food. The servers were very kind. The price is okay I think. For a shareable pizza + a pasta it'll set you back around $30+. Depending what you order just the 2 dishes can be $40. 

I do like this setting compared to a higher class Italian restaurant if I feel like just grabbing some decent pasta. It's quick and the good quality."}
{"text":"I have been to Levetto many times since and they are much busy with various food delivery companies popping in to pick up. So what looks like a short line may actually be a long one. Phone system has also been inconsistent.

Food is still great and I appreciate a place with great salads to go. Salads are usually pretty quick."}
{"text":"I rarely rate 5 star, and while this is not a Michelin restaurant, if you want very good Italian food in a light, easy atmosphere, while actually paying next to no money, jump a bit north of King and feast your heart out. Nom nom nom, non?

Treche, carbonara, sopreessata, Verde, all salads crush expectations. Honestly you could go to a high priced Italian resto downtown and not come close to the food quality here.

No stars will be here during TIFF, but you should be here anytime, and if you don't visit now, you will miss out!

Fresh made, made on premise, pasta, very nice staff.

It's on!"}
{"text":"On a late Friday night, Levetto is busy but without a lineup, which is good because I don't have much patience to wait. The waiters bring you water and your food, but you have to order and pay at the front. You also have to get your utensils from the side, and the washroom is downstairs in the basement. 

I've wanted to come here for a while now so I'm happy to finally try them out and declare their food to be tasty! We split rigatoni pasta and a shareable size peking-duck pizza (double the price- $20). Their pasta is made from scratch and piping hot- really yummy! Their peking duck pizza really DOES taste like peking duck. It's not for everyone (I wasn't a big fan) but I do appreciate how unique this dish is. 

I will come back to try out more pasta dishes, but I would get pizza elsewhere. A single size pizza contains 4 slices for $7-$10, and a shareable size pizza contains 6 slices for $13-$18. As you can see by the price it's not really worth it."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, very friendly staff, pizza crust was amazing! 

Cons: this place is freezing! And so was our pasta unfortunately.

Came here on a Friday night and wasn't too busy 

Would probably try their food again and hope the pasta is actually hot."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good....salads, pasta, pizza...small restaurant so they do a lot of take out, or there are about 4-5 tables in the restaurant. I have been there 3 times and all 3 times it is the same...food is very good, but the service is pretty bad. I have been there to both dine in and to pick up. The problem is that it is a tiny kitchen with few staff...so you don't get much attention when you dine in...and I had to wait a while when I picked up, and my order had some things wrong. Great concept, good food, reasonable prices, but I hope they get the service/staff issue fixed."}
{"text":"This is was the best pasta I've had from a restaurant, ever! Pasta cooked perfectly, sauce was authentic, food was quick. Definetly recommend this place for a nice lunch!"}
{"text":"Pizza was too thick. Maybe it was an off night. It was like a deep dish. The salads are great. I went back the next week but only got the salad for takeout."}
{"text":"Ordered the pomodoro with some red peppers. The food was delicious with huge quantity."}
{"text":"Cant explain enough about this place.
The best (totally amazing unique) italian pizza in whole GTA.
We were there tonight for the first time and wanted to just stay there more.
Such a great people and owner was keep checking on every body very humble and high manner.
I wish him the best of luck"}
{"text":"We came for an early dinner and were overall slightly disappointed. The food was okay but we had ordered two of the same thing and after waiting for 15-20 minutes we only received one of them. We then had to wait another 15-20 for the second one after we had already ate the first one. The setup of the restaurant was also very weird. It was our first time so we didn't know we were supposed to pay at the counter so we sat for an extra 30 minutes after we'd already finished eating waiting for a receipt or at least some instruction. I probably should have mentioned it was our first time but then again, I work at a counter service restaurant and I explain our process to every guest just in case which should have been the action taken by the young woman at the counter to reduce our confusion and wait time. I would give this place one star but the decor was cute and the wine was great. A very confusing and sub-par experience at this place."}
{"text":"Pasta is addicting, large portions, reasonably priced. pizza not so much, crust is a little dry and thick. Large delicious salad. If they offered veal sandwiches this would be our go to Italian spot..  Time to grow ur menu guys!"}
{"text":"First experience: Didn't receive 'regular service' (basic) when dining in, we weren't checked on and had to get up to order another drink and ask for takeaway containers. Tried pizza & rigatoni dish.
Second experience: the following week we ordered the Rigatoni dish (with braised beef) again but for take away there was only  1/4 of the amount of meat so we felt like we paid $15 for noodles and red sauce."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd enjoy this place. From the outside it looked like any quick, dine and dash pizza parlour. However it did not scream pizza parlour with the 'specials' ad that most pizza shops have. My friend was craving for some Italian cuisine, but didn't want to get all dressed up for it. The place was very laid back and casual. They didn't have a lot of seating area just a few small tables and a bar area in the back. After taking a look at their relatively small and simple menu some items had immediately caught my eye. I knew I was craving for a hefty pasta dish. To my surprise they had Carbonara on there. Yum! Anything with bacon on it and I'm sold. However I didn't order the Carbonara I ordered the Rigatoni just to explore my taste buds a bit. It is essentially a pasta with slow-braised beef ragu ($13). It was not bad, but in my opinion there was way too much pasta for one person. It's a good idea we planned to share, or I would've left with a food coma. Sharing is totally caring it allowed me to try other items. My friend ordered two small pizzas - Affumicato and Funghi ($7/each, 4 slices/each) for us to share as well. For $7 the pizza were of decent size. It looks, tastes and smells like a gourmet pizza. I absolutely loved the Funghi pizza which had Portobello, oyster and cremini mushroom with mascarpone and roasted garlic crema. I mean, if you're looking for a quick Italian meal to fill your cravings give this place a try."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times we ordered the Rigatoni with slow braised beef ragu and smoked proscuitto pizza. I enjoy the pizza here because its not your typical pepperoni or hawaiin pizza but they coat the pizza with date sauce which makes it sweet and enjoyable and the layer of argula makes it nice and refreshing. The toasted almonds also add a nice crunch to it and makes the pizza fun to eat. The crust I would say is medium thick and good to eat. Would be nice if it came with some dipping sauce too.

The Rigatoni is good as well because the sauce tastes healthy yet tasty and the beef is braised nicely. Small place but with a nice casual cozy atmosphere. 

Their dessert selection is good as well. The first time we came here we tried the panna cotta which I enjoyed - light, slightly lemony and not too sweet. Would recommend this place if you are craving some pizza or pasta in Vaughan"}
{"text":"I have always loved Levetto so my visit to this location did not disappoint. We ordered the carbonara and the lamb ragu pasta. Both were amazing. The portions here are always good and pasta is cooked perfectly al dente which I appreciate. My only complaint was that our order was taken wrong at first and that the waitress didn't come fill up our water until we had to ask. They also offered a free dessert if you check in on Yelp so be sure to do so. We had the panna cotta to share and it was also very good."}
{"text":"Went for a bite after going to the art museum - Nice mix and variety on the menu - Salad, pasta, and pizza options - Ordered a salad and two small pizzas at the counter and food was brought out - Salad had good flavor and was worth the price but had a few pieces of greens that were in that soft mushy state - Pizzas - Had the duck and tomato/olive pizzas - Flavors were good on the toppings, dough was a little bread-like but overall a good  just wanted a little more duck - Staff was nice and worked hard to ensure a decent meal"}
{"text":"Great Place for a quick take out or a casual bite.  Not a lot of seating space so make reservations.  Food is fresh and unique.  Not your typical Italian fare.  Definite place to try if your in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great! We ordered the Peking Duck, Salsiccia, Funghi, and Sopressata pizzas plus Rigatoni. Funghi & Peking Duck pizzas were our favorites!! The rest of the items were meh. If we could go back in time, we'd order multiples of those 2 pizzas. 

... I did go back to get the Peking duck and funghi again. This time I went with someone who wanted less cheese and Levetto was able to accommodate (no cheese on half of the Peking duck). I thought that was really nice of them. The staff are nice. You can now pay for your meal at the end (it used to be order and pay before you sit). 

Overall the pizzas are light and thin. It's not your typical pizza crust. I prefer it this way because you don't feel heavy after and the toppings shine brighter."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner with a friend. It's not a huge place but it's good for a small group. Staff was friendly and answered our questions about the menu. We decided on two half pizzas. They have some quirky flavours like roasted duck or fig sauce as well as more traditional combinations. Pizza quality was excellent! The dough and ingredients tasted fresh and the more exotic flavours worked better than I expected. The desserts were a tad sweet but otherwise this place is pretty great!"}
{"text":"Very interesting and delicious pizza! Slightly overpriced, but the flavour is something I haven't tasted anywhere else yet. Seating is decent and noise level is not too bad, good for small groups to chat. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about a year now and I'm seriously still impressed. Levetto beats many higher end Italian restaurants that I've been to. Definitely go out of the way to come here.

The pastas here have always been delicious- tried every pasta on the menu and they are all great. Personal favorites: cavatelli (pea pesto) & carbonara.

I like the casual environment and the people who work here are typically very friendly. Take out is quick and consistent as well."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Courteous Service......Fair Price... I recommend the Carbonara Pasta!!!"}
{"text":"Parking - Free: Usually not a full lot, there shouldn't be a problem finding parking spaces.

Seating: Tables and Bar seating available, there are usually customers dining, I haven't seen this venue dead but it's not so busy or packed that you won't have anywhere to sit.

Bathrooms: Bathrooms are well maintained but could be better.

The venue is very small, I don't recommend bringing in a large group.

Don't let the three stars fool you. I love this place, I'd give it a higher rating if not for the very high markup for a can of San Pellegrino soda. They charge $2.85 for a can (I still bought it anyway to help them out), where you could easily walk into Sobeys down the street and get the exact same can for $0.89 cents or walk into 'No Frills' and pick up a 6 pack for $5. I understand they have to pay the lease and their staff but I can't see a 3X markup being worth it.If they charged the amount that you would pay in a vending machine ($1.25 or so) I would gladly pay the premium. But at the rate they are charging for items there you're getting ripped off, and I don't like getting ripped off. 

I've met the owners personally, they are a friendly bunch and the staff are cool too.

As for food, I've only tried the pizza which I custom order. I've been a regular customer there, usually going there twice a week for the past 2 months. But since then I won't be ordering any sodas from them and I'm only returning if I'm ever craving pizza. They make good pizza."}
{"text":"My review is based on the food I received via UberEats. Since I'm rating it 5/5... Even after delivery the food was absolutely delicious. I've walked by Levetto many times and wanted to try but never got a chance. I actually tried it for the first time at the Yelp event last week. 

We ordered the rigatoni and Affumicato pizza. Both were so good! I love that there are 2 sizes for the pizza so you're not forced to feel like you have to finish the medium. We're always weary of ordering off UberEats because of the size always seems smaller with delivery but Levetto packed a ton of pasta and of course you can't change the pizza side.

I'll definitely be back at this location in person to try more of their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Tip: check into the restaurant on Yelp for a free dessert! 

I ordered the pomodoro pasta which was a simple tomato sauce pasta cooked with olive oil and garlic. Flavour wise I thought it wasn't boring, which sometimes happens with simple tomato pastas, and quite tasty. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce coated the soaghetti noodles nicely. I think it's definitely worth trying for it's simple but rich flavour. Given the price you are paying for (~$9 for the dish) you're receiving a pretty big portion.

I also used the Yelp check in function and got free dessert! Friends and I ordered most of the offered desserts and I tried the white chocolate tiramisu and coconut cake. The tiramisu was very underwhelming, presentation and taste wise. Maybe because I was expecting a traditional tiramisu layered dessert but this was just lady fingers stacked onto each other with some cream. I'm not complaining as it was free dessert, but if you were to pay for it I don't think it'd be worth it. The coconut cake on the other hand was delicious! It is a very dense, moist, and strong coconut flavoured cake. A bit heavy, but good to share with others. I'd recommend this!"}
{"text":"Wow! I first heard about this place on a Facebook group for people living in LV, I figured the menu looked super interesting and I had to check it out! So glad that I did!! Pizza was fab, staff were super friendly and talkative and the desert they recommended was to die for!!! Prices are super reasonable. Enjoyed all of it!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. I loved the casual atmosphere - you order at the counter and they bring you the food. The service was great - they forgot about one of our orders and when we asked them about it, they were very apologetic and offered to discount the dish.

The food was awesome - good portions and reasonably priced.

We will go back for sure to try the other items of the menu!"}
{"text":"Five stars for Levetto! 

I tried their potato pizza even though I swore I'd make the mushroom pizza my bitch but mmmm, no ragrets! 

The small was a decent size. I ate solo that night and ate the four slices up. I love my food and I over eat most of the time, so the four slices from this pizzeria was perfect. I wasn't stuffed but I wasn't left wanting more either. 

I really like the white sauce pizza. The crust was thick and chewy with and was topped with some crazy-good rosemary and ricotta. 

I'm determined to sample the mushroom pizza along with some pastas. On top of all this, the price is right! 

It wasn't over, Levetto. It still isn't over.

UPDATE: I sunk my teeth into the mushroom pizza. Wasn't disappointed in the slightest. I will return!"}
{"text":"My first time there was about a year ago (it's a bit far for me since I live in Mississauga), and I went with some friends who go there regularly. We had 4 dishes split among the 4 (and a kiddo) of us and there was still plenty of leftovers. Portion size is not an issue :) 

My favorite dishes are the Cavatelli Pasta and the Smoked Proscuitto Pizza. I'm more peculiar about my pizza than my pastas but Levetto exceeded my expectations for pizza. 

The people there are super friendly and accommodating. They don't just make and serve the food, they actually converse with the customers, which is why I've recommended it to so many of my friends.

I went there a second time not too long ago and met the manager from the downtown locations (not opened yet) who was super friendly! Go for the food, atmosphere and great cappuccinos.

Also the reason why I am giving it 4/5 is only because this location is pretty small. I know it's supposed to be more a fast food place but it would be nice if they could get a few more tables in, which I know isn't possible unfortunately. Other than that, one of my faves!"}
{"text":"The place looked great and seems super trendy so I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered lunch from here and got the Funghi pizza. It was a really underwhelming pizza. The pizza looked good but it tasted so bland, no flavour, and the pizza dough itself wasn't anything special either."}
{"text":"Disappointing.
I believe they use low quality ingredients and offer low quantities to keep prices down.
The mushroom pizza I ordered was small but too thick for my liking. It felt toasty and certainly the meagre toppings felt like out of a jar for its sourness.
My girlfriend had the spaghetti and it looked too little a portion, but I cannot comment on the quality. They had heaped it into a ball to make it look like more than it was however.
The space is not too big so they were full. Despite that once you place your order expect to wait 20 minutes before the food arrives (they can probably shave a couple of minutes by not making the pizza so crispy but because their dough is so thick perhaps that would leave parts of it raw)
Verdict: not expensive, but you get cheap ingredients, cheap quality and not enough food."}
{"text":"Sometimes simplicity is best. Take Levetto's pizza and pasta concept. Fresh made high quality food at an affordable price. 

Who doesn't appreciate hand made pasta? The menu includes classic Italian dishes like rigatoni and carbonara. I had the carbonara, which was Beautifully plated, huge portioned(bowls not plates), and absolutely delicious. 

On to the pizza....where to start....the Peking duck is the most popular on the menu. With the restaurant sitting on the edge of Chinatown, you can see where the influence comes from just by looking out the window. This has to be the most unusual and messy pizza I have ever tried, But somehow it works. It's quite Genius actually. Just be advised, grab a ton napkins! 

Although recently opened, Levetto has the makings of a successful long standing restaurant. A solid 4.5 from this guy."}
{"text":"First of all, this location is more like a café as opposed to a restaurant.  There were 4 small tables that fit 2-4 max.  And with 4 people, with food, there is barely enough room.

Second, the casualness carries through with the ordering process.  I sat down for a couple of minutes before I realised that NO ONE was coming to the table with a menu.  Patrons have to approach the front cash, place order, pay, then sit.  Food will be served at your table.

Girls at the cash were friendly, and stopped chatting/texting as I approached the cash.  All young people work there, so just a warning if you have a problem with this.  It's ok by me just as long as they get you what you want when you ask for it - and they did!

Neighbouring table was given menus, while my table of 2 were not.  No biggie, just a bit inconsistent.

Ordered a Margherita pizza to share ($12, medium) and a Tagliatelle pasta (~$12 as well).  Decent portions for both.  Crust on pizza was more like a fluffy bread.  Tagliatelle did not have much taste.  Noodles did appear homemade and were cooked al dente.  Just an issue with taste as everything was just \"ok\".  My bf and I agreed that Marcello's, near Vaughan Mills, is much better in terms of food and service, especially food.

So alright as a takeout, if you live nearby, but just ok, I-wouldn't-drive-out-of-the-way type joint!"}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday and we craved pasta, so what better opportunity to finally try out Levetto?

We contemplated calling in to make sure there were enough seats available first (party of 4), but ended up just driving there. We arrived Friday night around 7:30pm. When we first walked in, I noticed 4 tables that could sit 4 people, and thought \"crap, this isn't a restaurant\", which was what we were going for. Not trying to be rude and ruin the night, we took a seat at one of the two available tables (they also have a few high-seats at the counter). For unknown reasons, it was super cold! We could feel the seeping cold from outside, which was -5C. We all kept our jackets on. I briefly glazed over the menu and opted for Beef Ragu ($15). My friends got Carbonara ($14), Cacio e pepe ($12), and Lamb Bolognese ($16.5). We had to order and pay at the cashier first so not your typical order-at-the-table dining. Water was promptly served after we ordered, and we waited about 10 minutes before our food arrived. Once it did, I immediately took back all my thoughts of doubt of this place because the portions are HUGE, and it smelled delicious! And guess what? The pasta was so warm and fresh, we all ended up taking our winter jackets off from the heat of the food! No joke.

We all sampled each other's pastas and there was a universal consensus that I chose the best pasta of them all, Beef Ragu. To my pleasant surprise, the beef served in my dish was shredded, as was the lamb in my friend's Lamb Bolognese. I also liked the Cacio e pepe, as it was the simplest dish of all our ordered pastas. If you aren't going for anything special but crave pasta, I recommend Cacio e pepe. The Carbonara had a bacon/smokey aftertaste to it, which isn't what I usually like, but I recommend it for those who like bacon/smokey meats. As for the Lamb Bolognese...I can't really explain it. The sauce was creamy, but the taste is something you must sample for yourself. I personally liked the dish, and ended up sampling the most out of it.

Definitely recommend the establishment for small party get-togethers!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to the venue and unlike my 1st visit we shared almost all of the dishes, which included arugula salad w/chicken (awesome flavours throughout), carbonara and rigatoni pasta (ditto the awesome flavours), and soppresata, margherita and funghi pizzas (all were fabulous and the latter possibly my all-time favourite pizza).  For dessert I chose coconut cake and espresso to drink.  Each course was more delicious than the previous one, the service was outstanding and an incredible deal.

My heartfelt thanks to Chef Shahir and Dev our server, the latter of whom certainly distinguished himself with his very friendly and cordial approach and knowledge of the menu.  The 10 of us in my Group who attended were given exceptional treatment all around and I won't soon forget the experience."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Levetto.  We tend to get take-out fairly often (once or twice a month) from them.

I got what I always get ... a mild Soppresata pizza.  As usual, it was delicious!  I ordered a medium pizza so I could take some home for lunch tomorrow.

Gord bounces back and forth between a pizza and Carbonara ... this evening he got Carbonara.

Michelle took good care of us!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch today at Levetto.  We've been to the Sudbury Street location many times and thought we'd check out a different one.

Gord ordered one of his favourites ... Carbonara.  He said it was delicious as always.

I ordered what I always get ... a mild Soppressata pizza.  It too was delicious as usual.

The staff were friendly and took good care of us.

It was worth the extra walk to get there."}
{"text":"In the mood for pizza. Something yummy but not too over the top. Levetto has a different pizza crust, light and airy. I ordered the small margarita. Made to order. Delicious, but the spot. Staff very friendly. Not a large seating area at this location, but still cozy. The Kitchen was very organized and clean. Their specialty is pasta, pizza and delicious salads. They have takeout. Just call ahead or order at the counter."}
{"text":"Went there for a friends birthday and the service was spectacular. They were so kind and were incredible hosts. No one expected much from this small shop but they wowed everyone. The portions were generous and everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The \"pizza\" here was pretty good, although it was more like toppings on bread than an actual pizza.
We got the sausage, chicken, and mushroom. The mushroom tasted like garlic bread topped with mushrooms. The chicken I think was the best, and the sausage was also good. We all got the smaller size and shared because we weren't that hungry.
The large size would definitely be filling enough for one person.
Next time will definitely try out the pastas."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a pretty good place with great bang for your buck. 

I came here on a friday evening around 7:30 and got a table for four. There aren't many seats at this place. Probably 20 seats and a bar that fits 6-8? The air conditioning can really only be felt at the front. There is no AC near the back at the bar. The overall place is fairly no frills. The decor is minimal. 

The table is a bit sticky and the service is decent, but not great. However, considering the price point of this place, I understand why and have no problem with it. 

I had the carbonara and the pasta was cooked very well. It tasted a bit too peppery, but overall was very delicious. Pastas are generally $10-14 and is very reasonable. Free dessert ($6) if you check in on yelp, so my meal was about ~$16 with tax and tip. Great value for price."}
{"text":"It's in a small plaza, but with plenty of parking. They make tasty freshly made pizzas and pastas for a reasonable prize. I have only eaten the pizzas and they are pretty good.
I love the slightly burnt crust and the greasiness of the pizzas mmm. 
They also serve different coffees, soft drinks and beer and wine!
The restaurant has about 5-6 tables that seats 2-4 people.
One questions though... why is so so freaking cold in this place. The steel chairs don't help with his situation either lol."}
{"text":"Always a safe choice ordering from here.  It's pasta that's way better than anything you'd expect ordering from a chain restaurant in the heart of Chinatown.  They're always fast and super efficient, and as of late have been throwing in a small panna cotta on the house which is always awesome and really makes you feel appreciated as a customer.  

My go to is the pomodoro, which is always cooked with pasta perfectly al dente and topped with a big heap of parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be coming back! Got the Bucatini pasta and added sausage ($10.50 + 3). Everything tasted amazing and was reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Got takeout tonight on a Saturday and the place was moderately busy. Took 20 mins to prepare the food which is no problem since its fresh pasta. Ordered the Bucatini pasta and the arugula salad. The bucatini was ok, nothing special, pasta tasted fresh but i probably would never order it again because its just sauce and bacon.  The arugula salad was the worst salad ive ever had in my life, no lie. It had stale croutons!!! I never had a salad in a restaurant with stale croutons, it was horrible!! I should of went to pizza hut...."}
{"text":"Went there for a Saturday night dinner. Everything was exceptional. Our server was lovely and made some great recommendations. The food is delicious!!! Their Carbonara is easily the best in city. Downside is that they close at 9 PM. A little early for the weekend! Will be coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because we were craving pasta and the reviews were pretty good. 

The pasta was disappointing. It isn't really authentic Italian pasta more like American Italian style. We ordered two carbonaras. One with spaghetti and one with rigatoni.  Both the pastas were undercooked. The pasta was still pretty hard. The flavour was okay but it was not saucy enough. The portion of bacon was huge but there was little sausages and chicken that they charged extra for. 

The portion size was decent. We didn't finish though. 

I felt like the food was a little overpriced if you were to add chicken to sausage into it. It came up to almost $20 a plate. At that price you might as well eat a restaurant rather than this take out place."}
{"text":"This is utterly worthless. This wasn't pizza. This was topping on a slice of bread. The portion size was so small for the price. For $12 you would assume it would be good enough to fill you up. If the portion size is small you need to make it up with the flavor. I got the Fungai which had no seasoning (it was just mushroom on a top a toast). Then the Pollo Toscano didn't have any pollo (i.e. chicken) and it was too salty. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Ok it took me a while to think about what's going on with this place but now I think I understand.  We've been to the College location a number of times and had 'the usual' - good pasta, good pizza, etc. I think the food is actually quite good - a solid 3 stars, especially for a chain restaurant but it's not fine Italian. At this price point I shouldn't really expect it. 

The problem is that it's a delivery and take out place and the front of the house is a distraction and the poor step child to the rest. A steady flow of Uber delivery bikes shows this to be the case. The wait staff is inexperienced, inattentive (eg 15 - 20 min before taking drink orders, not circulating to check on basics like water, not bringing the bill) that makes eat-in dining painful even for a casual drop in dinner. 

We went when it first opened and chalked up the uneven service to opening jitters. That's not the case.  Unless you are in grade 11 going on your first date - don't bother with the dine-in option.

I don't blame the wait staff (only one) - she's spending 90% of her time packing takeout food silly!  The reality is that there is no one running the front of the house.  Actually, I don't even think there is a manager of any sort - some sort of egalitarian cooperative seems to be at play. Stuff gets done eventually but no one is really running the place (basics like here are your menus, waiter will be with you shortly, did table 2 get their bill, did you ask if they want dessert, maybe you should bring a glass for the drink,...) - you know, like a restaurant. 

All told the food is ok (skip the awful salads - dump and run of too much green stuff with some sort of gelatinous dressing), minus one star for 'it feels like we just opened this week' service and AWOL management. 

Take it for what it's supposed to be - a delivery and takeout joint."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Levetto. The pasta was made from scratch, fresh and delicious. Highly recommend for price, quality and service!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is really yummy. The three of us ordered two small pizzas and two pastas. It came out to 16$ including tax. The rigatoni pasta is really good. And their funghi pizza as well. The crust is crunchy and reminded me of pizza hut crust. The pea pesto pasta was my least fave of the four but still good. 
I want to eat here every day."}
{"text":"I have been to their other location in the past, let me tell you , it is equally good! 

I love their pizza, it's crushy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. Just absolutely perfection! 

Plenty of table and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! 
Its not a get-in and get-out kind of place. Great place to treat yourself with friends and family , and spend time catching up. 
The restaurant is a cozy, cafe like setting.  We did had to share a table with other parties. The servers came around almost immediately took our orders. 
The pizza was a perfect combination of crunchy and soft. It was very unique. And the pasta was equally yummy! 
Oh, we had a free dessert by checking in! Thanks yelp! 
I'm not sure if they take reservations, but it is wise to call first given the size of the place."}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti, didn't like it. This place is made for takeout. Do not bring a date here expecting a nice place."}
{"text":"We went to Toronto for our anniversary trip found this place because it was around the corner from our airbnb.

 The fresh pasta was so good I ordered the rigatoni pasta . Its rigatoni pasta with a  short rib braised tomato sauce.  I also ordered a Caesar salad which was huge for just 1 person.  

Overall this place is cute, convenient for a quick meal whether you are ordering take out or dining in. Their portion size is perfect too. We actually went twice for dinner.  The staff is nice as well.  If we get back to Toronto I will definitely return. Nice place."}
{"text":"Yes, it's an unusual move to open a fast-casual Italian place in Chinatown, but that's what makes this such a genius move on the owner's part. I have lived in Chinatown for six years and   I can't even tell you how sick I am of dumplings and MSG. There used to be a great Italian place, Strada 241, on Spadina but sadly they didn't make it - I hope these guys do. We have a small kid so are always on the lookout for fast, budget-friendly, family-friendly places opening up in the hood, and Levetto fits the bill to perfection. I took a risk and tried it on the way home from preschool today (normally we never try anything new then since that's prime temper tantrum time), and me and my kid both LOVED it. The pizza (we had the soppressata) was super tasty, and well priced at $7.50 for an individual size (that satisfied us both). They were happy to do half spicy and half mild. The pizza base is maybe thicker and breadier than some people are used to, what with the dominance of floppy, thin crust Neapolitan style pizza (as at Libretto and Via Mercanti) in Toronto, but it was delicious: soft and fluffy inside and crisp on the bottom. The sauce was simple, bright and tangy. I saw some huge, I mean HUGE bowls of pasta come out that looked and smelled incredible - next time I'm going to try the bucatini with guanciale (this is a dish I make at home a lot and consider one of my specialties so I'm keen to see how they do it). Staff seemed genuinely cheerful, not too overworked (there were 3 of them on which seemed just about right to cope with the walk ins and the many delivery pick ups coming in). One thing I loved was that they have followed the service model of other places, like A3 Napoli: someone greets and seats you as you come in, hands you a menu, then you go up to the bar to order. I LOVE THIS. No more endless waiting for an overworked server to notice you, seat you, bring you a menu, go away, ignore you, come back for your order, go away and ignore you again, bring you food, go away and ignore you until you need something, go away and ignore you until you need the bill, going away to get the bill... And then at the end of it you're expected to tip 20% for all that damn waiting and trying to catch their attention! I increasingly avoid eating in places with table service for this very reason. Here, I looked at the menu, walked three steps on my own two feet over to the counter, bought myself a drink, ordered, and had my food in 15 minutes. I felt no obligation to rush out (I probably would have even ordered a second wine if I hadn't been with my kid), enjoyed my meal in peace without a server hovering over/ignoring me, and got to leave as soon as I wanted. A million miles better than the usual experience. I really don't know why they don't do this everywhere. Thank you Levetto, you have a local family of converts!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing a friend's awesome food pic at this restaurant. We called to make sure there was seating available at 8 but was surprised to find out it was empty. 

We ordered and paid first before we seated ourselves. The food came 20 + mins later but one of the workers apologized for the delay as they forgotten our order due to a party in the back. They offered us dessert on house so I appreciate their kind service...even though I didn't tip them. 

The food is however a bit disappointing considering the good ratings on yelp. I got the carbonara and paid $6.50 extra for the lobster add on. It was a bit too salty to my liking and tasted nothing special and mediocre... 

I got the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake - it's a good blend of ingredients with pistachio and coconut but their loaf cake is way too sweet. On top of that, there was syrup which adds even more sweetness to it."}
{"text":"Love it! It's affordable and tasty! Not all dishes are amazing but I personally love love the funghi pizza (must have!) and the bucatini! My 5 stars are for these dishes mmmm"}
{"text":"Pasta -terrece I can't get enough... fresh pasta, goats cheese, spicy sun dried tomatoes, chillie flakes olive oil
Enough for two

Patate pizza enough for two due to the truffle oil.

Prices are exceptional for the portion"}
{"text":"I am not normally a fan of pizza and pasta but this place may have changed my mind in a delicious bowl of pasta I had. The menu is simple, and good. Good as in I like how you can chose from pasta dishes aside from the ordinary and traditional pasta dishes. I had the beef and pasta dish(can't remember the exact name) but I certainly remembered the taste. They cooked the pasta perfectly to my expectation - slightly under cooked pasta. The flavours were on point and the portion size is just right. Also order a salad with the a stellar dressing. For the first time I would say I am craving to go back and get another pasta dish again. 

We knew of this place from the Yelp event last year and I am glad we got to go try it out. The service was good and prices are within reason with the food you get.

Yum"}
{"text":"At the intersection of price and quality, Levetto was our favorite meal in the West End!

We ordered a romaine salad, pasta with braised beef brisket, and mushroom pizza.

Salad-- crisp, fresh, flavorful and plentiful. 

Pasta-- strong, vibrant flavors and the noodles are cooked perfectly. The braised beef added a unique heartiness to the dish, but I would have liked more of it!

Pizza-- this was the real winner. The crust was crispy, yet incredibly soft ciabatta bread. I really don't know how they get the bread like that, because ciabatta, from my experience, is either too hard or too soft! Cheese was flavorful and the mushrooms were a special blend of forest fungi. 

I crave this place! Sucks I live all the way out in Michigan :(."}
{"text":"Had the rigatoni. 
Pasta was cooked to perfection. 
Just wish there was a little more briased beef in the sauce. The flavour combo was spot on."}
{"text":"This is a very casual restaurant with great food at a great price. We were surprised at the portion for the price we paid. At $14, you get entree size pasta and pizza. We opted for the small pizza which comes in 4 slices so we can try a variety. The large size comes with 6 slices. Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 salads, 2 pastas and 3 small pizzas, we were so full that we had to abandon ship and doggie bag the extras.  As for the taste, everything was delicious and fresh. The fungi pizza with truffle oil is an absolute must try."}
{"text":"My office wanted to celebrate the end of a project, and we wanted to choose a restaurant that had a private room and offered pasta on their menu. Immediately I knew that it had to be at Levetto in Chinatown. So I reached out to Levetto, and one of the owners (Nic) confirmed my reservation within an hour of emailing him. Awesome service! Nic reassured me that my team would be well taken care of, and that they would love the food (I have been to Levetto many many times, but my guests had not). 

The evening of the reservation we were quickly ushered to the back room (private room) and everything was already set up for us. Immediately we began to scan the menu, and the one thing we found inconvenient at that point is that their drink menu does not appear on their paper menu - you have to look at a screen on the wall for the drink menu. The food however did appear on their paper menu. 

There were a couple of tiny hiccups (salad was missing a main ingredient - but quickly rectified when we pointed it out, and the dishes came out slightly staggered). But overall the meal was delicious, the quality excellent and there was value for money. 

Levetto never disappoints, and I am always eager to return. 

P.S. Dessert was on the house! How cool is that?! They brought out plates of their 3 desserts for us to share. Awesome touch!"}
{"text":"I had read many positive reviews for Levetto, and after reviewing the menu and the prices, I knew that I had to pay them a visit with my friends. I reviewed the Levetto website carefully, and I couldn't find any information about whether they took reservations or not - many restaurants will note that you can't make reservations or they tell you what you need to do to make a reservation. So what I did was send Aly MacGregor an email (she is in charge or press and media inquiries) and she arranged a reservation for myself and my friends. Aly not only addressed all my questions, and reservation changes (a very patient lady she is), she made sure to follow-up on our experience the day after our reservation. One highlight of my communication with Aly was when I asked about gluten-free options for my friend Karen who really wanted to join us for dinner (Levetto does not have gluten-free options on their menu), and she spoke to Chef Shahir Massoud (Corporate Executive Chef for Levetto) about my query, and Levetto agreed to look into this for us.

The day before our reservation, I received a Twitter message that read, \"Look Itanni! Gluten-free pasta!\" And there was an image of Chef Shahir making fresh gluten-free pasta. How incredible is that?!  So I immediately contacted Karen, and she was thrilled for the opportunity to join us and not have to stick to salads.

On the evening of our reservation I strolled in ON TIME, and as usual my guests were already there, seated. Argh Once I greeted everyone I went to look for Chef Shahir to thank him for what he had done for Karen.  I was relieved to see that Chef Shahir was there this evening (they had recently opened the College location, so it was very likely that he would be at the College location). When I introduced myself and thanked him for the reservation and the gluten-free pasta, he flipped it around and said, \"no THANK YOU! We are so excited to have you and your friends join us. I wanted to be here to meet you all. Aly really wanted to come as well but there was a scheduling conflict.\" Awww! It often shocks me when a restaurant that is doing so well, can be so humble. But then it is because of restaurants and service like the one we received at Levetto that will keep from returning to a restaurant that has amazing food, and a self-righteous attitude.

The Menu

The menu is split into 5 sections:

Pasta ($8-$13)
Pizza - they come in three sizes: personal (4 pieces), medium (6 pieces), large (guessing 8 pieces) and the prices range from $6.50-$31
Salad ($8-$9)
Specials
Desserts ($6)

Every single one of my guests were blown away by the food. It was not only delicious, but the ingredients were fresh, the pasta was made from scratch, great portions, and there was definitely value for money. We also lucked out in the dessert department. If you check-in to Yelp, you get a free dessert, so we all got a different dessert so we could share and try all three. My personal favorite was the Tiramisu, followed closely by the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake that was served steaming hot, and then the Panna Cotta. But really, it comes down to your taste preference: if you like rich go with the cake, if you like creamy go with the tiramisu, if you like tart and not-so-sweet desserts, then go with the panna cotta.

After dinner Chef Shahir made sure to check-in with every guest, and shared with us how he became a chef and some stories from his time in New York. I told him that I was flying to Italy the following week, and that when I returned I would teach him a thing or two about Italian food. ;)

Thank you to the team at Levetto and Aly for making this wonderful evening happen for us. Since this dinner, almost all my friends have returned, and at least 4 are now regulars. Now I am dying to see how the College location is doing. I hope it's just as good as the Liberty Village location since the College location is closer to where I live.

See you soon Levetto!

xo

P.S. Karen wanted me to tell you that Chef Shahir packed up the left over pasta for her to take home. She told me that she had enough fresh pasta for a week, and it was delicious (chef Shahir taught her how to keep it fresh at home)."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at the Liberty Village location - great service, delicious food, and value for money. Hence why I gave it a 5 star rating. I had been eager to try the College location because I work on College street and it would be more convenient for me to take the streetcar to the College location than making the trek to Liberty Village. 

My 5 friends and I arrived at 6:30pm and managed to score a table. There is not a lot of seating, so getting a table was a feat. Once seated I remembered that you have to go to the cash register to order. So I made my way over and inquired about their beers. Staff pointed to the wall and learned pretty quickly that the beer options are pretty sad. There is nothing on tap and all beers are \"light\" and under 5%. So I decided to get wine instead - big mistake - I think I got three sips from the amount they give you. And it was $8! For food I split a salad with a friend, and in addition to the salad got a pasta and a pizza (yeah, I was hungry). I could not get the salad I initially wanted because the greens they needed for it were not available, so I went with something else. The portions here are amazing, and I was pleased with the three items I ordered (Rigatoni, Soppressata pizza and Roasted Radicchio salad). For dessert I kept telling all my friends to get the Tiramisu cause I loved it the last time I had it, but it was not available as well. Sigh. Sad moment. So instead we got Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake and though I found it a little too sweet for my liking, most of my friends really enjoyed it. No one got the panna cotta because I was not a huge fan when I had it at the Liberty Village location and even staff discouraged you from ordering it. 

All in all, we had a really chill and comfortable experience at the College location. In fact, we stayed there for close to three hours chatting and drinking espressos. We never felt rushed, and service was friendly and efficient. Hopefully on my next visit they will have every item on the menu available, and I am crossing my fingers that the drink options will improve, and that when you order wine, you can have more than three sips!"}
{"text":"The pasta here is to die for! Fresh and a nice balance between bold flavored pastas and subtle flavors. 

I love the Spaghetti Pomodora, Tagliatelli, Rigatoni, and Cavatelli. 

I ate here 3 times on my stay in the GTA. 

This place is more of a takeout place than a sit and eat place. It reminds me a lot of the Fox Restaurant Concepts out West. It's going for a trendy hipster vibe but the service isn't pretentious. 

Definitely aiming to get the crowd that wants good Italian food without breaking the bank. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. I stopped here around 11am once and this place got swarmed with high schoolers for their lunch break (another time I got here around 1pm and it was less busy).

I highly recommend this place for a bite. Definitely some of the best pasta I've ever had.

Please skip the pizza though! It's not that good and the quality of the pies here vary from day to day. No idea why the discrepancy exists on a daily basis. I hope they work this problem out to improve the quality overall."}
{"text":"Came here again and found out I can mix and match the pasta and sauce!  We ordered the Carbonara sauce with Rigatoni pasta, much better combination!  The pasta was less packed, the portion was just right with the sauce ratio.  We also had the Affumicato Pizza, it came with lots of smoked bacon and mushroom, we prefer this over the Soppressata Pizza we had last time because it was loaded with more tasty ingredients.  For dessert this time we ordered White Chocolate Tiramisu, it was light and creamy.  They also sell glass bottled Coke there, a nice touch.  Overall another satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is better than pizzeria libretto and I am not exaggerating. We didn't get to dine but had take away since the place was packed (not many tables to begin with). Who cares though when the food is amazing?! AND CHEAP.
Pollo toscano 8.5- ahhhhhmaaaazzzingggggg
Funghi 7.5 - that truffle oil ... Delicious 
Panna cotta 5 not bad but free tastes pretty damn good 

I can't wait to try the pasta! Everything is made from scratch. The pizza crust/dough was unreal. I could eat that all day. So impressed. 

If you check in you get a free dessert -- which they can pack away for you if you're doing take away! Woohoo! Winning :)"}
{"text":"Great food, decent portion sizes, not huge but definitely more than enough. Had the rigatoni which was delicious and the affumicato pizza which was also great, good quality ingredients and the staff are all friendly and appear as though they care about what they're doing. Awesome new addition to the thornhill area! Will be back."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with a friend.   Overall it was very good.  We split a medium sized sopresatta pizza.  I really enjoyed it despite the sausage being very salty.  I have eaten sopresatta many times but usually home made or from an Italian butcher in Montreal and it was far better and less salty, although seeing it is only a topping on a pizza then one that they used was adequate. 

So for the pasta, I had the carbonara.   Very good although I found it to be a little dry.  A touch of olive oil would have helped, but still very good.  The rigatoni is what my friend had.  It was great.  The braised beef was excellent, the sauce itself was great. The pasta itself was perfectly al dente, just how I like it. 

We each had a glass of Chianti.  Not a fan of Italian wine but it did the job. No complaints. 

To sum it up, good food, good quality and fresh ingredients, reasonably priced.  Definitely a thumbs up !"}
{"text":"Pasta tastes fresh and very tasty.   Also ordered funghi pizza and loved the taste.  The crust is thick and crunchy - some others might prefer a thin crust. 

The restaurant is small - maybe 4-5 four seater tables and you order at the register.  Good for a quick meal but probably better for takeout."}
{"text":"We waited for 1 hour for the food and we sat at a table for 20 minutes and no one came to clean the table we had to clean it are self's a family that was there before us and ordered before us got there food after us and a man was stated that he was waiting for a hour for just two pizza and the food was nothing special would not go again"}
{"text":"Was craving house made pasta a few weeks ago and wanted to try this place. The carbonara was very good. Good portion size & reasonably priced. The only thing is the pasta wasn't rustic and didn't look like or taste like it was house made. It was very uniform and had a nice bite to it. So not sure if it was hand made or house made with a machine. I trust them I guess when they say it was house made. I would go back and try the other pastas there when I need a pasta fix."}
{"text":"I love the causal atmosphere at Levetto; staff are friendly. 

They makes pasta and pizza dough every morning. They use very fresh ingredients to make their food; it is pretty good value for the price I paid.

I wish there is more seating available at this location."}
{"text":"A Perfect 3 star all around! The service was OK, pretty cold but not to the extreme. The two Pastas we ordered were OK not more not less, just if you'll prepare them at home when you don't really have the time to invest in our food.
In different circumstances I would give them a second chance but as they are neighbors with Mr. Laffa, it's hard for me to see myself going... ummmm lets eat some OK pasta and not a BOMB of a Shawarma!"}
{"text":"This place started as a high standard. However now their food is awful. The management now run by untrained employees. Their pasta was was tasteless and their pizza went really cheap with topping. One of the tomato based lobster pasta was exceptionally bad (literally taste so bland and over cooked) and ask if it can be fix but the manager told me thats how it supposed taste like. That was a complete a lie because I had this dish while back it was really tasty! She didn't apology for it and took our pasta back and fixed it. They didn't make it from scratch tho (doesn't that violate food handling law?)It was one of my favourite joint in the town but the last two visit was complete waste of money. Hope they regain better practice by quality controlling."}
{"text":"Different but good

Small cozy place, easy going young staff, very casual. It can be confusing here if you didn't read yelp first, order right when you walk in like at a pizza-pizza but sometimes they bring the menu over and carry on like a waiter in a restaurant bringing napkins, cutlery, condiments and menu.

Pizza crust is very light and airy, crust has the crunch while middle has a slight soft chew. Small size pizza is very small which left lots of room for tiramisu. Dessert was good, huge coffee juiciness explosion from soaked lady finger cookies, mascarpone is nice but not as solid/firm as the traditional filling and berry coulis on top did not compliment or do much to the taste profile. 

Would come back again for pasta but bring small group of friends as finding open tables or counter seating can be hard. This place is great for take out to eat at park across street."}
{"text":"love their funghi pizza. it's a good place if you're craving artisan pizzas but don't want to pay too much. their pastas are also good too but last time i had it i thoight it was too oily and the cooking process took a while"}
{"text":"went here for lunch. we all checked in on yelp so we all got free desserts (dine in only). i had the warm brown butter and coconut cake - it looked pleasing but was too dry for my liking. nice service. clean restaurant. i got the trecce pasta myself which i thought was good. big portion and there were plenty of goat cheese, arugula and sundried tomatoes. you can add oil, fresh ground peppers and chilli flakes to your liking as they came on the side. i also had a few bites of my friends' foods (carbonara, pizzas, bucatini) which i thought were really good also"}
{"text":"It was more like a cafeteria than a bistro.  Portions are ridiculously generous so sharing is a must. I had pasta and salad for 3 meals. I would give it 4 stars but the pasta was over-cooked, I like mine al dente, and the basil pesto did not taste particularly fresh."}
{"text":"We had the rigatoni and carbonara pastas and both were excellent and very fresh like others have mentioned. The portions were quite generous. I'll definitely be back to try the pizzas."}
{"text":"Great prices. Fresh ingredients. Good amount of food and amazing taste. Always my go-to place for take out or sit in Italian!"}
{"text":"Located in a residential neighbourhood, we tend to pop by Levetto after shopping at Vaughan Mills close by. 

Not a fancy sit down but you can expect good service and good food options here. We ordered the winter kale salad with chicken and carbonara pasta. Generous serving size was great for sharing. Pasta came out a bit saltier than usual. Also the chicken on the salad was pretty dry. We have also had the mushroom pizza in the past and that is a must have. 

Overall definitely a must try for reliable, delicious and quick service pasta and pizza!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time this week. 

It's a bit of a different style/environment. Minimal seating and order at the counter.  Not bad, just different. 

We ordered the funghi pizza and braised beef rigatoni. 

Pizza was great. Fresh and delicious. Enough toppings and served hot. 

The rigatoni however was bad. Pasta was too undercooked for our liking. The tomato sauce was exactly that. Sauced tomatoes. Where was the seasoning?  The beef was totally MIA. I may put up a MISSING sign up in the neighbourhood.  

We weren't sure what the tipping arrangement was supposed to be. We had to order, get water, napkins and cutlery.  There was also a tip jar which makes it seam like tipping wasn't needed on the bill. Still confused about that. 

Service was great. No complaints there. 

Unless we're looking for a very small pizza to take out, we likely won't be returning. 

Solid three stars."}
{"text":"Went to the Spadina location last night.  Excellent Food.  We (three) had the Funghi Pizza which was just superb.  We also had the Patate Pizza and the Taglietelle.  The Patate Pizza was good too but pale in comparison to the Funghi.  The pasta was good but needed a little salt.  Overall, delicious, excellent portions and we were stuffed at the end.  We also had the brown butter coconut cake because of the recommendations and it did not disappoint.  Will definitely go back.  Service was good too and a perfect pricepoint."}
{"text":"First time here gonna give it 5 cause they've some God damn amazing pizza dough, I love the simplicity of the pizzas and salads were great too. 
The server was pleasant and friendly and helpful,  only thing I wished was they could serve a local espresso.  Otherwise they get top marks on everything. 
We had the Margarita and pesto pizzas and the salad which has fennel all top notch!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Do not hesitate!! Out of this world!! Very cheap for the amazing quality of food. It's mine and my fiancé's new favourite restaurant. Just go now!! You will not regret it:)"}
{"text":"I had the braised beef pasta and spicy salami pizza.  The pasta was perfect - al dente and super fresh!! The ambiance was also really nice and fun. Great food. Great price."}
{"text":"After my previous review, the owner reached out to me and offered me a complimentary meal for two. He made sure that we were taken care of and the entire experience was hassle free. 

Food: 4/5

The food here is great. I always get the Funghi Pizza and the carbonara. The rigatoni is amazing as well. 

Value: 5/5

You will not find another italian restaurant that offers this level of quality and taste for the price. Expect to pay an additional $5 elsewhere for comparable dishes. 

Service: 2/5

The service here has always been very mediocre. Understandably though, since it is mainly a take out joint with limited seating. Don't expect anyone to check up on you or offer water, utensils, and even plates. Drink orders are usually forgotten, and other requests for extra cheese, napkins, etc will take 5-10 minutes or will be forgotten altogether. Sometimes it will be best to just go up to the front and grab them yourself. 

All in all I would give this place 3.5 stars but I am rounding it up to a solid 4."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were craving for good pizza after vaughan mills. Didn't want to go to Marcello again so found this gem based on other yelp reviews! Glad we did but yelpers weren't kidding about the space being small! Only 4-5 tables and some bar seats. They might have changed their menus ... I didn't see any desserts or kale salad as posted in pictures :(:( 

Service:
- Welcoming at the cashier 
- Not sure if i caught them on a bad night but given the amount of tables. I still had to sit in front of dirty dishes from prior party for a good 5 to 10 mins. 
- I saw my pizza on the counter waiting to be served for a good 5 10 mins so when served it was just warm
- it's somewhat of a do it yourself/ get it yourself vibe which is fine 

Food:
- amazinnnnng 
- we had funghi pizza, rigatoni, panzanella salad
- the funghi pizza was delish even though it could be hotter. It was as described, lots of diff mushrooms and the dough was so soft and yummy! PLUS it even had truffle oil drizzled! I am a sucker for truffle oil! 
- the rigatoni was also very good. The braised beef was so good!! Hubby thought the pasta was a bit under cooked but I thought it was just right.
- the salad wasn't special but it was still good. All ingredients tasted fresh 

Overall:
- generous portions across the dishes 
- reminds me of a smaller scale via cibo but I actually better prefer this place's pizza and pasta (via cibo has better salads) 
- will come back again if in the area
- go early or expect to wait for seats"}
{"text":"It's rare to have a place in Thornhill that serves budgeted gourmet Italian food. I come here very often with my fiancé on a regular basis. We love how simple the place operates. 

Definitely come here for their pizza and pasta. Huge portion and their dishes never disappoint. 
One downside of the place is that there aren't a lot of seatings and it's definitely not a fancy eatery for patrons to sit down for a prolong period of time. 

Overall: 4/5
Service: 3/5

{"text":"My gosh this place is sooo soo sooo good! So happy decided to go here! from friendly staff and service to Amazing food; they had it all down to a T! 

The pasta waas perfectly al dente; and each was so well made! From the Lobster Taglatelle to the Slow braised beef Rigatoni... just amazing. 

And their pizzas! Hands down the best crust and base i've had. Perfectly crisp bottom with an airy dough that just melts in your mouth. Absolute perfection. If they had more seating; this place would be anyones group dinner destination. The food is that good and can be appreciated no matter what ones palate craves for.

Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Eh. I really wanted to like this place. Definitely disappointed. I got the pea pesto shell pasta and while the portions were huge it didn't live up to the pictures. It was very greasy and made my tummy hurt after just a few bites. On the bright side the food was very hot, even after I walked home. When I asked the counter girl for some Parmesan she said \"There's a charge for that.\" I tipped her generously for my take out and I think it's strange that you can't get packets of Parmesan to go with your pasta and pizza. So bummed, I was really looking forward to this place."}
{"text":"Levetto's used to be me hands down favorite go to spot for pasta. Their rigatoni was to die for with generous portions of everything. However, over the past 6 months I've noticed a drastic decrease in the amount of pork served in each portion. Yesterday's rigatoni was left me unimpressed with next to no meat...

Having said that, their pasta is made fresh daily and cooked to al dente. The Parmesan shavings are still a great mountain peak. So at least that's unchanged."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and my friend took me here since it was close to her place. 

Note: I'm not a huge fan of Italian as it is very carby and heavy. 

I just had to try this place though after seeing pictures of their pasta !

We had spinach salad - carbonara - porchutto pizza (can't spell it) and tirimisu (on the house when you check in on Yelp!)

Portions are extremely generous. The salad was passable. Carbonara was pretty good and you can certainly tel it was hand made. Their recipe for the the carbonara itself tasted very much like ramen noodles. 

Now the pizza.... Wow it was really good and I'm not even a fan of pizza. It was thin crust, had a kind of sweet bbq sauce and a splash of cheese. This pizza was amazing! Then to top it off; free dessert when you check in on Yelp. The tirimisu tasted quite home made and the espresso part was very strong. Pricing was very very economical. It was $45 for all that including two glasses of wine. 

I docked a point because they didn't have a wine on their printed menu (out of 4 wine selections ? Cmon). Second, I had to go up on multiple occasions to order the dessert, ask for the bill, etc. I realize this is mainly a delivery take out place but if tables and dine in menus are provided; I would very much like a speck more service. 

Still, I give it 4 stars and would come back even if just for that pizza !"}
{"text":"It is a good restaurant in general. The service is excellent but the food isn't. It's a bit too salty in my opinion."}
{"text":"I received an email from the owner Nazir who offered me a free credit for pasta , pizza and salad. I decided to go ahead and give this place another try. This time they did not disappoint. Thanks again , I will be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon Levetto, and it's amazing! It's a chill, low key restaurant that reminds me more of a take out/ coffee shop atmosphere, but it's a dine in restaurant. We ordered:

Affumicato pizza - amazing pillowy dough with a light crisp crust. It's definite not your typical pizza dough. The bacon gives it a smoky flavour, so definitely be back to try more of their pizzas.

Bucatini - I love bucatini, and this one delivered. You can taste the difference of home made pasta versus store bought. The bucatini was cooked al dente, and the sauce was great. We couldn't ask for more, or perhaps...maybe guanciale :p but nonetheless a thumbs up!

We also got their brown butter coconut cake on the house because we checked in on Yelp. So check in and get yourself a free dessert!

We will definitely be back, and even asked them to consider opening a location in the east end!"}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber Eats... Had the carbonara, I was glad they had lunch portions. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. And the flavour was amazing. It got super greasy at the bottom, but how can I complain when I knew it was a mix of bacon and cheese.
Mmmm still thinking about it now...
We also ordered the margherita pizza which I heard was kinda underwhelming. I didn't try this though, I was too satisfied with the pasta."}
{"text":"I love levetto!!! This place is amazing and the location is so convenient. They have the best ingredients and you can taste the freshness in their food and the portions are huge! My pasta usually lasts me 2 meals and they still taste amazing heated up. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Pasta here is delicious! Full disclosure, I've only tried the rigatoni with braised beef, but because it's so great I never order anything else. Also - the cake is delicious too. 

I took a star off for the inconsistent service and an unclear ordering process from location to location. At one location, we were told to order at the front. At the second location, we were seated and had orders taken at table by a very slow and awkward waiter. So I'm confused whether the restaurant policy is to always order at the front, or is it normally to have full service? We were confused and unsure whether or not to tip - kind seemed like waiter number #2 decided to make his own rules and take orders despite not really being trained as a waiter (he was brutally bad...) just so he could get a bigger tip. But I honestly don't know because I've only been there twice."}
{"text":"I was accidentally charged an extra $5 during my second visit. Nicolas, one of the co-owners introduced himself and I was SO impressed at the customer service I received. You can tell this is a new business and the entire team is working hard to ensure it is successful. They make sure you don't leave the restaurant feeling anything but super happy.

Also should be noted, this is my first Yelp review. It was that good of an experience. 

Oh and some eye candy in the kitchen was nice too ;) 

Do I sign off in Yelp?
- Ashna  

Oh shit - the food! So good! Massive portions so well priced. The pasta is always good for 2 meals for me! And I eat a lot. Like 12 inch sub appetite.

[Edit: I made a review in 2014 I forgot about. Doesn't count]"}
{"text":"Amazing handmade pasta and wonderful dessert as well. This place is nicely tucked in the China town area but it's definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Very good and cool place, pastas are awesome! Didn't try pizza yet but look as good as pasta :)"}
{"text":"Seriously good eats! The place is small but menu is simple. Get there early and you'll have a spot!"}
{"text":"Levetto's Chinatown pizzeria might seem like an unusual location, but for those near the busy downtown core it makes for a great lunch or dinner option. Carb-filled pasta and pizza delights can be combined with salads and desserts to create a satisfying meal that is not too heavy on the wallet.

Keeping things consistent with their other locations, this shop has a nice view of the street and features a nice combination of bench and wooden tables and seating. The atmosphere is quite nice and relaxing and the staff are very chilled out and friendly. Your order will arrive quite promptly depending on how many customers are ahead of you. 

It's a comfortable and affordable place to dine that I thoroughly enjoy. For just $8.50, a small Pollo Toscano pizza is the perfect pick me up. I must try the Peking Duck pizza next time I drop in."}
{"text":"Levetto serves up an impressive variety of pizza, pasta and salads at a price point that definitely will not hurt your pockets. The portion sizes are perfect, and proportionate to what you pay for. Say that three times fast.

The pizzas are rectangle shaped, made on a thin crust with rounded edges. The topping combinations on each of the different offerings are quite interesting, and go pretty well together. The pasta dishes are no exception, as they each come in a plentiful size and are presented in an appetizing way. Even the salads are gigantic, so bring friends to share with or plan to take some of your meal home with you. Soft drinks and a small selection of beer is also available, as well as desserts.

Must-try items:

Soppressata, Margherita, Pollo Toscano, Funghi (Pizza)
Pomodoro, Rigatoni, Carbonara, Tagliatelle (Pasta)
Arugula, Romaine (Salads)

The defining characteristic of this small chain is a comfortable, casual atmosphere you can anticipate experiencing when you dine here. Each location is slightly different, but this Sudbury shop effectively uses a modest amount of space very well.

The mixture of seating makes it a good luncher/dinner choice for both individuals and groups. Both takeout and dine-in scenarios can be accommodated, and food is brought out to your table. Service here is usually reliable and fast. I highly recommend giving this place a chance."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing but came here recently for dinner and the food has slipped. The pasta is too salty (the bacon I bet) and the duck pieces on their Peking duck pizza is smaller than Trump's wee-wee. What went wrong?"}
{"text":"First time was really impressed by the service but more so by the food. Loved everything ordered. Stuff comes out pretty quickly.  Very upbeat ambiance."}
{"text":"Do NOT order online from this place!! I noticed the other day that the base prices on Foodora were a solid $4-5 more expensive than the prices on the menu. Foodora lists the Carbonara as $19.50 vs $14 in-store. And this is before the delivery costs too! 

This is TERRIBLE ethics when all the other restaurants don't put a premium on their prices, despite needing to pay commission to the food delivery app. 

Honestly, Levetto is home of my all-time favourite pizza but I just can't stand behind this. If you're trying to source more revenue through the apps, don't put the extra cost on the customers. 

If you can visit in-person, do it. I've never had any issues finding a table when I visit, most of the traffic is done through delivery orders, which makes it even worse."}
{"text":"Levetto has the best smoked prosciutto pizza ever!!! They use date sauce as the base, which gives it a sweeter taste. When combined with the saltier taste of the smoked prosciutto, the pizza has an amazing sweet and salty flavour to it!! The arugula is the perfect topping for this pizza since the rich flavour overpowers the gritty taste of arugula. 100% recommend. The small size is a good size for one meal, however, the pizza does heat up well for leftovers. Be aware that their pizza is not thin crust, if you are looking for that. 

When you walk in, you order and pay first and find a table later. The concept embodies fast casual where it's very self served. They have everything that you will need on their counter and you just take. Whenever I go, the seats are always full and there are always lines for people waiting for takeout. I've done sit-in, take out as well as delivery. If you live close by, they will do delivery! Be aware that the wait times are longer, around 30-40min but the food arrives hot. If you don't want to wait too long, I suggest calling in to place your takeout order so you can just pick up right away."}
{"text":"By far, the best pizza spot in the area. Been coming here for a while since they opened up about 2 years ago or so, and they never disappoint me.
They simply have salads, pizzas and pasta.
Have only tried their salads and pizzas so far,
Portions are very generous when it comes to salads, but if you're not into gourmet dishes then this might not be a good fit.
My favourite is their chicken pesto pizza, in my opinion their best on the menu.

Very small place though, can take up to 25 ppl maybe at max, 4 or 5 smaller tables with like 3 or chairs each. It's a cool modern little place setup, with their Tomato sauces, pop bottles, flower all stacked up facing the dining area."}
{"text":"I've only ever tried takeout/delivery from a couple of the Levetto locations so I can't vouch for a dining-in experience, but I really enjoyed all of my meals. Tried the carbonara pasta, which was a huge portion and delicious. My favourite items to order are their pizzas though. That crust is so tasty! And that fior di latte mozzarella...mmmmmmmm.  My only gripe is that the cost for upsizing to a medium pizza is kind of ridiculous. It is basically double the cost of the pizza for not double the amount of food."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review after using it for years . Anyway I'm posting just to rave about how amazing this place is. The pomodoro is my Favorite dish - probably best pasta dish I've had in Canada. Simple but amazing. There's a similar dish at Scarpetta in NYC, but it's $40 USD, so you can appreciate why I'm raving about it here, where its $10! My only qualm is that they don't have more locations, such as north York/donmills. Please open more!!!"}
{"text":"I did not expect Levetto be so crazily busy on a Sunday evening. 

The takeout requests was just crazy: both phone in and walk in. The wait for food was around 45 minutes. It was kind of insane for pasta and pizza.

The quality of the food did suffer due to their popularity. Caesar Salad ($9) was really fresh since it did not involve any cooking. But Affumicato ($8.50) bacon was burnt, I just scraped those off. They forgot my Rigatoni ($14) and the girl gave me a takeout order that belonged to someone else. The braised beef ragu was really good, I would recommend that instead of the pizza.

I don't mind coming back but definitely on a weekday."}
{"text":"This place is so addictive. 

My personal favorite is the Trese (the one with goat cheese) and the arugula salad. A very affordable option and the dishes are actually enough to serve two. I've yet to finish a plate to myself. As well, the staff at both locations are very friendly  particularly the chinatown location, they go the extra mile to ensure that you are happy. Such simple but well done Italian food. My new go to pasta restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered one Peking duck pizza and one pollo Toscana and our order was forgotten. We waited ten minutes and kept looking into the ovens to see when it was going to be done. After seeing empty ovens for a while, we enquired only to find out that it hadn't even been started yet. The genteman at the cash began helping the Cook in the back. I write this about 17 minutes into my order and it still hasn't arrived. Not at all happy with the service considering the Sudbury street location was fantastic. 
Lastly, the music contained some rather offensive n word language. For an Italian place.... I would expect better. 
The one star is only from a service perspective. It smells good in here so I'm sure the food is great. 
22 minutes in and I'm still waiting.

Follow up: the Peking duck pizza was horrible. Excessive amount of onions and loaded with way too much cheese. See photos"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening at about 8 pm. The staff was really friendly and we just ordered a Margarita pizza (small to share). It was only $7 and was more than enough for the 2 of us. Really soft dough and crispy base - just the way I like it. The real icing on the cake was when we got a free dessert after we checked in on yelp!! Hello panacotta! Sooooo delicious. 
Anyway, we're coming back to try the pasta - that screen playing delicious videos was really tempting. Giving this place a 5/5 for being 5/5. Total bill was only 7.95 or something. Cheapest meal for 2 - score!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go for pasta. I always order the pomodoro with Italian sausage. The prices are really good, a good meal for two for less than $25! Service is always friendly too. Only complaint is that it can sometimes be hard to find a table because the restaurant is really small. Would love it if they open more locations or expand this one. I used to always go to the one in Waterloo and that one is about the same size too."}
{"text":"The food is great but my experience this time was poor. There was no line up but they made me wait 30 minutes to even take my order. Slow service"}
{"text":"I am truly puzzled by the very positive reviews of this place. I had dinner there tonight and the meal was satisfactory at best - definitely not worth more than 3 stars.

The Food: We had two types of pizza and the pasta carbonara. 
- The pasta was alright, but certainly nothing spectacular. They say it's freshly made every day, but I've made pasta at home before and this did not taste quite right. The dough was a bit too firm, there was no freshness to it. It was either made using poor quality semolina or did not use the appropriate amounts of flour to water. It was almost worse than store-bought. The sauce was OK, but nowhere near as rich as a traditional carbonara - you could not taste a lot of egg or a lot of cheese, though the bacon was good.
- The pizza was a huge disappointment: very low on toppings, with nowhere near enough cheese; the edges and corners were completely uncovered by either sauce or any toppings; the crust itself was fairly good, though slightly unusual - it was thicker than normal but airy and fluffy. Most importantly, half of one pizza was extremely soggy. 

The Ambiance/Service: The restaurant itself looks a bit like a fast-food chain, with standard plastic tables/chairs. Not exactly a pleasant place to be in, but serviceable. On that note, service was great for us - the young lady was pleasant, amicable, friendly, and very positive about the restaurant. 

Overall, the food was average, but by no means worth the great reviews it currently has. A 4.5 star restaurant should be top-notch and memorable, not at best mediocre. This place seems to have used OK ingredients and mostly average execution, but fell short in terms of the final package. I would not recommend it if great or even good food is what you're looking for. If you're OK with a less than decent meal for the price, by all means give it a go."}
{"text":"This is a must-try if you're in the Queen West area! Levetto is not your average Italian restaurant. It has a fast casual vibe and serves a high quality selection of pastas and pizzas. Walking in, you'll notice the restaurant is quite small (so not really good for groups to dine-in), and you have the option of walking straight to the counter/kitchen area to order take-out. 

I opted for the dine-in option with a friend, and we tried the Spaghetti Carbonara as well as the Funghi pizza. The carbonara was delicious, with bouncy pasta noodles that definitely taste handmade (as you will see in the looping video on their screens). The savoury bacon melds perfectly with the egg-washed noodles, topped with scallions and a generous helping of grated parmesan cheese. The Funghi pizza was delicious as well - although the mushrooms were a tad too salty for my liking. 

By checking in on Yelp, we got a free dessert, so we ordered the Warm Brown Butter Cake. This was HEAVENLY. It tasted like a warm coconut cookie topped with a delicious cream sauce and chopped pistachios. I would come back again for this alone!

Service was attentive, and prices were very reasonable. Our bill came to under $40 for two people, and we were stuffed with leftover pizza to take home."}
{"text":"I don't usually go for pizza but when I do it better be good!!!  I can safely say this place has REALLY GOOD pizza and for a very very good price. This place has a very modern trendy feel with great lighting and awkward long communal tables. 

We ordered two pizzas to share and the thin crust was just perfectly crisp and fluffy. I loved the fungi pizza it was my favourite. You could taste the mushrooms and it wasn't overpowered by anything! The smell was drool worthy.I loved how hot and fresh the pizza was because it was made on the spot. Waiting time wasn't as bad and it came in a timely matter. We then got our complimentary dessert from Yelp which was just alright but I ain't complaining it's free."}
{"text":"Not really impressed by the food here...nothing special. I had Margherita pizza, pomodoro and rigatoni for dinner and both pasta dishes were so-so. Service was not the greatest for the amount of staff hanging out in the kitchen area. We sat down with our 19 month old daughter and i dragged the highchair on my own from one end of the restaurant to other(no one offered any help) and in addition to that staff didn't even set the table for us ( we got our own utensils and plates). Meanwhile, people who walked into the place after us got their tables set up and got checked on a few times. 

Overall, not at all impressed and would not return again  or recommend anyone."}
{"text":"I was immediately transfixed by the images posted on their website and I knew I wanted this for delivery at my hotel.

They have a convenient online way to order, but they don't really give you a heads up about the delivery charge. My dinner total cost ended up being almost $10 more than I anticipated. 

Considering most of the highly ranked food in the area is Asian, if you want a quality alternative, this is it. 

I ordered the rigatoni and the romano salad. As soon as it came I knew this was WAYYY to much for me for one meal. I'm sure everyone has a little Italian grandma that might do the pasta better, but I couldn't stop eating it! The Romano salad I put in the fridge and crossed my fingers that it would hold up to the test of time. I didn't get back to it until dinner the next night and it was honestly one of the best salads I've ever had. It obviously had very fresh ingredients and the dressing complimented the crispy meat and cheese really well. 

My one major complaint (aside from delivery charge) is having to pay an extra $1.25 for cheese and getting a container with literally a half tablespoon of it all clumped together. Not cool."}
{"text":"The place is not that big they might have seating for like 30 people. They do get a lot of takeout orders from the condos around. The place looks very urban and modern. 

The menu isnt extensive but has enough options for everyone. The prices are very decent and the food was very delicious. The staff were very accommodating and took the time to explain ingredients etc."}
{"text":"Om nom. One of my favourites in Toronto. Just a hop skip and a jump from Bellwood Brewery. Go to the farmer's market, buy a beer for later and then get a huge portion of pasta! Very reasonable prices, don't forget your Tupperware for leftovers! The salads all sounded really good too and a lot of options for vegetarians which is nice.

It's sort of self serve so not as fancy as I was expecting but that's fine by me.  Good music though and I liked the vibe even though I'm not usually very partial to industrial areas.

The pea pesto was a nice touch. Not too in your face, a well rounded flavour. But best tiramisu ever! Unique and not too heavy."}
{"text":"No words can properly describe the joy and happiness that I experienced dining here. Top notch service, beyond phenomenal food, and absolutely delectable dessert. I can not recommend this beautiful restaurant enough.

Honestly, though, thank you, Yelp, for recommending this place. I enjoyed myself immensely. And the staff are so friendly, helpful, and personable, it was like we were actually acquainted. Loved it, and will definitely be going out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Levetto intrigued me greatly - popped up on Yelp recently and was home to such stellar reviews. I guess I had to try it then! 

I went early on a Friday evening - and it was quite empty at the beginning but toward the end of my meal, it slowly picked up. I peeked at the menu and decided to go for their pasta as well as a salad. 

We started with the Arugula salad, which was enormous. The portion was actually surprisingly big - I wouldn't know how anyone can finish it alone. The ingredients were fresh in the salad and there was a nice crisp dressing that went well with the salad. 

My friend and I ordered the Rigatoni and Carbonara to share. The rigatoni was my favourite, the texture of the pasta was perfect. Cooked perfectly and the flour they used had just the perfect amount of bite to it. The sauce was good and not overwhelming. The carbonara was very good as well - nice big pieces of bacon with a great creamy sauce. The pasta consistency was good as well - but the rigatoni really highlighted how serious they take their pastas. 

Next time I guess I'll consider trying their pizzas. But their pastas are definitely A+! Other things to note: prices are quite affordable - less than $10 for salads and small pizzas. Pastas and large pizzas are generally in the low teens. Also, you order at the front and they would bring the food to you."}
{"text":"Levetto is a small Italian restaurant at the corner of Dufferin and Autumn Hill. I've driven by this area so many times but only noticed it a few months ago. We came here twice, once to eat in and once to order out. The restaurant doesn't have that many seats inside (maybe 4-6 tables?) but they also have a few table outside. There's also tons of parking in the parking lot.

We ordered the rigatoni pasta, which was tasty. However, the serving size was pretty small, so I was a little disappointed. The mushroom pizza was very good. We ordered it to go on a different night, along with the potato pizza. The potato pizza wasn't particularly good. The potatoes were not fully cooked, so we were a little disappointed by that as well.

Overall, the food is hit or miss. I'm definitely interested in trying some of their other pizzas."}
{"text":"I ordered from Levetto for take-out and I was extremely impressed! The portion sizes and quality of food is fantastic. We ordered the trecce which was delicious with a bit of a kick from the chili flakes, and the rigatoni was exactly what you expected for a ragu. We also tried the pizza which had an amazing crust. I would definitely order from Levetto again!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and pasta. The service was really kind, we liked that. Recommended if you are craving for Italian food on Spadina"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go to Levetto with a large group of friends so I got to try a little bit of everything. My personal favourites were the rigatoni with slow braised beef and the Verde pizza. The ingredients were fresh and the pasta was made from scratch. The staff was super nice and accommodating. One member of our group has a gluten allergy and the head chef made special gluten free pasta for her. There's currently a deal that if you check in on yelp you get a free dessert, I tried the tiramisu and it was pretty good. There is a surprisingly strong taste of espresso within this dessert so if coffee isn't your thing I probably wouldn't order it. For the price we paid the portions were quite generous, I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Sorry guys it is a little overrated place.You can buy what you paid but don't except to eat best pasta or pizza at town as rated."}
{"text":"No private parking lot. Paid parking on the streets.

Came here for some quick pasta. I ordered the carbonara. The service was slow. The pasta was hard and undercooked. The portion was good but i was unable to finish it because the pasta was too hard. It came with a lot of bacon though.

The price is ok if you just order the pasta alone, but if you add chicken or sausage or any other topping on it then its not worth it. You would get better food if you were to go to a restaurant for the same price.

Plus side, if you check in with yelp you get a free dessert
I got the panna cotta pudding, it did not match my tastebuds. It tasted like gingerbread cookies with a really sour berry topping. 

May comeback to try the pasta again, hoping that next time it wont be undercooked ! 

Price: Decent
Food: Not that great
Service: Slow"}
{"text":"My God, this place is amazing, I was not expecting that! The carbonara is very very good. The pizza is just right, I little puffy with a crisp bottom and amazing taste."}
{"text":"It's a small place with small tables for four people. Not enough space to put for 2 orders of large pizza and 2 orders of pasta.  Considering you need space to put glasses for water and water bottle. You order first and you sit yourselves. The tables were dirty with stains of tomato sauce etc. Pizzas good but crust not crazy about it. My pasta order Trecce was so spicy hot that I took it home end up in the garbage. I was not warned about this and the staff only said sorry. Which means that's your problem!  Although I like the fact that they make their own pasta, the sauce of the other order  was not as expected. What my companions said, the sauce they make at home is much better than what they ordered. Overall not enjoyable and big disappointment"}
{"text":"We ordered beef ragu, carbonara, and the smoked prosciutto pizza. 

- Beef ragu was really delicious! It was definetely the best out of the 3. The pasta was quite tough (not undercooked) so after a while it became a bit of a jaw workout. Despite that, we would still reorder in the future.

- Carbonara was great and had a generous amount of bacon in it. 

- Smoked prosciutto pizza was waaaay too sweet for our liking. Really enjoyed the dough though!

There was only the 2 of us so we were stuffed.  Will go again when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The salad was fresh and very tasty, the \"green\" pizza was delicious, especially the crust. Our waitress was very friendly and it has a small, intimate, quiet atmosphere. They even gave us a sampling of a salty caramel biscotti..yummy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My best friend was visiting from another province, and I debated on where to take her. Since Levetto had really good reviews (which are well deserved) and an interesting take on Peking duck, I decided to come try this place out.

Since there was only two of us, we shared the Peking duck pizza and a salad. The salad was huge. There was nothing particularly special about it other than its size, but there's no complaints coming from me about more food.
While the Peking duck pizza was clever and tasty, I thought there was an excessive amount of scallions on it. It really took away flavour from the rest of the pizza, so I ended up scraping most of the scallions off. Otherwise, great new take on a cultural food!

I came right as it opened so we were the only customers at the time. Service was friendly and quick. This location is a bit small, so I wouldn't recommend it for larger groups, but the food is definitely good."}
{"text":"Interestingly quaint and modern pizza/pasta place where you could sit with a friend and a loved one or take a quick pizza home. I personally love the way they make their margarita pizza; thick light crust, sour Fresca tomato sauce topped with good mozzarella and a leaf of basil. Art. However their menu has hits and misses, and this is the go-to place for students from Stephen Louis Secondary. So don't go here from 12-4 unless you like when children watch you eat."}
{"text":"Wow ! fungi pizza thin crisp and delicious.  Pasta homemade and good for the soul. Small restaurant but friendly staff and nice decor. Will deffinitly be returning"}
{"text":"Levetto is a cute place. The restaurant itself is a bit on the small side, but it's very modern with nice decor and layout. The staff are very friendly! This restaurant has some of the best service I've ever seen. Really, really kind people.

To start, we ordered two small (4 slices each) pizzas: the margherita and the pizza verde. The margherita was absolutely delicious. It tasted very fresh: the cheese was perfectly gooey, but not so much as to think it had been reheated, the tomato sauce was perfectly sweet, and the dough was crispy but not brittle. To top it all off, it was garnished with a fresh slice of basil. Other places I've visited just sprinkle some dried basil on top, not Levetto. The pizza verde, on the other hand, seemed to be a bit confused. All of the toppings that were on it contrasted, not complimented, each other, making for an odd eating experience. The pesto was delicious though.

The pasta was just OK. It wasn't really al dente, and no matter how good the sauces were, they couldn't take away from the pasta not being properly cooked. My bucatini was a bit hard, so I didn't like how it turned out. There didn't seem to be enough bacon for the pasta - it wasn't well proportioned. The pasta was basically drowning the bacon. The portion sizes are pretty big, though, so I guess you get the most bang for your buck. If you come to Levetto, try the pizzas, rather than the pasta dishes. You will be much happier with your decision!"}
{"text":"Amazing pasta. Phenomenal service. Love that you can add different kinds of meat and interchange the kind of pasta. Very friendly and amenable! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"//OVERALL THOUGHTS//
FANTASTIC pizzas for a VERY reasonable price. Ranging from $7-$18.50 depending on the size and flavour. Each pizza had tons of quality ingredients and made to perfection with great portions. 

//THE FOOD//
Peking Duck Pizza (5/5) - who knew hoisin sauce, cucumbers, and duck would be a match made in pizza heaven? There was just the right amount of the sweet & salty from the hoisin sauce without overpowering the cheesy flavour and crisp succulent duck bits, while the diced cucumbers and green onions gave the pizza the freshness it needed. 

Funghi Pizza (5/5) - for any mushroom lovers out there, this is the best pizza you'll taste. There's a mix of portobello, cremini, & oyster mushrooms with the amazing garlic white sauce and a generous amount of incredibly finely shredded white cheese. Everything just melts together with every bite!!

Soppressata Pizza (3.5/5) - a more classic tasting pizza with tomato sauce, basil leaf on each slice, and spicy salami. 

Patate Pizza (2/5) - Looks a lot better than it tastes. I found that it had a much lighter taste than the other pizzas, which came off as bland to me. The scalloped potatoes tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all, but I was a fan of the fluffy fresh ricotta cheese!

Misticanza Salad (3/5) - lots of greens with refreshing bites of mandarin oranges and the dill dressing was light and flavourful.

Romaine Salad (2/5) - tasted like any typical Caesar salad, the garlic dressing was good, but the croutons were SO stale and gross.

//THE ATMOSPHERE//
You find your own seating and order at the cash register. They'll bring your food over but you're responsible for getting your own cutlery and napkins from the cart. They provide vases of water for your table to pour yourself but if you need a refill, you must go up to the counter to ask for it! Otherwise, the staff is quite friendly. The space itself is clean and basic, and seats ~20 people in the entire place. Easily got a table for 8 on a Sunday dinner prime time."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to eat tonight, was wanting for something light, you know what let's order pizza! First was too lazy to order by phone, but this also offer an online ordering system, very easy to use. So we order the funghi and affumicato. My girlfriend wants veggie only so funghi was quite a match in heaven for her! The order was ready at the time indicates when I went to pick up. The affumicato was amazing, I know it's shareable but I'm a hogger for the pizza! The funghi was so good, never ate one that so good take out pizza before. Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for good quality Italian food.  The best mushroom pizza ever! but get it quick because it sells out!  The Affumicato pizza and the buccatini pasta are also very tasty...make sure to get extra crisp bacon on the buccatini..trust me you'll love it, your arteries not so much.  Staff is young but enthusiastic and helpful.  Seating is limited but worth the wait to eat there!"}
{"text":"Levetto was a bit of a mixed bag. It's more of a stylish food counter than an actual restaurant, which was a bit of a surprise. Still, if the product was top notch I would not care too much about this. The young man at the counter was a bit rushed and seemed discombobulated much of the time. He made a pizza and pasta recommendation, of which my wife went with the recommended pasta (Rigatoni) and I went for a different pizza offering (the soppressata in a spicy sauce). We ordered a red wine and Italian beer respectively. The waiter seemed confused by my beer order (they had three to choose from) and he forgot to give my wife her wine.

The pizza was quite tasty and the crust was a real hit (it was a bit more like a focaccia). The half portion was a good lunch size and really reasonable at just under $8. The pasta serving (and the salads from what I could see) were huge. Unfortunately, it was also pretty boring and bland. The shredded beef in the rigatoni added an odd texture and, to be honest, ground beef would have been better. It also really lacked seasoning. Some pepper and dried chillies helped, but an option for a spicy past here or even some hot oil would have been a nice addition.

Overall - it was Just OK. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I wanted to have brunch at Mildred's Temple but the wait was estimated at 2 hours and we were both hangry. Not sure how i discovered this place, either Yelp or BLOGTO weeks prior but I'm glad I did. 

The counter staff are very friendly and the decor is very modern. We decided to order the rigatoni and Soppresata pizza. 
The crust is very thick, which I love and the sauce is fresh. They usually garnish with basil (but they were out) so they topped the pizza with chives. 
The rigatoni with braised beef was also VERY good. Fresh sauce, tender meat, although a little too salty for my taste mainly because I cut out sodium recently. 
Still a very solid lunch spot. Pasta and pizza are both shareable and we were both full at the end. Also the prices are very reasonable.
If you check-in on Yelp, you can get a free dessert too! They were out of the coconut cake so I got the panna cotta and it was delicious. 
Already have plans to return next month with a friend and I'm excited to try something different on the menu. Thanks for a great Sunday lunch!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from NJ, so we're very picky with our Italian food. This is a nice place. 4-5 tables with several stools that you can sit on the front where they make the food. We ordered pizza and pasta and it was good. Fast service and very friendly. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the menu is small. I love my meats and you won't find that in this place."}
{"text":"Finally downtown! have been going to the Vaughan location for my cravings. tried almost everything on the menu. lol. awesome food. friendly owner. just slightly harder to find parking than the vaughan location (obviously) but it's not too big of a deal"}
{"text":"Proud to be a regular. Never disappoints! The owner is always here to make sure it's all good and the staff are always friendly and pumped."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for my coworkers and myself for dinner. There were 7 of us so we definitely needed a reservation. I am not sure if they normally take reservations since the location is rather small. It is self order, so you go to the counter to order and pay, but they bring the food to you. 

We didn't know that it was self-order, so we sat at our table for a good 15 minutes and no one came over to us. Finally we went up to the bar and asked, and they told us that we had to come up... odd that they wouldn't have told us that when we checked in. The cashier was not very friendly/helpful. Someone in our group asked about white wines they had and she pointed behind her to the wall that had the bottles on it. Now we could see those, but it is hard to read what kind it is when it is up on a shelf... 

Most everyone ordered wine with the exception of one person who ordered a beer. When the wine came, we asked for waters (which never came), but the wine was honestly about half of what you would expect in a standard pour at a restaurant. The beer was poured into one of those plastic glasses that you would get at a cafeteria or a golden corral. It w just really weird that they didn't have glass beer glasses because the wine came in Ridel glasses. Just peculiar

We waited over an hour for our food to be delivered. The restaurant did seem to be almost full, but just would never have expected that kind of wait. People all around us who came in later got served well before we did. 

When we finally did get our food, it was delicious! The portions were huge! All the girls had leftovers for lunch as did a few of the boys. 

When we were just about finished, one of the managers came up to us and apologized for the long wait. He said he was going to bring desserts for us complimentary to the table. He brought us like 2 of each of the desserts they had that night (3 dessert plates)... They were quite good and honestly really made me feel a lot better about waiting... It was not as if they were just ignoring us, I guess they were just understaffed or something.

Just as a note, the reason for the missing 4th star is not because of the wait time, as they recognized that and tried to amend it, but rather for the servers never bringing water, being rude when we were ordering, and the minimal wine pours... 

Overall, I will try to go back again as it really was good food. I will just not be ordering wine.

** Edit **

Went back again. Ordered a salad and a pasta. I was able to eat about 1/4 of each. Portions are so huge. The service this time was a complete opposite from the time I came before. From order to me leaving the entire process was 30 minutes and the server checked on me twice asking if things were ok. Great experience. Personally, I enjoyed the pesto pasta that  I got the first time a bit better than the pasta that I ordered this time, the Carbonara.  Still good, just a personal reference, could be that I adore pesto... but either way, great service this time, quick, lots of food, and polite!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING! I had the best italian food I have ever eaten here! I wish I had a Levetto in Phoenix as the price and the quality of food was on point! I 100% recommend this restaurant to anybody who is looking to eat great italian food! Don't think twice and give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"In the heart of Chinatown, I discovered it enroute to Kensington Market one day. It's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. First experience was very positive - would definitely return!

ATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.

SERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.

PRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)


FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.

Here's the pizza we ordered:

Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.

Margherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more \"special\" toppings instead.

Shall return, and/or try other locations."}
{"text":"This Levetto location is located at Dovercourt and Sudbury, a few minutes away from the busy street of Queen West. I've tried the other Levetto locations before and decided to come back to this particular location as I was in the mood for pasta. I dropped by for lunch on a Thursday; the eatery was quite empty. The pasta I ordered was filing and service was friendly but the food was just forgettable this particular time. I found the pasta to be underwhelming, under seasoned, and overcooked. Unfortunately did not have a good experience here and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing, good flavours. I have the carbonara pasta it was good but lacked little something. Overall good place."}

Service ***1/2
Ambiance **

Great pastas and salads.  This is a go to spot for me after a long day at work with a yearning for a comforting bowl of pasta.  

After trying all of the pastas, my favourites are Tagliatelle or Carbonara.  

The salads are also huge, and perfect if you want to keep some left overs or to split it with someone and also share a pasta.  

I had the pizza however didn't think it was very notable. It was light on toppings and sauce with a bit too much crust for my liking. 

The space is a bit small so I generally prefer takeout.  The food keeps well when transported so you're still getting a proper food experience."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place from a colleague and I don't know if I was expecting too much but I was a little bit disappointed.

My colleague said the portions were huge and the food was amazing...Ok...the portions are good, not huge, and the food is good, not amazing... we left full, that's true, but we finished our dinners with no problem if you know what I mean.

The food is good if you are looking for an American-Italian, but if you are looking for REAL Italian food, don't come here...

There's not a lot of variety in the Menu, no appetizers, only pizza... 

The prices are very good, so to be fair, quality-price is an 8 over 10...but I'm just giving my experience due to my expectations.

Service was Ok. Only one waitress (very nice) for everyone (at 8 PM on a Friday)."}
