{"text":"Hands down one of the best in the city! A must try!  I find the menu changes so everytime I am there, its something new. I just love the decor and ambiance of the restaurant and the service is alway great! Service is steller.  The food is always good and the ingredients are fresh and most of all they always suggest a really good wine pairing  :)"}
{"text":"My first experience at Brava was for a business dinner. That visit was an absolute disaster for both food and service.  I vowed never to return again.   Thankfully a twitter group organized a dinner out and Brava was chosen for this nights outing. I decided to give it another go and I was suitably impressed. With the large group service was attentive and everyone enjoyed their meals.  Since then I've become quite the regular there and it's become my go-to place for a well done meal paired with great wines.   The only miss I've had in recent visits was the burger was slightly overcooked, however the waiter immediately took steps to make it right. Recent highlights, any of the flatbreads, the burger, the Lebanese chopped salad, plus numerous items from their weekly fresh sheet.   The wine list is well thought out and accessible. The staff don't mind bringing you a taster if you have any questions about a pairing. As well, the cocktails are fantastic and well made. It's apparent they spend time training the staff how to properly make them, something more places should do."}
{"text":"I was here for a friend's birthday.  The service was great, warm, friendly and unpretentious.  If it was solely based on that, I'd probably give it a 4.  However, it's not, hence the final rating of 2.  We started with the margherita flat bread and lobster poutine, which were decent - I would never crave it again, but it was good.  For mains, there was a selection of braised beef, bbq pork, basa and chicken.  I ordered the basa for myself, but had a taste of the othr mains.  Every one of the mains was sooooo salty, it was not palatable - it was unfortunate and I was not impressed.  The basa was dry and flaky, with enough sodium on for all the meals at the table that night.  I had a taste of a few other dishes - it was confirmed that the chef was very heavy handed with the salt.  I wouldn't return for the food, but would go for drinks... and possibly dessert (with I did not try)"}
{"text":"Easily on my top 5 date spots. The service is always top notch, and its totally unpretentious.   The lobster gnocchi is unreal, as is the Lebanese Salad. I'm going back soon"}
{"text":"Another one of the great places to dine in our city.  Great food, great service, and a nice place inside without being too stuffy.  I had the venison and it was ridiculously good.  Finished things off with their toffee cake dessert.  Wow!  The best dessert I have had in the city!"}
{"text":"Brava a is very nice and well appointed restaurant. The staff is friendly and attentive. We felt comfortable and welcomed.  We started with the lobster poutine. There was six of us and three had the duck, one had the beef cheek and two the chicken. The food was prepared and presented well and everything tasted very good.  Although we all liked the food, we felt there was some room for improvement. The lobster poutine certainly could have used a bit more lobster. We shared these starters and I for one couldn't tell if I ate any lobster or not. But it is poutine and it still tasted good. ($17). The duck was very good but the three who chose it thought it looked tad small for an individual portion. I had the beef cheek and it was  extremely tender and delicious. Again the portion could have been a little more generous. It came with many vegetables; some that I can't recall ever eating before. Really good. As a contrast to these four smaller portions, the two chicken dishes were huge. Almost an entire chicken was served; each. We all tried it and really liked how tender the meat was.  The batter was crispy and flavourful but may have had just bit too much salt in it. The meals were not overly pricy. As side note and not that it dampened the evening, the bar ran out of the gin I like to drink (1oz). They also ran out of Heineken beer (2). They only offer two types of port and they were out of one of them. We also thought the wines were priced a bit high. All in all, we enjoyed our evening at Brava Bistro. $370 (with tip) for six adults. Not bad."}
{"text":"Love, love Brava Bistro.  Everytime I'm in Calgary, we stop in for dinner or lunch.  The relaxed atmosphere encourages us to linger and enjoy a few great bottles of wine.    On our last visit, the mussels with aioli and pomme frites were amazing.  The Fettucini with smoked bacon and peas was perfect.  Wine recommendations by the server were spot on."}
{"text":"Saw the 4 stars review, thought it would be a nice dinner out with my boyfriend. Turned out to be a total disappointment. The lobster poutine was good at the top only, the bottom of the fries become very greasy.... I had a clam linguini and my bf had a lamb loin... I'm not a lamb person so I didn't try it. But my linguini was a total disaster that I have to give it up. There was sand in the clams, too salty and the linguini was stuck together.... I don't think I will ever go back again!"}
{"text":"We had reservations but showed up 30 min early. They managed to squeeze us in as someone didn't show for their reservation.  They seated us by the front door and it was on the chilly side so we asked to be moved to a table in the back. They immediately moved us.   Our waitress was professional and quick but seemed a bit nervous all night.. She recommended the \"lobster poutine\" to start so we ordered it. I'm a big lobster fan but omg it was totally disgusting!  Fries with lobster, not a good combo in my mind.   We ordered a bunch of appies and drank bubbly. The appie that stood out the most was the scallops - delish! We were there to eat dinner but just as we were about to order the kitchen closed!! Not sure why our waitress didn't give us a heads up this. Is why you guys get a 4 not a 5.    The atmosphere is nice, staff friendly and quick...the food I say a 4 star. I've been here several times thru the years and really enjoyed myself but some of the dishes were just ok. I go here more for the atmosphere, for dates. Upscale and trendy."}
{"text":"3 stars for food; 3 stars for service 2 stars for value.  If I didn't know I was eating lobster poutine, I would've thought it was regular poutine...or maybe they ran out of lobster that evening."}
{"text":"Although the lobster poutine barley had any lobster and was hardly a 'poutine', it was still pretty good! I didn't know this place closed down though?"}
{"text":"I cannot say anything negative about this little gem. The wine, the food, the service, the ambiance...impeccable. Matthias S. wrote that the waiters were seasoned veterans, and they sure are. It makes such a difference.   I have but one regret and that is to not have tried the lobster poutine. I had not read any reviews beforehand :(  At Brava, you are guaranteed to have a great experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I sat down at Brava Bistro on 17th Avenue last weekend, and i was super surprised on the quality of the food, i had the Lobster Gnochi (sp?) and my wife had the burger and it was some of the best food that i've had in a while here in Calgary. The place from the outside didn't look like it would have the quality that it has on the inside.   I would recommend this place to all our friends.  - SM"}
{"text":"So Sad! Looking for a new favorite restaurant. Not sure how many people I have referred this restaurant to, but it has been a long time favorite until last night.  So I guess there is a new chef and a new menu with a few favorites still there. I have been away for a while so I ordered one of the old favorites, the Crispy Chicken which is no longer crispy! Now the chicken was moist and served with different sides but when you change a dish- give it a new name! The bigger problem was the halibut, one of the most expensive dishes on the menu. The portion was so ridiculously small it was absurd. Also the vegetables were as hard as a rock- raw turnip is not great. Now they brought a side of beans which was appreciated to make up for the raw turnip but I just couldn't get over the halibut portion. When we brought this to the attention to our server-we were offered a dessert which we declined. Really disappointed in Brava. When you have an unhappy customer, one who said they had been coming for years, don't you make a better effort to please?  I would like to add that our server, at the bar was lovely. But when you charge such a premium for food, there are expectations and they certainly were not met. Really sorry to write this review but I think some of these higher end restaurants in Calgary need to shape up! If you are going to charge-then make it worth our while."}
{"text":"Quality over quantity. Brava Bistro's is a fine dining bistro: a small restaurant and not to be confused or compared to large plated restaurants or chains. Situated in the heart of 17th ave, Brava's contemporary setting is inviting and not pretentious. The menu (back in the summer 2011) offers simple and more importantly, great tasting dishes. From reading previous reviews, I'm not sure why people's expectations of size is relevant? It's a bistro and like a tapas, you shouldn't expect large amounts. Instead, criticize  Brava's approach on how they execute their dishes within a bistro setting, or just go to Denny's. Perhaps, Brava's casual ambiance gives off a mixed message of its brand, or maybe large plates such as their pasta deviates too far from their flagship dishes.  What I ate and liked   Lobster poutine is creative and economical (using the seafood broth from other dishes as the gravy is smart), The braised short rib was not overcooked/dry, nor was the basa either. Seared scallops were perfectly done, nice and opaque in the middle.   Feedback  We order pasta the following week and it was not consistent with the previous (above). I had the mushroom fusilli and the spicy penne. The fusilli was done well, but nothing to brag about. The spicy penne was over concentrated with salt (too bad). The chef took the penne off the bill without hesitation; thank you. Overall, I understand that the pasta attracts an affordable price range, but its not what I interpreted of what Brava's brand is. Keep it consistent with the rest of the menu and avoid the urge to cater to those who demand big portions.  3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Brava Bistro hands down has the best lobster gnocchi you'll find this far inland. I have had lactose-intolerant dinner guests try the gnocchi and say, \"ya, that's worth it.\"  It's not just the gnocchi that makes Brava special. It's the patio in the summer, the attentive-but-not-in-your-face service, the wine list, the hard lemonade, the lebanese chopped salad, the cracklin' chicken and the comfortable leather booths that all contribute to Brava's charm.  Brava is a great dinner date/girls-night-out/take-your-out-of-town-mom-out-to-dinner place as the space is intimate without being stuffy, charming without being cheesy and affordable without being cheap.  I have always been a fan of Brava Bistro, it's a welcome little haven in the hustle and bustle of 17th Av.  T."}
{"text":"Intoxicated and hungover from the night before, I was walking down 17th looking for a lunch option. Walking by Brava, I remember hearing nothing but good things about it. Many a fine dinners had recommended the place and did mention that it was \"classy.\" With traces of alcohol on my breath, dressed in a T-Shirt  and wearing sandals, I thought to myself how perfect my attire would be for a Brava experience!  I had the shrimp curry which was excellent and I really appreciated the mango chutney taste to it. It was subtly sweet and delicious. I cleaned my plate. It really took my mind off the hangover.   The place is nice, with a touch of classy. I did feel a bit out of place with my dress. So I would recommend not going in jeans and a T-Shirt, but you don't need to go there with a suit or dress either. The service was stellar, had no problems!  Bravo Brava! You've impressed me with a great lunch experience."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the lobster poutine to start and the pork shoulder entree. Delicious!!   However the service was poor. Took forever to even order our appetizers and get our drinks  despite indicating we were in a rush. It wasn't even that busy.  The worst was when we told our server we were ready to order our entrees and he told us we had to wait for our appetizers to come out first. Weird?  Great food, terrible service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants by far.  Very classy yet laid back atmosphere, Dewey runs a great place.  Everyone working there is crazy friendly and very knowledgable, you can tell they love their job.  And the food........holy crap.  My wife and I have been here several times over the past few years and will keep coming back.  Lobster poutine is a must (looks small but you can share with someone else as it is extremely rich), the short rib is amazing (and almost even better the next day if you can't eat it all) and the creme brulee to finish off will be one of the best meals you will have.   Can't comment on too much of their other food since we always seem to order the same thing since it is that good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, decent wine list and good service.   The one missing star is mostly due to the short menu, they could had a few menu choices without overdoing it."}
{"text":"There were 9 of us at Brava last night and we had such an excellent time! Everyone really enjoyed their food. I had the lobster poutine, the wedge salad and the baked chocolate pudding. The lobster poutine seemed a bit weird at the beginning b/c it's essentially fries with a buttery sauce with chunks of lobster and blobs of marscapone cheese. I guess I didn't read the description very well b/c I was expecting a creamier sauce. Then I tasted it and all thoughts of \"weird\" were gone. it was sooooooo gooooood! The fries were crispy and all the flavours melded together wonderfully. The wedge salad was great with lots of chunks of bleu cheese and bits of bacon. The baked chocolate pudding was sublime. it was a bit like a molten lava cake but with very dark chocolate. I also had one glass of wine. My bill came to $51 with tax but before tip.   The other highlight of the night was the service. Our waitress was awesome. She was witty and personable but non-obtrusive. She brought the bottle out for all glasses of wine & was very good about suggesting wines to people who couldn't decide.  The only hiccups with the evening was the reservations persons insistence that if we had 9 people (up from our \"for sure\" 8) that we could only be seated at 5:30 or 8:30 not 6:30 as per our reservation. I called back to cancel b/c we did indeed have 9 and that person said \"Why would you cancel?\" I explained that we were told deinitively that if we had 9 those were the only 2 times that worked and neither of those worked for our group. She put me on hold for a quick moment and came back to tell me that they could fit us in no problem. The other two were that the mussels appetizer my friend ordered was just \"meh\" and another friend was accidentally charged $45 for her glass of wine (this one was fixed quickly once she saw it). Our wonderful waitress even seperated our cheques for us before she brought the bills without us asking. We usually just figure it out but this made it much, much easier.  Overall it was a wonderful night and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great French-inspired cuisine. The service and food was very good. Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the Lobster Poutine really stands out as the key appetizer. But the mussels and scallops were both great as well. I had arctic char with thai green curry/coconut milk/pas/cabbage/noodles/pea shoots. The fish was flavorful and tender and the portion size was large. I could barely finish it.  The address is convenient as well, right on 17th St. in the middle of many others restaurants. But Brava Bistro really stands out. There's really no reason I can think of why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars. Everything was good. But maybe nothing stood out to me as extraordinary. Still, you can't go wrong with anything you order. If you haven't been, go!"}
{"text":"The lobster poutine stole the show and overshadowed my main course.  A nice place for a bite. I'd go back (after trying what else Calgary has to offer)."}
{"text":"So yummy!! I was recommended for our anniversary by a friend and We had shared a bottle of Rosé Wine, lobster gnocchi, burger, and crispy chicken. We were early so the restaurant was able to accommodate a table an hr before our actual reservation. The service was amazing and we never felt rushed. Food was delicious. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If you have not yet been to the Brava Bistro, I've got ONE question for you:   WHY?   As some of you know, I've been playing hostess in Calgary this week and my sister recommended that we go to Brava Bistro on 17th Ave. I was a little nervous because I'm really trying to show these people a good time, and let me just tell you; I think my guests LOVE Calgary BASED on their experience at Brava.   The hostess was great. We asked for a booth and despite the fact that they were packed, they accommodated our wishes. Our waitress was FANTASTIC. The ambiance was PERFECT. And the food was BY FAR some of the best food I have EVER had.   My friends ordered the Halibut, the curry Penne, and I got the chickpea salad. We also ordered wine and the watermelon & feta salad to start.   There's not ONE thing I didn't like about this place. It was like a feast for the senses. Eye candy like you wouldn't believe, the unmistakable sound of people enjoying good conversation, the orgasmic tastes of high-quality food, the exceptional feeling of a welcoming and comfortable environment and the most tantalizing smells around.   Brava Bistro is heaven on earth. Whether you're a total foodie or just someone who is looking for a good night out, I have NO DOUBT that you will appreciate all that is this Bistro.   It's official: Brava Bistro is my top stop on The Calgary Tour."}
{"text":"I've been twice.  Once for YYC eats with a booking of about 20 or more of us.  The second time was for a birthday party of 5.    Both times I enjoyed the Lobster Poutine and split it with friends.  The first time there, there was a mix up and they delivered a second lobster poutine for free, but then went on to charge us for it.  They did fix it, so that was good as it was not ordered.  However, we had no problem devouring it!  For the large group night I think the service was pretty good considering the size of us.  I know I enjoyed the food.  The lobster poutine was a little different, but I found it yummy and ordered again my second time there.  We were seated along the wall across from the bar upon walking into the restaurant.  The second time there was a birthday dinner of 5 and I loved the setting.  We got seated by the front window facing 17th avenue.  It was dusk so the lighting was perfect with candles lit and romantic kind of ambience.    We ordered a bottle of prosecco between three of us and it was perfect for pre evening festivity drinks.   As I said above a ordered and split the lobster poutine again as well as an avocado salad.  The salad was odd as just a wedge of romaine lettuce with some tomatoes and avocado.  It was small.  I also ordered my own dessert of chocolate pot de creme and it was so good!  I also got to sample the birthday girl's warm gingerbread cake and while I'm not a huge gingerbread fan... it was really tasty!    I happily would go back with a small group or on a date with hubby."}
{"text":"Brava made Avenue Magazine's top 10 restos in 2013 so I took my spouse for Father's Day. All of the food was fine and cooked well, not spectacular but fine. We had lobster gnocchi, which was actually the best dish of the evening, scallops, short beef ribs and crispy roast chicken. Similar to things I would make myself at home. No fancy plating or presentation here.  But the service was so dismal. Although our waiter was nice enough, he was completely useless. We poured our own wine from the bottle, had to get up and get the pepper mill and serve ourselves, he forgot to order our entrees, he took away our bread and butter when it was half done (why?), and we had to ask for our bill and wait about 20 minutes. After the 20 minute marker of waiting to pay,  I decided to go in from the patio and ask him again. I saw him coming in the front door. I don't know where he was, or if he was just opening it for other guests but by this point I was pretty annoyed. The only reservation I could get was 5pm and we left about 6:30. The restaurant was pretty dead, maybe 30% capacity, so I'm not sure why the little details of good service were overlooked.  I think Avenue Mag missed the mark on this one. Top 10? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Dear Brava Bistro,  I had to wait an hour for my food and you managed to burn my salad. However, you gave Wendy two Lobster Poutines for the price of one, so I can't hate too much. Also, your drink prices are reasonable, your restaurant is pretty and the guy who got my coat was equally pretty. If I could rate the servers separately, I'd give them 4 stars, because even though I'm pretty sure they bungled all of our orders, they were apologetic and diplomatic. Plus, I ate the burned salad anyway (wasting food was a mortal sin in my house when I was growing up).   I'm on the fence about you.  Sincerely,  Tiffany  P.S. Bonus points for having moisturizer in the bathroom."}
{"text":"(I Do try to not write so much but sometimes I just cannot help it!!!)  WOW!  I had heard good things about Brava - I had no idea I was going to be dining here at all until we walked in. Just like that! It was worth the drive through killer traffic. Needed a night off from the kitchen and we found the right place. Brava - a French Bistro with modern fusion is how it was described to me.  We had a seat at the bar after being greeted by A, the best hostess ever! I could not wait to see the menu. I was told it was a big wine place - I will for sure have to come back for some. It was getting busy, I was not sure what to expect on a Wed night. It took about 10 min to get a drink but once our waiter J directed his attention to us, we truly had a great dining experience. J is very good at his job and you could tell that he wanted to be there and wanted his customers to have the best experience possible.  We ordered: (alot!) Split the arugula and goat cheese salad. So good! LOVE the fresh, crisp apples and the cheese was SO fresh! Loster gnocchi - OMG, amazing! That sauce. Thank you bread for doing your job tonight of sopping up that goodness! Margarita Flatbread - classic, well prepared Frites with aioli - a really nice side to munch on, fresh, skin on Oreo crusted chocolate tart with espresso infused whipped cream - Lord help me! Our waiter suggested this and he was ON POINT!  Surprisingly, after splitting all of that food with 1 other person, I was not full. I sent Kudos to the chef who obviously had passion for what he put on the plate and also gave praise to A and J who are going to make us want to come back to this restaurant ASAP! J even made a point to leave his post at the bar and open the door for us to see us out and thank us again. What else can I say? This was a 5 star experience.  TIPS Make sure you get the complimentary olives once seated - so good! The bread is good too. I would give this place a 6th star if I could had the bread been served warm. Try a glass of the pink Bubbly Malbec - YUMMY! The beers are so nice and cold and we saw some on the list that we had never seen before - go for it! Brava serves very nice filtered water, nothing tasting as if out of a tap - nice touch. Brava has a baker on site so for those non-dessert eaters - you only live once, you have to try the chocolate tart. Every 1st Sunday of the month they have a supper club - you can dine on 3 courses for $35! We are IN!  Cannot wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"Brava Bistro was highly recommended to us by the staff at the hotel we where staying at, which was only three blocks away.  Getting a reservation on a Thursday evening was tough so plan ahead, we wanted to get a reservation for 7:15pm but where only able to get in at 8:15pm.  The wait was well worth it and dinner went from good, better and then best.  We started with the Mussels' which come with pomme frites on top.  This was so tasty and we knew instantly we had made a great choice for dinner.  Our second course was the Lebanese Salad which was such a great new taste.  I highly recommend it to anyone as you have never had a salad like this before.  Finally came our entree Artic Char in a Thai green curry. Fantastic taste and a great end to our meal.  My wife had a great Pinot Noir from Italy which was reasonable priced at $9.50 a glass.  The wine select is long and expensive and wines by the glass where at a minimum.  Next time I am in Calgary I will visit again."}
{"text":"I have been here on a number of occasions, this used to be a fave spot of mine, but after my last visit, it will be a while until I come again. The food was good, pretty expensive for the amount (especially the salads). They do not cater to gluten free, which is always a make or break for me. As well, we had the worst server. In the two hours we were there we maybe saw our server 5 times, my husband had to go and get him twice for us to get service. Which is unacceptable to me."}
{"text":"Went here for a graduation dinner. Everyone's meals (mussels and fries, and prime rib) looked amazing, I ordered the seasonal duck pasta, it tasted great but I was slightly disappointed that there was just plain boxed pasta. The bathroom was leaking into the restaurant and the service was EXTREMELY slow."}
{"text":"I was Kenny M's wingman on Saturday night @ Brava bistro.  I ordered their infamous lobster Poutine, along with an avocado/bacon salad. The Poutine lived up to its reputation, it was intensely savory and buttery and the lobster's essence transitioned well into the gravy and the fries. I kinda wished there was more Mascarpone cheese, but after a few bites, the dish didn't really need it because it was very rich enough as it is. However, the avocado and bacon salad was somewhat disappointing. The veggies were fresh, but the bacon was thick and tough. However I liked the salty crisps placed on top.  I wasn't really that hungry at the time so as I watched everyone chow down on their main courses, I decided to order Brava's Manhattan to slowly drink. Kudos to our very cool and very cute waitress from Manitoba, who enlightened me with a story of how she sneaked alcoholic beverages into concerts by soaking it up with fruit, revealing that this was one easy way to get LIT. Why the story? oh it was because of Brava's special bourbon soaked cherry. I was skeptical at first but when I tried one piece, it was definitely potent! After I finally managed to swallow the cherry, my mouth was so drunk my tongue was doing a one night stand with the back of my teeth. It was as our table described it, the \"lembas bread\" (re: lord of the rings) of alcohol treats.  The service was great, although everyone at the event didn't seem to share this sentiment. I for one had no problems and found them friendly. But they seemed to have ATM issues that night and had to result in sending their customers to the bank next door to make withdrawals. I think they had enough servers on hand to be capable of escorting clients to the machine, especially girls who have to brave the elements of 17 Ave (and by elements I mean roaming drunken vagabonds heading to Melrose). But instead they just awkwardly peeked at the window. Not taking points off, but just a kind suggestion.  But I have to admit, despite the great service and flagship dishes like the lobster poutine and manhattan, I didn't see it being on a level deserving fine-dining prices, especially if their salads aren't up to par (re: review on burned salad below). Besides, aren't real French Bistro's supposed to be affordable yet creative meal experiences?"}
{"text":"4 of us enjoyed an early 6PM seating on St. Patrick's Day.  This is a very hot spot, hence the early seating was good advice from others. The place slowly filled and was quite busy when we left 3.5 hours later. Our server, Rod, a sommelier, was unobtrusive, attentive, and friendly.  The quality of the food is attested by all of the plates going back cleaned! Between the 4 of us we tasted a wide range of the appetizers, mains, and desserts and sampled off each other's - all were proclaimed wonderful."}
{"text":"For a bit of a higher-end meal, Brava is certainly a good option. The food was great and it is the first place in Calgary that had decent fish (I'm from the east coast). Everything seems to be made with quality in mind and the service was very professional yet friendly. The wine selection is nice and the general atmosphere of the place is classy but also comfortable."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant for lunch.  Good service and very good quality food.  Recommend the Lobster gnocchi.  They have really good Sangria as well."}
{"text":"The food at Brava Bistro is delectable. If you're a poutine-lover, you have to try the Lobster Poutine. The creamy seafood butter sauce (also available in the gnocchi dish) is divine - while the plate looks small, don't be deceived. The sauce will fill you up. All in all, the food was fairly good, aside from the gnocchi being slightly too soft and the burned mushroom fritters on my friend's salad.  However, the service left a lot to be desired. I never managed to order a 2nd drink as the servers were in and out so quickly. There were numerous mistakes made re: orders for appetizers vs. meals, and when an extra Lobster Poutine was delivered by accident, and we were told it was on the house due to the mistake, it still appeared on our bill. Not to mention, wrong desserts were delivered and, toward the end of the night, flagging down a server to pay our bills was far too difficult.  I understand we had a table of about 22 people, but we were booked far in advance. If you are unsure whether you can wait on a table that large, please don't take the reservation.  Due to the extraordinary circumstances, and the fact that the food was delicious, I will probably be back to give Brava another chance."}
{"text":"Visited here for my birthday with my boyfriend. We sat on the patio, which had he heat lamps turned up on a brisk late summer night. Ambience was light and romantic. Inside was a bit darker with dim lighting and louder but still nice. Our server was prompt and professional. We started off with the lobster poutine and gnocchi- both dishes were amazing! Rich in flavour and delicious. I had the tagliatelle as my main- again rich and delicious and my bf had the duck. The duck had a crispy skin which I enjoyed but meat was not as tender to our liking.   Overall a positive experience- good place for a date or a special night with your loved one."}
{"text":"My fiancee surprised me by taking me to this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, so my expectations where kinda low. I was expecting patio food, or at best Joey Tomatoes style of cooking.  When we walked in we were greeted right away by one of their waiters, and barely waited until we were seated. She read the reviews before we went there and ordered the lobster poutine right away.  I was a bit apprehensive about it because I am not the biggest fan of poutine and mixing seafood in with it...i just wasn't convinced about it. After trying it though...it was quite delicious. The key to getting the most flavour out it was to mix the fries thoroughly with the sauce. Holy smokes it had this deep and rich flavour to it.   The waiter was quite helpful, I was a bit surprised to see the waiters though. I figured since it was downtown on 17th it would be your average college student trying to work their way through. But these waiters were seasoned veterans, these waiters didnt just give you the average spiel about which wine should go with the meal. Like white wine with chicken, red with meat and so on. Noooo these waiters, would recommend exact brands and their choices were really good.  A specific wine might bring out the flavour of the steak, or of the fish. And their wine recommendations do reflect that.   Our entrees arrived, I am still getting used to the smaller portions of higher end restaurants. But my stomach was not dismayed by the smaller portion, because I was stuffed at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Two words: Lobster. Poutine.   Five stars.   What's that? A vote for best restaurant in Calgary. They do know the way to my heart. The folks at Brava must have broken into my dreams and stolen all the best parts. Everything about this place is amazing: food, service, location, decor. The patio is gorgeous.   If lobster poutine isn't your thing, how about this: Lobster Gnocchi. Yum."}
{"text":"Wow, my friend wasn't kidding when she said Calgarians love to go out and eat. My sis and I were supposed to meet up with a mutual friend of ours for dinner on a Saturday evening. We wanted to go to Una Pizza and Wine, one of my sis's favourite places, but it was at full capacity by the time we got there. Over two hour wait for a two spot? No thanks. We meandered down 17th Ave in search of another place and came across Brava Bistro. The hostess had one table left so we took it.  A partial view of the dinner menu. The menu is a short, one pager but there were a lot of intriguing options. Prices are on the higher end ($8.00-17.00 for appetizer/salads and $23.00-34.00 for mains, exception being $52.00 for pork platter for two).  My sis and I were starved from our hike so we decided to order two appetizers while we waited for our friend to arrive. This place is classy with a much older, mature crowd/vibe. Music is on the loud side (seemed to go up and down randomly multiple times during our dinner). We were a little underdressed but you can get away with it here.  - Bread - the complimentary bread was good. Fresh, chewy and perfect to soak up all the juices from the mussel broth. - Salt spring island mussels ($17.00) - leeks, fresh herbs, white wine, pomme frites and a lemon garlic aioli. Awesome appetizer to start our meal off. The sauce was drink-me-by-itself goodness (wish we'd had more bread to finish it off), mussels were plentiful and the frites were good filler. - Pear salad ($16.00) -arugula, frisée, stilton cheese, candied pecans, compressed pears, and balsamic vinaigrette. Candied pecans are so good. I was hunting these bad boys down with a vengeance. - Handmade tagliatelle ($24.00) - parmesan, herbs, house smoked bacon, kale and a soft poached egg. The egg was cooked perfectly - poke it and let the yolk ooze out, mix it and voila. Magic. The tagliatelle was perfectly al dente. - Crispy leg duck confit ($30.00) - Risotto, kale, grana padano, sweet pumpkin purée and sweet pumpkin diced along with herb and garlic. This was my sis's dish and the duck was perfectly done. Juicy, medium rare, duck is always a winner whenever we order it. - Braised beef cheek ($28.00) - Heritage angus beef cheek, red wine, crispy onion, smoked jalapeno mac & cheese and local vegetables. Our friend ordered this one and gave us a bite of the beef cheek to sample. It was excellent.  Cool, hip ambiance but Brava Bistro is definitely a place where you'll be shelling out the moola. The patio looks awesome for summertime. Next time we'll have to try the lobster poutine (that's sayin' something as I don't even like poutine)."}
{"text":"Prior to going to the Theatre we went to Brava Bistro for dinner (we had been given a gift card)....a Modern Fusion restaurant combined with Mediterranean ingredients.   I love to be able to check out menu's online and so after drooling over the menu earlier that day I was hoping my husband would be a little more adventurous in his meal selections. He is however a man of simple tastes (well some of the time) and stayed true to form by ordering a cesar salad and Alberta beef tenderloin. I indulged in the cheese plate and bucatini carbonara. His tenderloin must have been good because he ate it all without offering me a bite (and hardly breathing I swear).  I did however share my carbonara even though I didn't want to because it was very tasty ;).  The wine list didn't impress as much as other restaurants wine offerings and although it was a little on the expensive side it is a lovely restaurant.  I'm happy we were able to experience Brava but with such a happening Calgary restaurant scene I am not so sure we will return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have read rave reviews about BB and decided to go and see for myself last night.  After all it is only about 10 blocks from my home and I don't mind driving if I know I can at least walk home if I do get stuck in the snow.  You need to make reservations online or on a voice mail before you come here; otherwise you do not actually get a human voice to book one for you.  This was a little frustrating but luckily when we arrived they did have a couple of tables for two available for us, as the place was really jam packed tonight.    There was tons of festive energy, attractive and interesting people to see at this restaurant. Plus BB has nice, big floor to ceiling windows that look onto a blue lit Christmas tree and the pulse of 17th Ave outside.  Hostess was in fine form this evening, and our jackets were taken hospitality at the door for us.  Our waitress this evening, Jenna was very funny, charming and accommodating as our server.   The menu is a lot more reasonable in price than I had expected.  And I started off the evening with a very strong Mojito at $7.50 and ordered the lobster poutine for my friend and I as recommended by other yelpers.  I had heard rave reviews about this poutine, French fries, chunks of lobster, shellfish buttered sauce and mascarpone cheese. But tonight the butter was not melted properly and what I thought was a chunk of lobster was actually a spoon of butter. Not too thrilled about the poutine, there really weren't that many pieces of lobster and I expected a bit more for the $16, but we still had our entrees to look forward to.  My friend had the Lebanese chopped salad with pine nuts, parsley, mint and feta cheese and I had the shrimp pasta with olives and spinach and goat cheese.  We liked both of our plates and we were just about to order desert when another client in the restaurant joined our table.  He asked where the bathroom was and there was a huge sign above my friend's head that said \"washrooms\" so we both knew we were being fed a line.  He was entertaining for a short time but kind of overstayed his welcome when he started showing us some buttock clenching exercises. The waitress was a dear and practically saved us from our new guest, nonetheless the meal was if anything an entertaining one.    I enjoyed my meal at BB, the prices were reasonable, the service was excellent and the ambiance was interesting to say the least."}
{"text":"pretty tasty in Calgary.  I got the Lebanese salad, beef tenderloin (amazing, melts i your mouth).  Cute place with yummy food and great service."}
{"text":"Ahhh, my holiday break was full of so much FOOD! My boyfriend & I celebrated my birthday here last week. We walked past the restaurant a few months prior and I wondered how I had never noticed such a gem! The menu looked great and after reading the reviews, I was sold. Our table was located next to the door, which made for a slightly chilly and uncomfortable meal. We weren't going to let it bother us though, and got right to ordering. Our server was friendly but forgettable. We started with the Lobster Poutine of course, as I had to see what the hype was about. It was definitely delicious but I was left underwhelmed. There was hardly any lobster or sauce for the fries, which was disappointing. My boyfriend had the mussels and they were excellent. Our mains were Beef Tenderloin and the Elk Loin, both were wonderful! We also shared the Creme Brulee for dessert. It was pretty pricey for the portions, but the ambiance was wonderful and the food tasted really good. I will probably return for another special occasion, as it's a little expensive for everyday dining."}
{"text":"When four people head out for dinner, it's inevitable that three of them may have a four star experience and one of them comes out feeling like their visit was a three star. I'm the \"one of them\" in this story, or rather in this short anecdote.  A reso was made for 3 people during Yelp Eats for 730pm. All was well there! We arrived to a table already set and waiting for us. We added an extra person last minute and the staff had another place setting added to the table. Service level remained at a 4 star the rest of the evening. We were seated at a table on the east side of the restaurant, near the front and with a nice view out onto the patio.   Here's where the 3 stars come in. To start I ordered the wedge iceberg salad. A wedge salad? It sounded intriguing. And it certainly looked intriguing! But once I dug in, it was literally a wedge of iceberg lettuce served with dressing and some garnish on the side. Order the lobster gnocchi or the scallops instead.  In between our starters and our entrees, there was a long wait. And by long I mean 30-40 minutes, probably closer to 40. Brava wasn't overly busy. Not sure what happened there, but it was too long and we had to ask about our food. Minutes later, my prawn penne appeared in front of me. Hooray for food! But not hooray for the prawn penne. The sauce was good, but the noodles were overcooked, it was almost like I had made them at home. It's true, I over boil my noodles all the time, it's usually why I order pasta in fancier restaurants instead.   At any rate, Brava's still a go-to, I just know what I won't be ordering next time."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I dislike this place...must be a first! After all the rave about the lobster poutine and the oohs and ahhs... I decided to give this place a try.  My boyfriend asked me where I wanted to go to celebrate and after reading reviews I chose Brava Bistro.   We made reservations a few days prior but could only get in at a later time (8:45pm) No biggy cuz we had plans before that but we were going with empty stomaches that wanted to be filled up!  Right when we arrived there was no host standing in the front so I had to walk into the dinning area to get noticed.  When we finally got noticed we told her about our reservation and got sat in the middle of two obnoxiously loud tables.  It took our waitress a while to greet us, and by the time she came we knew what we wanted.   First, we order drinks... Spence ordered a hard lemonade (which was good) and I just went with water. Then we ordered the lobster poutine to start.. it was meh, I expected it to be spectacular because all the reviews etc. It was warm, tasteless and watery.. seems like it sat under a heat lamp for a while cuz it was a mistake.  For our main, I ordered the beef tenderloin and Spence got the crispy chicken.  When my beef arrived I was wondering where the rest of it was? It was okay, a very small portion of mushrooms, onions, peas and even the beef was gone in a few bites!  The crispy chicken was ok, could have made that at home..   All in all, this place is really nothing to rave about.  We couldn't/didn't enjoy our dinner because the place was SO LOUD! We honestly seemed like the only normal people there. This place seems like it's for uptight crowds who think they're all hot shots. This place left us still hungry and we had wished we had gone down the street to buon giorno!!  I will not be dining here again! Definitely not worth our money!!"}
{"text":"Quality menu, great food, friendly but professional service. Relaxed ambiance withies upmarket crowd."}
{"text":"Brava was a pretty cool little bistro. I came here for a UYE and I came for the famous lobster poutine!   And did the lobster poutine deliver? in short YES, it was great! really unique and a ton of flavor. At first when it arrived I saw that their was only  a tiny bit of actual lobster meat in the dish ( not surprising) but as I started to delve into the dish I got a fry soaked in sauce and OH MY! I got it! its the sauce, the only way I can describe it is: like a high end buttered popcorn with essence of seafood flavour in it hahaha, how is that for an explanation? It was amazing! Really, really good, and I will go back some day to eat it all over again! It just has a depth of flavor and is mysteriously delicious, it has something in it you can't quite put you finger on.  I also got a lamb burger which was pretty decent, though I don't think I would get it again. I actually wanna go back and try this lamb pasta that the lady sitting beside me ordered. It looked great and she said it was really good as well!  So Brava is on my ever growing list of places to come back to!   The dessert was awesome as well, warm ginger cake! My buddy Andy thought it was a little to gingery, but I loved it. It tasted like christmas! and it was sitting in a caramel soup and topped with ice cream!  The service was fine (for our end of the extra long table) The waiters and waitresses were attentive but I heard other people down the line had some mixups and some mistakes happen.  Brava has been open for 12 years! so they must be doing a lot of things right, from everything I experienced I give this place a solid 4 stars. Check it!"}
{"text":"Out for dinner with friends, comfortable , good background music, good service. Wine list outstanding, never seen one on an I pod at the table... Very cool you can read all about the wine and compare selections, very cool. Appetizers were great rich and tasty , lobster gnocchi , lobster poutine, pear salad all enjoyed. Mains of salmon, braised  rib and the duck special all very good. No desert but did have more wine :) all around very pleasant ."}
{"text":"Everything we had was ok.     Probably the best thing I tasted was the flat bread pizza and chocolate brownie sundae.  The pasta, short ribs and vegetables tasted bland and cheap.   The service was also very slow for drinks. The food came out shockingly fast which scared us all too, mainly because we were still waiting on drinks.   I give it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!! I have seen several reviews about Brava Bistro and although I was a little worried that it was over hyped...it did not disappoint. We started off with the muscles and they were incredible! I was using my muscle shell to slurp up some of the broth that it came with (classy!). Hahaha...on top of that, the fries that accompanied the muscles had a touch of aoili and anyone who knows me, knows that biggest vice is my addiction to fries.   For my entree, I had the braised short rib and the meat was soo tender, i could cut it with my fork! Naturally, because the food was so good, it was not even an option to skip dessert either. It goes without saying that I was ridiculously full after this meal (thanks evie!).  Mellow atmosphere and surprisingly bigger inside than what you would think. Seems like the perfect spot for my next birthdayparty. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We have been meaning to eat here forever and finally got a chance on Saturday night. We had a reservation and walked in and was kind of surprised with the layout of the restaurant. We had to stand there for a good 5 minutes until a waiter came by to help us. There is no hostess desk at the front so it is a little awkward standing there waiting as tables are being served in front of you. We were seated and ordered drinks. I was kind of bummed they didn't serve any type of Pinot Grigio by the glass but they had something similar in their white wines from Italy. Okay...so our server. He was an experience. He seemed to have such attitude towards us, I have no idea why. We ordered the burrata & tomato salad $15 & daily soup to start $7. My fiancé loved the soup, some sort of a puree carrot soup. The burrata wasn't very soft, it was more granular, I have had better. We ordered 2 sides (sautéed mushrooms and steamed spinach, they don't have mushrooms on the menu but our server said he could have them made). My fiancé ordered the orecchiette alfredo $19 and said it was yummy. I ordered chef's salad and substituted the ham and egg for avocado and broccoli and dressing on the side.  So we waited for a while for our food, asked for bread as well, everyone else seemed to be getting served bread, but we had to ask after our appetizers came. Then my fiancé pasta comes and my salad. My salad has meat and dressing on it, so I ask if they can remake it. He takes it away and were left with one slice of bread left and my fiancé pasta. Considering how long all this already took, we weren't surprised to wait a while for my salad to me re-made. The server offered to put my fiance pasta under the heat lamp, he said that's ok. So we ordered another round of drinks and I asked him if the sides were ready. He looked at me and made some puffing noise and turned around. I was PISSED! So I was like excuse me? are they? and he said umm I need to go check on them. He forgot to order them. Finally the re-made salad comes out and the 2 sides. The salad is really small, wish it was bigger, the mushrooms and spinach was really good though. Ordered another round of drinks and no dessert. The waiter was really odd/angry the full time and I think if he had a better attitude we would have liked the place much better. I am surprised this place is one of Calgary's top 10 restaurants.  Oh, and when we were given the bill the server says, don't worry about the sides, I took those off (a full $10! lol). So my fiancé pays and we leave and he gives me the bill to keep (I am anal and keep my bills to match with our credit card statement) and notice that in his hurry and anger he forgot to charge for 2 of my 3 glasses of wine, 1 of the 3 beers for my fiancé, and my salad. I guess that was the good thing about the whole experience lol..."}
{"text":"The right rating for this place is 3.5 stars.... The service is ok.... Probably a 3 stars service.... The food was good.. Not too bad, but nothing special... The wine was good enough... The best of the menu was the bread.. It was delicious!,.. Only for the bread I will give 4 stars to this place... Plus the ambience was cool too.. I might go back, but is not one of my favorite places in Calgary..."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with an eclectic feel.  The food prices are reasonable.  The wine list usually offers different wines from smaller producers, ask for value/price recommendations.  The french inspired fusion menu is small but appropriately diversified.   The lobster gnocchi mentioned by a few members already is really, really good.  I've been several times and will return."}
{"text":"I don't really know what type of food to classify Brava Bistro under but I know I will surely be back to try some other dishes on their menu.  The lobster poutine was definitely the bees knees!!!!! Its nicely cut fries with marscopone cheese, lightly drenched in shellfish butter sauce topped with little pieces of lobster was just the ticket to end a weekend of fine dining.  It automatically soared to the top of my list of favourite fried food appeys!!  The main I had was the lamb burger with feta cheese and tzatziki sauce.  Though it was quite delectable it was inevitably overshadowed by the heavenly lobster poutine.  oh god...I'm going to be thinking about that dish for the next couple of weeks.....(if anyone knows the recipe for the sauce you have to let me know!!!!)  For dessert , if you are a dark chocolate lover than the chocolate pot de creme is right up your alley!  simply pure dark chocolate moose topped with whip creme and a cookie..it had me weary after a couple bites it was that chocolaty.  I'm no expert on decor but I would say this place is quite romantical (whaaaa! romantical isn't a word!...what do you know Spell Check?!) and the service was very pleasant and attentive. I would definitely classify it as a quality date place...so ladies form a queue!...actually don't cause I don;t think my wallet is fat enough! lol.    oh side note....it was great meeting some of you yelpers on Saturday...Excuse my seemingly tepid demeanor I was just trying to take it all in!  I think years and years of video games have dulled my senses lol.  Praise all thy that is edible!!!!"}
