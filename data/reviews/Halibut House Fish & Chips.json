{"text":"Just left halibut house. One serious warning: do not go there with hungry tummy. And absolutely do NOT go there on Good Friday. We arrived at 5- got seated right away. Good sign, right? No. We sat, ordered right away. Then wait. And wait. And wait. And wait some more. I mean, how long does it take to fry some fish and chips? After over 1 hour, one order of cod & chips arrived. Then wait some more. Another 20 minutes, and after the first plate almost finished, my house special plate finally arrived. Yes, it took 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 house special. The waitress was apologetic - but they couldn't make the food came any faster. The food itself? Good fresh fries, mediocre cod, good halibut and scallop. Ok shrimp. Frozen stuff onion ring. But definitely, not worth the wait!!!  On the bright side, we were not the only angry customers. Practically the whole restaurant was full with furious customers, sit down and take out. The table behind us got there before us and didn't get their food until after we finished. That's how bad it was!!!"}
{"text":"mushy peas was juicy and tasty, which also could barely be found at other fish & chips places in GTA, truly recommend to English traditional dishes lovers..  Fish meat was skinless boneless fresh, wrapped with a properly fried flour, chips were good too. Waitress was genuinely friendly, she made us felt that besides good food, we got excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my wife to try this place out. We looked through the menu and decided on a menu choice. When we asked the waitress to exchange fries for onion rings without a second thought she just said \"NO\". Being a little confused I asked why? She said because onion rings are $4 more. The annoying part is they are the same price on the menu. Extremely annoying when a waiter/waitress doesn't accommodate a customer. So I decided no to order anything. On a positive note the food looks good but they need to train their staff a little better."}
{"text":"Crispy fries and decent sized portion of fish. I would say good value for your money and good to excellent taste. Service is friendly and efficient...always a good thing when you leave a restaurant in a good mood."}
{"text":"Place is clean, order was done fast.. Taste of buttered halibut and chips so-so..."}
{"text":"Since the new owners this place has gone down hill. The service was horriable.  We ordered the halibut meal and wanted  to substitute the fries with onion rings but was told that is \"not possible\" and that we would have to order a side of onions rings which is $4.50. Pervious owners allowed to substitute for $1.50. We ordered our meals noticed that the portion sizes where almost cut in half. Please keep in mind the meals are $16.95 for one piece of fish with fries and salad that was drenched in dressing and soggy. The fish and fries were so oily you can squeeze the oil out with your fingers. That is all we heard from her. Didn't check in once, even though we are with our 20 month year old daughter.They ran out of the kids size portion of the halibut, so we forced to order the lunch size portion that was more, the owner didn't even have the courtesy to match the pice even though the price difference was $1.00. I receive my bill and and was charged a extra dollar for my daughters meal, I asked the owner to make the changes because our waitress disappered. She was busy refilling the ketchup bottles with older ketchup bottles from other tables. The owner explained that she added the soft drink charge to my daughters meal and didn't charge me the extra fifty cents. She continued to go off saying that if you want to pay the extra fifty cents you can. Please note that the owner is yelling this in a full store with customers over fifty cents. We will take our business somewhere were the customers are appercaite and the waitress are friendly and not busy reusing old ketchup in and placing them back on the tables."}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant a few times mostly for their eggs breakfast and a couple of times for their halibut fish and chips which was ok, decent portion size. I went there again with a friend just a few weeks and was I disappointed with the halibut. It was half the size and when I asked the server answered so quickly as if expected because I did not even finish my sentence. The server said \" that is the lunch portion\". This leads me to believe that there must have been complaints. Also the increase in price, no soup and it did not taste good either. The server must be new also. When we first sat down at the table which had some food crumbs, the server when wiping the table,  swept the food crumbs towards where my friend sat, onto his lap. She did not even realize it... very unprofessional. Because of the server's unprofessionalism coupled with the restaurant's \"rip-off\" very small portion and not so good halibut fish, I am not so sure about the other dishes that I used to order before so I don't think I shall return to this restaurant again and therefore my rating for this restaurant is \"poor\"."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Great service.  Great food I will be back sometime for dinner. Today I was super hungry so I ordered the Grand Slam, they let me change a couple of thing in the order which was great,I'm not a fan of breakfast sauages so ask to change to bacon. I was very surprised that they served fresh fruit with my order that was a bonus."}
{"text":"We just came here on an afternoon for dinner and I was amazed by the quality of food and service. The fish were not too breaded and very nicely cooked. The fries were large and nicely done. The service was fast, and friendly l. The portions were good size with reasonable price. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some nice fish and chips."}
{"text":"Even after several years in business they still deliver a good tasting and not overly greasy fish 'n chips.  Pricing has stayed very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Went there for take out - waited 20 minutes and then the manageress said the two cooks would not tell her what the delay was. I asked for a refund and she had no idea how to process a debit card refund so I had cash. This place is terrible, avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Was out for a glorious day ride on my bike with my beautiful wife when we were stuck with impending starvation , just then we stumbled upon this amazing little gem . As luck would have it our waitress Molly was on her first day ever and was amazing  ,we ordered the fish chowder and halibut plate for two , everything tastes amazing and was cooked to perfection! I'm impressed we have tried so many horrible places all over Toronto and Mississauga area and to find a gem like this ... Well makes me so happy we're keeping this one in our must go places! There should be more places like this with more people like this to go to in our great city and suburbs ."}
{"text":"I always go here for the lunch special. It's not super filling (sometimes I get two fishes with fries instead), but for the price, it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"I tried this new place & had reservations because it had mixed reviews from town people. So I went on a Friday for lunch I just managed to get a booth. The place was crowded & chaotic. The server came quickly & my table ordered all halibut n chips. The place is in an older part of town & is very dated(greasy spoon looking). The food arrived & I dove in. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Batter had a nice flavour & fries were crisp on outside & soft inside. I will definitely go back but take-out. They have an organized chaos system but as long as the fish n chips are good I can overlook that. They do need to clean the windows & booths a little more often like Stanley's fish n chips. A footnote always ask for can of pop vs the fountain which taste stale."}
{"text":"I asked if they were new owners and they said they were. I had the grilled halibut with side salad - over $13 for a small thin piece of fish, overcooked and dried out. The salad was limp and soggy. Disgusting. The restaurant was freezing cold.  While there, someone came in wanting an order to take out. The server said it was $2 more to take out, so he decided to eat there. I think it's stupid to charge more for take out especially if your heat is turned off (which is what the server told me when I asked why it was so cold)."}
{"text":"This is my second trip here, first time for dinner, it was tasty and I ate everything on my plate, today I went for breakfast it really hit the spot. I can't wait till I go back"}
{"text":"What looks like a typical diner would lead you to believe the food is just as average as the decor.  Not likely.  I ordered the seafood platter, with a large filet of haddock, 3 scallops and 3 shrimp, all breaded in the traditional way.  I half expected the shrimp to be dry and overdone and greasy, but they were succulent, with a crispy batter, and perfectly cooked.    But I knew the scallops would disappoint because deep fried breaded scallops always disappoint.  I was disappointed--these scallops were succulent, with a crispy batter, and perfectly cooked!  The haddock was also succulent, you know...  But the crispness of the batter was a real treat!  The worst part of this meal?  Solar latex tarter sauce in the little packets.  This place could rock out a real tarter sauce without blinking!  Please chef, I'll be back soon, and I want to see homemade tarter sauce.  If not, I would bring my own just to compliment the excellent fish!"}
{"text":"Have driven by this place several times and finally one day decided to pop in for a dinner nosh. Interior of the restaurant is as one would expect. Money wasn't obviously spent on decor, but I'm not there to eat the tables/chairs or artwork, so that's not too important. We were seated immediately (the place is very large with plenty of seating). Our waitress was over immediately with menus and asked if we wanted anything to drink. Ordered two pops and off she went. When she returned with them we placed our order....2 orders of Halibut and chips, halibut lightly battered. Off she went to place the order. Within a very reasonable time frame, she returned with our order. HUGE portion of chips (3/4 of the plate were covered with them) and the halibut was indeed lightly battered. It was a decent size for the price point. Added bonus was a small vinegar coleslaw (not creamy).  Fish was cooked perfectly.....nicely seasoned and flaky. It was a bit on the greasy side, but still delicious. Fries were excellent, coleslaw was a nice accompaniment.all in all, a great place for fish and chips. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Good food , staff and service. Fish and chips and good. Onion rings are a little on the oily side though. I would go back and recommend it to others. Good atmosphere and kid friendly! Amazing daily deals until 3:00 PM. Reasonable prices to."}
{"text":"The fish and chips come in a large portion of deep fried, crispy goodness..if you can look past the dated decor and slow service (which was hard for me as I am very anxious).  Up in Aurora, I felt like I was out of town and away from the hustle and bustle of a big city.. the staff were working at their own pace...only one server on the floor to serve a handful of tables.. yet we had to wait a good 10 minutes to receive our menus...and another 10 to order.  I would probably come back for takeout in the future but skip on dining in.  One tip: Do not use the little plastic packets of tartar sauce..it is no good! Use the homemade one provided by the server..it is much more delicious."}
{"text":"The fish is chips is always tasty and a good deal. Crispy & light. Lately I've been getting the grilled halibut with salad to be more health conscious. It's very tasty as well. Good, consistent service every time we come here. The servers are friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had the grilled Halibut.  The halibut was not seasoned at all and was simply grilled.  The piece of halibut I had was maybe 80 grams cooked.  The salad that came with my fish was good but for $13.00, I found the portion size weak.  I definitely would not go back.  I think if you are looking for a place to eat deep fried fish and fries it's probably fine but not if you are looking to eat something on the healthy side."}
{"text":"Fish and chips dive that serves nice semi-oily battered fish and fries.  Good portion sizes and the seafood platter tastes quite good.  I'd go again if I'm around the Aurora area.  Server was very friendly and kept checking back to see if we were ok.   There's a seniors home nearby, just like any other fish and chips place - isn't there always?"}
{"text":"What a cool place! I never really liked diners, but this is a diner that cooks halibut, and cooks it to perfection, and i think it is around $10 for a piece. Do I need to say more? I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This was my second time to the place one one opening week and here a year later nothing has changed.  The fish was very light and crispy,  but the Chips on the other hand were stale and starchy.   The price was average for fish and chips."}
{"text":"I got the halibut and chips. The halibut tastes fishy, which it should not, it was overcooked, dry and very chewy. The batter was also not very good. It was not fluffy, was more like a coating and not at all crispy. Also more expensive then other fish n chip places I've been to. I gave the rest to my dog.  The chips? Not bad! Only thing they got going for them.  Will never visit again and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. Generous portions. I hag the 2 pieces of haddock and chips. I didn't need 2 pieces, I ate them but i didn't need them."}
{"text":"Driving through my home town, I noticed a large new restaurant called the Halibut House right at Yonge and Edward.  I love some good fish and chips... so brought the entire family there on Saturday night.   We arrived just before 6pm... so were a little surprised when we found most of the restaurant unoccupied.  (well.. new business and all).   The kids each had an order of kids fish and chips... a nice peice of halibut with kids size portion of fries.  The kids loved it (such is normally true for anything fried or that has breading).   I ordered a big combo with halibut, shrimps, scallops, fries and salad.  My wife just got the breaded shrimp with fries.   The portions were big... quality was sort of in the middle.  I've definitely had better fish and chips... but there was nothing wrong here either.   This is definitely fast food fish and chips.  Staff were very nice and friendly.  The physical restaurant is sort of hard to explain... it reminds me of a diner that I used to go to in cottage country.,. almost like a cafeteria.   The price tag for the four us was just over 50 bucks... seems a little up there for fast food.  But fish and chips is never cheap in my experience.   I wouldn't likely go back with the whole family.   BUT something caught my eye... Tuesday nights... AYCE Fish and Chips for under 11 dollars.  Wait.. What?   NOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL.  So, I will be coming back on a Tuesday night for the AYCE festivities.  You can't beat 11 bucks for what will likely be 5 or 6 peices of fish by the time I am done, plus a mountain of fries.    Stay tuned for the results of the AYCE night..."}
