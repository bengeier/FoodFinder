{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've found in Buckeye.  It's clean, service is prompt, the food was tasty. 

Parking is always available.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I am completely surprised by the previous comment made by Evan B. I have visited this location every weekend since its opening because the restaurant came highly recommended by many of my friends and family that are locals at old  town buckeye. Instead of Ranchero's having a negative impact into the community it adds to its already great culture. FRANK IS EVEN THERE EVERY WEEK!!! That has to mean for something. I myself come from an American/Mexican background and the food, service, and cleanliness was at it upmost BEST. Uncomparable to any major dine in restaurant because of its home-body feel and authentic structure. Always treated with smiles, from when you walk in and greeted at the door, to when you receive your plate, to when you leave for your day. Ranchero's Rodeo Restaurant is where I go to receive great customer service and great tasting food on a weekly basis. I live in Phoenix, but let me tell you it is worth the drive. Thank you Ranchero's!!!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a \"local\" vs a \"chain\" restaurant breakfast while visiting my kids in the area. While driving through town this place caught my eye. I was very pleased with my meal, as well as the service. I had an omelette, bacon, hash browns, and toast. It came out quickly, warm, and as ordered. Very tasty. The coffee and juice were very good too. I'm looking forward to coming back again for the Mexican scramble."}
{"text":"Work has me living in Buckeye for a few months and always looking for a place to eat that has great food, service, and moderate prices. Ranchero's Rodeo is the place to eat from breakfast (American or Mexican), lunch, and dinner.  I've never been disappointed.  The food is always fresh and not greasy. All homemade. Their caldo is the best from Menudo, Caldo De Rez, and Albondiga. Service has always been awesome. Cindy I believe is the person running the restaurant,  seems like she is always here to make sure every person that comes is treated as their best client they have. Still working my way through the menu and looking forward to satisfying food."}
{"text":"9.27 for three small power and medium Dr Pepper and medium lemonade . My mom saw the price for 3 tacos was 7.99 so I payed for the drinks"}
{"text":"I have breakfast here like every week and I love it! My love and I have the amazing burros, grits and strawberry whipped waffles! Mumm!!!! The iced tea and coffee are awesome!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible. You sit at a table and you don't get acknowledge because their busy with other things and try to ignore that you've been sitting there for 15 min.
They'll clean tables and thaaaaan they decide to come and take your order. 
Horrible horrible service always.! 
Foods great tho."}
{"text":"Great variety of food at a great value. Breakfast, lunch, and Mexican foods available. Hours of operation are limited during the week but they are open until 8 pm Thursday - Saturday. One of our favorite little places to eat!"}
{"text":"So i got to say a 5 star for sure !! We were looking for some breakfast burritos and this was the place we selected after viewing a couple of reviews on others near by. We are from cali and i can say best breakfast burritos !!!! Love love !!! And i am not the type to write reviews !!! But it was a must for this place."}
{"text":"Was our fist time here, we ordered to go, I got the breakfast burrito (bacon, add sausage) wife got the chilaquiles both were awesome!! We have been in buckeye for 5 months now and have not found a good Mexican restaurant.  This is it! We are definitely looking forward to trying this place again. Side note, the place seemed very clean, and the people seemed friendly.  Also(for breakfast burrito) you may want to ask for crispy bacon otherwise it may be a little chewy but that is personal preference and I don't fault the restaurant, I forgot to tell them :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous. Very generous portions. Home fries served in a little deep fry basket, biscuit was delicious.  Definitely  a place to return to."}
{"text":"Sorry to say the last three times I have been there the breakfast was not any good. 
I think they are slipping badly I can not refer this place to anyone anymore
I think they are catering to Hickman eegs to much and not the customers in the dinning room. Something must be keeping them open it can't be the food they serve that's too bad because it was good at one time.
I stopped going for a while hoping it would get better but it has not."}
{"text":"Excellent food/ we had the Mexican enchiladas and huevos rancheros.  The hue is had an orange chilie sauce with peppers and onions in it that was awesome.  The home made tortillas are thin and large and, of course, awesome!  Plus we both ate for $16.  Highly recommend.  Has a small town atmosphere.  Not fancy but clean restroom and cute little booths."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Was pleasantly surprised that they serve breakfast all day long. The decor is a little dated, but the service and the food make up for it. This was our first time here and we will be back with our girls. I had the Huevos Rancheros and my hubby had the Huevos Divorciados. I sampled both and they were both great. I also liked how they brought out chips and salsa before we even ordered. Just a cautionary notice the salsa has some heat to it. We finished off our visit with ordering some churros to go. So glad we found this local restaurant in Buckeye, we will be back."}
{"text":"It is sad when you go to a Mexican restaurant and because of the lack of choices you have to order a hamburger. i ordered the spanish burger which is a green chile burger. i asked for jalapenos on top of it also and got just jalapenos on it. no flavor at all the service was fine the server did good but all in all the food just was not all that. its hard for me to say this but id rather eat at taco bell. anyone who gives this place a good review has to be a personal friend of the owners"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a homemade meal then you're at the right place!  Customer service is great and not to mention their customers such as Bruce.  He has some great stories!"}
