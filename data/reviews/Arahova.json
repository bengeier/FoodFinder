{"text":"We went there with our family,

cons:
-server was not friendly and did not treat us well. we wanted extra napkins,she said its on the table which was not.extra napkins does not heart if 10people dinning.
we ordered Pepsi she brings 7up.
we decided her service she only deserved 10% tip and not 15% she literally asks us to pay 15%because she pays tax,..,..blabla.out of compassion we did pay.

-food was so so.nothing special. small pieces in big plates.

pro:
-close to my location
-plenty of empty tables."}
{"text":"The positives: the chicken pita and fries were great
The negatives: the tables, chairs and ledge next to the window were disgustingly dirty
The host was too into the game to seat us. \"Pick a booth\" my family and I were told.
The waitress forgot my drink and got the kids' drinks wrong.

2 stars is generous. Other Arahovas were better."}

   No, seriously. I called them a bunch of lying douche bags, gave it a while, then my craving for dirty Greek food hit me like a ton of bricks and I called...

...and we talked.

    And sure enough, they honoured the fifteen percent and have been on a number of orders since. Hell, the even know me as the 15% guy now, good customer retention....finally.

  I chalk it up to yelping. If I hadn't of bitched about the injustice then it never would have been noticed and they would have continued their 'questionable policies' but when the call from corporate came about how they are tarnishing the Arahova name...a change was made

   Yelp is the boom shit.

   And no crooked bastard is safe.
