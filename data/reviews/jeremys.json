{"text":"Love this restaurant. Lovely friendly service, fantastic food and great wine menu. Could not record enough!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now, and on each occasion the food has been some of the best we've had anywhere, at any price.


 The hard surfaces of the decor mean there's a little more noise around the room than I'd like, but to be fair, some of that noise comes from our table - we can be a bit enthusiastic!


 It's a good place to relax with friends who appreciate very good food. Service, when it arrives, is stylish, friendly and professional - it might take a bit longer to reach you some nights when they're busy, though. If you're prepared for this possibility it should make the wait less stressful!


 Jeremy's food and atmosphere has the elan of a fine-dining emporium, but with an unstuffy approach that makes it a local favourite you can turn up to in 'smart casual' and yes, that includes jeans!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot. Stumbled across this on a recent visit to Scarborough. Great food and service"}
