{"text":"I was there a few weeks ago and Gina delivered such great customer service! She was very friendly and had a smile the whole time! Thanks Gina!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to neighborhood bar, not the closest to me 3+miles but I can count on a friendly welcome from the awesome bar tenders. I only come every coupple of weeks but they make me feel like an everyday regular. No this is no dive bar it is a great neighborhood bar, clean and friendly with decent bar food and I am not bombarded by loud sports but insted a good jukebox. This is not to say there isn't sports on but the sound is generally low or off ( oh thank you so much) for us not into sports at all times and allows for good company. There is also live music (not my thing) which can be fun. The owner is geneally arround and will give you a friendly hard time as he did to me the first time I was there, and I truly felt welcome. I also just wanted to give a shout out to the best bartenders in town I do not remember there names but you know who you are (crazy currly black hair) and the rest of the crew. Thanks so much for what I feel is a community service, the neighborhood bar a dying breed."}
{"text":"6 of us walked in from Barrett Jackson and the service to food has been amazing!! True Story!!"}
{"text":"It was close to my new house, so I thought I'd stop in. It feels like a really good neighborhood bar. The bartender, Michelle, was amazing. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I dont write many reviews but certain places like this deserve a shout out. Clean.  Great food. Smooth drinks. Very laid back owner Doug. Karaoke Thursday.  Honestly. ..best place in south Scottsdale to drink and be merry."}
{"text":"Friends recently moved near the El Dorado Bar & Grill so we've been twice, so far.  This is a great place!  We were greeted by the owner when we walked in and all of the staff were equally as friendly.  The Saturday night band was great - they played a nice selection of music.  We haven't tried the food yet, but hear it's very good.  My only complaint is that this bar is not in MY neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great people !
The band on Friday and Saturday nights is great 
Breakfast and bloody marry on the weekends !!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you are looking for in a local neighborhood bar!  It seems that it was recently renovated and it looks nice without being pretentious.  The food was tasty, came out hot and quick.  Staff was really friendly and the regulars (it was that feeling.  Like folks are there a lot and enjoy coming back) were chatty.  The owner came by to check on us after we ate, and see how we were and if we liked our lunch.  I like that!  I had wings and this NY girl can be picky about her wingage!  Served with blue cheese and they were yummy.  Prices were great and big TV's all over the place to watch the game.  There is a ton of live music on the calendar and I'm thinking that's a great reason to go back... Blues Jam!!!  If you've never been, or it's been a while I would say check this place out!"}
{"text":"Doug and Joy Bracken did it again.. Turned a struggling bar & grill into something substantial and rememberable. 

Try the Friday Fish & Chips, best I've had outside of the U.K... Served with tarter and traditional vinegar. Yum.. No, it's awesome.

Bartenders are personable and genuine. Nice to see owners that truly care about their customers and business.

You'll like this place, I assure you."}
{"text":"If you're not careful, you could drive right past Eldorado and miss out on a really nice hidden gem. I once would have probably placed this bar and grill in the dive bar category, but thanks to some \"sprucing up\" that the owners have accomplished, I wouldn't classify it as such now. But what it has become is actually a good venue for live music - especially on Wednesday evening when they host a blues jam. The musicians are mostly \"older\" artists who have been in the industry for decades and all come together to share their talents on stage for the live jam.
I did mention this is a bar and grill, right? Well the grill has also improved in recent years and the food is sure to satisfy your tummy, as they have a decent menu, and the food is well prepared and comes out promptly.  
We have always received good service from the attentive staff, so you won't find yourself sitting with an empty glass wondering if your server has been abducted by aliens. No, in fact I was about to finish my drink and before I could even think about reaching for my glass, my server gave me the \"are you ready\" look, and with a \"thumbs up\" from me, I had a fresh drink sitting in front of me, before I had even finished the last drink of my original glass.
So if you find yourself in South Scottsdale and need to wet your whistle, stop by. You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"First time here and the fish and chips were delish. Great value and good beer selection. Want to come back when there's music."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often, but I still miss the old El Dorado.  I enjoy all the food here, but I miss the way they used to make their fries when they had different owners.  They used to make them perfectly crispy and softer in the middle.  Now, they are done extra, extra crispy.  Some people like that, I suppose.  I miss Tammy, as well.  Tammy was my favorite bartender at The El Dorado.  She always provided above and beyond customer service.  The new servers are great, too.  Tammy was just my favorite.  What happened to Tammy?  :(  Overall, this place is great.  I can relax and enjoy a few drinks.  :)"}
{"text":"Great place to play pool and hang out awesome karaoke nights and ginger is a hoot! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great service! Awesome food!! Staff is over the top amazing! Duke, the bar owner is by far the best owner and a great person to know! My wife and I love coming to this place! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"This is an unofficial clamper watering hole and many clampers drink here.  A little bit to be desired on the food quality and taste but the service was outstanding.  Food specials are great in price but lack in quality.  Taco shells completely crumble on first bite (dry.old)."}
{"text":"Hubby and I recently moved into the neighborhood and are just a hop, skip and a jump from El Dorado.... been here a couple times already and last night we went to listen in on some live music.... love the food, on this visit we had appetizers and a drink and then later we both ordered sandwiches and have nice leftovers for today..... their patty melt is the best I've ever tasted and Jeff enjoyed his pork tenderloin sandwich.  The band started off with 3 or 4 guys and then it became a revolving stage as different people came and went ...... a really enjoyable R&B and Rock and Roll fusion jam session~!!!  Two of the guys we had seen the previous night performing at another local joint.... I told them we are now their groupies.... :)  The staff took great care of us, the crowd was nice and friendly.... definitely a place we will keep coming back to.... next up for us to try is their breakfast served 7 days a week~!!"}
{"text":"GREAT again!! Eldorado bar and grill.Been coming to this bar thru 4 or 5 \"new\" owners and for the past 10years.Whats always the same is the friendly attentive and all ways smiling staff.the day shift cook she is awsome.the bartender and servers  are professional warm and easy to be around.ive never had a bad lunch or negative experience at this business.Thank you for REMAINING the place I can  coy t on to feel better."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast!! Great friendly bartenders and staff! Awesome place."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood and a biker bar. The staff is friendly. The beer on draft is reasonable. I don't think they have a cover charge If a cover band plays because i come early enough.  Fun plays to hang and socialize!"}
{"text":"I took my buddy here for a good night out and we definitely got that! We walked into a \"50's plus meetup\" with live blues. Great people watching needless to say..."}
{"text":"Walked into the middle of a Karokee night on Friday night around 11pm. Just missed the kitchen, which closes at that time also. Clearly, a bar of regular older folks, bartenders know most people, as do the patrons. August specials were Bud Light bottles for $2.75 and some vodka drinks for 2 bucks. Some bikers there, enough TV's to probably watch a game at some point, but the crowd is not for everybody."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this dive.  Once again, I lived in this neighborhood, but I had a blast.  We used to come to this establishment with a huge lacrosse team full of dudes after games, and they would put up with all of our BS.  We would sing karaoke, act like idiots, and make fulls of ourselves.  21 year old athletes would be dancing with 50+ year old regulars of this dive.  This is a great spot to go when you have a group of friends that doesn't want to be seen.  A dive bar that isn't a Scottsdale \"dive\" bar (you know what I am talking about ahhhheeemmm Coach House).  It truly is a local watering hole.

If you are in the market for some food, this is not the establishment for you.  I am pretty sure that the pizza we ordered once was simply a tostinos frozen pizza that they had to run to the 7-11 next door to pick up.  Whatever.  I wasn't expecting much.

Cheap beer.  Great shots.  I think they even have a picture of us up on their website.  Very enjoyable.  I wish I was the first to review!!"}
{"text":"Owner greeted us upon arrival and even offered a free shot. Waitress was extremely friendly, there's a strong family vibe among the staff. Great bar for a conversation with friends, and the daily happy hour specials are a bonus (from open to 6pm)"}
{"text":"I like stumbling into neighborhood caves and this one doesn't disappoint. The fact that they have all the NFL games on each TV is well, a done deal. Came here to watch the Mets/Royals game and gotta love $2.50 pints on Taco Tuesday here. Food is typical bar food so set your expectations accordingly. Crowd is definitely not your run of the mill; eclectic to say the least but all friendly and serious pool sharks. There's a stage for the live music which I would come back to check out. Ginger is awesome as both the bartender who knows a good pour and the bouncer that will kick you out for not playing nice. It almost feels like you came home, kicked off your shoes and let the day close out."}
{"text":"Wanna grab a nice cold beer and watch a game or catch up with a friend? Need a spot that's not too crazy, but where you know the bartenders will be on point and have what you need? Head to this spot.  
The crowd will ALWAYS keep you guessing, as its very varied and not typical in any one way or another. There is private parking arond the business for both cars and bikes and the best part is I can walk here from my house! 
It took me a few years to actually go in and check it out; I am not certain what took me so dang long, but it was definitely my loss! I am glad my hubby finally suggested the place and we stopped in for a drink. 
The first thing that stood out was that the location as SPOTLESS. This always makes me happy. Everything was clean and well organized. The bartenders are friendly and funny. I really enjoyed meeting them and they have remembered me and my hubs each time we've gone in.  There is a lot of space and they have bands play and even a jazz night with open mic. They do serve food, typical bar food like burgers and wings.  We've tried the burgers and the quality of the meat is fantastic! I asked about it, since it was obviously not a food service patty that they used and the bartender let me know that they get thier ground beef from French's which is local butcher that is down the road! What a great idea and it makes for a wonderful burger. The wings were well seasoned and the sauce was yummy.  I asked for extra veggies and they brought them to me no problem! 
They also have pool tables, so I will have to return with some of my friends to this spot for some beer, a game and maybe some pool!"}
{"text":"Always great food and drink specials served by a very friendly staff! Karaoke with Emma on Thursday from 8-12 is amazing!"}
{"text":"Local dive/non-dive where you can find interesting people, decent food and fairly priced drinks. Music and other entertainment, and local sots mingling with millionaires. My kind of joint!

New find and now I'm a regular.

5 stars would send too many people here and it would go from crowded to overcrowded!"}
{"text":"Out of state Clamper, had to check bout the local redshirt watering hole.  Missed seeing any brethren but still had a great burger, couple of enormous beers and some good pool.   Quiet Monday night but sounds like it gets hopping in the weekends"}
{"text":"Had a burger while watching mnf. It was ok. Kinda dry. No bbq sauce no mayo just dry bun. Wouldn't cost them much to offer it. Staff was friendly. Went back in the morn. Heard the breakfast was good. I was. Really liked it. Could have been better with 2 sausage patties instead of one, or at least a decent sized one. The one they serve is the size of a McDonalds baby burger patty. Kinda lame. Won't be back for breakfast, tho. The server was not friendly. Kinda rude. Older gal with dyed dark hair. Musta been the owner or related to someone. Otherwise would have been let go long ago. The new owner should remember, ONLY HIRE FRIENDLY PEOPLE."}
{"text":"This is an odd rough and tumble hole in the wall bar. When I lived in walking distance, we probably came in probably 6 or 7 times. They've got your typical bar as the centerpiece with decent drink selections and standard bar food. It's nothing spectacular but there is always someone hanging out regardless the time of day. 

There's a small stage where I assume bands will come by to play. We randomly popped in during karaoke night and the place was quite lively. Customers are all shapes and sizes. The loud ones smoking outside the front door have interesting stories. Parking is strange as it sometimes flows across the street to the drive thru milk depot. I always see at least one Harley parked and sometimes over 20.

We had hoped it could become a go-to watering hole but it just wasn't our scene. Nothing wrong with that. It's a great place to grab a quick drink and catch the last part of a game. In the words of Garth Algar, \"they got a pool table too!\" - which they do."}
{"text":"First time here and we were a little hesitant at first. Our waiter was amazing. Since we had to wait a bit (about 30 minutes) for our food he comped our entire bill and refused to charge us even when we insisted. The food was also really good! Definitely will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place is as fun as you make it.  If you are looking for a relaxing place to get a fine glass of wine, then this is not your bar.  If you are looking for a place that will accomodate your group of 12 with reasonably priced drinks then come here.  When beers are on special, you can get a 32oz domestic for around 5 bucks.  There is karaoke just about every night of the week.  If you are nice to the bar tenders, they will be nice to you.  I will have to say, if it was just me and one other person, I would probably skip this place and go somewhere else.  But with a group, you can have a lot of friends here."}
{"text":"Most of the customers and a couple bartenders are cool people, the atmosphere is that of a bar -anywhere USA,  they use to have good bands but now they relay mainly on DJ's, the music is good but its hard to know anymore if it will be fun or dead, their drink prices are high as well as the beer prices and they serve food which surprisingly is well priced but the menu is small.

I give it a three mainly because of the customers and staff and when the place is jumping one can have a good time but like I previously said its hit and miss."}
{"text":"Please don't order anything from this bar aside from beer. I bought chips and salsa which was $6 (totally fine with that) but when asking for more chips...they will actually charge you $7 more than what they originally charge you for the salsa and cheese it comes with. I will honestly never go back to this bar...such a rip off. The staff wasn't even that attentive to fill our waters or beers. 

Love dive bars but this one should be avoided."}
{"text":"I like this place. Nice spot that's easy to walk to. They have a live band some nights, otherwise there is a music box you can select music from. Good drinks, super casual, friendly staff. 
I haven't had the food but it looked pretty good. 
I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This bar is hands down the best neighborhood bar I've ever been to. Not only does everyone warmly greet you when you walk in, but the atmosphere is incredible! I come here to see my favorite bartender Michelle and she is absolutely fantastic! If you go there try her Margaritas or White Russians they are fabulous! The food is incredible as well!  I get their Chicken Ceaser Salad  and their breakfast is so yummy! Doug and Joy were fantastic as owners and then now they have new owners Lynn and Duke and they are equally as incredible as the last! This place will always hold dear to my heart and the people who work here are just amazing!"}
{"text":"El Dorado is a hidden gem. Great food, great service and 32 oz. beers! They also always have sports on many of their TV's and it's a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great place to go anytime of day. Nice friendly staff and the owner, Doug is awesome! Good food and great  prices"}
{"text":"I have quit going to this bar,the prices are low and they have free bands on the weekends some quite good.Food okay.
 The super NEGATIVE and the reason I quit going and  will never go back is the clientele, you get the weirdest collection of off the wall people ,you get bikers,rednecks,fags,transients,druggies ,bottom feeders and COMPLETE NUT CASES .I think I met Charles Manson's brother in this bar,I mean this guy was SCARY he kept switching between religious fanaticism, intense hatred and to complete the package he sounded like a complete sexual deviate,this CREEP could very well end up on Forensic files as a serial killer.I know this may sound hilarious to some people but sadly I am NOT KIDDING AROUND, I wish I was kidding, this is first person I have talked to  that actually freaked me out.This not the owners fault,the problem is this bar sits very close to the freeway so you get an incredible amount of sicko TRANSIENTS floating in this place from God knows where.I have had several bad experiences in this place before but this last one was over the top !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure that I've updated my review since it became the new Do(e). 
I've only eaten here a couple of times since the switch and although simple, today's was delish. 
How can one mess up a BLT? Well, it is possible and that is not what happened here. As I took my first bite I couldn't help to think how incredibly delicious it was. I'm not sure how they did it but I didn't even have to ask for my bacon crisped, mmmm it was so good. Perhaps I'm warming back up to the place. Every time I'm in, the owner is very friendly the food has been devoured and the pup is allowed on the patio. All in all, it's still close to home. 
Thanks for the good breakie, I was needing it today :-)"}
{"text":"This place is a very popular neighborhood spot! I can see why. Everyone including the owner is very friendly and warm. The customers are nice and everyone treats each other like they are family. Pretty cool place. The food is good and customer service is awesome. They have live bands that play as well! Love this spot."}
{"text":"Updating review!
Seems new owners have taken over and revamped the place. It's a huge improvement and has become one of my favorite dives in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Always fun! Collin the bartender is the bomb.com. Genuine and professional. He pours great drinks and seems like he actually cares about his patrons. The karaoke dj was pretty awesome too. I've never seen a dj work the crowd so well and the crowd was extremely eclectic! Great job guys! I'm still yet to eat there but it's totes my neighborhood bar. :)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely as fun as you make it! One of my new favorite hole in the wall bars for a chill-axing Friday or Saturday night! They have okay food but may favorite experience is on Friday nights with Karaoke! So much fun and nobody there judges :) A good time for people who are down to earth and not - up-ity."}
{"text":"I checked out this place because it is within walking distance of my condo, and what a surprise it was! From the outside it looks shady but inside it is very well put together, plenty of tvs and great food. The staff was friendly and the owner talked to me about recently taking over and redoing the place. I want to try out their breakfast food some weekend and it seems like a great place to watch football on Sunday."}
{"text":"Well it was a good place until it changed hands.
 They used to cater to the over 50's crowd, but now do not want older employees or clientele and we were treated like a nuisance and even got an eye roll from one of the bar maids when all we did was ask for more ice in our drinks.
Who needs the attitude?  So we are done. 
We could have dealt with the food going  downhill   and the prices going up. But not the horrible treatment."}
{"text":"My husband and I are natives of Scottsdale not sure why we haven't made it to El Dorado before but we are really impressed.  The drinks are great, food is great and the staff is also great...I also really appreciate the cleanliness...this place is really a 5"}
{"text":"Been going to the Eldo for 14 years. The last owner, Doug B, was a great guy! Improved the bar 100%, yet he kept some of the old bartenders, which is cool, but they became less customer oriented and actually detached and basically rude. Now they have a new owner and I have had enough of their attitude and rudeness. I'm tired of their actions towrds good paying customers. They talk to someone and then mock them. So Lynn sorry, but your are not getting my business again. You have great new bartenders/night bartenders, but I'm not putting money into your or anyone else's pocket from your establishment again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love El Dorado Bar & Grill. This establishment was purchased approximately a year ago by a very hospitable & friendly gentleman, Doug, who is present & conversing with all of his customers every time I go to El Dorado Bar & Grill. In addition, Doug completely redecorated the entire bar & grill- inside & outside. I'm a RN, so cleanliness, especially of the restrooms is extremely important to me. The women's restroom is meticulously clean always. The food here is delicious...I especially love the Angus beef hamburgers & the onion rings. The chicken wings are fabulous & you get a nice plate of 6 for $3.00 until 6pm. The drinks are very reasonable & not watered down at all. If you sit @ the bar, you'll get to know the extremely friendly & accommodating staff on a 1st name basis. I read a few comments below that were less than stellar. This bar & grill is not, nor does it look like it's \"shady\" or a \"dive\" whatsoever. I love El Dorado Bar & Grill & the friendly atmosphere. If you ever would have any concerns, Doug, the owner, is right there, talking with his customers, & he would do anything to make any issue satisfactory for any of his patrons."}
{"text":"Foods good...fries are great! Beer is always cold. Employees are friendly. Tammy is great! Liked 2 bands I've seen there...Vintage Rocket & Tender Loving Fools....both play different styles of music but both are great!"}
{"text":"Great food & great prices! Try the Green Chili burrito! Make sure you go there when Ginger is working she is amazing"}
{"text":"Really more like 3 stars, but 1) This is the closest bar to my house so that's gotta count for a little extra & 2) The one (and so far only) time I stopped in was a early evening on a weekday when there's not a whole lot going on so I didn't get a real good picture of this place.

Going back to #1 it's pretty shocking I've never been here before. It's about a mile from my house & I like dive bars. I know that they redid the place within the past couple years & it's not quite as divey looking from the outside as it used to be.

Anyway, nothing really stands out about this place for better or for worst. It's a dive bar. They serve cheap drinks. There's not a huge beer selection (which is expected at a place like this), but what they have gets the job done. They serve decently priced food that is fine. I had chicken tenders, and like I said, they were fine. I wouldn't say the menu is \"limited,\" but nothing on it really stands outs (they pretty much stick to basic bar food). From what I understand the breakfast items are good though. 

The inside is clean. It's mostly high top tables, but there's a couple booths with lower tables along the wall when you first walk in. There's also a patio, but I didn't see what it was like. I know they have live music on certain nights here, which is probably where this place stands out. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good prices on drinks.  Its nit a biker bar per say.  Its a friendly neighborhood dive bar."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday during happy hour and I love the vibe of this place!  The owner Doug was very friendly and welcoming. Our waitress Ginger also gave great service and answered all my questions about the menu and drinks. Ginger offered us all samples of their \"Sunday Morning\" beer and I loved it. The bathrooms are very clean too. Can't wait to come back and try some more of their food."}
{"text":"Well how did I forget to write this?!?  What an unassuming kick ass \"dive\" bar!  From the outside you'd think who goes here then you walk in..so clean and inviting.  We didn't eat here but had drinks.  The service was terrific and a great crowd.  They didn't have a band when we went but the music was great.  This is a great neighborhood joint and well worth checking in."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar, I have been in about a dozen times and there is usually a decent crowed. The bar staff is top notch Morgan and Colin are on point, they alone are worth a trip to El Dorado!"}
{"text":"The service is great, drinks are well mixed and flavorful - great margaritas!  The new owners Doug and Joyce have done a great job updating the bar.  Josh and Jackie, bartenders, are spot on!  And the Braken Burger is delish!   CHEERS!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan what can I say, I live up the street and love checking in for the daily specials,
lets see, Monday, half off burgers with side of fries.  Tuesday taco night, weds pulled pork, before i give the wrong info you should go there check it out for your self.
People like it here Karaoke is hit or miss but when the place is popping its a lot of fun.  

I don't go to many dive bars but this place opened up a new area to start exploring."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for hanging with friends and listing to music. I was surprised how spacious and open it seemed, despite the amount of people inside. Our bartender (i think his name was Gary or Jerry) was super attentive and made sure we weren't empty handed at any given time. He even let me have a taste of a few of his special mixed drinks! So yummy. The western burger was fantastic as well, and big enough for me and my husband to split. We left with full bellies and smiles on our faces. I would definitely recommend this place to someone looking for good food and a good time."}
{"text":"I've been to this bar a couple times because it's down the street from my house. Whenever I go the employees are beyond friendly and you can tell they really care about their customers. The first time I went we just had drinks which are much cheaper than an average drink in old town. My roommate and I went back for food a couple months later and it was DELISH. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries. Burger was perfect and fries (lets just say I'm a French fry connoisseur) were amazing!! Imagine shake shack fries with the thickness of red robin fries plus seasoning. We will be back. Maybe this time for a late night bite. Don't forget to try the breakfast which is served all day every day, this place has it all!"}
{"text":"El Dorado is a great place to relax and have a drink.
I'm a local, there almost every Tuesday, and usually stumble in on weekends for breakfast and a spicy Bloody Mary. Prices are great and there's always been a drink special posted when I've gone. The food menu is modest and the food is decent, though I've only eaten breakfast there. Service is fantastic. If they don't know you by name..you get the impression that they intend to. I always appreciate a business that cares about whether or not their customers return or not. El Dorado definitely does.
My 4-star-rating is for the relaxing atmosphere, great service and good drinks. The food is an afterthought. It's a wonderful spot to wet your whistle without withering your wallet. See ya on the patio..I'll be the one smoking a stogie."}
{"text":"The place is a dive. We came out because of the entertainment. We heard they do karaoke which was pretty good. This guy had every song ever made. That was the best part of the experience. 
    The décor was American Hodgepodge. Nothing really seemed to go together. The chairs had a white or off white finish I couldn't tell which because they were dirty. One had dried mustard or melted cheese all over the back of it. The one bartender was nice and attentive. I do think she should refrain from singing karaoke while serving customers. It's kind of rude.
   Here's the real reason we won't be back. We arrived at 8:45. We ordered food and was told the kitchen closes at 9:00 and couldn't get anything on the menu. What kind of place has entertainment and closes the kitchen? I was looking forward to trying the El Dorado burger, a 1/3 pound cheeseburger topped with a pile of pastrami. My suggestion if you go for the entertainment, is eat first or get there early."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great atmosphere. Found this bar on Yelp next to our apartment and when we first walked in Doug, the owner, greeted us at the door. He sat us down quickly and offered us a free shot with him. Ginger came over with the menus and we had our beers in under 5 min. Great for sports games and hanging out with a family feel. Probably going to be a regular from now on. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night, no teams were playing, yet there were around ten people gathered around the large bar in the middle of the room. Seasonal Christmas lights crisscross the ceiling. This place gives me the instant impression of my Midwest roots small town bar. Clean, non-pretentious, bar to grab a drink. I did not try out the food from the kitchen, but the menu again echoed the friendly, small town bars of Iowa.
We had a pitcher of Shock Top and a round of shots. The bartender, Colin, was great. Helpful, social, creative, everything one looks for at this kind of casual bar. 
It was a good night. The kind of relaxed night that is looking for."}
{"text":"I find this place to be the Cheers of the valley! Whether you have been coming for years or the first time visitor, bartenders and owners alike want to know you and make you feel comfortable! Come on down and check in for a free shot of Fireball! I especially want to point out Michelle, Kim, Ginger, and mama Cass are there for your drinking pleasure! Stop on in!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome bar & grill. Great food & drinks. The owner Doug is very nice. The bar tenders are amazing & very friendly!"}
