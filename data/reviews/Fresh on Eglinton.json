{"text":"Service was okay. Came for Sunday brunch and it was pretty packed so staff didn't pay much attention. Service was mediocre but food was standard fresh that I love. Would keep coming back to keep trying different items from the menu but maybe on a less busier day?"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Toronto. Very healthy. They do a good job mixing good quality protein with a variety of healthy vegetables. Generally tasty. 
Some minor problems- twice they have forgotten to put the sauce that was supposed to come with my meal but when asked they did bring it. Service usually  very good but can be slow when things are busy as they are doing lots of takeout as well as the restaurant meals. 

Their elixers are extremely overpriced for what you get so better off to buy a smoothie or juice,   which are made on site."}
{"text":"Had the transformer salad. It didn't make me feel like a robotic giant but it was pretty damn good. Has tons on it. The carrot miso is lush. Be sure you're hungry if you order it as the portion would actually feed a transformer. The coconut and pumpkin smoothie causes a drug like euphoria. This place beats a greasy spoon any day of the week."}
{"text":"Used to like this place, I would go there at least once a week... Since the end of 2016 I've been there 5 times and I've waited over 25 minutes for our food, every single time .... service is also getting worst, some servers have some serious attitude problems."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Worth the wait for food on a busy Friday night. The burgers were great! I would have never guessed that it was vegetarian. The shakes we got were excellent. They were great about customizing the burger and the shakes just the way you want them and I loved that. I'd recommend everyone checking this place out. Eat well and enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service was a little slow but it was also super busy. The food was delicious, the service was friendly and the environment is really lovely! I had the ceasar wrap and a lemonade and I could not be more pleased! I definitely will be going again"}
{"text":"Not cheap, but I vastly prefer this location to the other Fresh locations. More space and not as noisy."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian food with a very good enough portion and very reasonable price!
The staff are so so."}
{"text":"Generally, Fresh is so good but the last time I got take it from there it was less than mediocre,  I ordered the All Star salad and the sweet potato was not fully cooked and they gave me the wrong salad dressing.  At $15 its not cool to mess around with someone's splurge lunch."}
{"text":"TL;DR - No delivery option but packaging and service was on point. Too much ginger in 4 of the 7 drinks which made it hard for me to finish. Everything was too spicy for no reason.  I wouldn't repeat this cleanse.

---

I decided to do a post solely on Fresh's Juice Cleanse program just because I haven't seen one yet and think it's informative for those that may want to try it.  This is my second time on a \"juice cleanse\" and whether or not you believe it works, I think this a good summary of how each of the juices tasted and worked in my opinion.  I purchased the Detox & Boost Cleanse for 2 days for a total of $136 + tax and no delivery option.  I picked it up from the store the next day and began the cleanse the day after. I've only tried one other cleanse before (from CEDAR) for comparison.  

The no delivery was definitely not a norm considering how many places will actually delivery for free within the GTA now.  I was a bit peeved because I drove to the Eglinton location in rush hour (with no parking) and having to carry out heavy boxes on my own.  Each day comes in a nice sturdy carboard box with dividers for each bottle and each day comes with 5 - 473mL (glass) bottles; 1 - 237mL bottle; and 1 - 118mL bottle for a total of 7 bottles.  I got 2 boxes and all the bottles have an expiration of 5 days after purchasing.  The 2-day cleanse comes with a $20 gift card and a small sheet that explains how you should go about each day and FAQs. The service of the actual restaurant was quick and ordering was convenient.  Asides from the lack of delivery, the packaging and everything else was nice.

The drinks (in the recommended drink order):
Immunity - This was a shot you're supposed to take in the morning. It was SO spicy with a ton of ginger and all I could taste of spicy garlic and some lemon/grapefruit. It was hard to down.
#00 Special (Activated Charcoal Lemonade) - This was my favorite; other than the black color and the settling of the charcoal at the bottom.  You really have to shake it up but besides that, it tasted like fresh lemonade!  The best tasting and easiest to drink of the bunch.
#14 The Healer - Lots of ginger here too... too spicy for me.  I was hoping for a more sour or even fruity taste but don't let the color deceive you; it's not good.
#01 Urban Detox - The first \"green\" juice of the day and not the best.  Also \"spicy\" from the ginger and cayenne so I couldn't taste the \"green-ness\" of it.
#05 The Daily Dose - The only other drink I could bare (asides from the #00 Special).  It wasn't spicy! And tasted very healthy.  It's sweeter than I would expect but just a tad and smells like grass.
#03 Clean Green - The better \"green\" juice but not by much.  It's still spicy but less so and I can pinch my nose to drink it.  I couldn't get through this last spicy one of the day because my stomach just couldn't handle it.
#09 Mad Chocolate - Smaller bottle for \"dessert\" at the end of the day. Not as a sweet as I would've hoped but still very cocoa-like. There's a bit of texture from the raw cocoa in it (sandy).

Overall, considering that 4 out of the 7 drinks were too spicy for me, I would say that I wouldn't recommend it (unless you like ginger) and I wouldn't order again. I don't mind if 1 (or even 2) of the drinks were filled with ginger, but not 4 - I didn't pay to suffer through drinking these.  I might've went with the wrong cleanse choice, as this was considered \"intermediate\" and not \"beginners\" so the latter option may have included more sweet or less spicy drinks.  About the only thing that I think it did for me was lower my appetite... I was definitely not hungry for more.  I would give this program +1 star just because the packaging is nice and the bottles are glass.  But in terms of being a repeat customer for their cleanse (or juice in general), count me out.  CEDAR is far superior in taste so go with that."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to after a I practice yoga at Yoga Tree up the street. Their BBQ sauce is amazing. Many of their dishes are amazing too!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best place to eat for vegetarians around Yonge/Eglinton. The menu is huge and they have daily specials that are reasonably priced, although I find that their prices have been steadily climbing over the years. ($17.50 for a bowl!)

Definitely order various sauces/dressings to go with your meal. The miso gravy
and the thai peanut sauce are to die for. My favorite things to order are the wraps and the bowls with soba noodles."}
{"text":"Great veggie food, hit-and-miss service.

This is the vegetarian restaurant that I can bring my meat-eating friends and family to, and know they'll still enjoy their meals.

I try to get something different every time, and I've yet to be disappointed. Some items are really over priced, but they taste great. Service can be great, but I've had a few awful servers a few times. Try my favourite dish, Powerhouse Rice Bowl."}
{"text":"Fresh is a Toronto staple and I'm so glad it exists. 

I've been coming here for many, many years. And I've come to find my favourites, but I have left disappointed on a few occasions when I've ordered the wrong thing (the Energy Bowl comes to mind). My go-to items are: quinoa onion rings, clubhouse wrap, soup/salad/cornbread combo, BBQ Burger (amazing!), and squash tacos. I'm a fan of the new monster protein salad too. 

The Eglinton location has the best indoor seating, it's a little less crowded than other locations. But I love the patio at Fresh on Crawford!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian restaurant I've been to. Big portions and top quality food. The bowls are my favorite. Love the Buddha bowl with soba noodles-great peanut sauce. The holiday wrap is another great meal,Very filling and satisfying. I have meat eating friends and they all love this place. 
The juices/smoothies are quite pricey but delicious. Of course you get what you pay for-very healthy.  
From time to time they do awesome discounts, 50% off food!  I make sure I take advantage of that.

A++"}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD OF VEGANS. HUGE PORTIONS,ONE MEAL FOR TWO PEOPLE AND WILL STILL BE FULL. Absolutely delicious food. Good service. Beautiful restaurant. Definitely 100% healer than all the other vegan restaurants. Found hair in food once and had clumsy waitress drop many things but that was only one time and will not change my opinion on the overall trips. If you ever want to go to a vegan restaurant this is seriously the one for you.  A lot of vegan food services are either really tiny take out restaurants or extremely overpriced small portioned food which taste weird. FRESH IS THE WAY TO GO."}
{"text":"Have been several times and ordered out many times. Amazing vegan juices, bowls, soups.  They don't disappoint. Love the onion rings and YYZ bowl. On one occasion they missed our appetizer order, but made it up by giving us two complementary juice coupons."}
{"text":"This is an awesome vegan restaurant. The menu is huge, and everything was made and presented care. Best onion rings I've ever had, with homemade vegan mayo dip as well. The curry mayo is amazing. The dressings are all made from scratch and there is quite a variety. The 3-6-9 dressing is the best. They have a juice and smoothie menu just as expansive as the actual menu. Fresh pressed juices and make your own juice blends as well. The vegan desserts are okay. They are from a bakery, and not made in house. They could be better, but I've had worse. This is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars. Everything else about this place is amazing. The phytosalad is hands down the best. I like how they had some gluten free options too. Would eat here everyday if I could! I think you could eat here everyday for 2 months and not repeat a meal"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Friendly staff. Food is amazing!!!! Must have the Quinoa onion rings.  I also had the powerhouse. So good!! Huge portion. I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"Very Good healthy options , but too hyped and overpriced . Everything is super expensive for a vegetarian based restaurant, excuse being organic produce. Not all options are fully organic , actually, it's a challenge finding fully organic produce in metropolitan cities these days. Unless one visits a clean and transparent agricultural farmland outside the city. I have tried a few of their rice bowls , which turned out to be bland , tasteless , and very mediocre."}
{"text":"Zero stars should be an option. Attitude, arrogance and a rip off - big time. I must've been comatose to spend $24 on a lunch ... a very small cup of green juice and a serving of rice with broccoli, bok choy and tempeh... spent the whole afternoon doubled over with cramps. Never, ever again..."}
{"text":"BAD ,BAD, BAD :( Food is not good at all..the glasses smell like chemicals. Not recommended..burgers are too oily, salad tastes like grass!! I never go there again."}
{"text":"I don't usually like healthy food, but this place makes it taste really good! I would recommend the all star salad and the tangled Thai. The peanut lime sauce is delicious! I'd love to try more menu items but I'm too obsessed with the all star salad right now!"}
{"text":"This is based on noise level inside. It's deafening like a dance club. Traffic outside on the patio is refreshing quiet in contrast."}
{"text":"Large vegan and vegeterian selection, but there wasn't anything truly outstanding. The food is decent, the staff friendly, and there's lots of seating.  

I was expecting much more from the food though,  and I left feeling slightly disappointed.

For the price ($15 Main Salads and Bowls), I had expected something that would make me want to come back.  We didn't find it here.

If we were vegan/vegetarian I could see the appeal since they do have a large number of options, but since I can spend the same money somewhere else and enjoy the food much more, it wouldn't be my first choice.

We only tried a small selection of their menu, so I'm sure there were other dishes that might have been better, but overall from the dishes we ordered nothing stood out as being truly delicious."}
{"text":"Been there once, really liked my quinoa & kale salad - fresh, tasty, large portion."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. We were greeted and seated right away and the food arrived in less then 10 mins!

I had the bbq burger and the hub had the all star salad. 
This was my first veggie burger and I can say I am a huge fan. It was delicious!! I loved the mayo. It came with quinoa onion rings which were great as well.

We also had a rainbow juice which is on promo right now and it's make with double ginger. We love ginger so that was sweet.

I'd recommend this to anyone willing to try out something new and healthy!

Definitely will return :)"}
{"text":"And I'm out. 

I have been to fresh a couple of times and always ordered a salad. I found them a little over-priced but fine. Today I decided to branch out and order a buddah bowl take-out. Not only did I have to pay $12 and wait 10 minutes but what I got was mung bean sprouts, rice and 2 slices of tomato. It looks wholly unappetizing, and honestly feels like I've been ripped off. By no reasonable costing scheme could someone justify charging so much money for such low-quality food. Thank goodness I went with the 'baby size.' 

Seriously. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Was never a fan of meals with meat substitutes until I ate here.  Love their burgers and the quinoa onion rings are to die for!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing vegetarian food. I was shown a variety of menu items and the staff were welcoming and kind. I ordered a pancake platter and was pleasantly surprised by the large portion size and unique and delicious taste. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Always tasty.  The \"baby\" size of the bowls is large enough for a full meal... the Green Goddess bowl is my favourite."}
{"text":"The wait for a table and for your food to arrive during lunch time is quite long, but if you are patient you will be rewarded with unique creations that actually work well together! As an omnivore I was quite impressed that the buffalo 'chicken' wrap tasted authentic and that the lentil curry crepe kept me full - not to mention tasted great! Good idea for a catchup date with a friend after hitting the shops in the area or for post workout healthy eats."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place, but I wasn't too impressed when I went there this past weekend. I opted for an \"add-on\" to my dish and I was surprised with how much I got charged and how little I received. For $2 bucks I ended up getting 3 really really really thin avocado slices (like 2mm each) - next time I might as well just bring my own."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations, so had to come earlier to get a table for our team lunch.  

Right away we were advised that an 18% gratuity is included for a group of 6+. If it wasn't a work outing, I would not have stayed. 

Not being a vegetarian and missing meat options on the menu, I hoped to have at least a decent portion of cheese in the premium bowl of Beach, alas. 

The bowl was brought with chopsticks. Since I am not good with chopsticks, I had to find a fork myself to be able to eat (too much for that 18% tip I was charged). 

I find my dish too oily and the whole experience disappointing."}
{"text":"Setting and service: 
This place gives me the vibe that it is hip and healthy which it is. The seatings are quite cramp, there's no room to put your purse of jacket, but they do provide u hanging hooks to hang your jacket along the washroom hallway. The service was good.

Since this is a vegetarian place, some background of myself would be helpful. I am not a vegetarian and I enjoy eating meat but I also enjoy eating healthy options. 

Food: 
I tried the bowls, the popular quinoa onion rings, and the veggie burger. I enjoyed the bowls, it is pack with flavour and healthiness but dont expect it to taste like a stir fry bowl cause it is not. It's a rice/noodle salad. 

As for the veggie burger, I wasn't a fan cause I had the hopes that it would taste similar to meat burgers, but my expectation was wrong. It was still a good dish but dont order it thinking it would taste like a meat burger cause that would be unfair lol. 

As for the quinoa onion ring, I didnt really understand the hype. I find regular onion rings to taste better :) and I am not sure how much nutrients are left in the quinoa after the deep frying process.

Overall it was a good experience, I find that to truly enjoy the food in this place is to set the right expectation. If you choose the right options for yourself, you will find yourself coming back :)"}
{"text":"Any of the Fresh Restaurants are some of the best eateries I've been to in the City. Having said that, it is VERY vegan, but also, very healthy! If I feel sick, I'll go in for the lung lover hot drink. If I want a good burger that's great tasting (and not fattening), I'll go for the mushroom onion burger.   They've got a new drink-cleanse line up that I'm dying to try before my next weekend bender. Also, they're onion ring tower is amazing. 

You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I recently ate at the Fresh Y and E location and am basing my review solely on what I ordered, which was the baby beach bowl with brown rice.  On the basis of this dish alone (some brown basmati rice tossed together with a few accent pieces of bell pepper, sweet potato, zucchini, avocado, a smattering of goat cheese and seasoned with a rather bland tamari sauce), for which Fresh chargers about $13.00, Fresh is one of the most expensive restaurants if not in the city of Toronto, then certainly in the entire Yonge and Eglinton area.  The dish was so much like an unappetizing blend of side dish items, that I ordererd a grilled tofu steak add-on to give the meal some much needed heft.  These were about the size of communion wafers, almost as tasteless, and pushed the dish past the $15.00 mark.  I had to rely heavily on the spicy condiment served with the meal to make the whole thing palatable.  I think you really need to know what to order here in terms of flavour and value.  In my experience the bowls (at least the rice bowls) are a real rip off and far from mouth watering.  I remember eating at Fresh on Bloor a number of years ago when I had the veggie burger which at the time came with fries (which were and still are, it seems, very good).  At just around $10, this was a wallet friendly meal and a tasty, satisfying alternative to eating meat.  I had the burger again at the Bloor location a few years ago and the price had gone up and the quality, it seemed, down (the burger was small and dry).  Having said that, I think the burger is still one of the best items on the menu at Fresh and would have preferred it to the beach rice bowl.  On the positive side, the atmosphere of the restaurant is quite pleasant in all respects and the staff friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"finally visited this fresh location recently, and I have to say it delivers on all of my other fresh experiences; great service, and great food. no matter what I get at fresh it's always appealing for the taste buds (and healthy to boot!). this location is by and far the largest of the four and features a decent sized patio as well. 

fresh continues to set the standard for vegan food in Toronto, and fresh on eglinton does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went there the other day, took me a while to find this as the map shown here is wrong. It's not on mount pleasant road. It's on eglinton. Anyways, ordered a club wrap. Really like the sauce inside but find the flavouring a bit too strong. A little bit over priced for what it is. Really disliked the environment, it was way too noisy, kinda drove me nuts and I had to finish my food as fast as possible just to get out of there quickly."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to and must spots whenever I'm in Toronto. I really have not had anything that has not fast become my favorite there. Their burgers are my most frequently ordered meal and their fries are awesome especially with the chipotle mayo."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this review because I like Fresh so much. I even get the cold pressed juices here after the gym! Unlike my other reviews, this review isn't even about the food. It's about the service. (And because the food is actually good, +1 from what I was actually going to give them, which is one star) (for the record, I like the qunioa onion rings, the buttnerut squash soup and the energy bowl with soba noodles the best)

My co-workers and I went to Fresh for lunch.  We arrived at 11:45 knowing that we had a big group and it would take some time to serve us. We ordered at around noon (so it took them 15 minutes to take our order). After around 30 minutes had passed, we asked about our food since some people needed to be back in the office for a meeting at 1PM. They came back to tell us they were busy but that it should only be another 15 minutes. We asked if they could bring out the orders that were already completed. They said no but that it would only be another 15 minutes. We were fine with that but kept a close watch on time because it only allowed us 15 minutes to eat. At 12:45, we still didn't get our food. After a few more minutes, we asked about the food again. The manager came over and told us that only a few minutes had passed since we asked and it would be another 10 mins. By this time, it was already 12:55 and we were sure that more than a few minutes had passed because we were conscious of getting back for our meeting. There was no way we could eat and get back to work. We asked if we could get our food to go. But they didn't seem too happy about that so we had no choice but to leave without our food. Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. We purposely arrived early so that we could beat the lunch rush and also because we had a large group. It's also sad because we were really looking forward to our food and by the time we waited for an entire hour for food, we were all very very hangry and had to go back to work without lunch. 

TL;DR: DO NOT EAT HERE DURING LUNCH RUSH IF YOU ARE ALMOST HUNGRY - IT WILL TURN YOU HANGRY!"}
{"text":"Super tasty and feel good food. Full gluten-free menu that is amazing. I had the tacos in the green wraps and the kale salad. My meal had a lot of flavour and the patio was nice on a summer day!"}
{"text":"I just came back from Fresh a few minutes ago and had another awful experience there. The servers here are very ill-mannered. 

The first time I came to Fresh I went with my friends and although I was the only one fluent in English in the group somehow the waitress seemed very annoyed with me. I was just as courteous as my friends but whatever reason she was rude. I found out the reason today. I came to the store again, there was a girl at the cash, I waited for her to greet me but as soon as a lady behind me asked for help she went and helped her. 

This guy was walking so slow to the cash, stood behind it, but never greeted me. I greeted him and asked for help. Anyway, I asked about whether they had a soft cookie that had a coconut filling because my friend had gotten one there. He said they had nothing like it. He then pointed hard at every cooking and said that's what they had there. I wasn't insisting they had the cookie. I was just simply thinking of what else to get and he could've simply suggested something else. I mean, he works there - he should know what's good there. If I was working there, I would suggest something else. It isn't just about giving good customer service, it's just plain decency. He just stood there annoyed, waiting for me to go. I bought something else and I thanked him and said take care. He responded with nothing. 

The staff profile their customers and they are plain racist. They were so nice to my friends because they were white. I was next in line but as soon as this lady asked for help, the server left me. More importantly, the only people that work here are white."}
{"text":"For the service i was a bit disappointed...
Food was just ok, too bad because I chose this place according to the previous reviews that were awesome"}
{"text":"My wife went here with her friends... Vegan?! Come on... It's not gonna fill you up.... But I had the bbq burger and man I left there satisfied and FULL!!!! good job vegan food, thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"My review is based upon uber eats. I've never really cared for the idea of vegan food, but was looking for a healthy-ish option on my Sunday afternoon. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower bites and the chick'n tikka masala bowl on soba noodles. These were both so delicious. I thought the fake chicken would gross me out, but this was actually really good. My only thing would be that I wish it was more spicy and had more gravy. Also another piece of chick'n would have been nice, but I did order the baby size. The bites were absolutely divine with the dip. It was so flavorful and had a good kick of heat. The portions are more than enough and I had for leftovers the next day. Will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"If you want healthy food in the Yonge and Eglinton area, look no further. Fresh is the place to go!

I love this restaurant. Organic vegan treats with portions large enough to satisfy the hungriest of people.  

This location stands out because it is huge. At the downtown locations of Fresh there is usually a 15 minute wait for a table, but I went here on a Friday at 8 pm and was seated right away. It was busy, but the service was fast and the food delicious. 

I highly recommend the Ace of Kale salad."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner over the weekend and had a really good experience. The restaurant was packed; the employees did a great job at getting everyone seated and serving guests in a really timely manner. They also take reservations in case you want to book ahead. 

We ordered the dragon sweet potato fries to share and they tasted really good. They use a miso gravy that tastes cheesy and delicious. As someone who is gluten and lactose intolerant, it is rare to enjoy something this cheesy and delicious at a restaurant. 

They even have a gluten allergy menu that makes it really easy to order something gluten free if you are celiac or suffer from gluten intolerance. We both ordered salads and were really happy with the portion size.

I ordered the monster protein salad and it tasted delicious! It was loaded with tempeh, chickpeas, tofu, avocado, cranberries, adzuki, beans, red cabbage, grape tomatoes, and hulled watermelon seeds.

My friend ordered a Thai inspired salad, which had an amazing Thai dressing. It tasted amazing and I'll have to choose the Thai dressing in the future. 

I would definitely recommend this location as it's much easier to get a table than at their Spadina location."}
{"text":"My go to! Fresh has been ahead of the game with its inventive and delicious vegetarian food. The menu is always being updated and new items are constantly being added. It's hard to try new things on the menu as you just want to continue ordering your favorites! I love the clubhouse wrap, megalife salad, powerhouse bowl, and the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I will preface this review with the fact that I just moved back from Portland and the vegetarian/vegan options there are plentiful and delicious. So, I may be spoiled.

The good: Some of the food is super tasty. Quinoa onion rings? Great. crunchy, flavourful, not too greasy. The buddha bowl's sauce was tasty. There are lots of options for vegetarians, spanning from 'this almost tastes like meat' to 'why do I want food that tastes like meat, I love vegetables'. 

The so-so: The same buddha bowl with the tasty sauce was mostly rice and tofu ($10 for a tiny portion). I only received 2 pieces of tomato, 1 piece of cucumber and a pile of beans sprouts. For a restaurant called fresh, I expect a bit more vegetable fare (i.e. fresh food?). The wait can be quite long, even when the restaurant is empty (feels just like Portland). 

The bad: Nothing really. The whole thing just felt kinda meh. Lunch was ~$45, for 1 appetizer and 2 mains (one was a baby portion). 

P.S. Why has no-one in this city discovered soy curls? Vegetarian's BEST FRIEND."}
{"text":"So I tried Fresh for the very first time yesterday via Uber Eats and ordered 2 of their appetizers and a salad for a late lunch.   I've heard they're good and was excited to see how well a vegan place fares for their salads and dishes; I mean after all they DO specialize in vegan salads... basically anything that doesn't involve animals or their by-products. Right? Right.

The delivery was right on time for the 30 minutes..so far so good.  I opened the bag and immediately started some mental notes regarding the salad.  Based on colours of the ingredients as well the presentation and the amounts given.  

First order: Quinoa Onion Rings
Very well done and I would expect that coming out of a deep fryer (and in general).  They were massive, cooked just right and had a super crunch.  So far they def have me solded on the crunch factor :). It was seasoned very well and the onion inside big, plump and juicy.

Second order: Dragon Broccoli.
It had about 12 pieces of cut steamed broccoli that was lightly tossed in miso gravy ( I don't know what this is or how it was made) but it was weird.. chunky thick sauce sat on the bottom of the tray with steamed broccoli on top.. whereas other parts of the tray had runny watery miso gravy.  In the centre was generous plop of hot banana peppers... the dish striked me as really strange.. didn't make sense of the flavors combined.. the colouring was off (green broccoli with a salmon coloured sauce and yellow banana peppers in the centre.  Nothing was mixed in together.  Flavours were OK 6(yeahh just OK) but the questions had me feeling \"otherwise\" for this appetizer.

Third order: Big Salad.  
It showcased on Uber Eats as a large and colourful basic salad.  Well it pretty much was however when I opened the lid .. there wasn't THAT much.   It still had every ingredient, I still I felt as though a grade 4 could have prepared the salad.   Nothing was tossed properly and so we had to make way as is.  I also felt a little disappointed after looking at the food.  Like really we spent $35 CAD give or take. And the only thing that fared well was the quinoa onion rings:) 

I didnt get to try their detox mixes.  Maybe later  plus continue to skim their menu for some new Jems 

In the meantime, I'll let Fresh continue their day to day operations providing \"outstanding vegan items.\"    If anyone knows what I also need to try please let me know :) ! 

Thankx Lana."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. It started off great when we got the dragon fries. The Miso gravy tasted great and it was a large size as well, considering it was listed as a Starter. It went downhill when my friend and I got our next dish. She ordered the Tiger Fresh Bowl with Soba noodles and I ordered the Energy Fresh Bowl with brown basmati rice. They were both bland. Very, very bland! It could just be that my friend and I are used to stronger flavours but it was hard to enjoy the meal when there was no taste. Actually, my fresh bowl had lots of onions in it so I guess my meal tasted predominantly of onions. Luckily, the waitress brought us some of their hot sauce. It wasn't hot at all BUT it had sort of like a jerk marinade flavour so we literally poured it all over our meal to flavour our food lol. Overall, the restaurant looked great and they have large food portions but I didn't really enjoy my main dish so, it is what it is."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday. I will say I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, I just generally like eating clean! I ordered the Sav Blanc, the quinoa onion rings (as advised by others on Yelp) with the chipotle dip and I had the Thai salad with deep fried tofu pieces. Everything was so delicious, the decor was nice and clean and the server was really nice and helpful. I will go back for sure. The tofu cubes were a tiny bit too salty but I ate them all regardless! Yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent food and amazing service. Very clean and comfortable environment. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went to Fresh today for lunch. Honestly, my rating isn't about their food as we didn't even get to eat there. We arrived to the restaurant at noon, ordered and waited with my 19 other friends. When they came back to tell us they were busy, we thought ya, another 15 mins won't hurt. but then when it got to 12:45, and asked them about our food.. They told us another 10 mins... That's when we knew something was wrong so we left. Afternoon lunch is about rush hour, if they can't even handle serving the number of customers seated, how are they going to continue operating in Downtown Toronto? Anyone have similar experiences here?"}
{"text":"Eating vegetarian in Toronto means you cross paths with Fresh more often than not. The first few times I went, I seriously wasn't impressed by the food. Now I know there are worst options around and have to give credit where it's due. Fresh consistently puts out relatively wholesome, but still tasty food that pleases both omnivores and herbivores alike. It is hard to find fault with a restaurant that operates at the scale Fresh does, while still ensuring consistency across their several locations. Truthfully, I think Fresh shines at being above average in the best way possible. Their homemade dressings and sauces, in particular, are always tasty, and really make what could be a blah salad bowl/wrap/etc, that much better. Their Clubhouse wrap and Transformer bowl, in particular, have really won me over."}
{"text":"Not my first choice, but still a solid place for lunch on Eglinton. I'm not a vegetarian so I'm not the target audience for this restaurant, but I still found something good. The superfood and tangled thai salads are both great. The radiant green and detox smoothies are both great too. I wasn't a fan of the bowls, again, I'm not the target audience.

It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and quick service! I love the chandeliers and the wooden features. Portions are quite large (well for me and my friend anyway) for a reasonable price. I had the soup , salad and cornbread combo with hummus. I wasn't able to finish all of it but it was delicious. I like the cornbread here compared to other locations. For some reason it was more moist at this Fresh location.  Also, the peanut lime dressing is super yummy!  My friend had soba noodles in a bowl. She enjoyed it as well!"}
{"text":"As a gluten-free vegan living in midtown, I was THRILLED when this Fresh location opened up! It's more open than other locations, doesn't feel as cramped. The staff are wonderful and the food is delish. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it's quite pricy, but overall a great place."}
{"text":"I was recently taken out to dinner at Fresh and was highly impressed. The last time I was at Fresh was six years ago, and I went to the one on bloor. From what I remembered of the one on bloor, it served delicious vegetarian and gluten-free fare, but the establishment was very crowded. This Fresh on Eglinton still had the same hip vibe, but was quieter and more spacious! I ordered the Chipotle bacon burger and my bf ordered the wrap with tofu steak and soy bacon. We didn't expect mock meat to be this crave-worthy, especially the soy bacon!  I will definitely be returning to try their brunch options...and more soy bacon!"}
{"text":"The best vegetarian restaurant in Toronto for delicious, yet healthy meals. Portions are huge, menu is huge, prices are what you expect for a place like this. Service is fantastic. Will return over and over again!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, but I do appreciate trying new combinations. 

I went to the Eglinton location around dinner time on a Wednesday and it was packed! We found seats right away, but the seating arrangement is a little tight, so you feel like you are sitting with the table next to you. Not a huge deal, I understand it's a busy location. 

We ordered the quinoa crusted onion rings, black bean burrito, and mushroom onion burger. The onion rings were amazing! Really - the best I've had in a while. 
However the burger was a little too dense and lacking flavor. The bread was quite heavy as is and with the vegan patty, I couldn't eat more than half of it! (Packed the rest to go)

I did try my friend's black bean burrito, and it was really good. Although quite simple for how much it costs. I also tried one of their juices, and it was refreshing and delicious!

Overall, I personally found it a bit over-priced and somewhat lacking flavor... but I can totally see this being an amazing option for people with plant-based diets. I will definitely come back again and but will probably order something on the lighter side. Aside from the food, I would totally stop by here for a juice/smoothie."}
{"text":"I vow to only eat here when I'm in Toronto. I was there for 5 days, and came here for dinner 5 nights in a row. I also went to the Spadina location which was very nice as well. I put all of my Canadian family on too ;) VEGAN POUTINE GUYS."}
{"text":"I'm not one to give compliments. In fact, I give the honest truth every time, regardless if feelings are hurts. In the name of transparency, I rarely give five stars.  But when I do, it means this place has exceeded my expectations.

Here's more facts. I hate vegetables. Especially the green ones. I don't like the smell of them, I don't like the taste of them. And I definitely don't like looking at them. I was brought up as a child to not like vegetables. My childhood friend, Bart, once told me, \"You don't win friends with salad\".

After dining at Fresh, I recant my everlasting distaste thee. This review will be my experience, coupled with a meat-bias.

Here's what we ordered:

Dragon Fries.
french fries, miso gravy, hot banana chilies, green onions,
sesame seeds and chili oil

Mushroom Onion Burger
sauteed mushrooms & onions, tomato, lettuce,
alfalfa sprouts & garlic mayo

BBQ Burger
Carrot Cake
Brownie

I am a huge fan of the Dragon Fries. The name might bare no resemblance to dragons, but it resemble an Asian inspired palette. I was enthusiastic on this dish with imitation gravy, because after all, the definition of gravy includes the word \"meat\". To my surprised, this dish packed an array of flavor. Sweet, savory, a slight tang and ironically, a mild cheesy taste. As cheesy as it sounds, it tasted very Fresh. Despite not including notes of meatiness, it was very pleasant.

The Mushroom Onion Burger was enjoyable, if not, lovable. The vegan patty itself was slightly bland. It had the flavor of a falafel and crumbled like a beef patty. What made this burger enjoyable was the medley of it's condiments. Fresh aromatics and vegetables livened up this dish. The ingredients meddled into perfect harmony. 

By definition, vegan stands for VEgetables, Grains, Alternatives and Nuts (i think). I was skeptical on how desserts are made without eggs. These desserts tasted great. No issues with moisture. It definitely fooled me as vegan.

Overall, my experience was beyond my expectations. If you want to indulge in an experience, Fresh is where it's at. #EatFresh.

Will I ever convert to veganism? God no.
Will  I re-visit? Hell yes."}
{"text":"I love the other Fresh restaurants and this one is closer to my house so I'm very happy. 

I don't love the decor, it looks sort of unfinished. 

The food is delicious, I have been a few times, eat in and take out, since it opened. The staff are friendly although the service is a little slow. It's overpriced for sure, but good quality and very FRESH :)

My one complaint, now that it is winter, is that it is DAMN COLD in there!!! They need to insulate the windows and get a big curtain around the door or something. Last time I ate there we kept out jackets on and felt miserable the whole time. I guess I'll be waiting until next spring to go back :("}
{"text":"Amazing menu. I'm not a vegan, but decided to check this place out. Prices are very good. Everything on the menu from salads to sandwiches are huge for the price, I didn't finish my 12$ salad. Toppings were fresh, very cute place!"}
{"text":"Been there only twice ( was enough for me). I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but had heard good things about it, so i figured  I would give it a try, with  few friends. Took forever for us to receive our food, and the service and attitude we received were't exactly the best either. Food was bland.. made me happy I am not a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Fresh. The squash tacos are perfectly made and go well with the soup of the day or a side of sweet potato fries. The service is always exceptional and the prices are affordable. It's a great vegan option if you're in the city but the food compares favorably to even non vegan restaurants."}
{"text":"We visit here frequently. Great service, fantastic healthy vegan menus. I've tried all the burgers and almost all of the juice options and they're all good. Menu prices are high but you get what you pay for. Whether you're looking to pop in for finger foods or looking to fill your belly, this place will make it happen. Having said that, I invite even non vegans to pop in and test the menu. Rest assured you'll be satisfied Would love to see more locations."}
{"text":"AVOID!!! Especially during lunch.  The service is just terrible and I'm quite certain they forgot my order because I just got soup and side salad to go and it cannot possibly take more than 30 mins to prepare that when I arrived earlier at 11:40am. The guy who was behind me got his food 20mins earlier and he did not preorder."}
{"text":"5/5 stars for venue (huge and has a sidewalk patio) and my soup+salad combo, but 4/5 stars for my partner's brunch.

Everyone should know by now that Fresh is pretty pricy, as are almost all vegan/gluten-free/health-conscious restaurants in the city. But because Fresh is a sit-down type of restaurant rather than order-at-the-front, the dishes are a bit pricier than say, Kupfert & Kim, and there's also tipping involved. 

I like this Fresh better than the one located on Spadina because the venue here is way more spacious, there's multiple types of seating (communal tables for working, private booths, tables, etc.), and the restrooms are cleaner. My soup+salad combo (large $12) today was fantastic - I loved the split pea soup, which was textured and hearty. It had hints of cinnamon and carrot and tomatoes. Very warm and filling. The grilled cornbread was great as usual, and even the superfood salad was fantastic. Loved the goji berries, almond shavings, and edamame. I recommend the House dressing, which contains apple cider vinegar and flax oil, and is not super creamy if you desire a lighter option like I did. 

My partner's brunch tex mex tortilla scramble, which came with brown basmati rice and vegan cheese sauce was much smaller than I expected, but the ingredients, like beans and avocado, were very hearty and sufficiently filling.

Very close to the Yonge and Eglinton subway station; great place for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Love Fresh! All their locations. More familiar with their location on Bloor street. Their food is phenomenal. For vegetarians like me, this is heaven 'cause I can eat everything on the menu!!! I wish they would open in Toronto suburbs as well. Keep coming back."}
{"text":"Everything is organic here! A perfect place for vegetarians/health concerned people. Food/drink are tasty; i would recommend their tofu steak(they don't make any meat). Only thing holding me from giving it a 5 star is its service, but it's good enough."}
{"text":"I came here last night since I couldn't be bothered to cook yet I wanted lots of veggies and a healthier option. This was the second time I've been here and all the food I've had is ridiculously tasty! I love the Buddha bowl and the Powerhouse was also delicious-- both with soba noodles.

The only drawback (and the reason for the missing stars) was that there was a misunderstanding and I was made to feel as though I was trying to take advantage of them.

I was greeted by a very kind server who complimented me on my earrings and then was led to a table. Before I sat down, I placed my order with the server and then went to use the bathroom. I think that because the music was loud I misheard the sizes when asked what I wanted. I thought they were offering \"regular\" and \"big\" sizes. I asked for the regular size for both dishes (one to eat in and one to go). When it came time for the bill I asked for a correction, which the greeter kindly corrected, but only one of two dishes. I asked for a second correction and the greeter kindly did so, but had a forced smile and look of doubt on her face that frankly made me feel like kind of a villain. I even tried to tip generously as a peace offering. In short they made amends and forced trying to be nice but in the end, I think they thought I was trying to make up a discount for myself.

I would gladly go back to the restaurant for the crazy delicious food and good service, but because of this incident, I don't want to risk going back to be \"that\" customer. This location is in an area that I frequent often, so it's unfortunate since now I will only be visiting other locations if the opportunity arises."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but they were so caught up with presenting their \"standard\" as an open faced burger that they would not even cut my burger in half!  Pathetic. As a restaurant owner myself I am justified to suggest they have to realize the customer is always right and to drop their arrogance of presenting it \"their way\" when they aren't the ones eating it. Wake up. Sad."}
{"text":"I am a super regular of fresh, they have a great menu, a lot of variety, and it's vegan!!! Their brunch is great, juices and smoothies are awesome you can either choose the super nutritious super healthy that taste really good or a smoothy that traste like sin (still good for you but they are drinkable desserts... not a bad thing at all)

The burgers are incredible, specially with all the toppings and dips they have (my faves are the picnic burger and the BBQ burger that comes with online ring ) 

Salads and bowls are great too, there's is something for everyone, for the carnivores as well!! I mean their menu is vegan (unless you see a * but they don't have any meat products) however that doesn't mean that the food isn't tasty, 
Try the poutin!!  They also have this new dragon fries yum 

I give them 4.5 stars just because it always seems they are shot staffed and the consistency of the portions (specially on brunch, specially the Tex mex scramble) depends who is in the kitchen, sometimes the portions are huge and sometimes too small... other than that I love it :)"}
{"text":"It is OK. Don't expect healthy, heck you can go healthy but then you miss all the good food. I had a burger, it was tasty, as were the onion rings but all was just average. The place was hopping so get there early. I have no real desire to go back there. What I can say is that the restaurant is great for non meat picky eaters."}
{"text":"I love this place :) Whether I am popping in for to go food, or catching up with friends! I really like their patio. I have had many things on their menu and always been pleased. My only critique would be that their add-on portions are very small. I added goat cheese to my salad and it was maybe a teaspoons worth, my friend added avocado and it was less than 1/6th of an avocado. Slightly pricey,but you cant beat the accessibility to fresh, healthy food. I love ginger shots :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a takeout rice bowl today and it was the exact opposite of FRESH. There were large chunks of rock solid brown rice and it tasted like it was leftover from yesterday's lunch. The roasted veggies were also disgusting and tsated lIke they were preared hours in advance. I am disappointed as I usually have good experiences ordering takeout and the food is alwas delicious. I ordered through the Maegan app and arrived to pick up my order at 1:08pm as indicated by the app as the time my order would be ready. 

I will NOT be spending my hard earned money here ever again. Get it together!"}
{"text":"I tried very hard to find some options near Yonge/Eglinton to eat for lunch. What do I want? Good food, reasonable prices, seating, no long lines, fast service. It was harder than I hoped. And somehow Fresh on Eglinton did not come up on Yelp when I searched \"lunch\".

BUT, I found it anyways after some more digging. I've been to other Fresh locations and I like this one most. It is spacious, very nice staff (moreso than other locations I found), and has pretty much all my factors checked. What it doesn't have? I'd say $11 for a wrap is a bit pricey, I'd rather spend like $8.50 for a wrap.

However, I ordered the Clubhouse Wrap with tofu and tempeh bacon which is quite good. It comes with a side kale salad which is nice addition.

Also tried one of the all green Green Juices and it was fine, but I thought it had a very large ginger/lemon flavor and could do with just a bit less.

The service though was very friendly and enjoyable. Only 3 blocks east from Yonge/Eglinton, and 3 blocks east is shorter than 3 blocks north/south, so closer on a winter afternoon!"}
{"text":"It's pretty easy to be a vegan in LA and NYC - my two main cities - but traveling can be tough and Toronto is not as vegan-friendly as my usual stomping grounds so when this Fresh opened it made my life easier since I'm usually in Toronto once a month. 

Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays they do brunch and that menu is 5 stars where I'd give dinner 4. I'm rounding up to support vegan restaurants so more will open. (That said, they have honey and optional cheese on the menu which is not vegan (boo hiss) but at least they very clearly state which items those are.*)   

The scrambled \"eggs\" are some of the best vegan eggs I've ever had and I eat a lot of these. I put their hot sauce** on them to add a little kick and while it is spicy there's also something sickly sweet about the homemade hot sauce that makes it less awesome than it could be. (Work on that one, team. You can do better.)

I generally get the Ace of Kales (yummy kale salad with nuts, green onions, avocado and tempeh bacon) and a side of scramble for brunch. Sometimes I switch it up and get the Superfood Salad and a side of cole slaw or I'll go for the Pancake Breakfast which is two pancakes (blueberry is my fave) & scrambled tofu with grilled vegan sausage. It's not a light meal but you are truly embracing the idea of \"brunch\" with this one. It's breakfast and lunch. Though technically it's all breakfast items. You're stuffed until dinner.

Other notables are:

-Quinoa onion rings with chipotle \"mayo\": decent portion (read: enough to make gluttonous me happy, probably too much for a normal person so maybe split them)

-Chipotle Bacon Burger (comes with tempeh bacon and jicama) or BBQ Burger (bbq sauce, quinoa onion rings (see above), garlic mayo, napa cabbage, banana chilies, lettuce & tomato)

- Bowls. All are good but my fave is the Buddha Bowl (marinated tofu cubes, tomato, cucumber, bean sprouts, & chopped peanuts tossed in Thai peanut sauce)

They have an entire side of the menu devoted to beverages with an extensive selection of juices (excellent but not cheap) (the fresh apple juice is thick and delicious and tastes as though you are literally putting a straw into an apple -- yum, and with fewer broken straws), smoothies, shots, shakes and hot drinks/elixirs (My thing to do when I don't feel well is take one of the immunity shots in hot water or drink the \"Ginger Fireball\" which is listed under Hot Drinks. When I'm visiting Toronto in the winter, I need these and they are a Godsend. They've also started selling cold pressed juices at the front of the restaurant to keep up with everyone else.

Also their coffee is decent (Americano). It's made to order and served with almond milk and it's pretty, pretty good. 

There is a paid parking lot a tiny bit south on the side street, accessible from either side. All you have to do is cross at the light and you're smack dab in front of the joint.

Notes to the restaurant:
* Vegan cheese has come a long way, baby. Some of the nut cheeses we have in LA (Kite Hill, Vromage and obviously Daiya) prove that you don't need ANY dairy in your \"cheese.\" And nobody \"needs\" honey. Agave is fine. Stevia is better. You should look into becoming 100% vegan. 
** Something is off with the hot sauce. Seriously. It's THISCLOSE to being great. Whatever you are putting in it as a sweetner needs to gtfo. ;) 
***Most importantly, thanks for existing."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan. I think vegans are lame. I'm also selectively not friends with vegans because you know, life is too short to be friends with vegans. Did I make myself clear here...? Ok moving on.

I was coerced into coming to Fresh because my two friends were already here. I looked it up online right away and my stomach sank when I saw that everything was veg....SIIIIIIGH. But I went. Praying that there would be beer...AND THERE WAS!!! Very limited wine and beer choices but I got a bottle of Flying Monkey for 6 bucks and it was nice. 

Location is meh for now, there's a lot of construction. It took the place of a really decent sushi place, Sushi O? Sushi One? I reviewed it i just dont remember the name...moving on.

Everyone working here is very hipster. Surprise surprise? They're nice through...a little slow, like they're pretending to be high because it's the cool thing to not give a shit. 
My friends ordered quinoa onion things, they're really dry. They taste fine for an ap but...they're really really dry and it's friggin quinoa!!! it's supposed to be good and healthy and stuff and you just went and DEEP FRIED IT?!?!?! ARE YOU ACTUALLY HIGH!? 

Then one of them ordered a salad. OMGGG this thing was amazing. It has tomatoes, mint, tahini, kale, figs, some kind of crispy fried onions?!!? SO GOOD. And i ordered a wrap and here's the kicker - WITH REAL CHEESE. Real, milky, beautiful goddamn CHEESE. Cheddar. I was like \"is it...real cheese...?\" and she was all like uuhhh yeah. Like i wasn't asking a legit question lady??? The wrap came with sprouts, lettuce, a lot of cheese, garlic \"mayo\", tofu cubes, avocado and some other goodies i think onions...all in all it was actually really tasty and it tasted like health but in a good way. In a \"ahhhh now i can have that midnight cheese burger and not feel so guilty because i just ate like a soccer mom back from yoga class.\" 

They also have ruuuuullll delicious spicy sauce. It looks peanuty. It's really spicy. I laff it. I wouldn't come back lol....because wtf, MAMA NEEDS MEAT. But i would recommend this to all you pour vegan and vegetarian souls.... (no offense doe, your body your diet)."}
{"text":"Fresh will always be my favourite vegetarian restaurant in GTA. I used to pop by a lot, since my office was located right next door. I always got the smoothie and cupcake deal for $7, which is a bargain for Fresh! Not sure if they still have this deal. I decided to swing by today, because it was customer appreciation day and most items from the menu was 30% off! I got my usual Buddha bowl, but with soba instead of rice. The soba costed an additional $2 for a large bowl. It was good, but not worth the extra $2. To save money, just get your bowl with rice instead. Bowl was filled with a generous amount of hearty ingredients on a bed of warm soba and peanut sauce. I felt like I did my body a favour by nourishing it today. Not sure when I'm returning again, because this place is kind of expensive."}
{"text":"I love Fresh and have had amazing experiences and wonderful food at all locations. I'm reviewing this one because it's the newest. My go-to is always the All Star salad. Generous portions of quinoa, sweet potato, tofu steaks, goji berries, and various other supreme ingredients rest atop a bed of shredded kale. I believe this salad is laced with crack because as soon as I take one bite I literally cannot stop until I have finished the entire thing--and trust me, it's a massive portion, easily two meals. Get it with the house dressing and you're set for a feast. 

That said, everything I have had at Fresh is awesome and you really can't go wrong. The holiday wrap. The quinoa onion rings (with avocado chipotle dip). The fresh juices and smoothies. The cashew cookies. Seriously, this local chain is delicious and true to its name: fresh. This is a vegetarian/vegan's paradise and although a meal can get pricey, it's 100% worth it. An easy 5/5."}
{"text":"Fresh has taken the traditional boring salad to a new level. Their combinations are mind-blowing. If they don't bottle their dressings, it should be the next step for this chain of healthy eateries. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I got the Buddha bowl and quinoa onion rings from this location and the total came to 22.00.  

The onion rings were warm and seemed like they've been sitting under the heat lamps for quite some time. They were chewy and bready and it seemed like the onion had deflated from sitting out too long.  I've had them before at the bloor location and they were much better. That fresh was also ten times busier with people lined up for a seat. The fresh on yonge and eglington was empty so that may explain the lack of \"freshness\" in the food. 

My  Buddha bowl was nothing to rave about... Heavy on peanut sauce light on any real flavouring to add depth.

The menu lacks creativity and just puts a bunch of the current health food trends in a bowl. 

You're paying for a fad."}
{"text":"Love Fresh!  Even though I'm not vegetarian or vegan. Just nice to know you're eating something somewhat healthy every now and then. Their onion rings with garlic sauce is unreal.  Only with that their prices weren't so crazy high.. $13 for pancakes!?!  I can make those at home for less than a dollar.  Other than that, fresh is awesome."}
{"text":"Best food you could eat! Everything is so fresh (ha ha), food comes out fast, service is good and there are always seats available. If not then max you will wait is 15 minutes. They have daily soup specials and monthly meal specials. I usually go for that but if not then its almost always Dragon (on soba, you wont regret it) or Tiger (rice or soba is nice). And if im feeling a salad then its usually the Transformer salad. My favorite part about eating at Fresh is how you feel after you leave. You feel amazing!"}
{"text":"Great welcoming service, good healthy food. Gluten-free and vegan. Immune-boostin juices and smoothies. Good tempeh bacon - smoky and crispy! Tofu scrambled eggs are not that tasty but their pancakes are super fluffy for being gluten-free. I have never been able to finish any of the dishes, they should make smaller portion sizes and charge a little less.
**Their Ace of Kales is the best thing on the menu!! I finished that dish.."}
{"text":"One of the few vegan-friendly places in the neighborhoods north of downtown.  It's really popular (a line of 20 waiting for them to open), the menu is great, and the food was wonderful.

98% of the menu is vegan.  There are a couple items with optional cheese and some use honey.  I don't know why they didn't just go that last 2%.  I know a lot of my vegan yelp friends would prefer a completely vegan kitchen.

I tried the green poutine.  Everything about it was great.  5 stars.

My niece (a picky carnivore) had one of their wraps but didn't like it.  I got to eat her other half as left overs and thought it was great."}
{"text":"I've been to Fresh more than 100 times over several years and been disappointed maybe once. The food is amazing (better at the downtown locations) and reasonably priced.  The menu changes enough to keep things interesting. Soups are great!"}
{"text":"For a person who is not vegan and was eating at a vegan place the first time, I very much enjoyed the food. I actually liked the quinoa crusted onion rings better than regular onion rings. I also had a cup of the corn chowder, which again was very delicious. Everything is priced reasonably as well. If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll definitely revisit. Wish they'd franchise out to the US."}
{"text":"This is a vegan/vegetarian paradise. You have no idea. Located in Midtown in the Yonge and Eglinton area, it's definitely a decent place for lunch. It'll make my lunch circuit for sure haha.

I got the Sam Houston burrito. It was really good, not gonna lie. Like really good compared to other veggie burritos I've had throughout the city. The slaw that I got with it, I didn't like too much, but hey, eating it made be feel healthy haha. It tasted like forest. That's when you know it's healthy. :P oh and the homemade hot sauce and BBQ sauce was pretty good I must say. The hot sauce had a tangy after taste, and the heat wasn't too overpowering. 
 
My hostess was really friendly and she was kind enough to make my mind up for me. I always like trying new things, and I use other people's opinions to judge for a decent meal haha. But she answered everything I needed to ask, and even more.

What amazed me the most was the fact that they had Indian Ayurvedic stuff for sale in the store. I was caught off-guard for sure. But I'm giving this place a 4/5 over a 5/5 because it's a bit on the pricier side of things. Don't get me wrong, their menu selection was epic for a vegetarian, but me being a university student, doesn't help the wallet haha. But I'll definitely come back here to treat myself to lunch from time to time :)"}
{"text":"I couldn't be less of a vegetarian if I tried and yet I consider Fresh one of my favorite restaurants. Three words: Quinoa Onion Rings.

So we walked into the joint at around 8:00 on a Wednesday and the place was hopping. (I suppose this explains why the service was disappointingly slow; we ran out of water about halfway through our respective meals but weren't given more until the cheque arrived.)

Anyway, given that this is Fresh, we just had to start with the aforementioned Quinoa Onion Rings. Honestly, I think these might just be my favorite onion rings in the city. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to remember any onion rings I've ever eaten that I've enjoyed more. Crispy and enormous, this is what an onion ring should be. We ordered them with a side of the Thai Peanut Sauce, although you really can't go wrong with any of Fresh's sauces. (Curry Mayo is probably still my all-time favorite.)

The one thing I did discover about Fresh a while ago is that if you're going to order a hamburger, order it as a wrap. They use an enormous whole wheat bun that's more distracting than anything else, whereas you can really taste each and every ingredient when you go with the wrap.

So the monthly special was the Banquet Burger (almond and grain burger with grilled tempeh bacon, fresh \"cheese\" sauce, garlic mayo, dill pickles, alfalfa, lettuce, tomato, and red onion), which I had to try just out of curiosity. And indeed, it did taste remarkably like a typical banquet burger. It was maybe a little dryer than I would've liked, but that was okay because we still had some Thai Peanut Sauce left and I dipped the wrap in that."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how much I love this restaurant. I have tried several menu items, and have yet to be disappointed. Their BBQ burger with the quinoa onion rings and the squash tacos are probably my top two picks. (With their signature hot sauce smothered over everything, of course!) Even my meat-loving boyfriend raves about this place! Always incredibly tasty and surprisingly filling. It is a definite must try. I have been to all 4 locations. I just wish they would get one in the Eastern end of downtown now!"}
{"text":"Visited this location with a group of 5 on a thursday evening. The place was absolutely packed but we were seated relatively quickly. Service was kind of slow however.

Food was great - had the quinoa onion rings to start and a tiger bowl for an entree. The bowl was a bit on the bland side so I added three huge spoonfuls of their hot sauce, which is delicious (but not very spicy). Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal. Portions sizes were very large and I took home about half my meal. 

Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hot mess in my opinion, yet I keep coming. The gluten free menu is kind of blah. Nothing very special, flovorful. It is always very fresh though so at least they're sticking with a theme. They have a whole drink menu for juices & smoothies. It's neat but so far the ones I have tried are nothing very good. I could make a better juice/smoothie at home to be honest. They are ALWAYS and I mean every single time I have gone here out of something on the menu. EVERY SINGLE TIME! I find it unbelievably annoying. The only thing really good on then menu is the brunch menu! So amazing. I go almost every weekend for it. It's very yummy!

The service is all over the place. The staff is very hit or miss but it's very agravating because you see them just standing around chatting.  Some of the wait staff has been lovely, others rather useless. I was there last weekend and I guess the kitchen was busy or something so it took them almost a n hour for are food to come. It wasteful. They took off are appetizer but still that's not the point. So slow. 

As an overall I recommend going for the brunch menu. If you are vegetarian or just vegan you might enjoy the place more then someone who need the gluten free menu."}
{"text":"First time trying Fresh, thought it was worth trying since the other locations had decent reviews. Although I'm not vegetarian, I was attracted to the very green menu. 

Dined here on a Friday night around 6:30pm and already it was pretty packed with a line for takeout as well. I thought this was a pretty good sign right?  Got seated shortly after we arrived. As soon as were seated we were given water, is it just me or did the glass smell heavily like very strong bleach! My friend agreed with me on this point and we opted to not drink it. 

Service here was very friendly and super attentive, asked us if it was our first time here and offered us the specials they had as well. My friend and I ordered the following: 
- Energizer
- The Wizard 
- Clubhouse wrap, added fries and chipotle dipping sauce for additional 3.75$
- Mushroom & onion. burger

Energizer was well blended and had good flavours. My friend thought The Wizard was too sweet for her liking. The Mushroom onion burger was pretty good but my friend wasn't a fan of the kale coleslaw. She thought it needed a different dressing. The Clubhouse wrap was really good and filling. The consistency of the dipping sauce was too thin and should not be called a dipping sauce, I felt it was more of a dressing. I would not recommend getting the dipping sauce. 

Overall, I would go there again and try something else from the menu. I felt the prices were fair for a vegetarian restaurant. Worth checking out? Yes I would say so."}
{"text":"never had a bad experience here
have gone there like 50 times
great coffee
weekend brunch
salads, bowls, etc etc
obviously if you are not ok with vegan substitutes for your usual non vegan diet you are not likely to enjoy it. service is usually excellent..."}
{"text":"The layout is confusing. I went to the front to order and apparently it is for take out only. Even though their credit card machine requested for tip. I paid a generous tip without any service thinking I'm going to get some service. There are no signs to indicate the rest of the seats are for dining in only so I sat down. No one came to service me at the dine in table for about fifteen minutes. One of the servers came over and told me I can't sit there. I told him I was confused about the layout and I wanted to sit in for my meal. But because I ordered at the front already, I got booted out to the front stores stool area only. What a disappointment. $20 for a meal and I sit in these u comfortable stools even though I told them I wanted to sit at the rest of the dining room.  I ordered the green detox and the ginger flavour was way too strong. I got the falafel taco. It's hard to even hold it to eat. Came out messy in the box. Don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"When I feel like pretending to be healthy I come here for the energy bowl. This place has me eating tofu and loving it! The curried chickpeas really make this bowl.

The prices are a little ridiculous considering the 'regular' size bowl is $18.50. It could be shared or saved for leftovers, but realistically I eat about 3/4 of it in one sitting because it's so good."}
{"text":"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. Your never ending freshness, healthiness, good value or top-notch service? Every time I come here, I'm in love with the food, the ambiance and the value. I especially love the squash tacos, the Buddha bowl and the smoothies (oh the smoothies!)."}
{"text":"Two vegans from NJ visiting to attend Kenny vs Spenny live at the Regent Theatre and Fresh was just down the block from where we were staying. And lemme tell you, I could eat at this place for 1000 daaaaays straight.

We ate here every day of our trip, having both bunch and lunch. The quinoa onion rings are 2 die for. Burgers were tasty AF, and we tried the poutine (had to) and it was so delicious...

The BF and I wished we could take this place back home with us...we'd be eating here on the daily, or at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places in Toronto and i'm not even a vegan! The first time my friend told me she's taking me here i thought the food would be bland however i was so wrong...ever since that visit i've taken all my friends there and they love it. The service is great as well! I usually get the tacos or burgers with poutine or onion rings. I would definitely recommend you try those because the flavors are out of this world! All my meat lover friends are obsessed as well. Also make sure to ask for the spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"The majority of the food here is great! I love having a healthy-ish takeout option in the neighbourhood. My go-tos are the falafel salad, monster protein salad, and holiday wrap. Recently tried a veggie burger which was good too. I removed a couple stars though as I've found some of the bowls really bland. Also don't find the service super warm, and as other reviewers have mentioned it's pretty pricey (although you also get large portions)."}
{"text":"Hit and miss at this location, but it's still a go to spot which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. 
I've tried a lot of items on the menu but find sometimes it's over sauced or inconsistent? Hasn't stopped me from going back, but honestly prefer the Queen St W location. 
Typically I share the onion rings and a salad. Or go with the soup and salad combo"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a dozen times, and finally remember to post my thoughts! 

I normally go after my yoga class nearby Friday nights (at 7ish?) and luckily there are always seats available. I recently fell in love with their Transformer salad- it has marinated cubed tofu, adzuki beans, edamame, and a tonne of other goodness! Their tofu wrap, mushroom veggie burger, dosas, cashew cookies are also delicious!

They have also started selling cold pressed juice...though I love Fresh and a lot of items on their menu, I still prefer juice from Greenhouse Juice."}
{"text":"I am pretty obsessed with this chains burgers. I've had 3 of hem and none have ever disappointed me, I find the chipotle burger and the BBQ burgers are the best. 

I ordered the tofu taco and cheese sauce on the side and have to say it was pretty disappointing. The cheese sauce come out cold, and he taco lacked I'm flavor and the overall texture was pretty unpleasing. I had a lemonade that didn't seem to have any sugar in it, so that wasn't very fun.

My friends had their Buddha bowl and that was pretty good.

So its a lot of mixed reviews, but I'm hoping to try more on their menu and hopefully get a better experience"}
{"text":"Food here was surprisingly really good and this is coming from someone who loves meat and cheese. The quinoa onion rings were amazing. Super crunchy. Even my boyfriend loved it. I also had the beach bowl with goat cheese and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the baby size and it was a good enough portion. My boyfriend got the mushroom burger of which he enjoyed. I thought it was a little dry. The fries were actually really good and the mushroom gravy was so good, I would drink it... but I didn't. Overall I'd definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"After the gym nothing like a protein backed mushroom burger at fresh. This is probably my favourite dish on the menu, and it is not that pricey. I have heard from many people that to eat at this place it is pricey, for myself I don't mind paying alittle more money for good quality food. The service is quick and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Very busy and in the heart of Midtown Toronto. I had actually never heard of the place before and came here because I was in the area and a friend wanted to try it. 

Their burger portions are pretty decent. I added a side of sweet potato fries for $3.50 to my burger (which if I remember correctly are made of almonds and grain), and the portion was HUGE. Needless to say, I had trouble finishing and I was actually quite hungry when I arrived. I sat right where the orders were picked up so I saw every dish they brought out. Everything was plated beautifully and instagram worthy. They have gender neutral restrooms, and the restrooms themselves are also really nice inside. I'll definitely be bringing my vegan friends here next time!"}
{"text":"This place makes me want to be a vegetarian!  Service was friendly and attentive and reasonably fast given the huge lunch crowd.  Incredibly large selection of offerings on their menu.  I went with the squash falafel tacos which were crunchy filled goodness with a soft well seasoned center. My partner went with one of the vegetable rice bowls that was quite ample in portion and also well seasoned and presented.  Large variety of juices and cold pressed drinks, all quite delicious. Overall and excellent meal and a restaurant that I intend to frequent!"}
{"text":"1 Carnivore & 1 Vegetarian walk into Fresh.. 1 hour later, 2 Vegetarians walk out. 

No word of a lie Fresh on Eg can make you say bye bye to your meat and become a Vegetarian. Every since becoming a Vegetarian I have dined at Fresh on the reg...I took on the biggest challenge and brought my meat-loving friend for lunch to show her HOW AMAZING this restaurant was. 

Saturday Lunch time was busy but thankfully the patio was open- which opened up a lot more tables. The bright colours and open concept is so welcoming, so were all the smiles on the servers faces!

We started with a few apps: 
Buffalo Cauliflower : crispy cauliflower with spicy buffalo sauce, creamy ranch dip, hemp seeds & celery sticks--- Don't let the word CRISPY turn you away, it was more of a light crisp... not overly deep fried like tempura.  Although the texture is nothing like a chicken wing, if you closed your eyes it tasted just like a buffalo chicken wing. The sauce is not overly spicy, just a little bite towards the end. 

Quinoa Onion Rings: hand-crafted, coated with breadcrumbs & puffed quinoa w/ dip-- WINNER WINNER WINNER..Onion rings have never tasted so good and FRESH. Perfectly crisp with a burst of flavour in every bite. Next time I would order 2x orders of these. 

Mains:
Flying Cashew Burger: avocado, quick pickled yellow beets, garlic mayo,
red cabbage, grated carrot & fresh cashew cheese -- since we were sharing this we asked to have it served in a WRAP (smartest idea ever).. honestly, I can't really explain the flavour in this burger..it was just deliciousness in every bite. It was moist, not dry and was SUPER COLOURFUL! I felt energized after eating it... not sluggish like I used to feel after eating a beef burger. 

Phytosalad: assorted organic microgreens, sprouts & flowers with soba
noodles, lettuce, edamame, crispy onions, grilled tofu steaks,
toasted mixed nuts, napa cabbage, fresh mint, lemon, lime &
sun-dried tomatos--- Instaglammers you're going to want to order this salad for the photo ops. Not only does it come piled high ..but the presentation and EDIBLE FLOWERS on top is a game changer. This salad is literally the coolest salad ever, it has soba noodles on the bottom and crispy onions on the top. It comes with the 3*6*9 dressing, I asked for the house because I wanted something lighter- excellent choice. 

Service:
I swear every-time I looked up to ask for a straw..napkin..more water, a waiter was there waiting! It was the most enjoyable experience. 

So... carnivores, I have a challenge for you.. COME EAT A VEGETARIAN MEAL... you will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Love fresh! Sad they got rid of the hummus though... as well as they used to give you dressing on the side and now they put dressing on the food. Those are my reasons for not having 5 stars but otherwise this place is very good! 

The onion rings are soooo good and if you love curry you NEED to get the energy bowl sub soba noodles. Trust me... you'll thank me later. 
p.s. their hot sauce is crack. get the hot sauce... GET IT 

I love this location and they have a cute patio which is so perfect for a nice lunch with a friend!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this vegan restaurant but really wasn't impressed with the place. We arrived around 2pm on a Thursday and the place had a decent sized crowd (always a good sign). The service was super slow though and took about 25 minutes to even get somebody's attention to take our order. We ordered the quinoa friend onion rings which were really good but also very limited in size. I ordered the Buddha bowl which looked really good on the menu. However the actual bowl had a huge portion of brown rice and very little vegetables/tofu by proportion. I had to leave most of the rice behind. My husband ordered the falafel tacos which were really dry. Not coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I often eat at Fresh. Naturally, when it's busy, service is slow but today (Labour Day) it wasn't too busy and our food came quickly. Here are a few of our favourite items so far:
-Quinoa onion rings: a must try but share it with someone (large portion) and get a dip like the chipotle mayo
-Poutine: it's ok says my husband who loves his poutine
-Squash tacos: my husband's all time favourite thing to get. He adds aged cheese and a side of fries and he's set.
-Chipotle bacon burger: just tried this today and I really liked it. I'm usually not a fan of veggie burgers but this one is not your typical veggie burger. I also liked the addition of jicama in it. 
-Bowls: I usually get a baby size bowl on soba noodles. I have tried the dragon and Buddha and both were delicious. If you like the taste of peanuts, get the Buddha. 
 
Items we didn't enjoy (but others may disagree)
-Green poutine: let's just say my husband doesn't like the idea of vegetables in his poutine 
-Brunch burrito: huge portion but I was not a fan of the fake scrambled egg (scrambled tofu) they put in it. It was bland and I needed to add hot sauce"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the quality of their food, this location should be a 0 star when their entrance is cramped for those who use a wheelchair,or walker,maybe even arm crutches.When this location's busy,you're competing with those awaiting their carry out smack in the entrance if you want to get a table.It's no surprise Fresh wants to maximize table turnover and sales volume,but to build a carry out counter right into the already narrow \"entry\" area makes the place inaccessible for the disabled with larger assisted devices. AODA requires businesses to be accessible in the near future."}
{"text":"Always impressed at Fresh! This location is one of (don't quote me on this) four (?) locations, so I would consider it to be a chain type restaurant.  Their weekly specials, however are where the fun is at! It injects a nice variety into to their otherwise standard menu.

My 2 cents:

Pros: easy access to public transportation, patio, large menu, quick-ish service

Cons: can be very loud, tables are very close together"}
{"text":"We love Fresh. We go to the Eglinton restaurant quite often and their food is generally at par with their other locations (for the first couple months there was some wobbling, especially with the Tiger Bowl, but they seem to have gotten into the swing of things.)

However, I'm going to agree with the other reviewer about the accessibility issues. A lot of the seating options are on a raised platform, in non-accessible booths, or up a small set of stairs. There only seems to be one small pocket of accessible seating. If you use a wheelchair (or stroller) there is only one or two tables you can use. If those tables are occupied the wait can be lengthy. The patio is an option only if the weather is right (and not at all during the winter months).

So, if you have several children with you who need their strollers, or you do use a wheelchair, be prepared to wait or get take-out. It really is a shame. The food is excellent but the layout is less than inclusive."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian (nothing with a face!) and a Celiac, and this is one of the only places in the city of T.O.I can pretty much gorge until I need to be rolled home...all while smiling about the yummy meal I just had.


Great, friendly service with a smile, and creative menu ideas. My personal fav is the Buddah Bowl, and my bf (who eats everything!) always orders one of the Burritos. We are also both addicted to their freshly made Ginger Ale (basically ginger, agave, and soda water...and basically the best ginger ale you've ever had, though I like to order with a touch less agave than usual and my bf likes a touch more.)

Brunch is also an incredible treat here for anyone Celiac, who wants an actual brunch on Sundays. Eggs are basically all I can order safely when I'm out for breaky, and when I'm at home I get creative... 

But at Fresh, you can get pancakes and waffles gluten free and they're ACTUALLY yummy! For anyone who physically CAN'T eat this stuff...y'all know who you are and what I mean...will feel so relieved to know that there is an option that tastes good, for a decent price, that won't make you sick for days once you get home. 

If you're not a \"Veggie\", or a Celiac, I still strongly encourage you to do yourself a favour, and at least try a super healthy smoothy next time you walk by this awesome restaurant. It's just too bad they aren't on every corner!"}
{"text":"I cannot fault this place. 

I've never had a bad meal here. 

The staff are great, the service is excellent, the food is top notch and I love the tunes! 

The menu is huge so there's definitely something for everyone and almost everything on the menu is Vegan. I usually order a wrap with some onion rings (to die for!) and I can NEVER finish it. (My eyes are way bigger than my belly when I come here!)

The prices are very reasonable when you consider the sheer volume of food and the quality of the food, too. 

I quite enjoyed their espresso, too. 

Good job, Fresh!"}
{"text":"This location is accessible, the front door leads directly to Eglinton Ave. With all the construction going on for the new Metrolinx LRT,  It's hard enough to walk here, let alone drive. Try to leave the car at home. It's close to TTC's Eglinton Station, which is also surrounded by construction. This is the third Fresh location I've been too and the food is great. They have healthy and unhealthy vegetarian and vegan options and good portion sizes. I've tried the Buffalo Cauliflower, sweet potato fries, Quinoa Onion rings (fav), Happy Birthday Donut, and a burger. I recommend the chipotle mayo. All the sauces I've tried so far, though, have been great. There is a patio out front. Only complaint is the seating. The restaurant space is a bit tight, all the chairs and tables are pretty close. The booths are comfortable enough, the chairs less so."}
{"text":"My new favourite vegan place! Ordered the squash tacos with a side of fries. So delicious!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I can't say how impressed I was about this place. A friend recommended to get the buffalo wrap (Vegan) as well as the Cauliflower Wings (Vegan) but it was amazing. Omg I've never had something so good and that healthy. The wings were probably my favourite part, if you didn't know they weren't cauliflower you probably wouldn't have noticed other then the texture. But it really tasted amazing. Will 100% go back. Just hate all the traffic in the area"}
{"text":"These Fresh on [Insert Location Here] offer a very consistent experience. The Fresh on Eglinton is no different. You've got the super crammed seating, the hip looking servers, the pricey vegetarian food, the long waits, and the loud clamor.

The food itself is A-OK. I used to be a vegetarian and came to the Fresh locations a lot, but haven't really eaten at one since switching years ago. I used to love the tasty vegetarian food compared to the awfulness I would have to endure usually (i.e. my own awfully tasting vegetarian food). Now that I'm not a vegetarian, though, I find the food not nearly as tasty and enjoyable as I remembered it. It isn't to say that the food got worse, just that my palate has changed. Meat eaters who must have their meat should avoid this place. Otherwise it's a good choice."}
{"text":"Amazing! I love Quinoa onion ring with Garlic mayo dip! Their food is really fresh like the name\"Fresh\". Now they are on my number one brunch restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive things about this place. 

They have plenty of indoor and outdoor (weather permitting) seating. Immediately upon walking in, you're greeted and seated. 

The menu is front and back. Simple and easy to follow. This is a vegan place, so eating here is easy for a vegan like me. 

The food was AMAZING. except the tofu scramble. My friend and I didn't like it. It had a weird texture and seasoning. But everything else was on point. The buffalo tofu wrap was just spicy enough and absolutely tasty. The burger was so complex and had great toppings on it. The fries were perfectly salty. We got chipotle mayo and dipped the fries in them. SO GOOD. 

The brunch food was also amazing. We got blueberry pancakes and they were delicious. The baked beans on the full breakfast plate were unique. I would have never thought to put those together but very well done. 

Overall, amazing food, decent prices, and great staff. They were friendly and very attentive. 

PLEASE open locations in New York!"}
{"text":"Love the quinoa rings and Buddha Bowl on rice. Phone in take-out very slow though. Had to pass a few times because they never answered their phone or put me on hold for over 10 minutes."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. I love everything I try! Today I had the Thai salad and a gluten free walnut brownie for dessert. I love the seating options at this location too. Bring your non-veg friends here to blow their mind :)"}
{"text":"Pretty ok. It's packed in there and while I enjoyed it, just wasn't 100% my thing. I felt my menu item was misleading. I ordered squash tacos and they came with big pieces of fried squash. I don't want fried, nor was it indicated that it was going to be. So I was very disappointed as I assumed that as a vegetarian place I would be getting healthy options but then it came as squash basically soaked in oil. Not happy about that. The lunch service took quite long. I would hope that a spot near many offices would figure out how to get people in and out in an hour but that wasn't the case. So one of our colleagues ended up having to leave early. When he asked the server to box up his plate, she told him, \"it's already on the plate about to come out\" and seemed frazzled about having to box it up. I mean it's not complicated, just bring the meal back to the kitchen and put in a box. She immediately brought the check too, meanwhile my other colleague and I weren't leaving and would have felt like we could order juice, drink or even dessert if we wanted to. It was an odd experience. 

I'll give a thumbs up to portion size, you basically get two meals for the price of one."}
{"text":"By far one of the best vegan/vegetarian places I've been to. My best friend took me here and I'm in love. All of the staff was super friendly and nice (even through the busy times) and the food was amazing! Their poutine is worth trying for sure!! Had their soup and salad combo of the day and was definitely filling. They have large portions so be prepared, we had leftovers and we split the poutine. One of my go-to places now for when we head downtown. Also tried one of their healthy green detox juices. Best thing I've ever had. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I adore FRESH restaurants. I am NOT vegan or vegetarian and I must say I love every single item on the menu. I have tried so many delicious items there and not a single one was a miss. I have a friend who eats mostly vegetarian options and she ADORES this place. It is somewhere where vegetarians and non vegetarians can enjoy. The food is absolutely delicious and is so good for you but also feels guilty. I have brought some meat obsessed friends here and not a single person has ever left saying they didn't like it.

The drinks are amazing as well, every single one is tasty and carefully curated. My only negative comment is that this place is EXPENSIVE. It is definitely something you are treating yourself to"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised! I tried the holiday wrap and squash tacos with a side of sweet potato fries and dragon fries and everything was really good. The portions were big and the toppings/fillings were generous - I was super full by the time I was done. The dragon fries were pretty interesting - fries drenched in some kind of miso sauce (tasted like nutritional yeast to me) with green onions and banana peppers on top. Only downside to this place is that it has a kinda higher price point. Otherwise, would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I got really lucky and ended up visiting during their customer appreciation night and getting my meal at 50% off, so I pigged out!! I sat at the bar which is super convenient for eating solo, but all the other tables and booths look very cozy as well! The place was crazy busy but service was super fast none-the-less! Each time another employee went by they assured I was doing okay! I got a smoothie (banana mango coconut) which I chugged cause it was too good to put down. Followed that by quinoa onion rings, every restaurant in the world can learn from this recipe. They are filling too, just so ya know! Next I had the \"powerhouse\" bowl, which is like three meals stuffed into this massive bowl. I took some home (which I never need to do) to save room for a cookie for desert! The prices are all reasonable and totally worth it!! Enjoy it, you won't find another place as veganly beautiful as this one!"}
