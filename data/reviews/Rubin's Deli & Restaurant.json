{"text":"My first time here and this place is in my own town!  How have I missed this gem hidden in plain sight?!!!  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Extensive menu, but most everything was frozen, cooked to order
Stick with the deli selections, or maybe the daily special.
The sides are just a generic bag of chips - kinda shotty.
A 1/4 lb burger was $6, while a 1/3 lb burger was $8 - a little pricey considering the chips (and nothing else).
Beer prices were also a little high - paid $7 for a local microbrew
Get take-out."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly environment with a full bar. A hidden little gem in Elyria where I will return time and time again."}
{"text":"Solid food and lots of deli classics.  It has a classic dinner feel to it with good friendly service. 

I ordered the pastrami and corned beef combo sandwich, its a 3 layer monster which I was able to devour.  Also had the matzoh ball soup, it hit the spot and warmed me right up.  Perfect soup for dealing with all this snow.  My co-worker order the tuna melt which he swears by, its the best he ever had.  

Will be hitting it up next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I ordered the Beef and Latkas. Basically this is a corned beef sandwich made out of potato pancakes and corned beef. 

The corned beef wasn't bad. Seemed to be a little processed but not bad. From there we drove off a cliff. The two potato pancakes were dry, very dark in color and had absolutely no taste. In fact, they were downright terrible. It was almost like they came pre made like toaster waffles and someone warmed them up. Please understand that I'll eat just about anything.....but yuck. I added a very small bowl of apple sauce for $2 and landed up using that and a small container of sour cream that came with the meal in an attempt to moisten up these things. It didn't work.

My friend had a different sandwich and said it was good. $33 was a bit pricy for what we got."}
{"text":"We ordered a couple of wraps and while good, we found them a little small for the price. Service was good."}
{"text":"who woulda thought, matzoh ball soup amazin. great find for great food. and they can make a Manhattan ."}
{"text":"Ive never had a bad meal here.  Their matzo ball soup is wonderful.  I've only really had the deli section and have never been disappointed my fiance always gets the hummus which I think is disgusting  but she says it's great."}
{"text":"No complaints . Waitress was good and friendly. Food was everything you would expect, prices reasonable and portions large,but not excessive. Service was fine. Decor was lacking a bit, but the place was clean. Lots of families eating out, must be a popular place for locals. I would go back here !"}
{"text":"You probably wouldn't guess that a place called Rubin's Deli & Restaurant would have the best quesadillas around, but they do!"}
