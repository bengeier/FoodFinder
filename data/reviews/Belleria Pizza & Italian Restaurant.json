{"text":"The area's best pizza by far!  If I were grading this restaurant on their pizza only it would be 5 stars.  However, guest services could be a little better.  My experience has been that beverage orders take too long (in part because of having been seated for several minutes before order is taken) and second server follow-up is inconsistent (i.e. making sure we have everything as ordered and that we are satisfied). Not to say they haven't improved, because when they were located on E. Main St., I wouldn't have been able to give any higher than a 2-star rating on most occasions, which could have been due to staff shortage.    Overall, a great choice for dinner and much improved experience!"}
{"text":"All of their food is very good and reasonably priced.  However, I don't think moving to Acorn Alley was a good idea.  The new space is not  easily accessible  to older people who aren't going to want to search for parking in a busy downtown area, climb the stairs to the entrance or pay money to park in a parking deck.   The new dining area is oddly shaped and they don't have the salad bar.  I miss the salad bar.   I hope they can make it their new location."}
{"text":"Super delicious wedding soup and pizza. Can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"Great salad bar and peperoni rolls.  Hopefully the decor will be nicer when they move."}
{"text":"No changing table! The decent food was spoiled by the fact that my son (3 mo) had to sit in his poop and pee while I held him, making me wet from his blow out :(. I'll change my review to more stars if a changing table is added."}
{"text":"Thiis place is so basic. The food wasn't gross, just bland and not at all interesting or exciting. Decor is the same, super sterile feeling. Service is well intentioned, but we heard the phrase \"I'm so sorry \" so many times to so many people.  They just seemed kind of clueless. I wouldn't ever go here again."}
{"text":"Very good food! Their fries are amazing! Italian hoagie is really good. We ordered their breadsticks as an appetizer and they were awesome! Pizza was excellent!"}
{"text":"Fresh salad bar, great lunch specials, love their individual pizzas. Great bang for the grad student buck."}
{"text":"The pizza at Belleria was delicious and it was reasonably priced. In addition, the restaurant was new and clean. I would not hesitate to recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Service continues to dissapoint.   Every time we call for delivery,  we are put on hold forever.  Sometimes they pick bAck up, sometimes they don't and you have to re call.  Tonight, after an 11 min. wait on hold, my wife called on her phone, got right thru, and was told they were out of 12\" Pizza- their large- at 7:40 PM !  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"It was late on a visit to Kent at the college.  The food was ok but the service was very good.  Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Belleria as a chain is great, I've been eating at the Youngstown area locations my entire life.  Other than the pizza which is great, the Kent location leaves a lot to be desired.  The restaurant is really loud, even when people are casually talking.  The service is hit and miss, usually miss and the wait for your entree can be very long.  The pasta dishes are usually ok, but other entrees can be hit and miss.  French fries and cheese triangles are usually undercooked.  Salad dressings all taste pre made and processed, so you might want to bring your own.  One glaring omission from this belleria franchise is a great homemade oil and vinegar based Italian dressing.  Every other belleria I've been to has one.  The coupons are inconsistent and borderline shady.  Tip - if you use an entertainment coupon for buy one menu item get one free, don't get an appetizer because it will count as a menu item and you won't get the full value of the coupon.  Coupons are supposed to encourage people to spend more money, not discourage.  If you must go to this location, get delivery.  It will take about an hour to show up, but is usually warm."}
{"text":"Good venue. You get your money's worth. Belleria is primarily an Italian eatery but they also have other options. The menu is concise and appropriately designed for the restaurant.   The service is good. My friends and I had ordered pasta from here in different variations. The sauces all tasted the same. The food tends to be greasy to my liking. I got the Eggplant Parmesan and all I could taste was a mound of mozerella cheese, which, I had to remove before eating. You would get the option of going to the salad bar which isn't the best in terms of variety but the items are rather fresh.  The pizzas here are the best. They are freshly made and are very reasonably priced. The crust is also cooked to perfection. They also have good range of appetizers, you just have to makle sure they dont pour oil over it - they do tend to come out gresier than what I am used to.   This restaurant is located in a college town and is definitely worth every penny for a college student. In terms of quality of the food, they can definitely do a much better job.  I would definitely go there again if I am in a mood for freshly cooked pizza."}
{"text":"I really like Belleria.  Mostly, I get their pizza or wings but I've had entrees, lunch specials, and appetizers and have never been disappointed.  It's not to be compared with some \"fine Italian\" type dining like you'll find in Cleveland's Little Italy but then again, it's not meant to be. Service has always been good. Their pizza is fantastic, I'd consider it among the best in Kent with my fave here being the Bella.  Wings are also good - nice and crispy outside - and great in hot parmesan."}
{"text":"I've had Belleria a few times during the summer and early fall and was thoroughly impressed with their NY style pizza. I have dined on location and also taken pizzas to go.  The servers are quick and friendly- no problems there. And, the pizza is pretty good. However, the last couple times have been less than satisfactory and all due to breakdowns in communication. The first issue was that sauce was left off of a NY style mushroom pizza that I added spinach to. Even then, it wasn't too shabby. The second, and most recent, incident included a few missteps. First was that banana peppers were put on the pizza instead of jalapeños, which I asked for. Second, I asked that there were no onions on my antipasto salad. Third, I found a piece of sausage on my mushroom and \"pepper\" pizza. Lastly, after taking a glance at the pizza at the counter I told the hostess that there were banana peppers on the pizza when the ticket so clearly said jalapeños. She literally said nothing to any effect of wanting to help and I ended up paying $25 for a pizza I didn't want and a salad that was laden with undesired onions.   Now, am I too good to eat some banana peppers? No. Was I gonna make a big deal about it and ask them to make it again? No. But, what I do expect is some type of accountability for that type of mistake. Maybe hook a sister up with a free 2 liter or take my name down and discount my next order.   Obviously, my issues at Belleria don't include the quality of the food or waitstaff but simply the lackluster attitude of the hostess, and thereby the business, for not emphasizing the value of their repeat customers by owning up to and fixing mistakes."}
{"text":"Good food, boring dining area. Feels like dining in a hallway. The pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"First time visiting Belleria on Saturday evening for a girls night out.  Cenenna was the sweetest server we could have asked for!  We decided to try a few menu items and share them so we could enjoy as much of their menu as we could!  The homemade italian breadsticks served with marinara were delicious as well the appetizer platter!  We decided to split a pizza and we were so happy we did!  It was fantastic.  The crust, sauce and variety of meat toppings were perfect!  I cannot wait to go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We ate here on our way home to canton from wild water kingdom in aurora. We were looking for a quick bite preferably Italian so we tried this place. Omg...we ordered garlic breadsticks for our appetizer they were very good light, fluffy and just the right amount of butter and garlic. We each got salads and the house balsamic was great also! Good came out quick and I have to admit it's probably my new favorite their marinara sauce was so good!!"}
{"text":"Huge Menu. Reasonably priced. Great tasting food. Awesome ambience."}
{"text":"Belleria is located in the newer Acorn Alley right off of Kent State University. I stopped here for a bite before an event and was so jazzed to try this place. The area off of Kent State has developed greatly since I went to school. Belleria offers inexpensive Italian fare, mostly pizzas, pasta and sandwiches.  The interior is cute and spacious and overlooks Acorn Alley with big windows from a second floor. When I visited, I was the only person in there at an off-time... and I waited 30-40 minutes for a salad. I was honestly falling asleep in the chair. Don't get me wrong, the salad was fine, but you know, its hard to mess up a salad. My server was super nice, but clearly, something is up with their kitchen.  I guess one might come to expect that with a college-oriented eatery. My salad was fine, but next time, I'll order takeout pizza. They also had a patio outside, but it was a little hot out. I won't be rushing anytime soon, but I bet the college kids love Belleria!"}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza at a good price. We do their Thursday nite special for $10.99, you get a 12\"-3 topping pizza. Their sauce is slightly spicy, lots of toppings and a nice crust (minimal edge, slightly soft). Just wish they were a little easier to get to but well worth the trip down town, park next door or on Erie St. So if you're looking for an upgrade to the Pizza Hut or Pappa Johns, try Belleria."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried it for the first time.  I had the combo: cavatelli and cheese ravioli with a couple of meatballs, she had the portabella parmesan, each with salads.  I had a glass of wine (overpriced at $7) and she had some sort of fruity drink.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly good; just kind of bland, run-of-the-mill Italian food, completely unremarkable.  Kind of like a better company cafeteria.  And the service, while very friendly, was so slow.  There were like 5 waitresses running around, but they didn't seem to getting things done in an efficient manner.  I see no reason to come back."}
{"text":"Always really liked this place. Basic Italian food with big portions and a good bang for your buck. Nothing fancy, but if you aren't looking for high end, this is your place. I got a fish special and there was enough food for 8 people!  The calzones are also fantastic! If you eat there, the salads are great, however if you order takeout, the salad leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Best curly fries around. Excellent pizza and sandwiches. Loved the Italian sandwich. The service was slow though and they don't have their hours of service present. All in all a great place for pizza sandwiches and fun"}
{"text":"Wow. Was there recently with the family. Pizza was good however we overheard the owner yelling at the kitchen staff so loudly. Very unprofessional!  Very awkward.  The owner needs to take a step back if he acts like that all the time."}
{"text":"I went here on a girl friend date a couple weeks ago and we had a great experience! We both got the chicken parm and it was great! Huge portions and everything tasted great. Their house dressing was AMAZING i want to buy a bottle of it!!! Nice place if you want to sit down for dinner but nothing too fancy. I've recently transitioned to gluten free and I'll be returning to try out their gluten free pasta soon!"}
{"text":"Living in North East Ohio, I made it my mission to find the best pizza around. So tired of corporate food chains. I went up to Little Italy, Cleveland, Akron, Sharron, PA. all over and not one place beat out Belleria Pizza & Italian Restaurant.  My go to pizza is \"The Bella\" Half sheet baked goodness with both onions and black olives. The first bite you take and your taste buds are filled with delicious Italian herbs and zesty garlic flavors. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. The pizza and all their bread products are simply wonderful. \"Let's go get some pizza!\""}
{"text":"As a returning customer I was disappointed in the service. My table waited for pizza for about 40 minutes when it shouldn't take that long and we didn't even get rolls. Also, our waitress barely checked in with us."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. Having ordered in the past from Belleria's previous location we tried our favorites again for a family celebration. So very disappointed....The chicken alfredo dish was no longer rich and creamy and had a bitter after-taste.(like chemicals) Although the chicken was tender, the dish was not palatable. The worst part of our meal was the beans and greens dish that had become a staple each time we ordered in the past. This dish was bad--I mean really bad. Each of us spit it out. It was a pile of disgusting mush with a few beans thrown in. Truly this place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Stopped in real quick with my son. Had a super slice of pep with a pop for $3. Pizza was good, service was fast. The place was super clean and the patio seating is nice.   During lunch hours they offer a buffet.  Didn't experience much, but what I did experience was great."}
{"text":"You get your monies worth here!  Lots to choose from and kid friendly.  Casual atmosphere with an average noise level.  Food is tasty but not the greatest I've had.  I did however have excellent service.  My drink was always full and all my needs and that of my kids were always met!  The staff was very polite and present!  I never had to look far for help!"}
{"text":"It has been a while and since decided wqnt to go to our Kent $5 movie night and had a bogo we decided to make trip to Acorn Alley.  We ordered mozzarella cheese triangle wedges with a smooth marinara.  Oir meals came with warm rolls and salad i had their balsamic dressing. They were accommodating when my son requested cheese for salad. And didnt need to ask for drink refills. He ordered rigatoni baked with mozzarella cheese and enjoyed that. I had the cavatelli with two homemade meatballs and smooth marinara sauce. Really good. Just would request lighter on the sauce.  A lot of food. Took over 1/2 home. If wasnt so warm would have eaten outdoors.  Love Acorn Alley so many good choices."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden but it's worth visiting... try their Hawaiian pizza!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a pretty bad experience here.  The food was not to the level of Olive Garden, but my bill was the same as if we were to have taken the family to Olive Garden.  Our server did not check on us once while there even though our table was the closest to the kitchen.  Everyone had to walk by us to go anywhere.  It was just a disappointing experience for $60 for my family of two adults and two kids."}
{"text":"Best pizza around - always get the Newyork Style with sausage. Also, get the lasagna on sundays is HUGE and as tasty as it is swimming in marinara (I always remove mine and put it on a plate to save it from drowning).  Their dinner rolls are also one of the tastiest things on the planet and come with a tasty whipped butter from landolakes.  The cheese ravioli is STUFFED, and great value.    This is better than most 5 star itallian places, and it'a s pizzeria.  Go there, you will not be disappointed."}
