{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Was busy but were able to find a couple seats at the bar and decided to eat there.  Staff was friendly but not very well trained.  I ordered the steak and the wife ordered the pasta bowl.  Steak was full of fat and pasta was just ok.  Better sauce can be had in a jar at any grocery store.  They really need to step their game up with the food quality if they want to make it."}
{"text":"Tonight we had 6 women who dined at this great eatery. Only 1 person had eaten here before.  We were warmly greeted. We changed our reservation to eat on the patio which was no problem. We had such great service. Even the owner came out to se if everything was ok. We all had an appetizer of the garlic bread which was awesome. We all ordered something different as entrees. Everyone was so very satisfied with our expertly prepared meals.  Too full to try dessert. The drinks were expertly made. No complaints. We all wish the restaurant well on their new venture."}
{"text":"Service was really slow on an early Saturday dinner. The waitress was new, but only had a few tables. 
Food was ok; not bad, but not real tasty.
I'm not big on Italian - it has to be real good Italian for me to want to go back.
Pretty limited beer selection"}
