{"text":"Just opened recently, and I would say as Jack-In-The-Boxes go, this is one of the nicer ones. Dining room is pretty small, and every time I've gone there the tables were dirty because nobody is cleaning them, but otherwise its a nice place in an area with limited low-cost options."}
{"text":"Sitting in line @2am. I get it. It's late. I get it people are drunk. But to make the entire line wait when a single car wants to sit there for 15 min......really? You are called \"fast food\". Idk about you but fast food in not considered fast when you wait in line for 20+ min. No apology....poor customer service. Even though you are a fast food chain I'm still taking the time to write a review.  Have a little more pride in what you do and how you serve the people paying your paychecks."}
{"text":"Do not eat here ever.  Tacos were stale. Bread on sandwich was a hockey puck. Ice tea was from the toilet.  I would definitely put this below dog food"}
{"text":"Store is kinda dirty...  But the store manager is the nicest guy ever!!!  I would come back again to eat if I was in the area and wanted these amazing tacos."}
{"text":"I have been going to this jack in the box since I moved to this side of town for about three years now and I have always had decent experiences. Today I went in there to use the bathroom I just went through the drive through and I got inside and tried to go into the bathroom and for one it was locked which I absolutely hate. For one its unsanitary for the workers to go unlock the bathroom every time and secondly it is just purely annoying and an inconvenience. So then I proceed to ask if she could unlock the restroom when she is done with the customers and didn't respond ( hey I will be with you after I take care of them) no she said nothing. So once she finished with them she unlocked the bathroom for me and when I went into the bathroom she said next time the paying customers come first. Which absolutely infuriated me I am a paying customer and for one anyone who walks into your business place should be treated with customer service. I know it's fast food but work on your customer service skills. There will be no next time."}
{"text":"I don't know why I always make the mistake of going to jack in the box. I got the ultimate bacon cheeseburger, and asked for no mustard or ketchup and I wanted tomatoes and onions when I got my burger or should I say my to leather patties on a stale bun with ketchup lettuce no onion no tomato! and when I took it back up to em they looked at me like I was asking for all the money in the register.  then when I explained what was wrong they started laughing didn't offer to refix my food or anything. this place sucks a giant bag of dicks, I would love to punch Jack and his big round stupid face for hiring such incompetent Jack offs that want $15 an hour .come to think about it maybe I should punch myself in the head for coming here again and again"}
{"text":"Absolutely can't make your order correct. I went thru the drive thru and ordered, asked them to repeat it back to me. Asked again at the window, they told me  correctly. Got home, all of it was wrong. Burger looked like it was sat on....Done giving them a try."}
{"text":"People the work here are very helpful they listen to you how you want your food like i ask i want bacon welldone and it was like that when i receive my order thank you and five stars ;)"}
{"text":"Usually have no problem with this location but when they messed up my order and I came back to get it corrected they forgot my missing sandwich AGAIN and had to come back a THIRD time and the staff was very rude to me. I just wanted what I ordered and paid for and they were very reluctant to give it to me. Not cool."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box location was very clean inside.  There was a homeless man in there, but he wasn't disturbing anyone.  The funny thing about Jack is that this is the only place where I think you can eat TACOS with RANCH.  There was this automated stand to order your food and if you used it, you would get free 5-piece churros.  Their churros are different, because even though it has sugar all over it, it had a cinnamon-sweet filling on the inside.  Their curly fries are way better than regular fries.  Their breakfast burritos are pretty good, but you don't get a bite of everything in each bite. One time the whole top was all egg and the bottom had all the steak."}
{"text":"This location always has very friendly and helpful staff. My order is always correct, fresh, and delicious. I have never been disappointed in my food here."}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of visiting Jack in the Box at 1833 W Van Buren in Phoenix at lunch today.  The wait in the drive through was over 20 minutes.  When I got to the window, I remarked to the kid working there, Daniel, about the excessive wait time.  He rebutted, without any sort of apology or concession, that it was because they had so many cars (there were in fact 2 in front of me the entire 20 minutes).  I reminded Daniel of the actual number of cars that had waited, and his new excuse was that the first of the 2 cars had placed a large order.  I reminded Daniel that he could have simply parked the car with the huge order (a practice I've been asked to follow at many of my past visits) to help the other customers get through the line faster, and he said \"no, other people want their food too\".  I asked to talk to his supervisor and he said there was no supervisor there.  I asked to talk to the lady wearing the standard supervisor button up shirt, that I could clearly see over his shoulder, and he said she was too busy to talk to me.  To add insult to injury, when I got back to my office, being late due to the long wait, the grilled chicken patty on my salad was so salty it was inedible.  I have been a Jack in the Box customer for going on 30 years, eating there at least weekly for the past 20 years, and this is the most abhorrent treatment I have ever received from a Jack in the Box employee.  As long as Daniel is the type of employee that Jack in the Box allows to work at their restaurant (and Daniel remains employed with Jack in the Box) Ill be taking my business to a different competitor."}
{"text":"Had to get a breakfast jack for old time sake.  They don't have these in NY anymore...too bad!"}
{"text":"cold dry burgers ... even the New Ribeye burger was precooked and dry, cold and tasteless. When did cooking a good burger end at Jack's. I would not mind paying over 5.50 for a burger if it was good. Even the fries were cold. And this is a new Jack in the Box ..not eating at Jack's again"}
{"text":"Day crew really needs to get it together!!  I have had two bad experiences in a row, last time I ordered an all American burger but  they rang me up for the \"havarti\" burger. When I told her that was incorrect she told me she would fix it at the window which makes no sense cuz by the time I get to the window it's probably already made after at the window to please make sure it was correct because I do not like grilled onions and instead she gave me an All-American with no onions!   Now let's get to this visit, I get to the speaker she took my order correctly, then tells me she'll have my total at the window (completely understandable) until I get up there and she makes no eye contact with me, barks out the total to me, doesn't say hello, doesnt ask me how my day was, nothing. Once I give her the money she hands me my food doesn't say another word to me even when she was giving me my change she didn't count it back she just threw it in my hand! You guys have to do better with hiring because your day crew is going to ruin your business !  you're night crew on the other hand is awesome! 2 stars for getting my order right  Also learn what \"ultimate\" means, My bacon ultimate cheeseburger that used to have at least four slices of bacon on it now has one slice of bacon cut in half!!"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER!!!!!! My taco actually had a bite taken out of it!!!! Not even making this up!  The managers explanation was that someone must have been eating their own food while making mine & mixed them up!  What a joke!  I even sent an email to corporate  & never heard anything in return!  Sorry Jack in the box all your other locations will suffer due to your one bad apple!"}
{"text":"I love tacos, and I love eating tacos, mostly fish tacos , but when I purchased 12 tacos from this jack in the box I was surprised, then disappointed, then pissed off. The tacos I found in my bag were some of the sorriest looking excuses for food I have ever seen in my life. Half of them ripped in half when I attempted to take them out of the bag, and all of them were so soggy with grease that they fell apart when touched. And finally they didn't have any sauce , and some didn't even have any cheese on them. The employees working at jack in the box off of Ray, next to sunset library at 6:30 on Tuesday night need to learn how to do their jobs properly, and frankly should be fired for being incompetent employees who obviously don't care at all about their jobs or customers. I will never be returning to this jack in the box or any jack in the box. Ever. Congrats! You lost a costumer!"}
{"text":"Fairly clean. Friendly staff. Bought $30 in food but wouldn't give me a couple cups for water that I could put a lid on. It seems to not be an issue when going through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Service is way too slow. I came in before school (with 30 minutes to spare) and ordered a fairly simple meal with a milkshake. 25 minutes later, I had still not received my meal and asked them if they were making it. They gave me an estimate that it would take about 5 more minutes. 10 minutes after that I finally received it and proceeded to arrive at school late. Never returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Stood around for a few minutes before anyone came to the register. I'm not really that impatient, but it's still kind of annoying, especially when I'm the only customer in the place."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for Breakfast Jacks. I don't know why. This one is notorious for either giving you an incomplete order, or not being able to understand the workers, as I speak English. I mean that in the nicest way possible. (But check your order before you leave.)"}
{"text":"This particular location isn't bad. It's not that good either, but what do you really expect from Jack in the Crack?"}
{"text":"Why give a Laveen JiB four stars? For a decent meal and five star service. I don't know where they hire, but they need to keep it up. While i waited for my dinner, I chatted up the cute cashier. She told me the breskfasts and convinced me to come back the next morning (today)"}
{"text":"I was actually at the new Jack in the Box on Higley & Pecos. Hands down the worst taco I've ever seen in my life. I ordered two Bacon Ranch tacos, and somebody left them under a heater at least an hour, AT LEAST, before serving them. Seriously, a TACO? How hard is it to throw one together fresh? Nothing in my bag was good. It was all out for far too long being kept warm by a heating unit of some sort. My order was wrong. Totally sickening. I took a picture of the taco, I'll see if I can post it somewhere, it's seriously laughable. I still couldn't tell you if the brown stuff inside was beans or some sort of shredded meat...or both? It was cracked and dehydrated. Never again."}
{"text":"Very close to home. There are not many places to eat on cotton lane so I go here often. Food is always fresh. Orders are always correct.  Staff is very friendly. Lobby is always clean. Outside is clean. Behind the counter and the bathrooms could be a little cleaner but other than that good"}
{"text":"EI went to your store late night and my window guy was Allen Rios he has helped me a few times I always enjoy his customer service. He is always so polite and his smile contagious,  this is probably. My favorite jack in the box cuz of him. Thanks kathy"}
{"text":"None of the employees here wear gloves.  I watch a employee come straight from the back room to the cook line and start cooking with his bare hands.  I will and recommended that you never go to this jack in the box.   The drink station was covers with employee cups and trash.  Look at all the comments on this jack in the box, not one good one."}
{"text":"This evening, at approximately 5:05p, I entered the drive thru and, after waiting over 10 minutes to order, ordered my food. I waited nearly 10 additional minutes to pay and receive my food. As I was pulling out into Stapley, the window attendant ran up to my car to tell me I had gotten the wrong order, which was impossible, as all patrons behind me backed out due to the long wait. I was told to go back around to get my food. I did and was then motioned to go, either to the front, or back through the line, which absolutely wasn't about to happen, as there were 5 more cars! I waited out front, with a sick baby and no one even pretended to get my food! You could spare a staff to run out to the street, but not walk out the door??? I eventually left...without my food, OR money!!! I would like my money refunded to my card!"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru. Missing the garlic fries and potato wedges. Told them and only got the potato wedges. Decided to just get the fck home."}
{"text":"I've had problems with this location enough for over a year that I'm done giving it chances. The crew is really bad at getting orders done properly, often forgetting things like the drinks for kids meals, or ignoring special requests. And if you have a special request or are a repeat customer, the crew tries to use language barriers to say bad things about the customer in question. Unfortunately for them, I understand enough Spanish being raised by my Mexican father. I've heard the crew do this to myself and other customers present in the building. The only reason I've come back so often is because they're the closest location to me without having to drive for a while. Today is the last straw though. Avoid this one. This intersection's food services are all around awful, maybe there's something in the water."}
{"text":"Every time I seem to travel to this Jack n the box which is late at night they are updating the system, cleaning a grill or something else. They truly aren't 24 hours and if you plan on driving a ways at night there is a good chance they won't be able to take you order."}
{"text":"Had a coupon, as I usually do, and decided to get a Monster Taco. All I had to do was buy the drink and taco free!! Cool! I watched as a guy WITHOUT RUBBER GLOVES handled my taco and its ingredients!! He put it in the bag and, there I go!!! I asked the gal who was the cashier,\"Do they not wear gloves when handling tacos?\" She looked around at him then said, \"We wash our hands!\" OK, no more!! Too many other options."}
{"text":"We visit this location on a weekly basic, approximately 3 days per week.  We only go because of the excellent customer service that we get, especially from Manuel and from the other staff as well. Our orders are always correct and the food is always hot.  A great location to visit..KUDOS to the staff!"}
{"text":"I understand I only ordered a chocolate shake but how hard is that?  she didn't ask if I wanted whip cream  which I didn't.  then she handed me an almost white shake with the chocolate syrup sitting on the other side I asked her remix it I order the shake not a Sundae    Funny thing is she didn't use the mix  machine right in front of me so I threw it away on top of that she didn't give me my receipt and I had to go search for the phone number."}
{"text":"Here goes:  Two cheeseburgers with \"Secret Sauce\" and pickles (no mustard or ketchup).  Medium fries  Large coke.  That's pure crack in a bag.  LOVE IT."}
{"text":"Apparently when their shake machine is not working they will charge you for a shake, tell you the machine is not working, give you a soda instead and not refund you the difference. What a rip off!"}
{"text":"Horrible  service.. never read back the order and then when I got home my husband's  food was wrong. I ordered a brew house burger with no tomato.."}
{"text":"Always give items wrong!!! And all the time beef patties looks old, dry and ugly!!! Don't recommend to stop eat here!!! Seriously!"}
{"text":"Took 15 mins to place an order and I was the only customer inside the store. My pita had less than half the ingredients usually included. If it weren't for my needing to get to work I'd have gone back and demanded a refund. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Yo so I came though here looking to get a breakfast sandwich and they sent me home with some sandwich that I cannot even identify being on their menu I was giving no receipt. I called them after using the number here and no one picked up the line. The sandwich  was covered in tomatoes which I am also allergic to. I'm not a happy camper as this one just so happened to be on the way that's out of the way. I managed to come back to settle what's happened and the Joseph  fought with me over the price difference which my intended meal was cheaper I've been told to come back and talk to the manager in the morning. They fixed my order but not how much I paid because \" you didn't pay cash\"  My hopes are not high..."}
{"text":"Worst service ever the guy would cut me off not let me finish making my order. I ordered some nuggets he didn't even put them in a box he just dumped them inside the bag without a box. He was very rude very unprofessional the worst experience ever that man should be fired, he didn't have his name badge on. Unfortunately this has happened at this Jack in the Box several times with this same person. They usually mess up something on the order one way or another. This is by far the worst Jack in the Box in Phoenix Arizona if not the world I will never go back there again. Wish i could give negative 5  stars."}
{"text":"This review is not so much for this location but the parent company, Foodmaker Inc. Headquartered in San Diego, CA.  Several years ago a manager at this location presented me with a special card that had no expiration, and entitled me to free combos, or other types of food. It seemed ironic to receive this gift after a short conversation with the manager,as I'm from San Diego and have been a big fan of Jacks since they were a local San Diego chain. It's almost as if I'm being rewarded for 50 years of brand loyalty. Several months ago this card was taken from me by someone at this location, he informed that their was a mistake, and that he needed to confiscate the card. I reluctantly handed it over, not wishing to cause a problem in the restaurant. I notified Foodmaker via e-mail about this and all they did was send me a form letter back, never contacting me personally. My girlfriend experienced a problem at the A&W next door, and not only did they personally contact her, but sent her 2 \"Be Our Guest\" cards, allowing her to have 2 free combos at any A&W store. Problem corrected in 8 days! After waiting another month, I again contacted Foodmaker asking for some sort of explanation, again the exact same form letter, with no personal contact. So thanks for nothing Foodmaker, after 50 years I'll be taking my business to A&W and In&Out."}
{"text":"Left out a sandwich AGAIN from my drive through order.  They leave something out more often than they get an order right.  Probably my fault that we get home before realizing.  I should know how bad they are about it and check the order, but I didn't . . . AGAIN.  Can't endorse this place but other Jack in the Box's seemingly are more competent!"}
{"text":"This 2 star review is  based on this particular location, not JITB in general.  I have recently moved near this Jack so it was probably my 3rd time visiting and before today I would of given this location a couple more stars perhaps, but definitely negative stars for my experience today. I have only been through the drive thru so I cannot comment on anything inside, but  the previous couple times have been your standard drive thru experience, nothing amazing, but nothing to gripe about until today.   There were 3 cars in line total including me when I ordered, so I would say it was not busy.  I asked the lady for a Big chicken sandwich combo (this was a request from my sister, I was actually going to 7-11 to get a drink next door, but figured I'd just get it there since they have 1.00 all size drinks now).  Anyway so I was asked what size and then I remembered she wanted no mayo so I asked for no mayo on the sandwich. Again I was asked what size, so I wasn't quite sure if she heard the request, but I thought I'd catch it on the readback, so I said small fry large coke (because of the 1.00 special).  After that the screen flashed 4.31 and that was it.  No readback, no pull up to the window, no asking if i wanted anything else ( I did). I sat there for at least 30 seconds waiting for something, but after it was clear nothing was coming I said, hello? and I was told to pull up to the window.  I asked the guy handing me my drink(a small drink btw) what her name was, and he started asking why I wanted to know. I told him because she was rude. He was nice enough to want to fix whatever was wrong but I was mad and just wanted to get the hell out of there. I did ask for him to make sure there was no mayo on the sandwich because it wasn't for me and at least I could have it right and I left. If the food was for me and not my sister I would of just drove on through hungry because I don't know if I've ever been that miffed in a drive thru."}
{"text":"Had to poke a little review in here.  If you seen my last JITB review just imagine the complete opposite of that.  Was in the drive thru around 1230 today. The lady asked how my day was and ordered 1 Jr bacon, 1 Jr Bacon plain and 1 breakfast jack. I asked if they still had dollar drinks and the lady apologized that the promotion was over. Had my order read back and pulled up to the window. On the way I decided to add an order of mini cookies I saw on the sign. No problemo. Got my order, the woman gave me 10% off my next order for no reason I could tell and asked if my service was as good as it was my last visit. I told here it was my first visit, but it was awesome and she wished me a happy thanksgiving.  That is like what it should be at the drive through.    PS  My jr bacon was plain and the cookies were delicous.   THANKS JACK."}
{"text":"Best Jack in the Box restaurant ever. Their manager in charge at the time (Cynthia) we went was very helpful. Food is brought to your table, it's clean and food even taste better than other locations. It's a new restaurant, so very clean. We even got some samples of their churros. Very pleasant experience did not expect this from a Jack!"}
{"text":"I went to this location last night, around 11:30. I didn't make it out of the drive thru until 12:20. There is no reason why it should have taken this long to order and receive my food at a \"fast food\" restaurant, let alone any restaurant at all. There was only one person working the lobby and the drive thru, when they should know that people go there late at night. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"OK at best. Typical fast food. You can easily taste the OK quality. For example, bacon almost tastes like rubber. Definitely better than McDonald's or Burger King, however. Staff is friendly, but not very enthusiastic about their work.   All-in-all, mediocre location."}
{"text":"I know it's just a fast food place, but this Jack in the Box is really special. I eat here maybe once a week at lunch and they always say hello and even know my name. The service is fast and exceptionally courteous, especially Frank and the manager Liz. I've eaten at much fancier places that could learn a thing or two from these guys about customer service. This place is excellent!"}
{"text":"Dining room doors locked at 6pm on a Saturday. Cars are being served in the drive thru, so I guess they are open in some capacity. No signage explaining why the doors are locked."}
{"text":"I stopped by for teriyaki bowl and egg rolls, cost me about $10. The staff didn't quite understand what I tried to order. I was in a hurry that's why I picked this place instead of ordering with a real restaurant and it was a mistake.  The egg rolls were decent but price a little steep for fast food restaurant.  The teriyaki bowl was awful,  too salty I ate only few bites and had to throw it away. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Someone here is an idiot. Cashier repeated, \"wedges.\" Receipt says, \"wedges.\" But I come home to find their horrible fries with a sad amount \"cheddar\" substance and bacon on top. This was my diet \"cheat.\" Thanks for ruining that and saving me a few hundred empty calories."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude. Waited at the drive thru speaker for two whole minutes with no greeting and when I said hello? The woman replied in a snotty tone, \"we will be right with you\" I used to work at Jack and I know that one of the non negotiables to greet within the first 5 seconds. I don't understand why she couldn't greet me and tell me to hold on for a second. Never returning here because of her."}
{"text":"Quick service, pretty clean, staff was nice.  Not crowded at all @ 6:30p on a Monday.  Better looking than other Jack locations we've been to in the CLT & was easily accessible via wheelchair for my hubby!  We tried the Bourbon BBQ Steak sandwiches -- pretty good, pretty greasy too!   Update:  right after I wrote the review last night, more traffic started coming in.  We quickly became the minority by a landslide, and not able to understand anything anyone else was saying.  I thought we time-warped somehow to South of the US border, but we were still in Charlotte.  The cashier at the counter became completely TOO LOUD, carrying on loud, Spanish conversations with some of the patrons.  Most likely better enjoyed via the drive-thru or with earbuds/music."}
{"text":"Awful.  Jack in the Box claims your food is cooked to order, but not here.  My bacon burger and fries were barely warm.  I tried to do the online survey, but it stopped after I checked highly dissatisfied. I wasn't doing it to get free tacos, guys; why aren't you interested about WHY I'm dissatisfied? Nope? I guess you want my $8.97 and don't give a rat's ass about why this location is terrible.  I didn't have high expectations; it's fast food.  But seriously, if you charge that much for a combo, you could at least make it fresh. Won't come back here, and probably won't try another location."}
{"text":"Mold in food. Goodmorning! I ordered a breakfast sandwich from this establishment November 4th, 2016 at 0730. I was eating the sandwich and remember feeling like it tasted funny, but thought it was just me; as I am 22 weeks pregnant and have been trouble keeping food down (morning sickness). I discovered that the egg in the sandwich had mold throughout the egg, and I ate almost the whole thing. As a first time mother I was worried for the safety of my baby, and called my doctors and poison control. Hopefully the baby is okay. I would not recommend eating at this establishment, as they serve moldy food to customers. I have pictures of the egg, and will share them!"}
{"text":"When I want a fast food burger, the Jack Sirloin burger is my go-to. Chez Jack hits the spot en route to or from a night of revelry. This Jack was fast and friendly, can't ask for more."}
{"text":"how can i be the only one in the drive thru and you ask me curly or regular and i say regular and ya ass still gives me curly  bitch what the fuck"}
{"text":"Just got southwest salad..tomatoes rotten and rancid..chicken harder than a brick..hope I don't die"}
{"text":"meat isn't as good as use to be.New napkins are like using newspaper!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the service I received was fast. The food was hot and delicious. Most of the others who have rated don't seem to understand this is fast food not a five star restaurant and I feel they have been unfair to this location."}
{"text":"Lately they don't have things ready or in Stock. where they tell me \"if you really want that your going to have to wait 20 minutes, because I'm still cleaning the grill.\"..wth..then the salads are never ready or they serve certain food certain @time a day.. I've gone couple other jacks around me and there 24/7 anything.. ppl are lazy I guess.."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, but this is the worst jack in the box that I've had the displeasure of visiting. The place is swarming with bums. During one visit there was as many as 4 bums INSIDE the restaurant at one time. I understand that the homeless people are not the fault of the Jack in the box, but the slow service is. I want to get my food and get out before some nasty bum begs me for money. Why does it take 10 minutes to make small curly fries?"}
{"text":"When I want to go out to someplace nice to eat, but don't feel like getting all fancied-up, I go to Jack in the Box, which is essentially gourmet fast food. Mickey D's and Booger King have nothing on Jack. NOTHING.  I really wanted to try the Classic Buttery Jack after I watched a commercial for it. Jack in the Box did not disappoint! It's buttery and Jack kept it classic by only adding tomato slices, lettuce, and provolone cheese.  Next time, I'm going to try the Bacon & Swiss Buttery Jack, which I'm looking at a picture of right now.   I didn't dine-in, but I drove-thru. The guy working the drive-thru was cool, and I didn't transform into a Hulk when he told us that their ice cream machine broke down and we'd have to wait 20 minutes. Ah well, see you next time, Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Shake and Bacon & Swiss Buttery Jack."}
{"text":"Ordered a 7 piece jalapeño popper (only got 6) and asked for 4 sweet and sour dipping sauce... (got three) funny these people asked to get paid more but cant seem to count correctly. Seriously? I was rushed out of the drive through at 130am. Only two cars... me and another guy. Music in store was blaring loud. Maybe thats where the confusion was."}
{"text":"I went into this store at 10:08 PM, with no one at the drive way or in the store. I didn't get helped until 10:15 PM even though there were no customers because they were too busy talking to each other. When I walked in, they made eye contact with me several times between the period they saw me and when they actually helped me. I was really nice and happy when I first went in, but after waiting for so long, my mood really dropped, but I still ordered nicely and happily because I didn't want to seem rude. What really made me mad was when someone finally stepped up to the cashier, she was extremely rude even though I was being nice. All I wanted was a munchie meal. I ordered the breakfast sandwich I wanted. Guess how long it took without any customers? 9 minutes because the 4 workers just continued talking. Someone went up to the driveway, and they decided to help and make that person's food before mine. Never coming back here. I wanted to demand for my money back but whatever."}
{"text":"Nice, cLean new place. I Love the double sided fire place that they have in the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Thus far, the service at this Jack in the Box has been great!  The drive thru was fast, efficient and did not take much time at all.  The dinning area was clean and well lit as were the facilities.  Additionally, the staff inside was friendly and happy to take our order.    Unlike a few other locations we have been to, they got the order 100% correct, which was also a plus!  The quality of food is consistent with what you would find at another Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"My fur baby thoroughly enjoys the burger patties from here but I on the other hand prefer the milkshakes and every time I've visited this establishment after midnight the milkshake machine is mysteriously broken until morning??? I don't quite know how the staff predicts that every time it breaks it will be working again by morning but they do and sure enough the few times I've returned in the morning the machine was working again! The food is not horrible, it's jack in the box, it's what you'd expect but they cannot be that busy in the middle of the night to not want to clean the milkshake machine after an order! If your lactose intolerant I'd give it a thumbs up but as for me I am not so that is why it gets a 2.5 star rating  from me."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the worst fast food experience I have ever had. Took 25 minutes to get a chicken pita and fries. Unbelievable. There were two disinterested workers who could care less and this was on a Saturday night. Mcdonalds has nothing to worry about with this kind of service. When my pita arrived the chicken was cold, lettuce wilted and no tomato on the wrap. Other customers had a worst experience than me.v obviously there is no supervisory oversight here. Avoid this location at all  costs. There are better fast food options in this area."}
{"text":"This location is clean, the service is helpful, friendly, and the food is served HOT! Love this place! I did not hear them call my number and the next thing I know the guy is bringing our food to the table. That was awesome! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I agree with most of the other reviews: Skip this place. I had an issue with this location in the past (came in and waited for about ten minutes and finally left without anyone attempting to take my order). Given the location, I came back during the wee hours of the morning and received semi-decent service. However, after having a drink spilled on my by the person working the window; I have my limits. I received no apology (only a scared look in the guy's eyes) nor any napkins. Even after this, I gave the place the benefit of the doubt and returned only to receive food that has no rhyme or reason.   All-in-all: The food is never consistent and the service is so below par that it gives fast food restaurants a bad name. Skip this and hit the McDonald's down at the end of the block. Service there is what you'd expect from a fast food place and the food is generally consistent with what you are used to getting."}
{"text":"Ordered a jumbo jack got home with a chicken sandwich.  This girl was not friendly or accurate.  Guess she didnt care."}
{"text":"I have lived here in this area for 8 years and have done my share of Jack runs. Over the past 2 months I have been here twice and now never again! I had 3 meal orders and I came inside thinking it would be best. Since I hate when someone goes to the drive-thru for huge orders. Wrong!! All teens working and don't know what they are doing. Messed up my order twice. Forgot fries. And then said I had the right burgers. I opened it in front of them and they started blaming each other. So many young kids don't understand customer service or management. I am glad they are attempting to work. But you need a leader to show staff the way. Not here. Sad, customers and these teens have been failed by Jack in the box at this location. Don't go."}
{"text":"Difficult to hear and be heard from the Jack in the Box drive thru.  The food, service and delivery overall was great."}
{"text":"Great location. Kristina in the drive thru was very nice. I go here often and have had 0 incursions with their staff. The only reason they aren't getting 5  is because I don't necessarily like all of Jacks stuff. They need to revamp their breakfast contents. But I would recommend this location if you need a quick bite."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars, I would. Poor service, guy yelled \"fuck\" when I asked to make additional tacos to my order. The one on Beardsley is better"}
{"text":"Been coming to this specific location for years, since it opened. Never have I had a problem, or issue, or bad service. Very consistent  (good) quality! Awesome that it became 24/7 eat in, as well as drive thru!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Three burgers roasted to a crisp, missing patties. Food took 15 minutes to come into the dining area. Then they locked the doors with us inside still eating. Other customers were asking for their money back. Mystery 'Maintenance' the explanation for the closing. Numerous people waiting outside locked doors while we unhappily ate a few bites of our food bf throwing it away. Wish I could give a negative star."}
{"text":"Bugs near our food! I just took my daughter to eat at this Jack-in-the-Box here in north Phoenix and while we were eating our food we noticed a ton of bugs crawling around on the napkin dispenser which was empty and right near our food at the table we sat on so we threw our remaining stuff  away and told the lady that worked there, she came over and said,  \"oh my gosh I'm so sorry\" and then we waited around to see if anybody was going to even talk to us about it but no one did and so after awhile we finally just left.  Doubt I will ever stomach eating at a Jack in the Box again, PTBD post traumatic bug disorder, so gross!"}
{"text":"It's Jack in the Crack but worse because it's next to Sexxpresso and you're not there.  Good SCFries"}
{"text":"First time ever eating at Jack in the Box (just moved here from Ohio), so I was excited to try a new place! Parking lot was completely empty at about 4:45PM on a Saturday, which is early for dinner, but you'd still figure there'd be a few people in there. That seemed like a bad sign.  However, the employees here were really good and friendly! I got a bacon & Swiss Buttery Jack with curly fries and a shake. Fries and shake were just average, but I really enjoyed the burger!   The manager was doing an odd thing where he slammed the trays every time he handled them, but he didn't seem like he was in a bad mood or anything, I guess the guy just likes the sound the trays make when you slam them together.   The best part was the friendly employee who took our order. When we were almost finished eating, it still wasn't busy, so he came out to tidy up and stopped to ask us how the burgers were and talk to us for a few seconds. Was really impressed that he cared that we were enjoying ourselves!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst location ever! They try to rush your looking what to get then.  They are not friendly at all nor do they listen on what you want. We repeated ourselves twice and still got the order wrong!"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. The drive thru kid was laughing and having a conversation with a coworker and not paying attention. When I asked to talk to the manager he wouldn't take the time to talk to me. I'm taking my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I typically don't eat much fast food, but I made an exception because it was a .3 mile drive from the job I'm working on and they have tacos!  The good - the food QUALITY was good, didn't taste off enough to make me worry about feeling like I'm eating cat or kangaroo.  The bad - here's the reason for 2 stars. Tacos were luke warm. At best probably 30 minutes old. Secondly, I don't want to seem all crazy, but I was greeted in spanish. Not that I hate Spanish or anything but we are after all in the United states of America. Perhaps greet in English and tend to Spanish customers instead.   Over all I wouldn't recommend this jack in the box."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Went thru the drive thru. They are not trained. My drink was wrong and they put my change in the bag instead of handing it to me."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would ! I love Jack & this location is closest to me. The few times that I've visited around midnight or a little after , slowest service ever!!!!! It always takes about 30-40 minutes from the time you order till the time you leave , in the drive thru"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place for some reason I have to stand at an empty counter for 10 minutes or longer for the employees to get it together and take my order. Whenever I order the steak and egg burrito it always mysteriously comes without the salsa.   Thus my reason for two stars, poor customer service and this place seems to horde condiments."}
{"text":"I have never had good service here. Every time I order at the drive thru I never get what I ordered and have to drive back.   But if I go inside I'm constantly harassed by homeless people for money or food. Clean your parking lot from them and listen to your customers. Idiots."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box get 1 star only because NO stars was an option.  The food is her is horrible and takes FOREVER to get.  The staff is rude and unprofessional.  On several occasions we have been offered \"FREE\" items if we would back up 2 feet while waiting in drive thru.  WE now know this is because each car is timed on how quick they get you out and by us backing up it reset the timers.  The staff is LAZY and the is shows in the food.  While in drive thru the other day the server left the window open and i acutally had to listen to to the Staff talk about their Manager and how they hated him.   NEW MANAGEMENT AND STAFF is what this place needs.  The owners need to take control of this store before they have no business  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I would drive the extra miles to another Jack in the Box because this one was so bad.  Food was horrible, they didn't give you what you paid for and the people working there had no personality and never smiled.  We deemed it the WORST Jack in the Box ever."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box experience went south really quick! We pull through the drive thru because my brother was hungry. When we arrived the greeting was \"Hello\" like the conversation  was taking place on a cell phone. I was taken back, but continued saying, \"One moment please!\" I rolled my window  up, so my brother could gather his order without confusing the drive thru worker David. David made a remark that we needed to hurry up. My brother immediately lost his appetite, and keep in mind we were only at the window 2 minutes max. We called to speak to a manager and got the run around from the shift lead Lashawnda. A simple and easy visit went south due to poor customer service!"}
{"text":"This store, is bad, my burger and curly fires were burned, and it was noon!! Sad store, go to any other ones in the area!!"}
{"text":"What on earth is the point of being open late or all night, if half your menu isn't available after a certain time? Then, they make you back up to \"reset their time\". Once or twice? No biggie. Every single time? Clearly they need to get their crap together."}
{"text":"By far the most u happy and rudest staff on this shift... Not a smile or expression. Look of death when we asked for sauce. If you hate your job why stay here. Unreal."}
{"text":"Well thought I would give it a try just moving here. But three parts of my order were wrong and food is missing. Never again"}
{"text":"No joke, easily the worst Jack In The Box in the state. Dirty tables, rude employees, bad food."}
{"text":"Hit the drive thru tonight about 10:45, ordered the sourdough jack with a couple modifications... The cook nailed it, was the best SDJ ive had in ever. Gentleman at the window addressing customers was courteous and professional, this was truly appreciated after a long day at work. Rocked it guys, thank you."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, walked in and waited 5 minutes and still no one in site to be seen. No one ever came to the front counter to take our order. The restaurant was empty with no other customers. Saw an employee and looked at her so she could take our order and she just ignored us. Ended up leaving and went to another Jack."}
{"text":"My double cheese burger and curly figures were burned at noon on a Saturday!! This is the last time I go, consistently bad."}
{"text":"Food was warm, not messy. And the cashier was very friendly. Lobby was clean and very nice and cold inside. The cashier even brought me the food. Coffee was ok."}
{"text":"This place was dirty after the lady mopped, the tables were sticky, they had no soda, and the fries tasted old. This place was horrible. On top of all that the customer service was bad. When my 75 year old grandmother walked in she almost slipped on a wet floor with no caution sign. We will not be going back"}
{"text":"I frequent this location often and have never been displeased. The drive thru is usually moving pretty steady and the self order kiosk in the lobby makes dining in a snap. The staff seem to be in a good mood and always smile and greet you."}
{"text":"Pretty much the service and quality you can expect from any fast food place. I got the sourdough jack combo with curly fries and a Diet Coke. The sourdough jack was good though it had too much mayo and by the end was just a mess. The curly fries were the freshest I had from this location so far. It's 3pm so maybe they don't have a lot of fries sitting out or I just got lucky. Drink was great with not too much ice. Overall a solid experience this time around."}
{"text":"Ok. I hate writing reviews and especially bad ones, but holy cow did I have a bad experience! So 9:26 pm, me and my brother come in to get some tacos but change our mind to order the munchie meals they offer after 9pm. We order 2 of the Stacked Grilled Cheese Burger munchie meals. There was only one guy that ordered before us inside and noticed 3 cars at the drive through. So we wait. 5 minutes roll by. Then another employee walks in from outside and went into the kitchen and said some stuff in Spanish, then walked back out. Another minute later and he comes in and grabs 2 bags of food and 2 munchie meals and walk back outside. Then finally the first guy gets his order or bacon cheddar potato wedges. That's all her ordered and took them 10 minutes! Then 15 minutes later, we get our food. We were happy and went home. Then when we saw what we had received, oh we were disappointed. It's not the fact we waited or anything, it's really the fact they don't care about anyone. Our munchie meal consisted of not Halfsie fries, but just regular fries, no curly fries. Didn't bother us as much as our burger. Poorly put together, 2 tomato slices and 3 pickle slices barely in the burger, and guess what? Oh we ordered a stacked grilled cheese burger but wait a second? Where's the grilled cheese?? Basically we paid for a poorly made burger, not the meal we requested. Come on guys! Like really? I know it's not an expensive perfect restaurant but how can you screw up not making the correct burger twice? But then make sure your other employee has all the food he wants before 2 customers that ordered their food and paid for it before you did. That's even if that employee paid for his food at all. This has been an awful experience and for what's it's worth, I could have went to another jack in the box that has a lot more customer respect and makes sure everything is correct before it leaves the door. Declaration of delicious? More like declaration of laziness. Thank you"}
{"text":"Asked for a side of sriracha and got this so wrong just laziness so sad smh could have gave my the plastic little cups but noo lazy"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy the salads...  The last few, however, have been awful.  Pretty sure this is how they make them: 1) take a head of iceberg lettuce and chop the entire thing 2) take the really nasty thick white pieces that nobody in their right mind would EVER think of eating, and toss them in the bottom of the bowl 3) cover up said nasty pieces with a few pieces of fresh, green, healthy leafy greens 4) further bury the nasty stuff with a few other toppings 5) sell it at over $6  6) hope that since the purchaser pours a good dose of ranch on it, they won't notice the white stuff buried underneath - surely that's just the ranch that made it look so nasty.    Tonight's was the worst.  You litereally could see how they layered the white junk on the bottom and the green stuff on top.  Half edible, but totally lame."}
{"text":"Hard fries , regular bun on spicy chicken sandwich meal... Had a taco half way done quarter of meat in the thing.. Two supreme croissants I ask for, and they gave me two sausage croissants major disappointment!!!!! hashbrown broken into pieces in the little bag horrible...super greasy"}
{"text":"Can't screw up the food as I got a basic hamburger. The service though sucks big time here.. If you go thru drive thru expect a 10 minute wait minimum. If it's busy it will be longer"}
{"text":"I experience horrible service here at this location. I had the same guy ring me up and prepare my food with No Gloves. Manager didnt seem to care until i said something and then he made him put on gloves but rhere was no washing of the hands between the cash register and the preparation of my food!!! Worst service ever! Will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"The service is always good here and they are much quicker than any other drive thru. But they are always out of products. Once, they were out of chicken. Last week, they ran out of syrup for the iced tea!!"}
{"text":"I gave you another shot and never again. I went for food for 3 people. Of course you forgot my food and when I called to complain yon didn't even attempt to make it right. I'm once again without food. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. They never get anything right"}
{"text":"Is this a joke ??! So sloppy and only 4 tiny pieces of meat ? No wonder it's only $3. P a t h e t i c"}
{"text":"Damn those Diamondbacks. The promotion that when they hit a home run, the next day you get a free jumbo jack with the purchase of a large drink has me going back regularly. It is a tasty burger. While there I do have to have two of the tastiest, greasiest tacos around. There is something about them that takes me back to my youth. The tacos are addictive!"}
{"text":"Lol, I know nobody will care for this review cuz it's Jack in the Box & all, but who cares...I do, that's who ;)  Every now & again I like to slum & get JITB, I mean who doesn't?! Especially those of us from the West Coast. Such a deal!   The food is decent, depending on the location of course. But, overall you get a good bang for your buck. I mean c'mon, 2 tacos for .99 cents!! These tacos are better than some I have had from some Mexican places :P  Anyways, I give them 4 stars cuz I like them & it's definitely a West Coast & nostalgia thing for me, from going there as a kid after school, back in the day when they has Pizza Pockets & Frings! Lol, that's right, Frings. A combo of fries & onion rings. Awww...I really miss those days."}
{"text":"Fast food been waiting 11 min just to order. If there wasn't 5 cars behind me I.would have left. Days not any better. I work in the industry and if I had a table wait this long I would be fired."}
{"text":"I had the most horrible service possible! The drive thru person Brandon was so rude! After each item I ordered he asked \" is that it\" you never say that ask if my order is complete or suggest something. Then he didn't verify my order on screen. The total on screen showed 10.78 to pay I get to the window and was asked to pay 13.36?!!! I am pretty sure that is why you are supposed to verify the order! I didn't get a thank you or come again my food was shoved in my face and then he shut the window! I will not return to this jack because of this or any for that matter. Rude employees should be dealt with if I am a bother to you then find another job don't work in the industry that requires hospitality!"}
{"text":"This jack in the box sucks, I've came here about 5 times and each time they're out of sauce, ketchup, or something, they mess up my order and add things I didn't order to it. This is definitely the last time I go to this location!!"}
{"text":"The Jack In the Box on Blue Diamond/ dean Martain is filthy inside. I watched the manager place food racks on the  cash register counter  while cleaning the fry storage and taco storage rack. Then proceed to take orders, handle cash and credit cards from customers, then turn around and continue cleaning and also fill orders touching French fries and containers along with other numerous foods then proceed to take more orders without washing hands. There was a lot of spilled food all over the prep area floor. vagrants were coming in and filling up random cups with sodas at the soda fountain overall the entire restaurant was the filthiest Jack-in-the-Box I've ever been to. Being The employee was handling cash, cleaning products, and food at the same time, I will never go back due to fear for my health."}
{"text":"The cashier named Kylie was very kind and patient she gave me recommendations. The food was better than any other Jack in the box I've ever been too."}
{"text":"Went inside and ordered a DOUBLE JACK COMBO and several other items to go.  Got home and found there was only one burger patty in the DOUBLE jack.  Since we live about five miles from the restaurant, it wasn't worth the drive back.  It was probably an accident but if you wanted to rip-off a customer, this would be an easy way to do it.  The're are plenty of other burger joints in Surprise so I don't need Jack In The Box anymore."}
{"text":"Trying to be fair here, but I have given this place at least four chances. I am disappointed every time.  Tacos are never crisp enough.  Burgers are super dry and overdone and buns burnt around edges.  The Jack in the Box in nearby Anthem is far superior in quality of food.  Seriously, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went to this location one night to grab some food. The commercials and ads running at the time were for the $5 late night snack boxes. I went at night to grab one, and placed my order. The guy literally yelled at me telling me they didn't sell those anymore and got mad at me because I needed an extra minute to place my new order. I was treated so poorly that I just decided to leave and go somewhere else. I totally realize people have bad days and I was not expecting 5-star service. However, I should never have been yelled at for an honest mistake."}
{"text":"This place is a fucking joke!! The employees are fucking careless. My 5 year old bit into a jalapeño popper which was supposed to be a chicken nugget kids meal! When I called all he could say was \" I don't remember putting any jalapeño poppers in there and then proceeded to hang up on me\" like get the fuck out of here dude. Your lucky my child isn't allergic otherwise you'd have more than just a phone call/speaking with manager issue. I DON'T AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS FUCKED UP SO CALLED fast food place. Once they start hiring employees that actually care about their job and actually take pride regardless of the time. Then I just might change my mind. But until then fuck that!"}
{"text":"I have literally never had a correct order here. And the things that are correct, are horribly cooked."}
{"text":"Waited for about ten minutes to have my order taken and everyone in the back obviously saw me but didn't chose the acknowledge me. After waiting for that long I just decided to leave and they didn't even say anything nor apologize for the wait. Terrible customer service"}
{"text":"So I went to this location a few days ago and ordered food.  They shorted my roommate and I a few burgers and some curly fries.  I am giving them five stars because when I told them what they had done via phone....Melissa Rocha made sure to fix the problem by allowing me to come back and get the entire order for free a few days later when we were in the mood.  I understand that sometimes things happen in any restaurant.....how they cope with their mistakes is just as important as not making them.  Thx to Melissa Rocha and anyone else that helped make that right......above and beyond.  I will be back"}
{"text":"I was there on Monday at 11:10 pm so my sis placed her order by the drive thru  and she said she wanted a large fry so the lady taking her order and also she was the manager on duty thst time was like making fun of her english ok then we got our order and i checked the bag no ketchup for the frech fries so i got off from the  car and went up to the window and i asked her for ketchup,hotsauce so she was giving me a bigo  hand full of ketchup and i sad also hotsauce  so since she was acting like that i asked for my money back she said i cant give you your money back so she shut the window at me so i left the food there  she was extremely super Rude it was my first time there and i also call it my last time  thats not the way they should treat customers specifically a manager managers are there to put examples of well behaving,nice,friendly,clean if i was the general manager there i would take off that manager of her position i know we all have problems but we dont mix our home problem with work in my opinion is that"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Guy (Mark I think) who served us was very very nice."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through because it said 24 hours I waited there are over 15 minutes to try to get someone to come help me I even called the store and they just ignored me"}
{"text":"I always result in going to this Jack. Clean, friendly employees,  and take the time to get my order correct....2 tacos NO SAUCE...., a little ruff to get in and out but well worth the hassle...."}
{"text":"Services just plain sucks 10 minutes before anybody could knowledge that we were here yelled couple times to get somebody's attention and that seemed not to matter to no one that we were standing here"}
{"text":"Went by got some tacos and they didn't get any hot sauce. I know I asked for some won't be going back."}
{"text":"Bad customer service waited for 20 minutes till I can get my order. Employees are dirty and are all clumsy."}
{"text":"Anytime I go out of town, I have to stop by and indulge.  Its no thrills or frills.  The store was clean. Service was fast and real friendly.  Food was hot and fresh as usual.  Thanks for making my trip!"}
{"text":"I don't usually bother to review fast food places, but I just had a really good experience at JITB and wanted to give that location and employee credit. I just returned from vacationing in Kansas City,  where folks are real friendly and service is very good, so I wasn't expecting the tip top service I got from the drive through!  I didn't see the mushroom buttery jack on the menu, so I asked about it, and instead of brushing my request off (which usually happens) the nice kid asked the manager, and made the burger for me, just how I wanted it. He was friendly and helpful and a cutie, too! Give that kid Raul a raise!!"}
{"text":"they need to.improve staff when theres a long line! this was not done and manager was not on duty as a customer had an issue like me! bever again when this is the situation will i be patient!! Never ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this location and the drive thru didn't speak English very well I couldn't understand anything she said . Then she wants to rush me and throws my change at me. Rude service"}
{"text":"If I could give this jack in the box a negative five star review I would but it seems that I cannot do that so this long comment shall do. Pulled up to the drive thru at 3:55 am on 4/9/2017 I get to the speaker box to place my order no greeting comes on nothing just silence not even an I'll be right with you just silence. So I waited about five minutes I figured that  they're probobly working on some kind of technical error in that moment. Finally I decide to speak up immediately I get a rude response were closed for 10 minutes. I replied OK I can wait it is now 4:02 I waited until about 4:17 am before the voice spoke again what do you want they asked. I replied a number twelve she replied what I spoke up a number 12. Then the conversation goes silent again so I responded that will be all the voice spoke again \"size\" I replied oh large that will be all. The voice responded what drink u said Dr Pepper so then they tell me to pull up to the first window where I see an employee with red hair sitting on the floor doing God knows what and another employee in the kitchen eating her life away. I doubt that this jack in the box will respond to any of the feed back left on here but to there loyal customers you guys need to know that there are much better branches with much better customer service just not this location avoid it at all costs. Save yourself the headache. never will I ever come back to this location."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Jack In the Box and will be my last. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, hash brown and orange juice. The only thing that was good was the Minute Maid orange juice. Went to the restroom to wash my hands and turned back around to use my own hand sanitizer that's how filthy the restroom was. Will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"HEALTH VIOLATION!!! I went there around 11pm for an Oreo shake. We got the Oreo shake but later... The straw kept getting clogged, we figured it was just oreos.  We stirred it around out of habit and we saw something blue. We picked it up and it was a finger condom! Finger condoms are used when you cut your finger. You put a band aid over it and then a finger condom to prevent the band aid from coming off. THAT IS DISGUSTING.  When we called to complain, nobody apologized. No sympathy was shown. They just said we could get a free shake next time. Why would I want a free shake after getting something like this in my current shake?? There are a few other jack in the boxes in this area. Do not go to this one! A good one is 3821 E Craig. Always humorous and good attitudes and I have not found any items in my food that is not meant to be there!"}
{"text":"If you know what's good for yourself, you'll  want to avoid this Jack in the Box. i've been to this location on multiple occasions and they've messed up the order and served me un-edible food every time."}
{"text":"i was hungry a few nights ago, and decided to grab some food. this location is pretty convenience, and their service pretty good on the D.T will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Went through the drive through, ordered nuggets, they didn't put the order in then asked me to park and wait so they can bring it out. They didn't. First and last time."}
{"text":"Chicken Fajita Pita is the best. Curly fries are the bestest Oreo shakes are the bestestest  What can I say, I like the box."}
{"text":"I was at Jack in the box about a week ago and the manager was the one at the drive true. She was berry slow and rude I got two burger an the 7 stuff jalapenos and I ask her for 4 ranch dressing and she charge me 50 cent for the additional ranch and she did not gave me any napkins she was rude"}
{"text":"Well I ordered double cheese burger and curly fries. Burger was dry , fries where overcooked they where extremely crispy and greasy. Was not a good lunch at all. Will not go there again. Sorry."}
{"text":"This was literally probably the worst customer service I've ever had. The cashier, Emma I think her name was, took my order. When I got to the window, I found that my order had been made incorrectly and asked them to fix it. When she came back with my new food she told me people were waiting and I had to leave. I was quickly checking it to make sure it was made correctly, since it was wrong the first time. I didn't appreciate her tone, but just asked her for salt and ketchup. She shoved the packets into my hands aggressively and scoffed at me. I don't see how it was my fault for holding up the line; their carelessness was what slowed them down. The food wasn't even quality so that didn't even make up for it. It looked absolutely unappetizing. To top it off, she turned to the associate next to her and said \"I don't know, she's being a real *you know what*.\" I've never been so disrespected at an establishment and I'm not even comfortable repeating what she said about me. I contacted their store manager who was monotone and not very helpful, asking me how I wanted her to fix the problem. Shouldn't she be the one to know the protocol of how to fix it? I ended up calling corporate who was more helpful with the situation. I'm in the customer service industry and know how important it really is, and this associate needs to go back to very basic training if they are going to allow her to represent their company."}
{"text":"I must say I can't believe i'm doing a yelp review on a jack in the box. I'm here at least twice a week for lunch or dinner. I get my usual, the bacon and swiss buttery jack with extra grilled onions. They always have my order correct and I can see them cooking my order fresh. Definitely a well operated restaurant."}
{"text":"Would give 5 stars to the people who work here- Always friendly and nice. As far as the food, it pretty good but not amazing- not a knock against this store particularly. Very efficient and convenient for me. Keep up the good work and bring back the All American combo- great value!"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to post, because I wasn't sure last time, but I know now that there is racist service. On both occasions I waited 15-20 minutes to place my order, while there was staff more than capable of taking it; I've been in the restaurant business for 4 years. Then someone finally takes my order, when they relize I'm not leaving. Then a white person walks in, this time a white female, and they helped them right away, and I looked at the screen, which displayed the same number of drive thru. If your a colored person don't come to this location, unless you have a white friend with you, or are prepaired to wait 1/4-1/3 an hour! Your welcome."}
{"text":"If I could, I wouldn't give this restaurant any stars. This location is the slowest place I have ever visited.  Upon arrival, the cashier made us wait nearly ten minutes before taking our order because she's pulling double duty: cashier for the front of the house and cashier for the drive thru. Once our order is taken, the cashier now cooks our food. Seriously! Add on an additional ten minutes. Now our \"fast food order\" has taken twenty minutes and counting. Thankfully my baby is sleeping and not screaming because honestly, this defeats the purpose of eating at a fast food restaurant!  What truly pushed me over the edge was once I received my order, I was missing food so I brought it to the cashier's attention. She tells me that I didn't order the combo. I told her that I wasn't going to argue because I was hungry and I didn't want to wait any longer for something I had ordered.   This was the biggest waste of time. Do not come here if you value your time."}
{"text":"Just screwed up a simple order. Not busy or shorthanded but give me the wrong sandwich.  I don't have time to check my food on the go. So now ill take my business to in n out."}
{"text":"Terrible service.   Have come here a handful of times at night and seems every time it's run by kids who have no organizational skills. They're slow, and get the order wrong every time.  Opt for the jack in the box on lower buckeye or dysart if you're looking for a jack to get your order right and In a timely manner."}
{"text":"Went today the restaurant wasn't busy but the staff was really slow getting orders out. The soda machine in the lobby was out of all of the regular sodas but had kid sods available. I will not be going back. Oh and I waited to get my food and it was cold."}
{"text":"this place has inspired me to download this application on my phone for the soul purpose of telling these people how shitty their service is. I waited 20 minutes in a FAST food restaurant for a cold burger that looked like someone stepped on the shit. apparently these employees are so incompetent they can't put a burger together without it being a mess. never coming back again, promise."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the low rating b/c the lady who works the drive thru late nights has been there since my hubby & I were in HS & she is super sweet but ugh, I GOT FOOD POISONING HERE! It was 1am Christmas day, or the day after if you wanna get technical, and we were all hungry after some drinking & other 'festivities\". Jack in the crack is 1 of the only places by us open 24 hours, so the boys went on a food run. That morning at about 5am I got so sick. I thought maybe it was the alcohol but I only had 2 glasses of wine & 1 glass of champagne, nothing crazy. When I couldn't stop throwing up that entire day, had the chills & body aches, my husband said it had to be food poisoning. I will never eat here again, or at least for a long time, no matter how hungry at 1am I am. All the pain I was in was not worth it!"}
{"text":"It's Jack in the Box. I go there because it's inexpensive and fast. I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack an hour after eating every time. I would rather go out to a real restaurant, but time does not always permit that, and don't exactly like being stuck around a crowded joint, so the drive thru works great."}
{"text":"Up until yesterday, I had never had any problems with this location.  Yesterday, I went into this establishment with a friend of mine who is a disabled veteran with a service animal. I watched in horror and disbelief as he was REFUSED service because he would not share what his disability was/is with the manager on duty.  She actually said \"You don't look blind, so why do you need that animal?\"  Even after he presented the Service Animal ID for the animal, he was still refused service.  Epic fail, Jack."}
{"text":"Stopped in and got the jumbo jack with curly fries, other than the cheap bun the food was what you'd expect.  The food wasn't the issue though, everything else was.  Service was meh, typical do the minimum necessary attitude, prices are a little high for the quality and the dining area was clean (highlight of the trip).  The bathroom though, my god why did I go in. Toilet paper and a diaper on the floor, rust and what looked like mold on fixtures and that tile hadn't been cleaned in ages if ever.  That alone has scared me off from ever coming back."}
{"text":"I went late like 10pm last night to buy a chicken sandwich and some nuggets & I also had a coupon for a free medium fry with any purchase so I used that as well which came out to like $2 and some change. When I got to the window the employee that looked like he could be manager (he had a red shirt on) took my 20 dollar bill and asked me to pull to the front and they would bring me my food. He closed the window before I could get a word out about my change . I pulled to the front and he came out about 5 mins later. I went home a noticed I didn't get my change or my receipt. I turned around and went back . A new manager was on shift (less then 5 min after I had left the drive thru) I told him what happen he asked for me to come back at 6am after he count his money and it there was $17 and some change over that he would give it to me. I came back at 6am this morning before work and he said his money wasn't over (who pocketed the $17? where did it go?) and that the OTHER manager would call me by 10am. It's not 12pm and I still haven't got a call or my money back. This place is horrible and the whole company and location lost my business for good. Wouldn't recommend and will defiantly tell all my family members and friends is the area about Jack In The Box.  P.S. Will Update IF they call me back."}
{"text":"Honestly, one star is still to good of a rating for this location! If you love burnt food, atrocious customer serivce, and long wait times then this location is perfect for you.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Jack N The Box, the food is always cold. I hate cold hamburgers, and I have vowed not to go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"DONT GO TO THIS LOCATION!   I have gone to this location several times and have had no issues. I am not sure if management has change in the last few weeks but, as of late this has not been the case. A few weeks back I went through the drive threw and was told to wait up front and they would bring me my food. Instead they have my order to someone else, forgot about me and made me wait over 15 minutes. Most recently I went through the drive thru again and placed my order. The boy taking my order told me he couldn't hear me, so I raised my voice. He cut me off told me not to scream then gave me attitude. I had to repeat my order again. I wanted to sub curly fries for the regular fries. I had to repeat this request. Now I've repeated my order twice. Then I said I wanted iced tea. The boy taking the order said his headset cut out. I repeated again. Then he asked me to repeat the order again because he couldn't hear the order. By this time I have told the boy my order 5 times. The first time, the second time for curly fries and THREE times for the iced tea. This was not a complicated order and the boy was very rude. I did not even stick around to get my food because of constantly having to repeat my order."}
{"text":"Rolling through the drive-thru at 148 am on Saturday, you expect employees to not care. Not the case, when I was kindly greeted by the very nice jack in the box employee working the window. Driving nights for lyft you visit businesses in off hours and it's great to see an employee who cares about customer service at 145 am! He was kind and on top of his game. Its always nice to see people who work hard and take customer service seriously. I forgot how his name was pronounced, I believe it was Julio, (I'm horrible with names) and he made an impression on someone who sees food service workers all the time. Sandwich was great as well :)"}
{"text":"Screwed up a simple to go order. Tried to call the store & got a msg - not taking calls at this time. Called the 800 number, took too long to register the complaint & kept asking the same question. How many times do I have to explain the problem? A few days later I get a call from someone claiming to be responsible for this location. Hard to understand. Basically the resolution was: this is \"John\", manager there is \"Bob\" next time you're there ask for \"Bob\" and he'll make it right. Really?! What if \"Bob\" isn't there? Do I keep going back until he's there? What if it's 2 - 3 weeks later? will he remember? Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Always friendly service. Small location but quick with orders. Convenient location just off the freeway."}
{"text":"There's a bunch if youngins working at this location.  They all (for the most part ) look dirty.  The girls always flirt with my Fiance and have absolutely no respect. There's absolutely nothing at Jack in the Box, that's worth me going back.  They always mess up my order and when I asked for 5 hot sauce, I got 1. You has 1 job ladies, and you couldn't even did that... no. Just, no."}
{"text":"This is the most horrible road robbery eatery that i have ever approached. They make so horrible non edible food that they earn their living by road robbery with a towing company which lures outside the jack in the box and look for cars parking in the lot at the back if other eateries like pita jungle. The guy from the towing company lures arround the corner and as soon as a car parks he goes into the empty jack in the box asking if the owner of the car is eating here. Then immediately your car is towed and you have to get an ueber to a very remote site to get it back for 150 $. So jack in the box makes no money on selling their bad food but on road robbery jointly with a towing company."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered an Oreo shake and when driving to the next window.... The girl making my shake didn't have on any gloves..... And while she was putting the whipped cream in the cup she had it all on her fingers...wiped her fingers on her pants.... So I this point after I'm watching her the whole time and she looks at me... I told her never mind and I want my money back!!! So discussing and unsanitary!!! And I really wanted that shake so badddd too... but my health is more important!!! I will never eat eat here anymore!!!!'"}
{"text":"Everytime i want something tasty and good to eat but dont want to spend to much i always go here the service is nice and the food is big they dont lie about there food and then give you a pile of shit.  Best part is that it's also a 7/11 so i can grab a cold one before my walk home."}
{"text":"Great Service. Gwen is usually the Drive Thru cashier when I eat here. She always has a smile and a welcome. The food is hot and freah, I have never been disappointed. I love the Breakfast Jack, the best breakfast sandwich to eat while driving.  I have used their dining room also, usually on the weekends. The dining room and bathroom are always clean."}
{"text":"When I've had a long day and just want a good burger and fries before I go home. I stopped at Jack-in-the-Box. Their food is reasonably priced in an extremely consistent on taste and time. It is safe to say that Jack-in-the-Box is one of my favorite fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"The food is good but poor customer service there the woman that work there always gossiping always forget something in my order all the time one time I had to 3 times back to get the food they forgot to put in my bag  last time order a orange juice the forgot to put it my bag just never went back an I will never go again"}
{"text":"Definitely a bad experience at this location AFTER HOURS. I waited in line for 10 minutes  to get cold curly fries and a horrible tasting drink smh. Surprisingly the burger was actually hot. Customer service also needs to be tuned up at this location."}
{"text":"I Went threw the drive Thru to get a mango tea annnnd that Shit Was Nasty as Fuck. Straight Booty . But on the flip side the Chocolate Over Load cake was Pretty Bomb."}
{"text":"This location has the WORST drive through (and probably inside) service we've ever encountered every single time we come to this location. Extremely slow, rude, and they just genuinely seem like they hate their jobs here. Not to mention half our order is always wrong before we pull away from the window. We even have to ask for straws. Absolutely ridiculous, I would not recommend this location at all! This is the third time in a row, we will NOT BE returning! Save your time and money and go somewhere you are appreciated as a paying customer."}
{"text":"We all know what JIB is.  What I gave 5 stars for is the awesome service I received today by Justin!  l am diabetic, and when I asked if the Coke Zero was really CZ (it tasted too good for some reason), he responded \"Yes! I poured it myself!  I made sure it was Coke Zero.\" When I explained that I am diabetic, he said that he understood, and that he \"wouldn't do that to anyone--give them the wrong drink,\" in a very service-oriented and heartfelt manner. I thought that he might have been the manager!  So, I called back about 30 minutes after going through the drive-thru, and spoke the John, the Manager.  He said he has only been the manager of that store for 3 weeks, and that they do have a very service-oriented crew.  I agree!"}
{"text":"Just came through the drive thru and was given expired sour cream, and had a black piece of God only knows what in my bacon cheddar potato wedges. I've had nothing but horrible service the recent times I've gone to this location. Including the girl taking my order being so rude she said \"duh\" in response to a question over the speaker when she thought I had driven off."}
{"text":"I have been here many time in the last few years since the JitB at cave creek and cactus turned into filiberto's. the only reason i even come to this one instead of the one at 32nd & cactus which is just as far from my current house is the food quality is better here, i have never really had a 'good' experience here but it's sorta what to expect. but several times in the past, yesterday and now today they have told me to stop and wait after the car ahead of me leaves so they can \"fix their time/clocks\" I always got frustrated because of this but today it almost got domestic in the parking lot after the cars behind me started honking their horns, i yelled at the DB directly behind me that i was instructed not to pull up, after the employee \"Julia\" came to the window and told us just to pull up, i demanded an explanation, and to speak to the manager, but she said said there was no explanation and hesitated to say the managers name, instead she just kept saying \"he is working the back and can't talk now\" so i kept demanding until she said it. it was a terrible experience and i don't see myself returning here for a very long time."}
{"text":"This is an update. Wow, what a difference. The last time I was here,  on a Sunday, it  was in the afternoon like today. The restaurant was slow and dirty. Today, at the same time it was slow and outrageously clean. During the time I was there the floor was mopped - not swept mind you - but mopped twice and each table cleaned with soap and water. I sat at the same table as last time, but now it was spotlessly clean no grease rubbed into the table top.  This is the Jack - the Box I have come to know and enjoy. Kudos to the management and staff. You are accomplishing the restaurant mission. 5 STARS."}
{"text":"If I was God, and was able to leave a zero star review, I would do so in a second. Not only did they forget a large part of my order, they made the rest of it look like a five year old went to Art class. A mess. Here's a little taste of what this Jack in the box has to offer. But hey, what can we expect? Its fast food."}
{"text":"Great food  Good customers service  They never have milkshakes went in 3 days after 10pm and none of the 3 times they had milk shakes come on 3 times i just finally gave up and went in the carls jr"}
{"text":"Drive-thru is 24/7 But I'm still going to give you one star. There store was closed so I have to ride a bike through the drive-thru. But after I ordered my food, waiting for four mins,they told me I couldn't get my food without a car! WTF?!?"}
{"text":"keep this place clean! whwn I was sitting by the cash register I could see how dirty it was. Brown paper towels,papers,trash can full  and walking buy like there was nothing on the floor.it was a slow night. Nobody was there but my couisn and me. Please keep your work area clean cause it makes jack in the box dirty and ghetto."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Not bad if you're hungry and in a rush. Stood waiting for almost 5 minutes before I was even greeted. Another couple minutes before anyone took my order. They weren't unfriendly just a little understaffed I believe. I ordered #24 breakfast (supreme croissant). The croissant was not very light or fluffy. It was ok. The hasbrown was soaked in grease; not very appetizing. The \"smoothie\" is just mango syrup with the fake ice cream they use mixed together. Let it sit for a minute or two and it starts to separate, (also, not very appetizing). Overall, it was just another fast food joint."}
{"text":"In my neighborhood and easy access to drive thru.     Love all the options and the new items that come out.     Some are a hit with me.     A few not so much, but that's what a menu is for....diversity.        Quick service and hot and tasty.....not prepared and wrapped waiting on a sale.         Always like the BOGO to help with budget.      Not a fan of their fries, so I just get the sandwich.     Wish they would bring back the 2 free taco's with future purchase...."}
{"text":"So this one time i ordered tacos fries and cookies. I pick up my order and go home. Next thing you know out of the blue my cookies weren't there! I freaked out and called them just to them laughing at me complaining about my cookies. They also gave me a free cheesecake (so nice of them) but I'm allergic to dairy:( Overall not to shabby"}
{"text":"Nasty breakfast food. (Supreme Croissant). Go the nearby McDonalds instead. Plus it's expensive."}
{"text":"I like ranch... I like ranch with my Jack tacos... I got two tacos and they gave me one ranch. I asked for another. They said No. One ranch per two tacos. I asked to BUY another ranch. They said NO. You can not buy extra ranch. What????? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went to get a munchie meal at jack a while ago. Where hungry but we never got that munchie meal, reason being is because they need competent and awake people to work regardless of the shift. When the order taker can't tell in the agitation in my voice they continue to repeat themselves. \"I would like a Powerade please,\" I said. \"What flavor,\" the order taker said. I mean did something change when I said Powerade more then 5 times and eventually I say forget it and she says ok to what ever she thinks I'm saying. Next if like to just make it a full serving of fries, so I asked. She said that it will just be a smaller serving... I'm thinking WHAT? Why can't you just substitute the curly for normal. They are literally just going to give me the half of the fries \"set.\" All in all I will never be going back to this jack in the box. There are others in my area that are hopefully more caring about a customer."}
{"text":"Okay jack in the box is pretty decent.  I like the chicken samdwhiches there, as sad as they may look they are pretty good. I also like the tacos,  although they arent AUTHENTIC tacos. Obviously. The only thing i do not reccomend are the fucking nuggets man. They taste good at first but leave my insides rotten.... no other fucking food in the world but those nuggets. Otherwise, good."}
{"text":"I visited Store #1555 on 10/7/17 at about 5:45 PM. I ordered 1-spicy chicken sandwich, a medium order of french fries, and 1-Jumbo Jack sandwich with no cheese but extra tomatoes. I repeated the \"No cheese, but extra tomatoes\" twice to the young woman who took my order.   I paid at the drive-up window, got my order in the bag (after the manager asked and confirmed the order), and drove home. After arriving home, I realized I hadn't been given a receipt.  The only part of the order that was correct was the fries. Chicken sandwich was cooked so hard I could barely eat it. The burger had double cheese and standard tomatoes, contrary to what I had specified.  When I returned to the restaurant to return the remains of the meal and ask for a refund, I felt that both the female employee and the manager were argumentative and did not respect me as a customer. The manager kept calling me \"brother\", and never did introduce himself nor apologize for having failed to give me a receipt.  He finally did give me a partial refund, but never once was apologetic for the incorrectly and poorly prepared sandwiches, nor for my inconvenience at having to make a second trip to handle the matter.  Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location, even if my \"brother\" isn't working."}
{"text":"I like going here cuz they remember what I like are friendly and always have great service"}
{"text":"The young woman working the drive-up was incredibly slow tonight. She only had one speed. She tried to look busy by walking to various points behind the counter but always came up empty handed.  And I caught her looking at her phone. The guy who was maybe the manager also wandered around behind the counter. Meanwhile, the cars are stacking up behind me. I think they were hoping that people would give up and drive off. The food was actually good."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER GO TO THIS LOCATION. At least not if you are planning to park in their parking lot. YOU WILL BE TOWED. Turns out they are working with Monster Towing Company, which has been scamming paying Jack in the Box customers for years. Check this out:   http://www.azcentral.com/business/call12foraction/articles/20130920tow-firm-conduct-questions-call12.html"}
{"text":"I have had good experiences with the staff here however the area is terrible.  This is a  hot spot for the panhandlers in the area.  I can think of at least a couple of times when their begging made my guests feel uncomfortable.  I am not saying this is a bad venue just that you should be aware of this issue when choosing a spot for seeing friends or a date."}
{"text":"This is the worse jack in the box ever! They messed up my order twice I asked for my money back due to the time they finally got it right my food was cold the manager ripped me off half my money."}
{"text":"tried Jack's spicy chicken burger and chicken nuggets. burger was good but fries were cooked in very stinking oil."}
{"text":"I just wanted something quick and easy so I stopped by Jack in the Box after the lunch rush. I've never had an issue with JB so I figured it was safe. I went inside and was greeted with a scene from Idiocracy, specifically the hospital scene. The young lady mopping the floor, looked to be attempting to jam a salt packet through one of the walls, before giving up to rearrange the dinning furniture with the head of the mop. The gentleman taking orders at the register was either too taxed to remember a simple greeting or had never been taught, so i was greeted with a blank stare and a grunt. While waiting for my order, the register man and mop lady exchanged yells from across the restaurant, despite diners being present. All of this while the manager was no more than 5 ft away. If I had an all you can eat coupon for a year to this Jack in the Box, I'd still go to the Wendy's across the street."}
{"text":"I do love jack in the box and never have had any problems at this location , the staff is always pleasant. I've never seen the girl working today , maybe it was the long line that got her a bit stressed that her customer service just wasn't on point today? Who knows she kinda rushed me away I didn't even ask for ketchup since she gave me that look like \"girl just go there's a line\" but yeah, she forgot to throw some napkins and ketchup in my bag. WAMP wamp. I'm alive."}
{"text":"food is always cold and undercooked.  staff is less than friendly & lack quality control of orders"}
{"text":"First time ever at a Jack in the Box, and the last.  Sorry JITB, I guess I picked the wrong one to go to first. The bum sitting outside should have been my first sign but I ignored it.  From there it was all down hill.  Person behind the counter couldn't communicate and after giving me the wrong amount of change she only smiled and laughed.  Food was slow to prepare and prepared sloppily.  I think I'll stop with the large chains and begin supporting locally owned establishments, they'll probably care a lot more about first impressions and service"}
{"text":"I just came through the drive thru and I'm always seeing people around the corner begging for change. I also ordered an Bacon ultimate cheeseburger with no bacon. This location usually has ok service until tonight. This location needs improvement."}
{"text":"Wouldn't accept their own jack in the box text offers sent from the company. Employee at drive through was very nice and sincere in apologizing just followed managers orders. It's cool Robertos is in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here my food is always cold the women that work here are very rude seems like it takes twice the amount of time to get my food and if you try to complain about their service or their food you will get a super super rude woman that will come and tell you how wrong you are and how customer service is not their priority. This store needs every employee to be fired including managers supervisors and the GM with a brand new crew that actually cares about the job and service they provide. People at this restaurant must forget customers are the reason they get a paycheck. I don't care if they gave me free food for the next 10 years I will never come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Shady service!! Nobody in line and they made us pull forwards and then backwards a couple of minutes to get our \"fresh food\". Why can't you just let us watch you make the food?! The guy was just a complete jerk about it all. First no probably last time we go here."}
{"text":"The employees here are nice, but both times that I have come here they did not have very many clean tables to sit at. I left my table looking cleaner than when I first sat down. Also, the backs of the chairs have sharp edges, and I hurt my back when I sat down lol probably my fault though. Anyway, it is not too bad here. What else could you expect from a Jack in the Box? Their food is great, no complaints there (just as greasy as  ever! (; ) also they gave me all the sauces my heart desired, so I was happy about that."}
{"text":"One word...Pathetic. As soon as you walk in through the doors the music is blaring into your ears. It's not very welcoming especially when you're hungry. That also says about this so called fast food place that the employees don't have much consideration towards the customers. Now it's not usually this loud during the day. But in the evening it seems as if every time! Apart from the music being annoying, you're being ignored for a good 5 minutes until an employee attends you. I understand they need to help the drive through people, but those lazy people didn't get off their ass to order their food that makes them even fatter. So the employees tend to prioritize the drivers outside instead of the people that walked in. Really sucks because you grow inpatient quickly. Again, especially because you're hungry. Once you're lucky enough to pass the first test or should I say 2nd after the music. You have to wait for your food to be prepared. One time I ordered 3 chicken sandwiches and it took them 30 minutes exact!!! I timed it too. I mean   what the hell!! I was so pissed and frustrated because I wasn't just the only person waiting for my food. Everyone is just so annoyed inside this jack in the box that people start doing stupid stuff in order to get attention. It's actually kinda funny. Once your food is ready, this lady has a freakin boom mike yelling out your order lol. It really doesn't help and it's overdone. Bottom line, this fast food joint needs to pick it up and hire some real employees that know what they're doing. I also think this place is way too understaffed. I seriously wouldn't bother going to this place if it wasn't one of the only places open on mill ave at 10-12 in the evening to get a bite to eat.   Seriously it's sad."}
{"text":"Avoid this Jack in the Box. We  should have eaten at Denny's right down the street. First thing in the morning, 6 am and the restaurant was FILTHY! The breakfast was HORRIBLE, and the service was the worst I have ever seen.  Not that anyone reads Yelp reviews for fast food, but seriously don't go to this one!! The food will probably give me the runs"}
{"text":"10:10pm went by the drive through, ordered my food with extra hot sauce on the side. I get to the window, graveyard guy dustin? Doesn't greet me, hands me my bag of food \"says thank you\" goes back inside talks to 3 other of his employees, i look in my bag no extra hot sauce, no napkins and no fork for my potato wedges, drove home half way there i realize they didn't give me one of my sandwiches, i had to drive all the way back to get my sandwich. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today, ordered the Supreme Croissant sandwich with hashbrowns. Food was great, Customer service was excellent. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The chicken teriaki rice bowl thing was pitiful.. But the breakfast 24/7 thing is VERY cool.   Minus 1 star for at least 7 homeless ppl hanging out in the parking lot, it smelled like literal poop outside the place."}
{"text":"Crappy slow service that is not fast at all which is ironic this is a fast food restaurant and they tell every Car to pull forward to the front so they can pretend their drive thru time is fast when it's slow and crappy stay far away from this dumpster until they upgrade their service seriously"}
{"text":"I guess you could say they don't have the best service, it isn't unusual that they make mistakes but they correct it. I'd say overall it's a good service"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great besides the fact that at night their shake machine is ALWAYS down! Literally every time I have gone to this location at night I can't get a shake. Now I'm not that picky I understand it sucks to clean that machine and it's time consuming, I get it but at the same time I always go on the weekends when tons of ppl are there and it's only like 1 am. This is Vegas! Plus this location doesn't close, they are open 24 hours. Seriously you can't just close down a machine for the entire night the moment you get to work so it's ready for the next shift just so you don't have to deal with it the whole night. It's ridiculous that this is constantly happening. Come on night shift, when all i want is a shake and i can't get that I won't even order other food from your establishment, I will simply go to another place where their machine is up and going so I can give them my money."}
{"text":"The employees are always kick ass. 'Steak' and egg burrito sucked ass. I wasn't even aware that any steak was present."}
{"text":"Bottom line, jack in the box pretty much sucks at any location. Although the mini churros.. Omg"}
{"text":"I used to stop here and get a chicken fajita pita on my way to eastern NC.  Stopped in today.  The pita was quite awful. Very few ingredients on the pita and I had asked onions to be left off and they didn't comply to the request.  Also, the unsweet tea taste like bug spray.  I tasted it and poured it out.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from eating their food. I don't expect it to taste good, but at least don't try to kill me."}
{"text":"I order here 2 -10 a week. I order the exact same thing every single time...price for that same order ranges from $4.71 to $5.84.  If I say something..sometimes it will get fixed.  Super annoying the huge price change depending on who charges me...and for the same EXACT order. I've started to reduce my order and the amount I visit.(which sucks...I love Jack in the Box)"}
{"text":"Service is ok and same with the food.  The thing that makes this place good is that there is a pokestop there.  So it is a decent place to get some cheap food and play that pokemon go."}
{"text":"If you are super high and it's 2am this is your spot, otherwise, avoid it as there are much better options all around it including Rubios, 5 guys, chic-fil-a, and pizza."}
{"text":"Suppose to be open, its 4:30 till -4:45am but they have the drive thru blocked by trash cans and cones, employees saw me wanting to order but looked the other way, seems they are having too much fun inside, someone needs to be on them to want to work. Seems as if they blocked it to have an easy shift unfortunately at the expense of the custoner.  Would put zero stars if i could."}
{"text":"Omg this was the most awesome service I've had all month! And it's funny how it's a fast food place and I got better service in the drive thru on a graveyard shift than any other restaurant I've been too lately!! Props to the funny drive thru guy with positive energy! I wish I got his name so I could name him on this review! Excellent job!"}
{"text":"I don't want to even give this jack in the box one star... Every time I get food here late night or early morning I have issues with them. I just recently got food and the guy was rude by asking me how many egg rolls we wanted just because we ordered 2 3 pieces and an egg roll with a meal and yelling at us through the speaker box... Then after we got our food they forgot to give us a drink and we sat there waiting trying to get their attention but they were too busy talking to someone in the dining room (which was closed). So finally I yelled at them through the window and they finally have us our drink.. COME ON REALLY? Finally at home the quality of the food sucked.. My eggrolls were burnt and the lettuce on all our burgers were brown and shriveled.. I try to avoid going there because every time before that I've gone they never had sweet and sour sauce. I just thought to give them the benefit of doubt and try again. But now from this experience I would rather drive the extra few minutes just to get better service and quality!"}
{"text":"I felt so disrespected. Even from the MOD. Dining room says it's open till midnight and I got there at 11 and the MOD said \"you guys need to go through the drive-thru\" (in a pissy attitude). Then after I get through the drive-thru, I see her letting people come in and eat. Never again. AND, I ordered a combo meal and received no fries. Unprofessional. I would put zero stars if I could. Please don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"No shakes at 7pm on a sunday?  Disappointing to say the least. Guess the workers did not want to dirty the sake machine. Took  10 min to get 2 breakfast jacks..."}
{"text":"This place is a joke I have been going to this jack in the box for 3 years and all the sudden the past three times I have gone they have been outrageously rude and disrespectful from messing up orders and then acting like they made no mistake not even the manager has anything to say I guess minimum wage goes up and productivity goes down"}
{"text":"Avoid this place, It has guys hanging out waiting to tow your car. If you eat there and then shop, they watch as you leave the lot and call a tow."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! SKAM ARTIST! RAYMOD WAS RUDE AND OVER CHARGED ME TWICE! I've been going to this Restaurant for a while. The last two times I've been here he's charged me over. It's principal of the matter here. And when I asked him why he did that he said \"There was a recent price increase.\" Ok I get the increase... But I was here two weeks ago and he gave me the same excuse. Mind you this is false advertising. AND HE HAD THE NERVE TO LAUGH AT ME AND TELL ME TO CALL THE 1-800 #! Then change the prices on your boards! I would have given this review no stars as this restaurant continues to give rude service. Now off to call the 1-800 # and really give them a piece of my mind. Don't go here. I guess class wasn't part of their motto here. Very disturbing as well as disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is bad. They can't ever get my order right. Today makes the third and last time I'll ever go there. I even asked her to read it back to me. They still managed to screw it up."}
{"text":"Out of all the reviews I've ever left nobody has been ruder than the employees that work at this location. The food was prepared poorly the employee that took my order at the counter literally rolled her eyes at me when I ask for salsa with my burrito. I will never return to this place and I love Jack in the Box I'll Drive to a different one. If you would like me to take this review off please contact me and let me tell you in person why I left this review."}
{"text":"The drive through employee was sooooo rude at this location!   I said \"I'm sorry, I can't hear you\"- twice  to the girl taking orders at the speaker- at the second time she said (very clearly) \"Forget it!\"  She had an extremely thick accent and spoke super fast- so maybe she was tired of repeating herself all day... but it doesn't excuse her rudeness.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because I still like the chain- but will not go to this location again."}
{"text":"This is the worst JiB I have ever been to. The soda machine in dining room is broken, so you'd figure they would automatically fill your cup for you, but no, you still have to ask them to fill it. My mom found a hair in her chicken sandwich. Service as crappy and our food took forever. I will never set foot in this place again!"}
{"text":"Had to put a star since there is no zero or negative star. I walked in and stood there for 5mins while all 4 employees were in the back talking and laughing just having a good ol time. Cashier walks up and seems irritated because he's not back there gossiping with the women. Gave him my order \"bfast jack\" to go. I ended up with 2 bfast burritos. Was to lazy to make myself bfast so now I'm eating a bfast burrito while thinking of the bfast jack and asking myself why didn't I just make bfast this morning."}
{"text":"Melinas customer service needs improved. Returned my onion rings tasted stale got lg. fries instead. Did not offer change because of price difference.  I had to ask. Then she left and returned with her change purse and gave me a dime. As I was walking a way she made a comment that I shouldn't have wasted food. REALLY....."}
{"text":"The employees here are courteous and prompt, and I have never had a problem with any of my orders here. Been a customer 2+ years."}
{"text":"I went here late one night at about 3am. When I pulled in to go through the drive thru I saw a couple employees running in to the building from the parking lot. After I ordered and drove up to the window to pay the young man said to me \"you cut my smoke break short\". Really? First of all, employees should not be out smoking on shift. Second of all, if you were smoking and then ran inside, you certainly did not wash your hands before you touched my drink cup and bag of food. Gross! It was rude and disgusting!"}
{"text":"Drive-thru service was horrible. Food was not worth money. Will not ever go there again. Some prices are not available all hours."}
{"text":"Count the cars in the parking lot. Never more than 3 even during busy times.  There's a reason for that. The WORST location. Don't torture yourself just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Imagine the creepiest, rudest staff ever. Imagine half of the menu missing when you try to order. Imagine the offers they advertise not being available yet (they are up in a week). Welcome to this Jack in the Box"}
{"text":"Best Jack in the Box in the valley. I just always come here for coffee, and they always so nice. The young girl even recognized my voice through the 'drive thru'. Highly recommended!:)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ive had at a jack. I had about like 4 dollars in coins and the lady working in the drive thru on new years day around 11:30 at night told me to count the money myself and to put it in little bunches for her but when I already had count it and told her how much it was. She then told me she could refuse service or I could walk around and of course I wasnt going to walk-in I clearly went thru the DRIVE-thru for a reason."}
{"text":"The food was good but service is horrible!! I just get off work and went to get some thing to eat at 11pm. The lady there was yelling and not pay attention to me. I was ordered just 1 meal, but she charged me for 2 meals. And she was argue with me that I was the one who said 2 meals, which I didn't. Also, they were taking care of the drive thou first, even though they should taking care of me first. I was ordered first, but I was the last to get my food. Just because I wear a fast food uniform and go in, doesn't mean she has to treat me bad. I'm also a customer. Also this one guy came in try to buy a drink, and she just told him to go to circle K instead. I like the food here, I came here many time, but this time I'm very disappointed! Well at least she gave me a free fries :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a sour dough jack which came not toasted, jacks late night munchy meal with the stacked burger and it has the same bread as the sour dough... again not toasted. I ordered all regular fries with one munchy meal and no curly but got still got mixed. We were given an extra drink and shorted 2 tacos and wasn't given a recipt after I paid. People were messing around and unniformed person was hanging out eating food and playing around. Not going back."}
{"text":"I come to this Jack in the box fairly often because it's the closest to my home and as a college student I don't have a lot of time to cook, so I usually get the same order, home style ranch chicken club meal with no bacon, or h'angry chicken hash with no buffalo and wakey bakery hash with no bacon. This time however, when I ordered the latter meal, the girl told us she couldn't take off the bacon, and instead she took off all the cheese. We said it was okay because she told us they were putting the bacon into the sauce, we were clearly confused and thought best to ask once we got to the window. Once we got there, we asked how we should order it next time so there wouldn't be any issues since I most likely would come back again in a day or two. She went on an explanation as to how they make the dish, saying all the cheeses and sauces are added and then they put the bacon, when we pointed it out that she had said the bacon was added later her eyes opened as big as saucers and she said it was in the sauce again. Then they went to charge us for cheese that was suppose to have been on the hash... until finally they told us they were just gonna give it to us free, most likely to finally be rid of us. A second after I got the bag I checked and they had spilt the cheese on the bag , we just left because I wasn't about to continue this conversation. I guess it's time I change my location or fast food restaurant, there are some only a minute away form this location."}
{"text":"***I just want to note that I am basing this review on the customer service that I received earlier and not on anything else***  I received a coupon in the mail for a $1 off my iced coupon so I thought I would give it a try. I ordered a regular size iced coffee at the drive through and gave the employee a heads up that I had this coupon. Then I drive up and the female employee only says, \"coupon?\". I hand it to her and she grabs it out of my hand. Then she comes back and says, \"card?\". I hand her my card and she grabs my card to make the transaction. Then I felt as though she gave back my card and receipt with a little force. Then she gives me my iced coffee with a little bit of coffee on the lid.  I would have appreciated it if the employee would have said more than 2 words by making me feel welcomed instead of a bother. I also would've appreciated it if I could have been handed my card more gently and not with as much force and if I didn't have sticky coffee on my lid.  The reason why I'm giving the customer service 2 stars instead of 1 is because the service was pretty quick.   I will be going to other Jack in the Box locations as I have standards."}
{"text":"Pretty consistent with serving hot food. Employees seem friendly. Not in the best neighborhood and doesn't feel well lit or safe at night. Avoid putting whipped cream on your shakes especially during the summer... often they'll not put it back in the refrigerator and you'll end up with curdled cream on top of your shake."}
{"text":"This place is so bad, that I just had to download the app, create an account just to tell you about it. First of all the cashier is very rude and has an attitude. My food took 15 minutes to be ready and they're soda machine doesn't have any ice and the soda is flat. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Guess JITB is afraid of what people will say of the one they have on  West Blvd. Went to the one on West Blvd about a week ago , have not been in about 6 or 8 months, see thing never change, gangsta wannabes hanging out in dining area, management seems not to care, or are they intimadated by the GWB's Food was cold and greasy.....This time I will stay away......"}
{"text":"Worse service ever.  Sat in line behind one car for over 15 minutes!  Part of time window person was talking with person in car, elbows bent, just chatting.... Never again."}
{"text":"As far as fast food is concerned...I'm a fan of Jack in the Box.  The burgers are always great.  Sure they're like 10 zillion calories...but that's the byproduct of tasting great.   I also love that you can get to tacos for a buck. You heard that right...a buck...and no they're not authentic...but they're a buck...and not bad at all.  I'm not generally a fast food lover...but I have yet to have something I didn't like from Jack in the box.  Just ask my belly...or look at it."}
{"text":"We go here just about 3 times a week and the customer service is terrible and on 2 seperate occasions they forgot my tacos i am very unsatisfied with this place and the service"}
{"text":"After waiting for almost 15 min to receive my food I get home only to bite into a mildly heated sourdough jack..."}
{"text":"Man THUG FIRST!!  Alrite so who doesn't hit Jacks up after a night at the club if ya goin home with more than a female under the wing lol.. So we pull up and there were 0 lights but it was open nonetheless.  Seemed like this was a 1 man operation and he had the attitude ready for confirmation. The dude hit u with the \"why you callin my house @3am\" attitude.  The food looked freshly refreshed from during the day. At least when you're dazed you don't notice too much. But the Thug First moment was when he asked if we wanted sauce and gave us a nano-second to reply. Once we did, instead of just grabbing the buttermilk goodnes he snapped sayin 'thats why I asked you.'  Thug First doesnt tolerate that so I yelled from the passenger (dont drink and drive please) seat, \"Thats why you work on the 'they put me all by myself shift son!\"  I swear being nice in times of blatant rude activity is gettin old. Tired of givin passes out but Oh well better than giving Money out from lawsuits lol! THUG FIRST!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review fast food joints, mostly because they're all pretty similar unless one is really really good, or really really bad. This is the first. Frank Thompson was the guy who was at the counter, and I don't know if he's a manager or just a worker, but he's the most up-beat, energetic fast food worker I've ever seen. Extremely quick, professional, and so enthusiastic. There is a lot of debate over wages for fast food workers, and this type of worker is the only one that I would say deserves a raise.   Oh and the food was good as well."}
{"text":"This is a drive thru review at this location. First I just want to say the order menu that verifies accuracy was not working or perhaps not in use, with that said it was almost impossible to communicate my order. I'm craving a Southwest Grilled chicken salad so of course they don't have any available that's ok because I always plan ahead and order the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl instead, but why for the life of me are there never any salads at a certain hour? I proceed with my order, and order 2 Jumbo Jacks the guy ask me if I want those in a combo, NO buddy, if I wanted the combo I would have gave you the combo number to begin with. I then order my last item which is just a plain kids hamburger for my dog, again he wants to make it a combo grrr! Then it's time to verify my order and he blurs through my entire order in one syllable. I ask him to repeat my order, and of course he sighs then reads it back with an attitude. What confuses me even more is why would you read back my order by saying 2 Jumbo Jacks with NO CHEESE. News flash dude, 2 Jumbo Quacks with no cheese are still just 2 Jumbo Quacks LOL."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location every night after work. But when there are more than a half dozen cars in line and you have an employee taking a smoke break, and then another one coming out and acting ratchet, yelling and cussing. I'll never return to this location again. These are some of the rudest, ignorant, and unprofessional people I've ever seen (that's saying a lot, this is fast food). This is one of those times that the corporate office needs to get involved and fix this location."}
{"text":"Let me just begin this terrible review by saying I am a current Taco Bell manager and in my 6 years of experience in customer service I have never visited a more disgusting and truly terrible establishment. On Friday October 28th, I ordered 4 breakfast items from this location. I was told to pull around to the parking lot as my order was being prepared. I received my food and left. When I got home i looked in the bag and saw a item was missing. I called and spoke to a woman named Kim who was the manager. She offered to replace the sandwich. I sent my mother over because the sandwich was for her. As my mother is on her way and I'm eating my first burrito, I took a bite and there was a hair in my mouth that was coming out of the middle of the burrito. At this point I'm disgusted and want my money back for everything. Well loving Kim only refunded me for the one burrito. When I called back later about a miscommunication she got and attitude with me and said she wouldn't refund me for my meal. Or for the sandwich they FORGOT TO PUT IN THE BAG IN THE FIRST PLACE. I work in fast food and if they aren't doing something as little as wearing hairnets then that means the aren't hand washing properly or might not even be caring enough to water gloves. I hope that no one goes to this location and if you do please keep a sanitary note in mind."}
{"text":"Jack in the box, you had one job, you weren't supposed to make it until I orded it. Ordered a number 2 through the drive thru. (Was the only one there until i pulled away) The fries were banging. Peach tea tastes like peach chemicals. The hamburger... was obviously either put together before i ordered or everything was pre cooked and chillen under the warmer. (How ever they keep their food warm). The bread was dry as hell, like cardboard. The hamburger was room temperature, the cheese was already hardening. Its been a long time since i ate jacks. I had a long drive and decided to stop by. Welp, wont be doing that again. The service by Veronica was nothing less than perfect. Hats off to you my dear. Otherwise, pick another fast food place. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I've lived near this Jack in the Box for about 4 years now and I will have to say that the employees here are the most courteous employees I have met.  In this amount if time I have only had maybe 2 or 3 times were they have messed up my order and even then they were very eager to help rectify the problem."}
{"text":"This place is garbage! First of all, it was impossible to hear the employee through the speaker at the drive through. Besides that, I made a really simple order and even that was messed up. Immediately noticed that part of the order was missing. They took the bag of food from me to fix the order. We sat there in the drive thru line for what seemed like ten minutes. A six+ car line had formed behind me. They finally came back to the window with another bag claiming that the issue had been fixed. We did a quick check to see that we had the correct amount of food, and it appeared to have been corrected. When we got home, we realized the order was wrong, again/still, and the breakfast sandwiches looked like someone sat on them. They were extremely smashed! The other part of my order was the coffee. I asked for three coffee's. Two regular, one decafe. The employee asked me if I wanted the coffee to be hot. Yes, of course I do! He told me there was no hot coffee, and that I would have to wait for a new brew. To make a long story short, the coffee was cold and watered down. Avoid this location! Horrible! This was my first time ever going to this location, and my last."}
{"text":"If you're thinking of taking advantage of the 24 hour deadline on Fridays and Saturdays for this location, don't. I've literally walked over here (I live nearby) and when it becomes late night, their \"computers are always down.\" It's obviously a half-baked excuse they use to implement to just hang out.  And when you do show up and order, they treat you like a burden. The food is absolutely delicious, especially when you're craving a burger, but it's corporate/ chain, so the recipe is probably hardly difficult to mess up.  Trust me, you're better off ordering from your closest McDonald's. Not as good food is better than absolutely no food."}
{"text":"Brand new place. New staff.  Food is JITB but nothing special.  It has a fireplace in the dining room. Reminds me or mountain fast food places..."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is one of the best I've visited. The employees are always friendly, and the food prepared as you would expect from viewing their TV commercials. For example, the Buttery Jack is BUTTERY! (Unlike a few I've eaten at a few other JITB locations, they where dry and the preparer didn't seem to get the \"buttery\" part.)"}
{"text":"Pinchi jack in the box. Siempre me salen con su mismo chiste sito. Yo vengo bien contenta y la muchacho de la ventana agarra mi orden mal y ni me dio mi soda, con que me voy a pasar mi pinchi taco aguado? Cabrona si no te gusta tu trabajo, lárgate para que contraten a alguien que si les gusta su trabajo. Chingaros ya mejor voy a cocinar mi propia comida."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-through and ordered a breakfast Jack no cheese no meat because I'm a vegetarian, but I do like the extra veggies I ordered extra lettuce, tomato and pickles on it. I'm not sure why it's so hard but every time I say extra lettuce tomato and pickles it just never happens. I don't mean that for this particular drive-through I mean that anywhere I go.  But this time when I got to work and started eating my breakfast Jack it was amazing it actually had extra lettuce tomato and pickles THANK YOU so much for whoever did it right today February 10, 2016 at 5:39:47 AM through the drive-through store #159."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place ever. DO NOT GO THERE. That is all I need to say. This place needs to get shit down."}
{"text":"I don't go to McDonalds and do go to Burger King, but I bought my very first burger at JIB and couldn't believe how good it was. For $1.29 I got a Big Cheeseburger and it was tasty, chewy and large for something on the Value Menu. Went back the next day and bought more for supper."}
{"text":"This JITB is so slow. It is 2 minutes from my house and I won't go there anymore. Every now and then in an act of desperation I'll try again and they remind me why I dont go there. The hamburgers are dry. Tacos are always overcooked. After all the waiting you somehow get cold food still. And now they ask you BEFORE they even give you your food \"How was your service today?\" One, like I would answer that honestly without my food already in hand. Two, how would i know, I don't have my food yet. Any other JITB is just fine. This one leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I love Jack in the Box.  It's cheap, convenient, and the food is always hot and fresh...most of the time.  I am old school I get the Jumbo Jack meal with no onion and 2 tacos for 99cents."}
{"text":"Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame..."}
{"text":"I try the new french toast plate with bacon... Delicious!!! They have my favorite cashier at graveyard.  No matters what time is   she is all the time happy and friendly..   i love to come to this jack..."}
{"text":"I don't always eat fast food but when I do crave Jack in the Box this is the place! this location has great customer service very patient with customers and always get my order right and when I asked for extra sauce they don't complain or give you a dirty look this Jack in a box knows what they're doing! I've gone to other Jack in the box and horrible service... Keep up the good work 35th Ave and Buckeye location! I don't care if I have to take a drive to go to the jack in the box lol.. can't comment the inside cuz never been in side..."}
{"text":"When I go to a fast food drive-thru, I am not expecting a \"fine dining\" experience, but I am expecting a \"fine\" dining experience. And when I can't even say the service was reasonable...   The last time we went to this drive-thru when my boyfriend got out of work at 1am, the halfwits working made us back up and pull back through. They couldn't manage to put a burger on a grill or tacos in a deep fryer in an amount of time satisfactory to Corporate so they had to register our car as two vehicles.   When we got home with the food, the fry container was barely filled and food was missing.   Emailed a complaint, heard back from the District Manager who offered to send coupons. Never heard from him again, never received coupons.   Tonight, same thing. Ordered food, was asked to back up and pull back through, got home with our food and tacos were missing, burger was thrown in the box upside down and oozing with sauce.   Barf-ola. Must miss. Don't bother. Buzz's girlfriend, woof. What a dump-a-roo."}
{"text":"Nastiest food I,ve ever had from a Jack in the Box, tacos were stale and extra greasy,  burgers were burnt, bread was stale and burnt, fries were old."}
{"text":"They have a good Jr. Bacon Burger that is seasoned well and juicy, the Cheesy Potato Wedges were so delicious, and Oreo milkshake was so good and rich and creamy. The only problem is the service. They gave us something we didn't order, Chicken Nuggets. I gave them back to the lady at the counter. They didn't have the fastest service either. Sorry Crystal but my service was bad. If the food was bad and I got a stomachache, I would give it one star. Since the food was good"}
{"text":"Neighborhood eating place.  Food has consistently been going down hill.  After complaints to both the manager Pepe, and corporate office decided to finally throw in the towel and start warning folks.  Getting your order strait is a crap shoot.  Afterr waiting in lengthy lines you get to the window to pay.  After paying you get a list of what they are out of at that time.  Varies never coffee items at night even though breakfast is served 24 hours a day.  Onion rings on occasion.  Actually told if we really wanted them we could go to the Dysart location.  Tonites order was so rancid that after eating some of it, It came right back up within minutes.  Tomorrow I will be making a call to the health dept, instead of giving them another opportunity with my money.  Buyer Beware big time...."}
{"text":"I ordered a supreme croissant.  I got an overcooked dried out egg, soggy croissant, no bacon, what the hell! It was like I got a day-old breakfast jack on a croissant for 3x the price.  I already got to work before I realized what they gave me and now I am in a bad mood."}
{"text":"If you want good fast food go to the restaurants in Sun City. I guess if they do it right the residents get mad because this place is 10 times better than the one by me!"}
{"text":"Good news is, unlike McDs, there is flavor to the food.  The bad news is the prices are outrageous. Replace a bun with sourdough bread, add a slice of undercooked bacon and double the price.  Jack you are too proud of your food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Linda is by far the sweetest lady on the face of the planet. She is the only reason I go back to fast food!"}
{"text":"We tried this Jack in the Box for the first time last week. Drive thru service was great. Their shakes are AMAZING, fries were nice and hot but I wish I could say the same for the burger. It didn't taste fresh at all and was borderline cold."}
{"text":"So I guess they're not really open 24 hours a day only when they want to serve you or if you're their friend you can come whenever. Tonight marks the 3rd night in the last month that I've tried to come and order food later in the night because I work late and there has been some bullshit excuse about their system going down and them not being able to take orders which I believe is what you learned in like fourth or fifth grade to calculate tax and give the correct change back I don't see why nowadays you have to have a computer to do the math for you but??? The other one was they were short staffed so they couldn't take orders and now the same tonight there's a guy outside smoking with somebody in the drive-through and he's  telling people that come up that he's the only one there so he couldn't take orders but we could call in a little bit cause they will have coverage than come back..... So ok upset but kinda just deal with it but I drove down the road looking for a fast food spot that's open but nothin so I turn around and head home on the way back it's now been 20 25 minutes since I was told they should have someone there to help very shortly so I thought almost 30 minutes was enough time so I pull back in and there's a jeep in the drive through and the passanger is putting wet floor cones behind his car blocking the drive through so I parked down the parking lot and watch as they pull up to the window and talk with the employee for about 5 minutes and he hands them s bag of food???? And honestly I didn't see an initial transfer of money or change givin only a bag given to the customer......."}
{"text":"All of my food was old and obviously microwaved. The cheese in my jalapeño poppers were rubbery. My tacos were still cold. I don't really expect much from a fast food place but it could have been better!"}
{"text":"What do you expect from a fast food chain.    Had the Southwest chicken salad. Meh."}
{"text":"Just stopped here. Zero customers, food took forever. Cold fries. Filthy restrooms with no paper towels. No napkins in main lobby.  Biscuit was good though. My boyfriend wanted me to add that."}
{"text":"This morning the younger idiot lady in the am took my order I told her #28 and she doesn't put a hash brown in my bag I go inside and she acted dumb like,\"oh you ordered a combo?\" Yes idiot that's why I ordered a #28! she even repeated my order. It's not rocket science and ordered one combo that's 2 things, the sandwich and the hash brown. I am sorry but there is no hope for you if you dont even have common sense."}
{"text":"The woman at the take out window was so nasty and rude that before I even placed my order I left.. if someone is that NASTY before I placed my order I sure don't want her touching my food after!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Jack In The Box. The restaurant was okay, but nothing to write home about. The food was also just average. It wasn't bad, it didn't blow me away, it was just what I expected of an average burger and fries. I guess what I'm saying is that if you want a place to get some food, this place is alright.  If there's something I could pick at it's that it took about 10 minutes for me to get my food. All I ordered was a burger with cheese and a fry. I'm not sure if this is usual, but if it isn't, then it was slow. I didn't take off any stars for this, but it's something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"Embarrassingly poor customer service. After being rushed along and asked if we were \"done\" after every single item we ordered in the drive thru, we got home and the food was not only wrong, but also cold... like, refrigerator cold! I called and talked to the incredibly rude manager, Yamilet, who repeatedly interrupted me as I tried to explain the situation. She was not apologetic whatsoever and I couldn't even get more than 2 words in a row in before I finally gave up and we tossed our full order in the trash- with no refund, might I add. Not sure how Yamilet came to be a manager or if she even is one (since she also is the rude women who took our order,) but if she's the best woman for the job, Jack in the Box is in some serious trouble."}

{"text":"Went here for our two free tacos the other Tuesday. The place is clean, the service was as can be expected. I hate how all fast food places seem to give priority to the drive through. Tacos were actually good! I haven't had Jack In the Box Tacos since my college drinking days when they were a 2:30 am staple."}
{"text":"The worst place I have been. The food was okay.. getting jumped outside hit with a crowbar was the worst part. Not one person inside would help they gave me a phone that was not working to call the police. The mother of one guy works inside is why they didn't help I will be suing I do not recommend going to this jack in the box."}
{"text":"I usually dont do Jack in the Crack when it comes to a fast food stop but every once in ahwhile the mystery meat taco sounds good.When the mood strikes though this will never never be the Jack I go to.Nothing against homeless people or those that are struggling but allowing them to sleep at a table inside is absolutely unacceptable!That wasn't even the worst of this mistake of a trip.Midway through my meal an obvious \"having a hard time in life\" individual dressed in \"drag\" walks in with his personal red \"solo\" cup and ask the Jack workers if he can get ice tea?This poorly run establishment gives him the green light to use his street cup to get a drink from the fountain machine!!!Absolutely trifling and dirty.I wouldn't even allow my kids to use sippy cup at a fountain machine out of respect for everyone else!I will never go here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on Crack in the Box but they have French Toast sticks and sometimes it's the only thing I can coax my 2 year old to eat.  Yes... When I'm desperate, I will resort to fast food to feed my child. It's not often but I do it. This location is really clean though.  Not a lot of traffic through here when I'm here but it always seems like someone is cleaning. The staff is pretty nice too.  They will usually come bring me the order if I'm sitting down at the table. Who get's table service at a fast food joint nowadays? I've had the grilled breakfast sandwiches here.  They're actually not too bad. A little greasy for my tastes but it will fill me up which I guess is the purpose."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast all day!  What a plus, especially if you overslept and missed the cut off time for breakfast (10:30am).  We're on our way out and headed back home to Cali.  We wanted something light and enough to get us through for a few hours on the road.  A small and light breakfast was prefect at the time and we are glad they served them all day.  This place was just located a couple miles away from the Las Vegas Strip right on the main boulevard itself.    Food         =     B+ Service     =     A Decor        =     B"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat fast food occasionally.  We decided to stop at this Jack in the Box due to the fact it was on our way home.  I have to say that this was by far, the worst fast food restaurant we have ever eaten at.  The place is dirty and the staff are unbelievably rude.  My wife had a Jumbo Jack and I had a chicken sandwich.  The buns were stale and I do not know what kind of dry over cooked meat was in between the buns.  Also, the fries were stale and cold.  This was during lunch so you would think that the food would be relatively fresh (for fast food). Not so much.  Do yourselves a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"I just don't think the food is that good, I have eaten there 3 or 4 times, nothing special. I'd rate them Behind Wendy's, McD's, BK, Sonic, Hardees, and the local fast food places. I've been to Seattle, it seemed better out there, maybe because they have more customers and the food is fresher. The closed stores dotting the area should give you a clue."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Came here at 5:30pm on friday. First of all the woman who took our order was not friendly, she rushed us and didn't give us our total. It was on the screen so we knew how much to have out but once done placing our order she just told us to pull up. Once we get to the window the woman has hickeys all over her neck and gave us a different total! Sounds like a rip off. She had no name tag on so I can't tell you a name. She didn't make any eye contact with us and handed the bag as if she just wanted us to get the hell out of the drive through. Seeing how I live within walking distance I come here often but I will be sure to go out of my way to another jack in the box from now on."}

Great service and everything was hot. Thank you"}

They were so good I ate both when I got  home and put  the shake in the freezer for later. Crystal if you don't want to run Jack in the Box think about a career in TV and or Radio  You Rock"}
{"text":"Nasty, greasy food... you are aware of that already, right?  But, always good service here. Their mini churros really hit the spot when you need a deep-fried sweet treat. Shakes are tasty, too."}
{"text":"This is the greatest Jack in the Box I have ever been to. The manager and his staff are very attentive to all our needs. The food is the best within the Jack in the Box restaurant system. I am a frequent visitor to this location and always leave happy. It is worth checking out, you will be happy."}
{"text":"WORSE customer service ever, pulled into the drive thru, the person taking the order had an attitude to begin with. Ordered my food 3 times and she still got it wrong. Told her to scratch my order I'm coming inside. Not one customer in sight, employee and relative maybe sitting in left corner of store. 3 employees that I see behind the counter. Not 1 again not 1 came up to help or even stated we would be with you in a minute or anything like that. Finally someone comes to the counter I ask for the manager she says she is the PERSON IN CHARGE. So I ask for her name and the name of the person in the drive thru which she stated was her. So I asked her why she has such a bad attitude and she said I didn't have an attitude I couldn't hear you our headsets are bad. Not sorry our headsets are not working right like any professional would've said. At this point I'm pissed took her store number and name, left a message for corporate or distract manager, also sent an email regarding the incident. I will not be returning to this location EVER! So I spoke the manager on 8/23/16 come to find out she gave a false name, she said her name was Crystal and her name is really Claudia. So I guess this jack in the box employee thinks it's ok to Lie!"}
{"text":"Been to this location only once but I had a great experience. Usually, fast food from jack is not fresh at all. I got a Jr bacon and the bacon actually tasted fresh and not dried up to a crisp. Bun wasn't stale. Plus, the lady who took my order was so sweet and even asked me if I wanted a water cup. Never had anyone so thoughtful at fast food. Overall, pretty darn satisfied"}
{"text":"If you wanna wait for 25 mins at a drive thru.... YES 25 mins for a kids meal cheeseburger. Take a trip to the Jack In the Box on Tatum. What a nightmare!!!! Even crazier... I actually waited."}
{"text":"Should have paid attention to my gut feeling and just saved my money when I drove up and nobody was at drive thru during peak supper hours, but I was in a hurry to get to work.  Service was fine and friendly.  I was craving my favorite Mango Ice Tea, so ordered that in my combo burger and fries.  So disappointed!   My mango tea tasted like bad water despite shaking and stirring.  It was undrinkable.   The fries tasted like the were cooked in stinky oil and had sat.  Toasted bread of my burger was like stale sponge.  Too much mayo and ketchup and no lettuce whatsoever.  Burger itself was okay and the tomato slices on it were the best part of meal.   I left half the bread, most of the fries and most of the tea.   Way too expensive for such a lousy meal.   People should know that this location has very low standards for the food they serve."}
{"text":"Since I travel for work all over the place I have eaten at a few of these, and this one has been my favorite.  Fast, friendly service at the drive through.  I am hooked on their Mango tea.  Very interesting tacos.  I appreciated the cold crispy lettuce on my hot taco.  No tomatoes on the taco, but maybe they aren't supposed to be on them?   I want tomatoes on almost everything though."}
{"text":"I enjoy this Jack In the Box very much. It is usually very clean and recently the staff has improved greatly! However, even though it may take over some jobs, the self-ordering touch screen kiosk is awesome. My order will not get messed up and I am a whiz on a computer like machine. I get it done so fast! Do not have wait for someone to find the tiny little button with the item on it, do not have to repeat myself over and over, and as soon as I pay, my order was out in an adequate time frame, which was good cause I was craving the grilled breakfast sandwich.(Best item to me) AND...almost forgot...because I used the kiosk they offered me two free tacos! Ya, freeeeeee. Not sure they offer it every time, but still. Bonus points for this visit.   This was is way better that others I have been to. One in Portland, took for-ev-er! They had one guy working the night I went, which is ridiculous. I think he was a manager and all his people quit, so he had to work it all. So this one here, I give props for being quick, yet still delicious !"}
{"text":"Great food and a very nice employee working around 2 am 4/16/14  while we were at the hospital kiddy - corner to the drive-thru. Amazing breakfast food which I think is better than mcdonalds! First timer. I was very pleased!"}
{"text":"I live in Greensboro NC and wish we had a Jack in the Box is this area. When I lived in IL I would frequent one several times a week for the chicken fajita pita and their fries dipped in their buttermilk. Over the weekend my significant other and I decided to plan a trip to IKEA. My first plan was to find the closest Jack in the Box and add it to the GPS. Coming from Greensboro this was a very easy location to find. I had not been to one in over 15 years so I was surprised to see it was as clean as the one I remember in IL. I mentioned to the clerk I had not been to one in a long time and wanted the chicken fajita pita which used to be a #9, now a #13. I ordered it without onions and with the fries and buttermilk. The clerk said seeing me so happy made her day. I think I was so thrilled to be eating one of my favorite meals again. When the order came it was just as I remembered it! It was not one bit greasy and very fresh! I ate every bite with such pleasure! I highly recommend this location for the friendly and helpful staff, the clean interior, and also the best Jack in the Box food I can remember! Knowing it is about an hour away I need to make a few more trips there. I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Food took close to 30 minutes to be made. Was stuck in that drive thru for way too long. Staff was also inattentive and mildly rude."}
{"text":"Never going back to this Jack in the box.  Went there around 5AM to get some breakfast at the drive thru. The guy on the speaker said \"Our computers are rebooting for 15 minutes, can't take orders\".  This is the 2nd time they told me this. A few weeks ago they had the same excuse around 4:40AM  I never had this problem at any other Jack in the box. I will file a complaint with Jack in the Box corporate about this location."}
{"text":"I want to give a shout out to the Jack In The Box at  2141 W Deer Valley Rd Phoenix, AZ 85027. You have the best ice tea in town. It's aways fresh, it has a great flavor and that's what keeps me coming back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Love this jack! People here are fast and food is always done proper especially the morning crew"}
{"text":"Stopped by for late night taco's. Service seemed good very friendly. Got home pulled out tacos and there was a brown liquid all over the outside wrap to the tacos. It looked like something had spilled all over them. I pulled out the tacos and they were full of grease. I took them back and showed them and said this is what happens when you re-fry. And she agreed. Asked if I wanted new ones. Got a refund. In the back I see a guy making new ones. I made a comment. She asked again if I wanted new ones. Still took the refund. Told her she was lucky I did not take pics to send to there corporate office. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location in the past and service was very slow using the drive thru. However, recently it is MUCH improved. Additionally, the staff is very friendly, courteous, and efficient, really like the changes here, which have resulted in a very good experience. Regarding the food and the new menu, it was hot and tasty. Thanks."}
{"text":"Terrible!! I went there to order a kids combo with grilled chicken strips, apple bites, and milk. They were out of apple bites and don't grill their chicken strips at this location. I ended up with fries and fried chicken strips!! Way to keep the kids healthy Jack in the Crack!!"}
{"text":"More than a couple of people in line and it all falls apart. Waiting quite a while just to order. Food came up pretty quickly after that but it look like it had been thrown together. How hard is it to get all the ingredients on the bread? I guess the rush of 4 people in line was too much to handle. Food was ok but messy. Also, done woman parading her dog around inside the restaurant. Since when are pets allowed?"}
{"text":"NASTY- MOLD--- GROSS!!!!   Everyone was standing around talking when there was Plenty to be cleaned everywhere!   The food was- regular food.  I went to put ice in my toddler sons cup to get some water and there was MOLD all over the ice spout!  I showed the manager- they put an \"out of order\" on the machine but then decided to mop the floor instead of cleaning the machine. Mind you this is the floor that they would need to stand on to clean the machine!!!  Will not be back here- if something as simple as the soda machine is nasty, what else is nasty in this place!  GROSS!!!!!"}
{"text":"the young thin worker on graveyard that wears the shirt that says BOSS on the back has completely turned this place around! 5 stars man! you completely rock! if you're the manager you should be proud of yourself, this place BLEW before you came around"}
{"text":"We had Jack in the Box for dinner last night! We all ate a jumbo jack with cheese no onions and curly fries to go with it. We only go to this one because it is the closest Jack to our house. Every time we go, there is always homeless folks swarming around asking for donations. Majority of the time that we go, we end up giving to the homeless, but everytime? It is always so the same ones... I know that we are suppose to help the less fortunate, but come on. And the managers, don't say anything..."}
{"text":"Don't ever ever gone there is better to stay hungry then they take your money is the lady. Was fighting with me I told her no cheese in my Barito"}
{"text":"Don't go here RUDE RUDE RUDE .... horrible customer do bad I did not feel safe eating food and just threw it out"}
{"text":"Not a bad Jack in the Box, but not the best either. Wait time is horrible during lunch, the food at drive thru is bagged sloppily, and they tend to go skimpy on the fry orders. The only good point is at least it's better than the Jack on Ray in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Went here tonight through the drive thru and the manager was so rude. I ordered a value french fry and she put a hash brown in my order she argued with me saying that I said hash brown when I even asked the other people in my car and they all said that I said french frys. I just can't believe that she would argue with me about it"}
{"text":"This is not good the only thing that is good is the shakes and the brownies and the cookies"}
{"text":"I have to say for being a fast food joint, their salads are really fresh!  I've ordered their side salad and their full size salad with grilled chicken and haven't been disappointed yet by their freshness!   I've tried the salad at a nearby competitor and I've had mixed luck. Some days the red hair girl gives me a decently fresh salad, but most of the times you can see the vegetables are starting to wilt. That's not the case at Jack in the Box. When comparing the side salads you definitely get more from JITB and I prefer their ranch dressing, although the competitor do have baked potatoes.   I sometimes pair the salad with a value menu item like the chicken sandwich or Jr. Jack.   This is the place I go to for salads when I want it fast."}
{"text":"After a movie, why not stop here @ jack in the box. Beats taco bell right next to it... I'm just really glad that although it seems like I was being complicated on the drive thru, the worker kept her cool. (5 stars for her)"}
{"text":"This. Is the worst jack in the box in the valley I do believe.  The service is poor!, I mean POOR!, The restaurant was  dirty, floors needed swept and counters needed wiped. People behind me were also complaining because of the LONG wait with only 3 people working of which 2 were cooking and 1 doing counter and drive thru. This place needs LOTS  of work and MORE HELP! What ever happened to good Customer service!? This jack in the box is located on the SE  corner of 19th avenue and Dunlap."}
{"text":"Burgers are never dry at this location.  Staff is always very pleasant, which I'm sure isn't easy when I stop as they are usually cleaning the dining room and have to hurry to the drive thru. I stop on my way to work between 3-4AM"}
{"text":"Won't go back again. Strands of long blonde or grey hair in my chicken sandwich and half my curly fries are burnt .On a short lunch break so money wasted and food thrown away"}
{"text":"My husband ate a burger here on Saturday evening, November 16, 2013 and subsequently became sick with gastroenteritis a few hours later. We are wondering if anyone else has had this experience around this date and time. Please be careful what you eat and please if you work somewhere handling food, wash your hands regularly."}
{"text":"Good place to stop after a Panthers game. Service was slow and strange felt like there was only 3 people working in the entire restaurant. Had to wait 10 minutes for our food...at a fast food place. Nothing outstanding but the deep fried tacos were a good source to soak up some over priced beer at the Bank of America stadium. Found the restaurant to be not well taken care of and the sketchy drunk guy harassing us for money was not pleasant."}
{"text":"Wow..just went through drive thru to find that I can only order drinks.  No food as only one person working."}
{"text":"They are getting one star because I can't submit without selecting at least one.  My wife went through the drive thru to get our family something to eat tonight. When she got home we noticed they didn't put my chicken club sandwich in the bag. We checked the receipt and we were charged for it. We called the restaurant and the girl said we had to come before 10 o'clock tonight. We would get the missing sandwich and a free drink. The gas would cost more than that to get there.   Nothing like efficiency for people wanting a $15 an hour raise.   Don't go to JIB# 142!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was a busy Sunday for my family and I , we decided to grab some late night  dinner at Jack In The Box... The 2 kids meals were fine, THE SALAD IS WHAT MADE THIS THE MOST DISGUSTING SALAD  IVE EVER HAD AT ANY FAST FOOD RESTAURANT PEROID!! The chicken was hard, a bit less than warm , tiny, very tough and last but not least That's what happens when you get lazy and go out and buy a salad instead of making it at home ."}
{"text":"Went and tri d to get two separate orders and the drive thru employee told me that it was company policy to not do two separate orders. Whe I told him that I've done two separate orders before he said \"how about I charge your card and not give you your food\". When we made it clear we were not loving until we got the food we were charged for he threw our food in our face and was absolutely rude about it. He ended up laughing on my face after he was rude. I've been coming to this Jack In the Box for 20 years and have not received this much problems. I'll never give them business ever again."}
{"text":"I was looking for something fast, and I guess this got the job done. The burger was okay, but the portion of fries seemed incredibly small (I swear I only got about 20 fries). The restaurant was dirty, and there were even some flies buzzing around too. They only have ketchup packets, and none of the convenient pumps that many fast food places have. Also, they forgot to give me the drink I ordered, so I had to go up and ask for it later.  This location is the kind of place (and in the kind of area) where you need to go to the counter and have them give you a key just so you can use the (kinda gross) bathroom. That probably tells you more than any food description can tell you."}
{"text":"I pass by this JITB twice a day on my commute. Every once in a while, I decide to give them yet another try to see if their food quality and service have improved.  Today I went there and ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. I was, yet again, dissapointed. I've had this same dish at another location (99th Ave and Thunderbird), where the veggies are bright and the rice is fluffy. The bowl I received today was a sad, sad misrepresentation of this JITB product.   The broccoli was so overcooked that it was dark green clumps of mush mixed into the mushy rice. The carrot strips were ok (can you really mess those up?) and the chicken was dry, but edible. I ended up fishing out the broccoli nastiness along with the inedible rice, which left me with 4 strips of dry chicken and a tiny pile of julienne carrots.   I won't give this location another try. Their customer service is horrible to-boot, and doesn't even kind of make up for their disgusting food. The manager should take a serious look into what his/her chefs are doing there, because they certainly aren't making food."}
{"text":"Y'all wanna make $15 an hour but can't manage to get my whole order in the bag! #gtfoh #wherethefaremybaconcheddarwedgesipaidfor"}
{"text":"The service at this J in the B location makes the food taste better.   I was coming home late the other night, and figured a grilled cheese sandy from Jack in the box was the right move to make, so I pulled up to the drive thru.    The man taking my order was cheery, pleasant, and fun.  His enthusiasm was refreshing and sincere.  When I pulled up to the window he asked how I was tonight, and we began chatting about crazy things he saw that night working the window.  (Drive-thru flashers are apparently \"in\" right now)  I can't give a fast food place 5 stars, but the service here is 5 star caliber.  It's so refreshing to meet someone who loves their job, or at least, does it with sincerity and enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Jack in the box sucks now! My food was cold, I've actually never had a pleasant experience at this location. I think jack in the box is one place I will never go again."}
{"text":"It took forever for my food to be made, yet it was cold when it came out.  Jack in the box used to be so good, crappy service now and shitty food"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast while I'm waiting for an oil change across the parking lot. Service was quick and friendly. Cleanest JITB I've been to in quite some time."}
{"text":"Do not ever go here if you don't drink soda as they do not give out water cups they will instead make you have to buy their \"value drink\"."}
{"text":"I usually order the same thing.   Stuffed cheese jalapeños and chicken pitta bread but lately   their food sucks!   My fiance order a chicken sandwich and it was gross , cold. Nasty!!! My jalapeños had a funny taste maybe was the cheese.  I know it's fast food but had better times than this ."}
{"text":"I like this JITB because it's usually pretty mellow and easy-going. Food is great, breakfast is always available, the place is clean, and it's nice place to take a breather. The manager there (Manuel?) does everything from taking orders to wiping down the tables, picking up trash, and tidying up the place during down time. It's refreshing to see a working manager that's a team player."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, the girl at the counter had no clue what she was doing. In stead of ordering my meal like I had told her. She ordered everything separate. When I went to fill my medium cup. I ordered a large, there were ants crawling all over the fountain machine. Needless to say this has ruined my j in b opinion on service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service ever. Not only did it take 5 minutes for me to get help, when I finally did. They were rude as hell! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"WTF... took 19 minutes to get our order at 2:38am... nice boss but should give us a bonus burger or fries for having no Coke or Sprit. Cheap bastards.... customer NOT happy"}
{"text":"What an outrage I have food stamps. Unfortunately that's all I have and when I found out that Jack in The Box accepted EBT. I rushed right over to the closest Jack in The Box near me. Only to find out that the 2104 store in Las Vegas. On Las Vegas Blvd. Does not accept the EBT. Cause the owner of this particular store Jack in The Box says that the EBT would bring a certain kinda customer he does not want. This owner should lose his / her right to own this establishment. Jack in The Box has lost a lifetime customer forever what an absolute shame"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this jack in box! It was 11:30pm and we went to the doors. Even though they close the carryout lobby at midnight and there were customers in the lobby STILL ordering, a employee LITERALLY walked up and locked the door right before we put our hand on it! That was rude as hell but we decided to go in the drive-thru. So apparently the 5 cars that were there have been there before us for a good 15 minutes or more. Unknowingly I pulled in only to be stuck there for 20 minutes Not Moving, with people at the front even honking their horn. Luckickily after another 10 minutes the 2 folks behind us gave up as well and back out giving us a chance to escape this he'll ish Not Fast food crap shack. I Can say ill never eat here again even though its a block away. Plus past times burned our patties to a crisp. Your losing business great job."}
{"text":"This place is a sad excuse for a restaurant, even a fast food restaurant at that. I'll admit it, I go to fast food places way too much, but this takes the cake. Worst fast food experience... Ever!  I've been here 3 times over the past year and all 3 visits were horrible. Today was the worst and I will never go back. You literally walk in, not a single worker is in sight, or comes the counter. After 3 or 4 minutes somebody eventually came forward, not apologizing, and then they took our order. I was continuously hearing complaints from the employees, talking amongst themselves the back, sharing stories about activities outside of work, and swearing like a sailor. F**** this, F*** that. There are kids in the lobby, and these punks who are working there have no respect for the people in the restaurant, or the people they work for.   But I'm guessing the upper management is no better. They've let this location go to hell, and it is obviously whoever owns this franchise doesn't care, or they would get a manager who is paid well enough, who would care, and get the store in shape. When a franchise like this is run so poorly, it brings the whole chain down. Hoping this location goes out of business, so I better run restaurant can take over."}
{"text":"Terrible service, messed up everyone in my groups order and then said they didn't because that's what the receipt said even tho that's not what I ordered. And the diner was dirty as hell. Every trash can was over the top and trash on almost all the tables."}
{"text":"The service was really unfriendly! No smile no even she said thanks or welcome  The lobby was a mess and dirty The food was was good I can not believe that the employees do not take care their place of work and treat their customers well. I hope the owner and Managers read all the reviews a see a lot of one star scored"}
{"text":"They couldn't hear me from the speaker so I pulled up to order, they still couldn't hear, started throwing attitude at me, checked food when I got it, all good except for sourdough jack with no mustard and just ketchup. Went in to get it fixed. Manager Darlyene giving me nothing but attitude, first time it came back with tomato, ketchup and mustard when I asked for a Cheeseburger with just ketchup. Second time came back with just meat and ketchup on the bread. A Cheeseburger with no cheese? Really? The problem would have been fixed if Darlyene would have just listened the first time. I asked for my money back for the burger and she wanted the whole order back, nothing but bad attitude thrown at me. They don't give a Crap about customers at this jack in the box. Avoid going here."}
{"text":"1/15/2014 Jenine S. 4 friends 14 reviews This is by far the best Jack in the Box in town! Food is always great, staff is friendly ALWAYS! My dad still talks about how kind the manager was (a year later) when he visits my house. I think some people just have to write something negative about everything. But from personal experience this is the place to go. They always make my day great! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Not a bad environment.  Good food. Just parking issues... I clearly noticed that no one was in the lobby but the parking spots directly in front of the store were in use...(not that parking further is a problem. I don't mind walking).. But it was clearly the workers that are parked here and its a fairly large parking lot with other complexes by it. So that seemed tacky to me...other than that it was alright...."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the drive thru. started giving my order, then girl repeated my order then asked how many churros... 5 or 10.  I stated I did not ask for churros... I was about to complete my order then she cut me off and gave me a total and said please drive forward.  HUH!  so I did I figure my order can be straightened out at the window.  So i pull up she asks for the amount given I asked alexandra to repeat my order she did it was wrong.  She corrected it... No apologies nothing... then proceeded to get my order literally slammed it on her counter threw napkins in it and said here you go!  No thank you no smile nothing.  And so the management knows at this place she gave me the extra food I did not order anyway.  Unless you can't find anything else in Tramanto then don't go here!!!! run far away.  I Will never go back!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 large curly fries and these assholes put half French fries on the bottom of both . Fuck y'all. Do your job and make more. fucking scheming asses"}
{"text":"More often than not staff are extremely rude, to both customers and each other. Orders are rarely accurate and service is slow at best. A clean table is a rarity so I went through the drive-thru; my order was incomplete and without a receipt.   After a dozen or so visits I have finally learned my lesson and will never patronize this JnB again."}
{"text":"I only visit this location because it's close to my residence. Tonight I ordered a teriyaki bowl & the rice was almost cooked. That's not good enough. I've had other issues with this place. I'll just make the trip to the Jack in the Box on Dobson & Chandler Blvd from now on. They do a good job in my opinion."}
{"text":"This recent trip was the first time I've been to a jack in the box in 10 years and the first time I've ever gone sober.    I got off of work and was very hungry, realized I had no food at home, and made the impulse decision to stop in here.  There was no line so I ordered quickly.  My food was ready in a few minutes.    First, these sandwiches look absolutely nothing like the pictures.  Smaller, grayer, and totally unappealing to the eye.  The taste was blah but whatever I just wanted some food in my belly.    Second, the place was full of crazy people.  They were being loud and obnoxious and generally behaving like crazy people do.  I should have gotten drive-thru but ate inside because i was hungry.    I plan on not going back for another ten years, or at least not when I'm sober."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. Consistency is usually a good thing... Not when it comes to ride employees. I drive out of my way to a Jack In The Box to get decent service I kick myself every time I accidentally end up in this locations drive thru. I promise you almost anything is better than this place. I like Jack, just not this one."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero I ordered a burger at 1150 on Sunday, took 25 mins to get it made me late to work they put out 10 orders through the window before mine and I ordered first. They are timed at the window so if you go in and to go they will ignore your order and put yours out last. I wanted my mony back bit I really waited 25 mins for a burger I wonder if the corporation knows about what they do. Awful. And most of there employees look ileagal!"}
{"text":"The cashier/server was friendly and quick. The sandwich was well made. But the coffee was out, both regular and decaf, at 4 pm. Maybe it's just my luck. Otherwise I'd give it a 4-star."}
{"text":"So I'm currently in the process of moving and came to this jack in the box because it's close on Aug 26 @ 1030 just for them to tell us they were closed yet the signs say drive thru 24hrs and yelp says open til 3 am. Either fix your signs and yelp or management needs better employees that aren't lazy and lying to customers just so they don't have to work."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Jack-in-the-Box in the whole fucking country The staff is not very nice they don't even apologize for the whole time that you're waiting. Just don't come here.  I wish I could give it -1000 stars."}
{"text":"isn't jack in the box supposed to be 24/7? i mean....how sad is it that at 5am in las vegas i can't get a freaking ultimate cheeseburger and curly fries?! i have actually given up on this jack in the box because it has failed me more times than not! you are a disgrace to the jack in the box name! pffffft!"}
{"text":"Well I just went by to get a shake 1045 at night and their shake machine is down again it never ceases to amaze me how their shake machine is down whenever I go through the drive-through I'm so over it I'm not going to this location again."}
{"text":"The guy that was working cashier in the lobby messed up our order.  we were missing a Munchie box and the guy did not want to fix it  because my friend took a bite out of the sandwich they messed up on. 04/18/15 am #406"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Tacos earlier at the drive thru the crazy thing, it wasn't even busy. Got tacos with holes in them. Never seen this before the meat in the taco tasted funny. Long story short the lady replaced the tacos. A 2 because the 2nd set of tacos were perfect."}
{"text":"Best customer service at this Jack in the box! Everytime we come in here, it's clean, our order is correct and the employees are great!! Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Dude!!!!  This is literally the SLOWEST fast food restaurant in the city!!!  17 minutes in the drive-thru is RIDICULOUS!  Never again"}
{"text":"Glad to see  a Del Taco near my new apartment so went In all excited to get me some Del Taco, drive thru was crazy busy so walked in and was greeted by Kiesha at register, she played around and was great.    She was really nice friendly and professional! I'll start walking in vs drive up JUST. Because of her!  Hope management realizes what a good employee he has on his hands, you could tell she liked her job as it showed, most fast food counter people aren't as fun yet professional at the same time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here early Sunday morning on my way to work.  It made me remember why I avoid fast food.  Went through the drive-thru, paid for my food, got my food, and the guy said \"have a nice day.\"  He never gave me my change.  I didn't say anything because it was only 20 cents, but I'll never return and I don't encourage anyone else to eat here."}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food to me. Not a lot of places have impeccable service considering they're probably getting paid minimum wage with a few bad eggs approaching the drive thru window. Buuuuut, if there's a few things I can count on Jack in the Box to deliver, it's this:  Perfect curly fries Cheesey bacon potatoe wedges  Jacks Munchie Meal (for only $6) Deliciously greasy tacos   Always my go-tos when the cravings start hitting. Thanks, Jack."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the drive-through a little after 3am on June 17th with a friend of mine. A girl asked us what we wanted and we said we needed a moment to figure out our order. Not even a minute passed and she told me to turn off my truck in an extremely rude tone. Then after turning my truck off, wasting gas to turn it back on, 5 seconds later she asks us what we wanted again. Still not ready and still rude. So we pulled through to the exit without ordering. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I haven't even tried my food yet, Mrs Preacher is so nice and sweet the food could be terrible (not likely) and I'd still go back just to order a shake and see her smile. Brightened my day."}
{"text":"This place is aweful. Employees were joking around in the back and ignoring their coworker upfront. It took me 15 minutes to get a hamburger with two other people in line."}
{"text":"Everything you may need to know: It is always a hit or a miss with this location. About 75% of the time, the food is good. About 50% of the time, their customer service is spot on.  PROS:Their fries tend to be really good, and I've never had issues with their breakfast. they actually have let me know if there's a promotion in the past(like, did you want to get the promotion combo? It's only .30¢ more and comes with this stuff), which is great. CONS: There is a older guy there who may have a speech impediment,as he always speaks way to fast, loud, and seems to mix his words together. They seem to \"run out\" of stuff a lot, or their systems/machinery \"act up\". Like accepting gift cards. I had an issue once where they dropped some of my brunchfast potatoes and didn't replace what they lost, so I had half the amount. And sometimes the burgers are cold/dry. There was a time once where people were in line for a very long time waiting for their food; Whatever was ordered, we got our food and almost finished our food by the time some people who were waiting got their food.  If you can visit a different Jack, you probably should. But you don't have to avoid it. I've gotten decent service more often than not, and the food also."}
{"text":"The one star is for the fact that the poorly trained staff are trying their best. I asked for a milkshake, not once but twice. What did I get? I got 2 cups of ice cream. Seriously?  No one here knows the difference between a cup of ice cream and a milkshake? Apparently not because the female manager said that the cup of ice cream is a shake! I hope corporate sees this. I've been to two of your restaurants (McDowell and 3rd Street) and (7th street and Buckeye) both have sucked."}
{"text":"Been a while since I'd been in here. Since it had always been relatively clean, I decided to give into my urge for a couple of tacos.  Nobody was at the counter. I waited, and waited. Finally the girl in the kitchen with limited language skills went to find the manager. Again I waited and waited. Apparently the manager could out wait me because I finally left in disgust. While I was waiting (and waiting) a couple of other potential customers came and went. A couple of tacos ain't worth the wait."}
{"text":"i love this place and i love everything you have on the menu..  Its fast food so if idiot like Irida N. would write some thing about customer service is so crazy insane.  Maybe the staff is rude to you Irida N. is because you plain morally insane. Irida N. grow a soul have some peace if not invent a robot that can serve you only.  You are like an ugly troll of yelp that constantly complain about every little thing.  nobody listen to your crap on real life so you go on yelp and write this crap. Unless you can work better than dont write about stuff that beyond your control.  Be part of the solution and not another compain troll."}
{"text":"i love this location because very convenience located near the school. as for  Irida N.review we now know she have alot time on her hand that she dont know how to use it wisely exept for going on yelp and write all negative review about places that sure can use her help constructively. so all restaurants and shop and fast food chain watch out for this elitist moron. Grow a soul  Irida N. and start a charity instead. you are just one ungraceful yapping waste of a life and god creation.  Did you appear in one those morally damaged and  persnickety types  princess episode the porn channel?  did your parent not teach you anything? did you get a lot criticism when you were a child? do you have alot of hate inside? Do you wan all your pictures post at the door of all these place you review.? you might look decent in this life time but if you keep spreading lies and slander about anyone or any business you will be reborn extremely ugly in your next life or perhap later in this your life. open your heart to kindness and your soul to god. Go mediate for a while before you write another stupid review. Be a better person and help the world because they sure need your help. otherwise you are just another soulless zombie on yelp just snicker and snare at everything that does not go your way."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  The dining room was very clean, and the staff very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location they get my order wrong. If I order two burgers they give me one, if I order two breakfast sandwiches they give me one and charge me for two. Or they give me the wrong drink, make sure you compare your receipt and order."}
{"text":"Went to wk yesterday at 245am!! Oouch Order a jumbo jack with extra patty and no seasoning on the pattyies.. (Seasoning is nasty) don't like it at all .. and when I got to wk.. Sure enough,seasoning on the pattyies., threw one patty away.. And just ate the rest.. Went to jack at 7 pm,took the receipt and told the manager what happened.. I asked her if I can get 2 jumbo jacks on sourdough bread,no catup!!! No seasoning !!!  And some fries??? Sure enough .  I got it ..   :0) My bill came to $5.20 , when I went back, she gave me more than. $7 in food.. Thanks"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers here I normally don't frequent this type of venue but I've got to agree this is one of the best JITBox franchises I've been to in Cali or AZ.  Great customer service and well prepared food.  Excellent at what they do.  Would go 5* but hey it's fast good--nicely done anyway."}
{"text":"\"What a coincidence that the system is always rebooting between 4 AM till I don't know what hours and the can't serve\""}
{"text":"This jack in the box has made me sick on a few occasions. I just now discovered yelp otherwise I would have done this a long time ago"}
{"text":"Went to the new Jack's on Broadway & Priest.....the tomato on the Buttery Jack wash disgusting!"}
{"text":"McDonald's always screws my stomach up, so I don't eat it anymore. Jack in the Box is nearly the same price, however after having it consistently for over a week while in Vegas and California, I didn't have any problems. As far as fast food goes, Jack in the Box is affordable, has good food, and puts McDonald's to shame."}
{"text":"Who mixes SUGAR with SALT!? They mixed up sugar with salt!  Aside from taking their time to take my order, they managed to cover my churros with an insane amount of salt. Cinnamon cream filling does NOT GO WITH SALT!! When I went to tell them about it, the lady had the nerve to laugh and didn't apologize. At least they gave me a fresh batch with sugar and cinnamon afterwards.  Will not be dining or even entering the premises again!"}
{"text":"They never get your order right. I work across the street so I come here at least twice a week. They get my order wrong 9 out of 10 times. They do it so often I can go in a get a free combo courtesy of the manager Freddy, because of how bad they are at getting it right the first time. Stay away if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Number 1 on sourdough. Try it and you'll be hooked. That being said, I drop coin in JITB all over the valley and am pleasantly surprised that the best service is here in Centennial Hills. #score"}
{"text":"We don't have Jack in the Box on the East Coast.  I'm glad we don't if this is the norm.   Service was totally disorganized.  And no internet.  Food was ok though."}
{"text":"Went to jack and the cashier was rushing and gave my daughter 3 nuggets  And didn't even give her a toy in the kids meal My jumbo jack meal was cold  Cashier Yolanda was nice but rushing and forgot a lot of things including straws"}
{"text":"If I had been looking for prostitutes, drugs, or a gang crime hook-up, I would have been very happy here.   Unfortunately, I was looking for quick food, and It took more than ten minutes to get my meal even though there was no one else in line.   When I got it, the fries were hot, but the sandwich was stale and crusty. Must have been waiting on the fries, I guess.   Two stars for being reasonably  clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered a #4 combo meal, with medium curly fries and a medium coke. It's pretty straight forward. The menu states that a number 4 is a Jumbo Jack cheeseburger. The person who was taking my order asked if I wanted cheese on it? I asked, Isn't it already a cheeseburger? She said yes. I got home, there was no cheese on it.   Normally, I would say messing up an order is no big deal. I get it, mistakes happen, but in this case I felt like someone would have to go out of their way to make this mistake considering the circumstances and the conversation addressing this very issue with the order. I have made 3 phone calls, and no one has returned my calls. The voicemail does not have a message that identifies who I am calling.  Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but if I order a cheeseburger, why would you ask if I want cheese? If I order a hamburger, are you going to ask if I want meat?! It was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 Jumbo Jacks meals , and my Husband and I got so sick , lets just say we lost 5 pounds in 2 days , felt like we were going to die.. I called Jack in the box and the manager  said she would have the store manager call me, but I never heard from him or her.. I will never eat there again even if they paid me.. My hubby went to the doctor and confirmed it was  food poisoning , I could not get out of bed..My husband lost to days of work thanks to Jack in the Box.  I should call the Food Safety Department.."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. There are nice running around it. Completely discussing. Informed the driver thru person and obviously didn't care."}
{"text":"The worst place to go horrible  customers service  & they never get my order right i will not be at this jack in the box any more !!! I also call their distant  manager  waiting 2 hear back ."}
{"text":"Not being a Las Vegas native made my breakfast experience at Jack in the Box a confusing and difficult one.  The lady in the drive thru seemed be communicating with a combination of Auctioneer and mumbler. She was speaking quickly in with an accent and through the tiny speaker it made the entire experience a bit awkward.  The food was good and the coffee was just the right temperature for drinking.  A good experience overall"}
{"text":"The looooooooongest taking Jack in the Box in the entire city, avoid this location at all costs it is terrible"}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich combo, the lady made me repeat myself 3-4 times and hen I somehow got a chicken breast with bacon egg and cheese. When I called to just let them know, the lady only responded \"oh\". Yeah, not cool but looking at the reviews for it, I should've known better. Who eats a chicken bacon egg and cheese SMOTHERED in mayo?! Grosssss. Get your sh together!"}
{"text":"I love jack in the box. I always have a wonderful time when I come to jack in the box.  I eat jack in box almost everyday. I get four tacos && a large iced mocha coffee! But today when I came to this jack in the box, there were wild children running and screaming and I could not enjoy my tacos. They were screaming loud and I believe they're one of the employees children, I think that if this is going to be a continuous daycare you should invest in a play ground."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the food here... but some people love it.  The only thing I could say is to try it, see how you like it, and go from there.  This location is alright but I've had some issues with long waits on occasion while going through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Food service was bad today and it's Thanksgiving! It was so busy. The manager did not have control of her staff. Orders were taking too long to process. The workers were very slow. Some orders were not processed properly that orders did not come out. There were many of us who were furious. The manager tried to refund the money but customers want their food since there's a lack of places to eat due to the holiday. In this situation she should had just given refund and food!"}
{"text":"Love this location, super friendly staff. Very courteous and accommodating. Clean and quiet. Love those onion rings and all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"The service was very good today plus they have really good coffee.   And then there is the free sandwich when the Cards get a sack deal..."}
{"text":"Where's the egg? We ordered a breakfast jack with no meat and received bread cheese and a hashbrown.  Who does this?"}
{"text":"I love this location by my house I just hate the service I get comming in to eat here. You have to wait forever for someone to come take your order then the sodas are always out with the new machine. And they   are very rude."}
{"text":"Gave me the incorrect food items and became belligerent when I asked for the items I ordered. I was then told that they were out of key ingredients to make my order correctly.   I'm not keen on them giving me what they want me to have in comparison to allowing me to make another choice...it is my money after all."}
{"text":"I came through at the graveyard shift around 2 AM and they were surprisingly busy! They had a manager running the window though, so he was killing it! Shout out to Klinton for providing excellent customer service, serving good food, and all while having a full drive thru with limited staff."}
{"text":"I found a long brown strand of hair in my food. I know it wasn't mine, because I have platinum blonde hair. The drive through employee made a comment about me having \"counterfeit money\"... not very good. Unsanitary and unfunny."}
{"text":"Jack in the box is just a normal fast food place. Not great but not bad. I like 2 minutes away from it so I go there a lot and have started to become sick of it.  The 2 tacos for a dollar is a good deal. They are yummy.  The jr bacon burger is also really good.  I like the teriyaki chicken bowl. Didn't even know they had it for a long time.  Their curly fries and potato wedges are really good. The wedges are really greasy and look kinda gross but they are good.  Their hamburgers are meh."}
{"text":"As a kid I enjoyed it when I traveled out West, but I have come to realize more and more over the years that the food here is truly disgusting.  This was the last location I visited and will probably be my last visit to a Jack in the Box in a long time. Even for fast food I just can't stomach it."}
{"text":"Really great service and super friendly staff! We screwed up our order and they gave us our money back and were so sweet about it"}
{"text":"Lmaooooo this location is horrible. It's soooo bad, man. They get my order wrong every single time and they take a million years to serve you. The guy at the window is pretty funny to listen to lol. I only go here because it's right near my bf and I get the munchies sometimes haha. But to my friends with even decent standards, don't go here. Lol. Unless yo"}
{"text":"They never wear gloves when they prepare your food! Saw an employee making sandwiches with her bare hands, this is now the third time i have seen this here! They do not care about your health here."}
{"text":"First off how can you work at jack in the box and not know if you have antenna balls? No cream for your coffee or not asking if we want any?"}
{"text":"Fine by me.  It's your typical Jack In the Box.  Our order was correct, fast, and friendly."}
{"text":"I went by at 1:40am on a Sunday and swear no answer! Had to go to another Jack! Not a soul on site and place is open 24hours and I was hungry!"}
{"text":"The absolute only time I eat here is if I have a craving for the buttery Jack, an oreo cookie shake, or churros. I've never had a problem with any of the people that work here (except 1), but I have a few problems with this location.  1. Way too many people begging for money. They need to keep the premises clear. I'm not against giving someone a buck or two for food, but having people begging at the intercom every time I go gets to be a bit annoying.  2. They take FOREVER to get people through the drive through. First you have to wait at the intercom for 5 minutes. Then when you get to the payment window, they find everything to do except take your payment. Then when they finally take your payment, they take another 2 minutes to give your change back. If you're lucky they won't ask you to wait at the window until the car in front of you gets their food. The wait is never less than 10 minutes. For that amount of time, I might as well wait the extra 5 minutes and eat at a real restaurant.   3. At night it seems like they only have 1 person working 2 windows. The other night I didn't see anyone at the first window so I drove to the 2nd window, and the lady had an attitude, as if I should have waited for someone to appear at the window.  Management or the owner really need to fix this place. There is no reason they are so slow. If they are short on staff, there are plenty of people at the intercom begging for money, and I'm sure they'd be happy to have a job or even work for a free meal or two."}
{"text":"Let me just get straight to the point this place is Disgusting...I bought some tacos and then asked to use the rest room. I wanted to throw up. As I sat to urinate I was faced with an open waste basket full of bloody sanitary female napkins amongst others things. I was so sick from seeing that I left and threw the tacos away....I will be posting pics as well. And calling the corporate office on thus location.."}
{"text":"Even though I'm writing this review from Jack in the box at Las Vegas blv. This is for all the all the Jack in the boxes that helped me make it through the day! Jack in the Box has everything you craving for. Starting with the most basic fast food items. Burgers and fries. Want Mexican? Best tacos for only .99 for two! If you looking for some Asian how about chicken teriyaki bowl with egg roll. Get a deli trio Grilled sandwich if Italian is what your looking for. they also have some healthy selections like salads and grilled chicken if counting calories is your thing. With all the selections, even if you don't know what you want,  you're surely will find something to suit your fancy. What else can you ask for? 24 hour breakfast? You got it! No matter how late I wake up I never miss breakfast when jacks' around.  Thank you for being there for me! ..........If you are what you eat, is that makes me a Jack?"}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru today. Everything was right on the screen. Got to the window and the workers were arguing about who has to do what job and using crazy obscenities loudly with the window open. Got my order; looked right in the bag. Got home, and no bacon on my burger, 2 tacos literally had NO \"meat\" in them. I'm not even exaggerating, there was none. Not any! Went to take them back, but I have no receipt and didn't want to be subject to these jerks or have them spiting in my food.  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"New to Jack in the Box, I've never eaten here. SPOILER ALERT: I've still never gotten to eat here. I wish zero stars was a thing.  We came to this location on a Sunday at 10:19am. There were two cars in front of us, one of them was ordering. 5 minutes later another car pulls behind us, trapping us in the drive-thru. At 10:43 a.m. we finally get to the order screen and an automated message comes on then the woman says, \"it will be another 10-15 minute wait\" before we have the chance to say anything. At this point there was us ordering and one car in front of us who was at the window. Two additional cars could have fit in between us.  We told the woman we could not want any longer, if so, we would have dined in somewhere, which is why we are in a drive-thru line and ask if they could ask the only car in front of us to pull up so we can leave and not be subjected to wait another 10-15 minutes. The woman becomes indignant, declaring herself as a manager and says she cannot do that as it is only her and the cook working today and they have to take care of the customers inside the store as well and we will have to wait.   We told her we were not being subjected to waiting for nothing. We advised if they could not handle operating the inside and outside, one should be closed and reiterated its already been more than 20 minutes and we need to leave.  The (what I assume) manager comes out of the back of the building and starts yelling (with a slight attitude) to the 3 cars cars behind us, (quote), \"Ya'all need to back up! Back up and let this customer up here out (pointing to us), we only got me and the cook here today...\" We did not catch the rest of what she had to say since the customer in front of us had gotten their food and we were able to pull up and exit.   I did file a formal complaint. I received a call from a customer relations personnel in South Carolina. They said they were making changes to this location and it will be fixed. According to previous reviews I've read, this has been said before, so I do not anticipate any change. The only line I would wait for over 20 minutes in is Chick-fil-A. However, at Chick-fil-A, even with their line wrapped around the entirety of the building, it's a 15 minute wait at most during peak lunch hours of 12-1pm.   If you are restricted for time, don't go to this location. Wait times seem to be perpetually an issue and once you're in the drive-thru, YOU ARE STUCK."}
{"text":"Its a nice newer facility. I rarely eat Jack in the box, but when I do its always a breakfast jack."}
{"text":"Husband was there this week,DrPepper nozzle was lying on the floor.  He took nozzle to cashier who immediately came around the counter and put it back on, without any washing, ick.  What else don't they wash...hmm."}
{"text":"Ordered a meal at the drive-thru speaker. It echoed back so many times, I couldn't remember what I had just said. This is the third time this has happened. PLEASE repair the speaker or replace it with something else."}
{"text":"It is what it is... fast food... however this one is very clean and the woman behind the counter was extremely nice. The food was hot even by the time I got it home and it didn't look like Ronald McDonald puked it out! Tasted great... again... as far as fast food goes."}
{"text":"Live to stop by here for special occasions.  Have since they first opened! It's nostalgia time every time, so I am a bit biased. Always friendly inside and at the drive-thru.   Unfortunately, I can only visit infrequently because they are 80 miles from home.  Y'all need to pony up and extend your reach up the I-85 corridor like you did to the I-77!"}
{"text":"Not bad, especially for being in the ghetto. I'm surprised at lunch time there isn't any scum hanging around. Place was clean. Staff seem friendly. Wasn't too busy either. If I had to choose again I'd come right back here."}
{"text":"Nice place. Probably my favorite Jack In The Box iv been to in Vegas. Mario? I think was his name... was my cashier. His customer service was excellent and on point. Very clean and not too busy."}
{"text":"Eh. It's okay. Food is good and so is the customer service but I honestly wouldn't eat in here again. Lots of ghetto people. I get it, it's busy, but dude, this is like ultra ghetto scum in here. Tables were sticky. Bathrooms dirty. Yeah. There isn't much space inside to begin with so just use the drive through."}
{"text":"It's alright. I came at the peak of lunch time and it wasn't busy at all. Parking lot was good and not crowded at all inside. Not even any ghetto scum! The place seems great and the cashier was friendly. My only knock on a star was you have to ask to use the bathroom. And there is no drink machines. They get your drink for you. Some people like this but I do not. That's all I have so guess. WiFi is slow but they use CenteyLink so what do I expect. It's going to be slow. Get some Cox internet in the future!"}
{"text":"This is going to be a short review because I don't have much to say about what I ordered and service I received.  I decided to do something different and ordered the spicy chicken jack, regular fries, and a sprite.    The chicken was somewhat thin and not as spicy as I would have liked it.  But the sandwich was perfectly made and not too shabby either.  I probably will get it again but I need to stop comparing it to Chick Fil A spicy chicken sandwich and it's probably even better than what I am describing.  And I got some of the freshest hottest fries from there and boy I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"first off he couldn't hear me when i went to the drive-thru and had  to literally scream my order.  once i got to the window he did apologize for he having yell and why he couldn'tunderstand me.  then there was a wait of approximately 10 minutes to receive my food. once did receive it he did apologize for the wait.   but once i got home the worst experience i have ever had at a jack in the box.  the fries were not crispy and tasted like they were fried in old dirty nasty oil.  and then i ordered jalapeno poppers and the cheese wasn't melted and was really crumpled up.  very very extremely disappointed.  i will be making a complaint with the survey they gave me on my receipt."}
{"text":"Came by for my sweet tooth. Place is typical for Jack in the Box though somewhat dirty. The counter with the drinks and ketchup was a tad dirty."}
{"text":"Ok food, but this Ohioan wasn't impressed. Clean inside, and nice bathrooms though."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and this is my first and ONLY visit to this location. Went around 1AM and ordered from the drive thru. I ordered 3 items in total but the guy got my order wrong. Drove up to the window to correct my order. The last item I ordered needed to be prepared so I patiently waited for about 15 minutes. I could see the staff in the back cooking while chatting with each other in Spanish and the window guy was doing something else. He returns and sees 3 items on the table and packed them in a bag and handed it to me. Normally I wouldn't look inside to make sure the order is correct, I would usually just check that the number of items is correct. When I get home, I find that not only my order was incorrect, they also forgot to give me the ranch dip i asked for. I went here after seeing their new items on TV (Wakey Bakey Hash, Hangry Chicken Hash) only to be disappointed by my drive thru experience but also the quality of the food. If you like the food I would suggest you go to another location, but avoid the Decatur/Trop location! Save yourself the headaches."}
{"text":"Tried the new American Ribeye burger because of a promotion and the burger tasted like tuna fish and it looks nothing like the picture. I felt a bit cheated considering it was close to $4. I could have got a $1 chicken sandwhich and had no expectations for greatness."}
{"text":"Thank you for making my food hot, fresh and delicious the last time I was there.  Five stars!  I'm also doing this in part because I believe you deserve more than one star on your review page.  I know better than to post a corporate rant on a restaurant review page for a local franchise, just sayin'."}
{"text":"We went into place an order at the 2:15 am however, the cashier proceeded to tell us that they cannot take orders because they are not staffed. There were 2 cars ahead of us so we had to back up in the line to leave..."}
{"text":"Came in today to get some lunch, instantly saw a woman by the name Tanit \"working the window\" pick her nose and wipe it on the outgoing napkins.. I have never felt so gross in my life.. Get it together people.."}
{"text":"Friendly service, fast food and quality.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I got a Jacks Blazin Chicken Sandwich. I have had the shits and a very sensitive ass hole for at least 24 hours now. Good sandwich though.  Update: 48 hour shits.. 3 star downgraded to 2 1/2 stars because burning"}
{"text":"Man it's the female manager there. The guys are super nice. but that woman she's even too monster to her staff. One morning I decided to try their breakfast when I do McDonald's they typically can put the creamer in for me if I'm going to the drive thru everyone knows what a pain that is.  She flat-out refused and said it was company policy that she couldn't put cream in my coffee  after I politely asked if she wouldn't mind .  I just don't like her . She makes a great manager I guess. A real whip cracker. I will not be supporting that"}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box location saved my buddies and I. twice this past weekend, as it was one of a very few restaurants open after we stumbled out of the Candy Store. I use the term \"restaurant\" loosely, but we are talking about Phoenix here.  It did the trick, and both times the guys working the drive through had all sorts of personality, the second one navigating a ridiculously complicated order and the errant moans from one of my over served friends.  The two tacos stand out as one of the great hidden gems on any fast food menu. And at .99$ they're  a bargain to boot!"}
{"text":"The food was alright with an exception of the fries. The only problems is that it took way too long and they forgot my drink :("}
{"text":"Tonight after a long week at work I decided to spend my Friday with some food and a movie, I'm not one to go light when it comes to fast food so I decided to stop by this Jack in The Box on my way back from work. It was certainly an unsafe location I wouldn't personally go inside though the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"If you like eating at a homeless shelter perfect place to go service is absolutely horrific! My advice is to stay away from this place at all cost!"}
{"text":"My first jack in the box bc they don't have it on the east coast. I was so excited. I ordered I the kiosk bc they had a promotion of free 5 piece churros. I just got a burger..  Customizable for sauces and stuff. It was good for my first time. Breakfast menu looked great but never got a chance to try it :("}
{"text":"If I knew this place was tiny inside, I would have just opted for the drive-thru instead. It looks run down and dirty. I immediately regret not going for in and out which was like 1 minute away, across the street. What a huge difference from across the street to this jack in the box. I came in the morning and it looked terrible and reeked of pee thanks to the other customers so I absolutely would not recommend this place at night. Food was ok, we just ate in the car for a quick meal because it just felt too dirty inside."}
{"text":"OMG...AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST!  The place is FILTHY, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like!  The smell of the homeless hanging around front of restaurant will ruin your appetite as you enter, however if that doesn't you will definitely be having second thoughts on your decision after seeing the cleanliness inside.  I ordered a fish sandwich with rings and when I got out to my vehicle I noticed the bag was sooooo SATURATED from the grease, of not only the rings but the fish as well!  The box from the rings was sooooo saturated that it was falling apart.  I had no time to go back in because although I was only 1 of 3 people in there my order took 20 MINUTES! I usually am a fan of JIB but this location is a black eye on them.  Corporate should do a pop in and see how horrendous this place is.  I ended up choking down what I could because I was so hungry, bad decision,  I wound up so sick from the grease it wasn't worth it.  So in ending I guess it comes down to are you a gambler?  Take a chance at eating here...I don't understand why the previous reviews were 3 stars it sounded like they had some of the same experience I did."}
{"text":"On Thursday, 5/8/14, I ordered chicken nuggets, fries, and mini-churros from this Jack In the Box. I got the worst food poisoning. I had to go to the ER, and that is the first time I have been there in 20 years.   I would stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place pretty much blows. I've never left a restaurant empty handed as often as I have here. I live nearby & it's usually the most convenient location on the way home from work...but I'll just go to the gas station from now on...or learn how to cook. ;)"}
{"text":"This place just screwed me out of $10 worth of food. My fiancé and I ordered a munchie meal, a burger, mini pancakes, two bottles of water, and a few other things. They almost forgot to give us our water, and when we brought it up they tried to only give us one at first.   I was so hungry I was about ready to faint, so we stupidly didn't check the rest of our order before heading home. We ended up paying over $20 for about half of the order, and didn't even get a receipt so I can't go back and prove it.   Absolutely infuriating."}
{"text":"My experience was as a walk-in customer. I was greeted promptly by 2 different employees who genuinely seemed happy to serve me.  I ordered a mocha iced coffee and mini churros as I had missed lunch and was meeting someone for dinner, but didn't want to totally spoil my dinner. Food was fast and fresh. The young lady even offered me a bag for the bottled water I had purchased from the grab and go cooler at the counter.  This is a newer updated Jack that has a 'hip' interior. It also has one of those soda machine that give you hundreds of flavor choices, if you're into that kind of thing.  My only beef was that it was a little hard to find from the freeway directional signs once you were on the surface streets. I know Scottsdale doesn't want to allow 'garish signage', so I wandered around in the shopping center a bit before I found it.  Over all, it was a good fast food experience."}
{"text":"one of the worst restaurants in tempe not even worth my time to tell about it. my food went right into the garbage seriously wash your fucking hands after you finish your drugs outside before you ever touch my food"}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with their service. They are great here. This review is about the buttery jack bacon and Swiss.   NEVER EAT THIS BURGER ! It is probably that nastiest thing I have ever eaten. It was so gross. I took about 3 bites and I couldn't have another bite. It was so gross. It has so much garlic it's so nasty. Save your money it's not worth it. I don't know why they made such a big deal about this burger because it is so gross."}
{"text":"Ive made a formal complaint to Jack in the Box about this location to no avail, hopefully this one gets through. There is a female, I assume manager, that works late nights (around 2:30am) who is fantastic. Her male counterpart that works the same shift is horrific. Even if Im the only customer in the drive through, im told Ill get my total at the window. However, Im never told my total and he never gives a reciept. Luckily this time my order was correct but thats not always the case. Regardless, I should know what im being charged for."}
{"text":"Went here a month ago when we were visiting.   Had a mid morning breakfast...they seemed to get our order fairly quickly, and the food tasted pretty much like all the other jack in the boxes that I've been too... which is a good thing.    I believe it was one of their breakfast burritos.  The parking outside was decent, and the tables and chairs inside were good too.   It was pretty clean inside, so I can't complain about this location.   I would go back the next time I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"The food was decent but there were flies everywhere! I had to keep swatting them away while I was trying to eat my chicken fajita pita."}
{"text":"Don't come here at bar time. Two cars in front of us were obviously very intoxicated and throwing their garbage all over the parking lot and this restaurant served them anyways instead of just calling the police. When we tried to leave the drive through the two cars decided to block the exit out of the parking lot and gave us the finger when we asked them politely to move. My fiancé ordered an iced mocha. We got some sort of weird milkshake concoction with curdled cream or milk on top. Was absolutely disgusting. Food was awful as well. I'm shocked I'm not sick this morning. Stay away."}
{"text":"Don't bother going after midnight because they're always \"closed\" or want you to wait ten minutes before they can take your order. The 24 hours advertisement is a lie."}
{"text":"Well I can say I am about 50-50 with this Jack in the Box.  Jackie is one of the night people and she's very sweet when she's working and I'm finding out that they typically shut down there milkshake machines around 3 a.m..  Being that is my only complaint because sometimes I can't sleep lately and for some reason a good old vanilla milkshake does the trick so thank you this night at least for helping me once again Jack in the Box and thank you Jackie for always having a positive attitude! On the nights Jackie doesn't work the times on stopping the soft serve varies.  I usually call ahead to make sure MS Jackie is working!  She is awesome!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. But two chicken sandwiches in the middle of the day ... Sat at the window for about ten minutes.  Was it worth the wait?  Hell No.  Curly fries were chewy, greasy and cold.  Chicken sandwiches ... Way over fried and old oil.   Scary to say the Taco Bell next door would have been a better option.  Oh, and over $14 for this with a small drink.   Won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for the location and every time the drive thru workers are slow and not very friendly. My last visit I was told to hold on before ordering and waiting 6 minutes for the girl to come back meanwhile cars piling up behind me."}
{"text":"I struggle with J in the B.   It seems to all run together and in taste.  Saying all that .......I did enjoy a recent breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"No option for zero stars. This location is filthy. The employees are rude. Most of the hardly speak English so you can't understand anything they say. Went through the drive thru 15 minutes ago and instead of them saying \"welcome to jack in the box how may I help you?\" The lady said \"what\".....bought the first thing I saw so I could drive the hell away, when I got to the window, the lady said \"ok. You pay\" I said no thanks and drove away.... this place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service  They are slow And the are very rude  This is just depressing  They are ungrateful of the job they have"}
{"text":"Worst fast food place in the whole country!!!! Ordered drive through and was told to pull over by the front door. Ok, no big deal. After waiting for almost 20 min, I walked in and all 4 employees were talking stories and after I showed them my receipt, only then they started putting stuff in the fryer. They were swearing the whole time I was in there for 10 min. Young female manager was swearing too among themselves. They need to be visited by an Undercover Boss!"}
{"text":"We decided to try it at this Jack in the Box for the first time and not impressed. Went through the drive thru and ordered a meal with a coupon, pulled up to the window and the female in a maroon shirt (appeared to be a manager or supervisor) was too busy talking to an hispanic male in a grey shirt (possible manager) about nothing really. The window was open, so I could tell they were just talking. Finally she just turned to me, without saying a word and stuck her hand out. I waited, thinking she was a beggar on the street the way she just had her hand out (the receipt says her name was Jesica). I could not give her money because as I ordered she said that she would have my total at the window.  She finally asked for the coupon. I gave it to her, she told me how much it would cost for my meal. So she told me, I paid, all while she was still talking about her day with the guy in the gray shirt. She hands me change, and NO RECEIPT. I tried to ask her for the receipt because I'd like to know if I got the correct change, but she ignored me and kept talking. After a couple minutes she brought the food. I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she didn't answer me. She only printed off a reciept and handed it to me. Just reallly poor customer service. What really irks me is that if they were just regular workers and a boss or manager came in, they would have stopped talking and started working. I guess when you are the supervisor, you can just not have any customer service skills at all.  I would have given them a 1-star review but the meal was good. That is something they had nothing to do with. Jesica and the male hispanic manager or supervisor need to desperately work on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"The night shift are always pleasant and understand that the wait times can be longer then most fast food chains and will offer a free beverage if times are  not swiftly implemented to satisfaction."}
{"text":"Very easy to get in and out of the parking lot, just sometimes very congested from the people parking at other stores in the shopping center. Dine in area was remodeled in the past few years and is always clean. Food is always made fresh and made fast and accurate. Drive thru line sometimes can get long, especially later in the night when people leave nearby bars."}
{"text":"If I could leave negative stars, I would.  I don't always leave bad reviews, but when I do, they're horrendous and my intention is to bring this to light to upper management.    I have NEVER in my life experienced worse customer service at a fast food place than I did last night.  An order of tacos, curly fries, ketchup and ranch.  Easy right? We know everyone's guilty pleasure is jack in the box tacos dipped in their delicious ranch sauce.    Used the \"convenient\" drive through, the lady working the drive through must have been having a really crappy day based on her attitude.  I get the food in a couple bags and leave.    Only to arrive home and found that for some reason, they interpreted my \"curly fries, ketchup, and ranch\" request to mean cold plain fries, and loads of taco sauce.   Dinner was ruined.  I called the store and spoke with someone named Hector.  He refused to let me speak with the manager.  He also refused to give me information on whom to contact if I had a complaint.  Hector didn't really do all that much for me except hang up on me and tell me that If I wanted to complain, I'd have to call back Wednesday morning at 8 AM.    worst part?  Hector didn't even ask what my issue was.  He displayed zero willingness to help and of course, an apology was out of the question.    Hector's poor disposition and suffering customer service skils have led me to write a better business bureau complaint.. all over ketchup, curly fries, and ranch dressing.  I really hope it was worth it to you, Hector.  Here's some insider advice though.  NEVER let a customer walk away angry.  If you are in a position of power to fix a situation and avoid a negative escalation, do it.  Since Hector clearly skipped class in any managerial courses he may have taken at the community college, he could use this advice.    It could have been corrected.  With an offer to come back to the store another day and have the order made correctly.  Hector, this could h ave been corrected with a simple apology.  Your lack of initiative has caused me to start the hike up the corporate ladder of jack in the box.  This was an embarassment to you and the entire jack in the box franchise.  Needless to say,  I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is so scary, at least for me. I can't come here at night anymore. I'll be honest and say that during daylight hours it's almost as decent as a 2-star... But I still wouldn't recommend you to try this location. Its on the corner of Flamingo and Swenson, very dark area though.  The customers and people lurking around this area seem very sketchy/suspicious. Wierd things happen whenever I come to this locaion. I would go through drive-thru whenever I can only to avoid the bums around this place. I only come here because it's less than a minute drive from my apartment. The food quality is as every other Jack in the Box. The service is a little below average, kind of slow, once had to be asked to park in the parking lot because the 24 hr drive thru was \"closed\". I give props to the workers though, being able to deal with their customers who come in and out of there using their bathroom without purchasing anything.  Also, everytime I use the drive-thru they're always out of desserts, so much for late night cravings...  On the bright side, theres another Jack in the Box on Maryland if you do decide to find another Location. (I'll warn you that its not that much greater of a location either but theres more light there.)"}
{"text":"This is the new location , before it was on Glendale and I thought the service would better but it's the still same bad service as always . They never get your order right , I know it's fast food but still every time."}
{"text":"I've always liked eating at Jacks! The menu is affordable! I like this location they have the best customer service, I believe the drive through person is Carlos, that guy is awesome and goes above and beyond to make sure customers are satisfied. Thank you for your awesome customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to a Jack in the Box and my last, the meat in my burger (if it was meat) was horrible, rubber with a slight hint of flavor. The curly fries were, ok at best. Very disappointed, in the food. The restaurant it's self was fairly clean and the people did there jobs, no one was super friendly but not rude either."}
{"text":"I visited during a week of fatting myself up for a pending weight loss challenge. Rolled into the drive-thru and found it to be a pleasant experience.  The service was go to go as I ordered up some cheap double burger with curly fries and a soda pop.  With items purchased, I sought out a quite spot in the parking lot to stuff me face.  The surrounding area was sketchy.  Lot's of shadiness out and about.  Stop, grab, move, stop, until I felt like I could devour my meal safe and sound. The meal was made with efficiency but not much love.  What does one expect when dining from a get and go commercial trough.  All in all.....an A-OK experience."}
{"text":"Great customer service and fast!! I don't like that I've seen my food made with bare hands tho!! Especially after they have been on register!! I'm sorry but hand sanitizer is not washing your hands and you need to wear gloves!! They bathrooms are very small too and I don't like that I can never find a clean table to sit at!!"}
{"text":"If there was no star I'd give it that ordered a kids meal was no toy and fries were cold and hard. They don't answer the phone to speak with anyone 3rd shift crew sucks!"}
{"text":"Once again their milk machine is broken! No milkshake for us! Seriously J Box, get it together at this location!"}
{"text":"Ate here around 1030am and although the area is not that good especially at night I have to say I had no problem at this jack in the box location the food arrived really quick the person taking my order was very friendly and upbeat and the food was really fresh which is a plus for me other then that I see myself coming back to this jack in the box location again when I get a chance even with the area being the way that it is."}
{"text":"The customer service is phenomenal at this Jack-In-the-Box. Anita who works drive-thru along with a few others is always ready to please and friendly. I eat here only around twice a month because it is fast food and I am not a huge fan of putting fried grub in my belly. I have had the breakfast Jack sandwich which is always hot and fresh. I normally stop in for lunch once or twice a month and get the jumbo Jack with cheese which is good. Their milkshakes are also good but too filling to have with any other item on the menu. Make sure to ask for a Jack card. It earns you free food off the menu over time. If you enjoy JIB often it pays to get hooked up with a Jack card!"}
{"text":"I rarely crave Jack in the Box,  but when I do,  it's usually after midnight when everyone else is closed.  The last three trips here resulted in me going elsewhere because \"Systems where down\", \"Grill was warming up and would be an hour\" and tonight guess what?  The grill was down and would be \"uhhhhhh like 20 uhhhh maybe 22 uuuuh minutes\".  Hey owners,  maybe not hire pot heads to run your night shift."}
{"text":"Came to drive through and the associate name Allen was extremely rude. He took our order with attitude and really did not act like he wanted to be there at all. Management should really evaluate their workers on customer service."}
{"text":"Tried to look at the menu but was rushed multiple times so I didn't even get what I wanted to try.. and when I got to the window the lady wasn't ready very annoying there literally wasn't even anyone behind me!!"}
{"text":"I'm standing outside their door right now and it's locked. They have employees inside and yet the doors are locked and they won't open them. Since when does Jack in the Box close?"}
{"text":"My first jack in the box. Great experience. Ordered at the keiosk amd got some freebirs"}
{"text":"I love this jack in the box location it's right near where I live each time I order food from here it is fresh and by fresh I mean meat just off the grill and fries just of the fryer fresh I like that never had my orders messed up from here the service might be a little slow but that is okay with me when you always get the food fresh and made right with no orders mixed up or wrong."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 10 minutes and was not even acknowledged by any workers. Left the store to find out other stores in the area were closed, and came back to wait 10 more minutes."}
{"text":"Waited at the drive through for about 10 minutes with no one talking to us or sign to pull forward so we drive up to the window to make the order instead and the guy at the window couldn't answer a single question about the menu so we decided to go through the drive through again and order except this time he couldn't get our order right at all and we had to repeat things at least 3 times. It got to the point where we decided to reverse out of the drive through and go somewhere else.   Mind you he wasn't some teenage kid trying to make some extra cash."}
{"text":"I went here and I got a breakfast platter and it came very fast. I ate and the food was good and when I left all of the people behind the counter all said thank you for eating at Jack in the Box!"}
{"text":"I came in last week around 9pm and got the ultimate bacon combo with my boyfriend and we took one bite and looked at each other and spit it out because the beef was jst hard like they over cooked it and the buns was even hard like they over toast it! Very disappointing with our dinner and won't be returning"}
{"text":"Went to this Thjack and I need to kick myself again rude and food sucks got order wrong.  Never ever again.  This one sucks"}
{"text":"First of all, let me start out by saying if the below post is true I am NOT a fan.  However, tonight I was running late and went by later than usual to the Jack in the Box cause I was craving bacon cheddar potato wedges.  I also decided to get some chicken tenders while I was there (late night drive thru).  There was an African American gentleman who cooked me fresh chicken tenders and brought it out to me and even went back in for the sauces I had asked for.  I really enjoyed his positive demeanor and I will be back."}
{"text":"After making my complaint, both the manager Jeremy and the owner contacted me within 24 hours. I spoke with Jeremy and he was extremely apologetic and assured me he would speak with the employee. I work just down the street so I am sure I will be back. Management at this location is great :)"}
{"text":"Honestly the food is great, although their single burger prices makes one have to buy a meal ($5 for a burger).... I enjoyed the food better than Mickey D's- I wish there was one in the Chicagoland area"}
{"text":"My gosh this place could use a good manager. no hustle at all when it comes to getting your food. never had a problem with the food just a service"}
{"text":"Went for a simple order, yet the cashier still screwed it up. Then, the burger I ordered was nasty tasting. Took two bites of it, and threw the rest to some stray cats. Even they didn't eat the damn thing. They ran from it. Then topping it all off, despite taking only a few bites of the burger, I have been sick since so it's likely that it was badly undercooked. There's few adventures in life I want to experience more than once, food poisoning isn't one.  I know you're a fast food joint and my expectations aren't high, but at least have the food be edible and cooked completely."}
{"text":"Do not go here unless you enjoy getting stolen from.  I ordered 3 meals. Came out to $16.50. Handed my DEBIT CARD over, and 10 seconds later was told \"Uhh your card only took $3. you still owe $13. Do you have anything else to give me?\" I'm no millionaire, but I am a thousandaire, and I'm not stupid! And IF there was not enough funds on my DEBIT CARD, it would have declined altogether. I could see it in his eyes, he tried to scam me. I will be calling the manager. He probably was the manager though.   The chicken sandwich I ordered tasted like cleaning supplies. I threw it away."}
{"text":"Typical burger joint. Bugers & fries were good & buttery. Only downside was dirty bathrooms."}
{"text":"I prefer Jack In The Box over Wendys or Burger King, and *maybe* even over 5 Guys, but they still aren't as good as In-N-Out. And NO ONE has beat Custom Burgers yet. On a side note, I thought it was interesting that they carried Teriyaki bowls on the menu. And pretty cool that they had churros. Wish the fast food in my region would DIVERSIFY."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru today and I must say this was the best Jack-In the box I have ever eaten. Everything was made just right/ just how I like it. Everything was extremely fresh and hot and the customer Service was decent . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went there to go grab the jacks munchies meal one late night, ordered & the drive thru. When i got home i was disappointed.. Soda was just carbonated water.. Suppose to be raspberry iced tea, the deal i got was combination curly fries and reg. fries.. I only got One.. Yes 1 curly fry.. Just horrible and what a waste of money..."}
{"text":"The food was okay but when I asked for my receipt she gave me a reprint.   I was unable to do the survey and get my free tacos I know this happens a lot here because they keep the eeceipts  and probably given to family members don't go to this one go the extra mile There's No 1 800 number to call you have to call the manager directly or the owner and he don't care so do yourself a favor there are 900 million Jack in the box and go to another one.   Then maybe the manager will do something"}
{"text":"Drive thru is always slow. They can't make a burger without it looking like it got tossed on to the bun. Some of the crew is nice and others show they don't care it's just a job. Hard to leave pleased."}
{"text":"When you order they ask you if you want medium or large.  If you choose medium thinking it's the meal item that is on the menu, you would be wrong.  Both options are up-sales.  If you want the meal item on the menu you have to say, no I want the regular or the small, which mean the same thing.  They don't warn you that the medium is an up-sale making you think you have one of two choices when you actually have three.  Very sneaky and very unappreciated."}
{"text":"I spent $30 for a sloppy made order. Worst Jack I've ever visited. No napkins. Food looked like it was smashed. Waist of $$$."}
{"text":"Found two hairs in my sandwich while I was eating, pulled one out of my mouth. Stopped eating and just threw it away."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place. The service is ridiculously slow, but the food isn't bad like it used to be. That's a trade-off I'll take."}
{"text":"ON a Friday afternoon, I found myself starving and in need of some chow.  That hunger was further stimulated by having to shop in the immediate area.  I thought I would grab something off of the value menu but after seeing the \"GO BIG Menu\" on miscellaneous billboards around town, I would try the \"The Jack's Big Stack.\"  The initial order seemed innocent enough, the clerk friendly, the order correct on the screen.  It was at the window where things got a little funky.  Beyond curt, all friendliness stopped as I was handed my drink and swiped my card.  I waited a few minutes before receiving the bag with no receipt.  Is this one of those moments I make a big deal out of it? No words were exchanged with the dude....I thought the better.   I then rolled out not knowing how to proceed other than checking into yelp to document the experience.  I then sat alone in the parking lot wondering about the JBox employee's change in attitude and lack of receipt.  I figured what the hell as I ate the food.  Because the food tasted good and I am still alive and not permanently married to a toilet seat  all must be well.  Three stars because JINB is what it is..."}
{"text":"I've always had a pleasant experience at this location! They never forget anything, the drive thru cashier is always polite and attentive.  Every once in a while you have a hankering for unhealthy fast food this is one of my favs.  Lol will be back again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Alma the manager here is the best. She is always smiling and very helpful.......,,..."}
{"text":"Probably the worst fast food employees I've ever seen on today's visit. Service on any weekday is terrible. The weekend crew seems to have it more together and they are much friendlier. The manager working tonight was nothing short of untalented, inconsiderate, the absolute worst employee they could possibly find. Definitely will not be patronizing this location again which is unfortunate given I live and work so close to it. Seriously, if a location or regional manager ever gets to read this, please consider paying your employees more so that you can raise your standards for them."}
{"text":"The cleanliness nor friendliness was an issue at this location.  However, I ordered 2 Grande Sausage burritos. This was by far the WORST sandwich I have ever eaten in a restaurant.  This is a ticking time bomb for salt. The sauce was over the top nasty. The eggs and sausage tasted terrible.  To top it off, about 2 hours later I am vomiting and have IBS type symptoms at work and have to make several runs to the restroom and try to stay the remainder of the day. I did call out on my night job so I can spend a couple hours in the restroom.   I threw out the 2nd burrito, and only ate 3 bites of the first one. As nasty as it was, I did not eat dinner the night before and would have been willing to eat something that did not taste well, but this was just too overbearing.  I did the survey on the receipt, and demanded someone contact me. It has been 2 weeks and no contact.  To make it worse, calling the customer service number, they REFUSE to deal with customer complaints. Corporate will ask you if it is a store complaint, if you say yes, they simply say \"Go on the website\" and hang up without any negotiation skills.  This will be my last trip to Jack in the Crack. There are many other choices in Las Vegas, and all the others at least have someone willing to talk to customers. Other restaurants will not have me worrying about food poisoning."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I can come after Noon, and still get breakfast. This was all my hangover needed."}
{"text":"This place is the best jack in  he box ever. Kendra was so friendly and kind. The rest of the employees should strive to be as professional and fun as she is!!!"}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning. I ordered the chicken sandwich, the fries and a sprite.. the chicken sandwich was hard around the edges as if it was old meat. The lettuce taste a bit off. Usually I go to the Jack-In-the box a bit further from my house but since this one was close to my house I decided to go here and I am disappointed. I'm still sick after 3 days from eating there. If you've ever had food poisoning you should know exactly how I feel. I'm never eating there again!!!! NO STARS PEOPLE!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. Tried something new on the menu. The prime rib cheesesteak was not only messy but the meat was very tough. I also tried the chorizo fries were not good at all. They didnt bother to give me napkins or a fork to eat the fries."}
{"text":"Drive thru window staff was very friendly and professional. Ralph was one the the best drive-thru employee I have ever had.  Thank you Ralph for being so kind"}
{"text":"What's to say. Sometimes you just gotta give in to guilty pleasures. All day breakfast!  I get the sausage egg and cheese biscuit without the sausage and cheese. I'm trying!"}
{"text":"This jack in the box is horrible. Every time I go they mess something up and it's always something very simple. Last time I ordered a jumbo jack with cheese got home no cheese. So this time I think to myself I'll outsmart the jumbo jack guys and check to see if I got cheese and yep there's cheese phew. Get home and bam no kind of condiments on the burger what so ever. Please avoid this jack in the box."}
{"text":"Zero stars for this JITB.  I stopped going to this JITB over a year ago because of the indifference and lack of manners the drive-through staff displayed when I went through one evening, but decided to give it another chance today.  However, when I went inside to order my dinner, I waited for over 5 minutes while one cashier, whose back was to me, stood to the side talking to a co-worker whom I could not see.  A male employee, who saw me and made eye contact several times, did nothing to tell the cashier that there was a customer waiting.  Eventually I decided I had enough and left.  This is the LAST time I will go to this JITB.  I do not know who the manager is but they definitely need to focus on the staff's customer service skills.  Perhaps an email to the district manager is in order by this time."}
{"text":"I'm hoping the order from drive thru won't be wrong, as the guy at the window had issues even repeating me saying I wanted ketchup mayo and onion on a burger. Ok add onion? Yeah and the other shit I just said too. Christ why is it such a project? Def checking everything before pulling away."}
{"text":"Worst and slowest service, plan to be there for at 30 minutes for 2 tacos some lazy ass workers and pissed off customers"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. I pulled up to this Jack in the Box at 12:12am to get some food for my husband who was just getting off work. I was the third car in line. At 12:32 (20 minutes later) they took my order. I pulled up and 'Rain' said, \"Sorry, we were having technical difficulty\" and, \"the other person that works here was in the bathroom, so I had to do everything myself.\" Then he asked me to back up and pull back up to the window so it would reset the timer. I finally got the food at 12:38. I will say that at least the order was correct and the food was hot and delicious. That was riDICulous!"}
{"text":"Life is about phases.  Sometimes I am an oak and other times I am an undisciplined pig.  The latter gives cause to resent myself.  Further resentment makes me want to punish myself even more.  Punish myself in the form of fats, sugars, simpler carbs, and shitty attitudes.  It's been a bad third quarter for 2016.  But....I digress.  Back in the day-day, I used to live in this neck of the woods.  I love JitB.  It has at times been an abusive relationship with many a forgiveness until I can't catch my breath at the top of the stairs.  This particular location has caused me many a pleasure and pain.  Then I moved away to another part of town, only to be abused by another JitB location.  It's been three years (approx) since my return to the NW.  It was only until very recently, I returned to this address to see what would happen.  Arriving shortly before what I assume was the lunch rush, I placed my order for a funky JitB burger I had seen on TV (Classic Buttery Jack).  Additionally, I ordered up some curly fries and pop.  The service was so-so, but the food severed as a gastro main line straight into my soul.  I could have cried. I could have laughed.  Perhaps, it was a mixture of the above stated, pleasure & pain.  The food was just as I has remembered it.  Damn you Jack, I love you...I hate you."}
{"text":"I love jack in the box , it's one of my favorite fast food restaurants . I have tried almost all of their menu  , delicious . This location has good customer service"}
{"text":"Don't go here late night they are the absolute slowest ever could have went to Waffle House sat down ordered and ate by the time they got our food to us line in drive thru not even that bad . Never again !"}
{"text":"It's jack in the box so you know what to expect but this is one of the few jack in the box locations that is not stingy at all with the condiments. I ordered a snack box and asked for ranch (you can put ranch on almost anything at jack) I got 5 containers of it. Don't mind me just getting excited over ranch."}
{"text":"I got \"Jacked\" at this Jack in the Box! Food is standard Jack fare but the service is slower than a Wisconsin snowbird. Only  fast food joint in North Scottsdale, though fast in category only. Oh, and don't plan on going in after 9:30 as they lock it up early."}
{"text":"I frequent this location about once a week, first thing in the morning because it's on my way to work. Every single visit I'm always so impressed with how happy & cheerful the staff are. It's extremely refreshing, especially for a fast food restaurant & for how early it is. I'm usually helped by a few of the same women, who make the ordering process smooth & always have smiles on their faces! Thanks for being the fastest & friendliest drive-thru in town!"}
{"text":"As Mr Hand would say I think everyone was on dope at this jack n box. I work the 3rd shift and went to get some lunch. I asked for Diet Coke and got a Dr Pepper I thought they shorted me my onion rings but really shorted me my chicken.Twinkle toes didn't give me my receipt. Bad service bad food."}
{"text":"Was heading up north for a work and my companion needed some chow.  Given that this JITB was just off the exit it seemed the likely choice.  We came rolling into the drive thru which was absolutely packed with cars spilling out into the parking lot.  The decision was made to proceed and wait it out.  The line moved rather quickly.  A #5 (ultimate cheeseburger combo) was ordered.  I went only with some onion rings.  As we made our way car by car through the drive thru...I spotted what appeared to be a fireplace?  A fireplace that can be seen inside and outside?  Crazy!  The number five was as ordered and my onion rings were fried to hell. A fireplace???"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We stood there for a while waiting for someone to acknowledge us.  They see us standing there and no one even says anything because they're busy talking amongst themselves.  Every once in a while they will call people to pick up their order, but not once did anyone say \"hi, hello, or we'll be right with you.\""}
{"text":"This is one of the better jack locations I've been to. Sometimes the drive thru can be long but it moves quick. I get coupons in the mail so I use them most of the time and they take them with no problem. One of the best things Jack ever did was invent the munchie meal. It starts after 9 pm and changes but right now it's $6 for a hella-peno burger, 2 tacos and a mix of regular fries as well curly fries. The burger has jalapeños on it but also stuffed jalapeños and taco sauce. Damn it's hella good! Not that I expected much but I wasn't crazy about their mini pancakes. I'll stick to the ultimate sausage sandwich for breakfast instead."}
{"text":"This is consistently the worst Jack-in-the-Box I've ever been to. I just spent 25 minutes in the drive-through line waiting for a shake,  nothing else just a shake.  The kid at the window could not have cared less about how long I had to wait. He just mumbled the total of my order, handed me the shake, and then mumbled a thank you that could not have sounded less sincere.  If the service wasn't bad enough the restaurant is always dirty there's trash on the floor inside the restaurant and a pile of trash underneath the drive-through window. It's the last time I'll ever go to this particular Jack-in-the-Box."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my boyfriend and was not pleased. The food was good, as usual but the lady (African American) working the window was extremely rude! I've never witnessed this much attitude. She didn't smile and was very rushy with everything. Felt like I needed to know exactly what I wanted before I got to the window. My boyfriend is in the military and I asked if they do military discount and she replied \"yes, with ID\" handed her the ID and looked at it for a good minute or two thinking we were trying to get a discount on our food with a fake military id. Won't come back to this location unless I have to."}
{"text":"They messed up my order on purpose. The girl at drive through was a literal idiot. Jussst give me my potato wedges."}
{"text":"Okay breakfast. Staff was nice.  A bit slow for a Saturday morning...took them a fee extra minutes for our food. Breakfast menu on part with any fast food joint."}
{"text":"Frequent drive-thru diner. The location is very bad. You have to hit the drive thru at a certain angle, and people who dine-in can get blocked off by drive-thru goers. The drive-thru employees are great. Very friendly and have never gotten an order wrong. Beware the cat person who always hangs out outside feeding the strays."}
{"text":"Now keep in mind my review is for late night stops while getting gas and coming home from Cali/leaving vegas.  So, it might be time sensitive, however, this is my honest opinion none the less.  I've gone here several times and each time I go the food is usually a bit over cooked and stale.  Not to mention that Jack in the box tends to have greasy food anyways but greasy, over done and stale is not always a pleasant combination ;)  I do return because it's often the only place that's open (and it's still better than gas station food at 3 am) on the exit and i'm trying to get back onto I-15 quickly.  It's not the most terrible thing out there, but it's far from the best.  Plus almost every time I go they're quite slow for fast food."}
{"text":"Order three sandwiches today and all three of them had stale buns that literally disintegrated when we picked up our sandwiches to eat them! Not to mention the meat on the Junior jumbo Jack was rubbery and disgusting. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Went to this Jack in the Box because it was close, even though the last time they really messed up my whole order, except the soda.  I thought I'd give it one more try. I asked for lettuce, they added mustard instead. I asked for no cheese on my burger, I got extra cheese.  I asked for a strawberry smoothie. He asked if I wanted strawberry banana. I said no...Just plain strawberry. I got strawberry banana! I will seriously never go back to this location again. It's worth the drive to not have to keep going back in to get my order fixed."}
{"text":"Awful, just awful. My burger was greasy. Like enough grease for Danny Zukoh (sp?) and his whole gang. Then I got to the fries.... yeah you could've just kept those for yourself. No one should be subjected to that crap you call fries. Just eww. Did I mention that it was awful? Do yourself a favor and pass on this place"}
{"text":"Stale old food and rude employees!  Refused me more than one packet or ranch with my meal!  What kind of business is this??"}
{"text":"This particular JINB was friendly, fast and fresh."}
{"text":"I have had 3 bad experiences at this location with the service but this past Saturday was the final straw I will not go to this location again, Anyone that asks me I will discourage them from this location it sucks! Number one I went at 10 am in the morning i was the only one in the line did not receive a receipt then I had to go and park in the parking lot to wait on my food only to find out when I got home I did not receive my complete order. I tried to call that location for about an hour because the line was constantly busy. Once I finally did reach someone named Oscar I asked him if he was the manager and he said that he was not then I asked if I could speak to the manager regarding my order and he told me the manager was too busy to take my call. I was livid. I am not saying all Jack's are like that but this location is the WORSE!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best in the world. But great that its open late. I also like that they have breakfast and the lunch menu at all times. They always try to make additions to the menu as well. So not bad when ur tipsy at night"}
{"text":"The food was fine - like any other JITB - but the dining tables felt sticky.  I think I'd stick to take-out next time."}
{"text":"Tastes like JITB.  The tables were really dirty.  Wasn't busy at all and nobody cleaning the tables.  I'm glad I brought my own wipes."}
{"text":"I asked for a double jack and they gave me a jumbo jack apparently don't know how to understand English so I made him do it again because the order was wrong and apparently they overslept on the sauce because it got all over my clothes and pants they are the worst Jack in the Box team ever dealt with every one of them should be fired"}
{"text":"Got the supreme croissant and I'm pretty happy about it. The gal who was helping me suggested I get this new deal that's 2 breakfast sandwiches for 4 bucks! Bam - you have a sale today miss Jack in the box lady! One of them came fresh and hot the other not so much... I attached a pic of it so you could see for yourself.The one that was fresh was great so make sure to ask specifically for freshly made! And note to self for next time I come here, cause fresh is super important with cheap food."}
{"text":"Came through the drive thru at 2am and Leshanda at the drive thru was being very rude. She even said she doesn't have mini muffins with an attitude. A few minutes later i went inside the lobby and ordered mini muffins and they had them. Clearly Leshanda doesn't belong in the food industry, because she's uncultured. Will be going to Mcdonalds a mile away from now on. i used to work at jack in the box and our general manager would fire you on the spot for this behavior. Not sure how she still has her job."}
{"text":"Munchie meals!? Shakes... Those legit tacos!? Can't be beat...  Word of caution: sometimes there's vagrants hanging out on the side. Drive windows up, thankfully cops frequent the area. Otherwise, a solid go to. I travel the extra 5-10  minutes ever since McDonald's decided to NEVER have shakes/mcflurry items..  Viva jack!  Make sure to get an antenna ball too"}
{"text":"This jack is great! Way better than par. I live right next to this location and have probably eaten here 75 times over the last few years. Lightning fast and I can't think of a single time and order was messed up. Thanks jack in the box!"}
{"text":"It was Friday night (11/16) and I was starving and tired and ready to go home.  After picking up my son, we decided the drive-thru at Jack in the Box was exactly what we needed.  He loves their chicken strips, and I'm a sucker for their Ultimate Cheeseburger.  Have you ever wanted different hamburgers to appease different cravings?  When I want a cheesy cheeseburger with lots of cheesy goodness - this is it for me!  I love the Eastern location in Henderson - the folks there are great and my food is always good!  I also go to the Flamingo and Sandhill location for lunch sometimes.  There, the food isn't quite the same quality and there seems to be a problem with the speaker.  Oh!  Need a little spicy cheesiness in your life (who doesn't?)?  The jalapeno poppers are soooo good!"}
{"text":"Experience based on drive thru alone...  Stopped into this Jack in the Box location for breakfast as it seemed to be one of the few fast food places open 24 hours and I was heading out on a trip at 4am.    It was my first time at a jack in the box and the guy at the intercom was extremely helpful and patient.  While the food was a cookin' he struck up conversation and said he was going to include some free things since we were visiting.  This guy and the woman packing the food really wanted to make our experience one worthy of 5 stars.  Our order was accurate and the free hashbrowns were hot and clearly not leftover food that was just sitting around.    - 1 Star for the shady characters drinking 40s in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Stay away from this location. The place is full of panhandlers and bums.  They smell awful, are rude, bother people trying to eat and the managers won't do anything about it."}
{"text":"Never wrote a review on a place before but i have to on this shit hole.  They forgot about me in the drive thru, waited 20 minutes until i drove up and pounded on the window.  And then she takes my order, and i thought maybe id get some kind of a discount, but no.  Then after i leave i find out my fries are wrong. I go back to get new ones.  And now im home and my food is cold.  Never go HERE!"}
{"text":"Came here with my buds and all ordered food. After waiting 12-15 mins each for our orders I found that I was missing 2 tacos. Not cool"}
{"text":"By far this is the worst Jacks drive through i've ever been to!!! They take for mf ever seriously 20-45 mins on any given day or night wtf!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst jack in the box when it comes to getting hot food and more importantly food the way you ordered it.  I have been here on a few occasions late night and each and every time have been disappointed.  Once i asked for my chicken sandwich to be made fresh (due to prior experiences here) and I was assured it would be made fresh.  I got home and I couldn't even bite into the sandwich.  It had sat for hours and then been fried again.  It was hard as a rock and I contemplated finding a lawyer but it was 2am and suing a Jack in the box isn't my idea of a good time.  I have never received food like that from any fast food company in my entire life though, and that is a snapshot of the quality of food and service from this location.  And for those who say why would you go back to a place that sucks this much more than once...well its the addictive agreements in the food...duh."}
{"text":"They always treated me right. Great value, especially late night munchies. Wi-fi worked okay. Avoid the homeless - one time saw a guy flashing a knife."}
{"text":"Another Vegas Staple we need in Tampa. LoVE the tacos."}
{"text":"My cousin is visiting from Florida where there are no Jack In The Box & wanted to go here. They made is back up & wait awhile after paying before pulling back to the window. We waited awhile for them to prepare our food & out curly fries were still cold. Not from this side of town & def won't come back to this Jack. *Only have it two stars because my cousin asked for ranch & they didn't have any, but one of the guys offered her the dressing ."}
{"text":"So annoyed. Went to this jack in the box after 7 hours of moving into a new place. We get our food and it's ice cold. I won't be back to this location EVER. The one on Tropicana always makes the food fresh to order late night and the staff is way more professional. #thisplacesucks"}
{"text":"They got cuties in this jack plus they don't fuck up my order unlike mcdonalds... the guys at the drive thru are fast and polite"}
{"text":"Who doesn't enjoy having breakfast for dinner? Brinner! I love that Jack in the Box serves breakfast all day long. I tend to pass by this Jack in the Box on the way home and it's right next to a gas station, nothing else really near it until you hit Town Square. I usually use the drive-thru and there is either no line or only a few cars ahead of me. I like that because I have places to go, brinner to eat.  It's a Jack in the Box, so if you're not into their food, you're not going to like it at any location. I happen to like an occasional meal at Jack in the Box and this is the closest one to me. The employees are fast, friendly, and the food is Jack in the Box delicious, so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Ever miss the  old manager  joel  the new one is letting this location  go down the  toilet"}
{"text":"What can I say... they are open all night... and they are close to my work.  They do have a few \"healthy\" options... or a few options that might kill you. If I am going here late at night... I am usually hankering for something that might kill me in my sleep so that is what I get.  Love the fries as well, forget the curly ones as the regular are better."}
{"text":"how can you dislike Jack? If you are coming here, you shouldn't expect 5-star dining. I got what I wanted, hot, and quick."}
{"text":"This use to be the friendliest most efficient fast food spot, hands down. Lately though the typical \"I don't wanna be here\" employee has been working. Use to be a stand out amongst fast food chains. Hope they get better soon."}
{"text":"Worst Jack In the Box experience ever!!!! horrible customer service!!!! Shavon was extremely RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"I drove 30+ miles on my way home and could have stopped several times,  but I wanted Jack in the Box near home so it would be hot. I came through at 4am on 1/15/14 and there were bun crates sitting out blocking the drive through. The sign says open 24 hours. Period. Now I'm off work, going to be hungry because someone doesn't know what 'open 24 hours' means. This is poor POOR business practice."}
{"text":"Don't go here!!! They make you wait 15 minutes in the drive thru, plus the management staff could care less for a franchise store. Even the district manager wouldn't return my call about terrible service. I won't be back... McDonalds right down the road from me!!!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Mark B. who commented below. I think I had that same server when I went there a few days ago. The manager does have the personality of a bucket of mud . Then by chance I went back again today because I really like their croissant breakfast sandwich and their coffee taste great just like I make it home. And the young girl (Melissa) that was waiting on us today was as delightful as you get so I would change my two star rating to 5 stars based on her personality, coffee & the Croissant sandwiches."}
{"text":"Done with Jack In the Box! Food was cold and part of our order was missing! Terrible food! Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Something has changed at this Jack in the Box store, and it's definitely a change for the better!  I've been to this particular store about three times before today's visit. And, I've been to another of their stores in Queen Creek, AZ. Unfortunately, at this store (Store JIB# 1195), I've experienced quite a bit of difficulty with the folks at the drive-thru. They've been very hard to communicate with because they cut me off in the middle of placing my order, asking me questions that I was about to answer anyway.  But, today during this visit, the lady who took my order was extremely professional and clear-spoken. She didn't interrupt me while I was placing my order. On my own, without any prompting from her, I said which Combo I wanted, then its size (large), that I wanted the 3-piece eggroll menu item as my side instead of fries, and finally that I wanted Dr. Pepper to drink. She responded with a simple and clear \"K\". This was perfect for me. I then went on to explain that I'd like to add-on two tacos for $0.99 as advertised on the sign by the drive-thru menu. And, finally, I ordered also Combo #12 - she didn't hear me clearly when I said \"twelve\", so I repeated that quickly and easily. Then, I went on to request the \"small\" size of the combo with Sprite to drink. She assumed correctly that I wanted the standard (fries) side with that combo.  I was so happy and excited that she'd made my ordering process SO easy. I praised her at the window for it. I was a little sad that the store manager wasn't there at that time because I wanted to be sure the manager knew that my order taker was an example to follow. Since the manager wasn't in the store at that time, I decided the next best option is to leave this review."}
{"text":"Why do i do this to myself?"}
{"text":"I always go here only because it's convenient the service is always horrible but this morning was a bust I got up early this morning to go grab me and my husband coffee before he went to work. I ordered 3 large coffees it was the manager that took my order she did not offer me a cup holder for 3 large coffees which thank God I have enough cup holders in my car I get home take the lids off the coffees I could see right through them as if they were iced tea I already knew the coffee's were weak and they were ice cold now I have been calling the store non-stop all morning and they will not answer the phone I paid $5.81 for 3 weak ice cold coffees I want my refund back and I've been trying to get ahold of them all morning no one answers the phone..  Also posted a picture of my call log of them not answering any of my phone calls"}
{"text":"I work close by to this location and was craving a quick, inexpensive breakfast today. The staff were friendly and professional. The restaurant was clean and a nice get away from the heat. The breakfast platter was good and I was given an upgrade to a large iced coffee for the long wait (which was only about 5 minutes long), brightened my day. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while. I don't know why this place has bad reviews because every time I've ate at jack in the box they've served my food hot and fast."}
{"text":"horrible customer service, there were a ton of people but no one seemed to acknowledge me. i waited 15 minutes just to order a shake. i had to say something to get their attention, not only did i have to wait 15 minutes just to order but it took 5-8 more minutes to get my shake. it wasn't even worth the wait because the shakes were so thick. it was basically ice cream."}
{"text":"It's fast food and I know you can't ask for much. When I ate here, it was slow and some of the tables were dirty. The employees could have taken advantage of the down time to clean. I got a good deal on a burger, but the mayo on it tasted old and awful! Thankfully I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION SUCKS. Came to just get a simple milkshake and 1. They were rude 2. Told me I had to come inside (I was in the drive thru) because they didn't make them yet 3. They then got our order wrong. Thinking they might need to be trained more..?? Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Hubbie got us breakfast.  Egg, cheese, ham, and bacon Croissant sandwich.   pretty Delicious.  First time eating Jack in the box."}
{"text":"First- In the drivethru they forgot to put my Chicken Fajita Pita in the bag- so I parked my car and ran in and grabbed it. I got home to find that the chicken fajita pita (that is usually over flowing) was less than half full. I paid $6 for this thing...."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Jack's for a long, long time.  My ex-wife was a research dietician with Foodmaker Corp. when it was owned by Robert O. Peterson.  A lot has changed since then, but I'm still a fan of Jack In The Box.  When it was time to leave Las Vegas, my current wife and I decided not to leave town with empty tummies and no coffee.  This JB was right across from our hotel, so we hit it for breakfast.  Our food was just great, mine a Meat Lover's Burrito Combo ($5.19) and hers a Sausage Croissant Combo ($4.69).  Both combos came with hash brown patties and coffee.  Neither of us could finish, and the leftovers provided a great snack on the 5-hour drive home, along with our refilled coffees.  But I was most impressed with Victoria, the order-taker.  The customer before us was a wee bit harebrained or hungover, hard to tell which, and thought she had to wait outside the building in the desert heat for a To-Go order.  Victoria called her number, and realized the customer was outside sweltering in the morning sun.  Victoria rolled her eyes, shrugged her shoulders, told me she would be right with me, locked the register and delivered the bags of food to the whacked customer outside.  Now that's good service.  We're fans."}
{"text":"My first Jack in the Box East Coast sighting!  I was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl.  That was until I arrived and the menu was completely different than what I had remembered from the California Jack in the Boxes.  If the food was more consistent with the west coast this place would be a 4 star easily.  It is very clean, the staff was very friendly and the food although not being what I wanted or remembered was somewhat tasty."}
{"text":"I stopped in to just get a shake I was feeling fine went home finished it off awoke sicker than I have ever been. I could not get out of bed vomiting all day bones were also aching. This took two days to get back to my normal self Lesson Learned I will NEVER EVER order any food from this place AGAIN!!! Oh and prior to this incident about a week earlier I stopped by to get some tacos and this is funny they were OUT of Tacos. But because of the illness that alone will keep me from going back to this Jack in the box. Very VERY Disappointed with this Location."}
{"text":"Every time I come it always seems like they are out of buttermilk. I ordered chicken strips for my little sister, and asked for buttermilk as the sauce he then says \"sorry we're out of ranch, barbecue, and honey mustard.\" Ok?! What is she going to drop her chicken in?! Don't come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Real good & real good service strawberry shakes rock great after late nite at race track and staying across the street darn good."}
{"text":"I usually don't do fast food places like Burger King, Wendy's, Carl's Jr. as well as that one Scottish restaurant but this time I felt the need. I was late for breakfast on the way to work and curious to try their cronuts. Wait. WTF are cronuts you say? No not crow nuts. Not the nads of a bird. Not the testicles of Croatian or Cro-Magnon men either. Cronuts are croissant donuts. Wait for it. The Cronut brand and product is a registered trademark of Dominique Ansel Bakery internationally. There - so with that out of the way, Crack In The Box can't officially use that term to call them that. So I found myself feeling stupid when I actually went to the drive thru and asked for cronuts. Huhhh??? was the response I got. Oh. I mean \"croissant-doughnuts.\" You know? That freaking pastry formerly known as a cronut? So then she understood and I could pay and GTFO and on my way to work. This location does the credit card slider on the outside so you don't have to give some sketchy degenerate your credit card to actually hold for too long - you just do it yourself. Extra star for that. Now I've never had the real trademark Cronut but I had something that resembles it at a convention once. These that I got from Crack In The Box were donut shaped and not croissant flakey at all. In fact, the outside was indistinguishable from a regular sugar donut. Well, maybe not THAT sugary but still sweet from some sugar and cinammon. I cracked open the package to make sure I actually got 3 croissant doughnuts and not anything else like a chicken head or any of the stuff you hear about in urban folktales/the internets. MMMM. It actually smelled nice and fresh and cinammony. So I get to work and instead of getting straight to work I'm taking pictures of my food. See photo - money shot/centerfold of a croissant doughnut doing the splits. Smelled great and is actually fluffy like a croissant in the middle. Had to try it once. Not sure if I'll ever get the craving for it again but if I do, I know where to go. Nothing personal, Jack. Just rating the croissant doughnuts and nothing else."}
{"text":"From AMR Las Vegas, a huge thank you to Loraby (name on the receipt) and the other staff member who was working at 0330 on 3/21/18, whose name I unfortunately didn't catch. They did a truly amazing job and my crew and I felt so welcomed with their upbeat attitudes. Thank you again for making such a short wait time as great as you guys did, it is appreciated greatly!"}
{"text":"This is almost embarrassing!! I never thought I would review a fast food joint on Yelp! Where to begin...my first time at this Jack in the Box was a 'walk-through' where I tried to persuade the nice lady at the window to let us buy food, as we were in no condition to be driving. She said it was against the rules and she could get in trouble, but we could probably easily persuade someone in a vehicle...which we did, The food was of course awesome, but I believe anything is probably amazing considering the state we were in that night.   The second time I was actually driving through after being DD for a birthday bash late in the evening. Ironically, I was asked to help some 'walkers' get their food. I also learned from these late night patrons that the sweet lady at the late-night window was Tess and that they always call in great reviews for her, which I found quite hilarious coming from two drunk burly men! Hahah, makes me laugh just remembering the image. I came to realize after living in this neighborhood for a while that this place has quite a few late-night regulars!   In addition another afternoon, after leaving the pool, my friend and I were starving and I volunteered to pick-up some food at good old Jack in the Box. My friend had recently become vegan, which I had forgotten up until my arrival at the menu.....hmmmmm, what on earth will I get her besides fries?! So I consulted another friendly Jack in the Box employee at the window and asked her if it was possible to take all the meat and cheese off the chicken fajita pita and add as many vegetables as they had. She also put every sauce in the bag because I was clueless in the vegan department. This along with some churros and my friend was quite impressed and she said it was quite tasty!!!   This place looks like any other Jack in the Box, and really probably tastes like most (it is always quite fresh though). But the service here is above and beyond! If you are ever near Cave Creek and Bell Road and have the urge for food on the fly, this is by far the place to go!  I gave it five stars in comparison to other fast food restaurants; obviously this is not exactly 5 star dining!  :)"}
{"text":"We tried to eat here but after waiting about 5 minutes for the staff to acknowledge we were even in the facility we left.   Why bother eating here unless you are drive thru for a drink.   Doesn't even rate a single star."}
{"text":"I don't really know what makes good or bad fast food, but I've never had bad service here. They've always been friendly in the drive through, which I guess is the most anyone could ask for!  The 24 hours doesn't hinder on service at all, which is why I still go during those odd hours."}
{"text":"Woke up starving! Google sent me to Jack In the Box! Web site sold me on late night menu. Pulled up to the drive through and was told \"we don't serve that \"! Their website sucks u n just to be disappointed! I hope everyone at this place dies a slow painful death from ass cancer!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've EVER seen such a poorly made taco!! First off I was the only person in the drive thru, there wasn't anyone inside. The staff was messing around with each other. Took 5-7 min for my food. And they gave me a coffee straw for my drink!! And didn't say anything or apologized that they ran out of straws!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible.  The wait for someone to come take your order in the dining room was ridiculous.  The cashier was busy texting before he took our order and during.  Got the order wrong twice due to his phone distraction and food was terrible.  Lettuce was brown and old, fries cold and stale.  Also had to take back two items due to finding trash in our food.  Not going back for sure"}
{"text":"Stopped for gas and food driving around Vegas, and aside from being in a complex that had low gas prices, the burger wasn't too bad for this person who rarely eats burgers or fast food. The fries were HOT, and the tables were clean. Paid less than $5 for (2) Jack Jack using a free JJ coupon, large fries and large drink (the items I had to pay for were the fries & drink). Restrooms located in the complex - a few minutes walk through a convenience store but no problem. Well-lighted and easy parking."}
{"text":"I ordered one five piece chicken tender entree and received four mediocre chicken tenders and one small piece of breading with no chicken in it! There was no one at the window when I pulled up at 9:36 p.m.. I ordered and came up to the window And they took my money and then the server sat there at the window drinking his soda and talking to someone else for almost two minutes. I sat there patiently waiting for my chicken tenders and when I got home I found out I only got four for approximately $7! What a rip-off and terrible service to boot! I can't believe I stop there and got such horrible service and not the food that I was promised! I feel like a fool! Good for you Jack in the Box you got another one!"}
{"text":"Worst location! My order ALWAYS gets messed up and the servers during the day are rude! I keep trying to get in contact with someone and NO ONE returns my e-mails or calls."}
{"text":"I am not overly thrilled with this location to say the least. I rarely eat fast food, but when I do, this is one of the closest locations to home. The fresh home brewed tea is never fresh and they don't do anything about it or even apologize when asked to change it they just dump it out of my cup and refill sane cup that had sour old tea. I will not be returning here, employees seemed efficient and quick but not willing to deal with any issues. There is a problem with homeless or home depot day workers hanging around. No intention return to this location."}
{"text":"Every time I order here my fries are always hard as rocks. That's why they get one star from me."}
{"text":"I really love this particular Jack in the Box location.  The staff is always so friendly and helpful.  I come in once or twice a week for those wonderful tacos!  I always ask for extra lettuce and they are happy to make them that way!  The restaurant is clean inside, although the outside area needs to be power washed once a week - it is really filthy!  But I don't let that get between me and my tacos - I just levitate myself over the dirty parking lot and side walk!  Also love the Jumbo Jack - yum.  See you next week!"}
{"text":"**If you go to this Jack in the Box location and see this vehicle outside don't even bother going through the drive-thru.** I live pretty much down the street from this location and come here quite frequently and every time I go there it's great service with this exception. Every time I see this car I know I'm not going to be served. 1 time of saying \"sorry we're understaffed I'll be with you in about 20 minutes.\" Is fine I'll just leave and go somewhere else but when we're well over the 10th time of this woman pulling this same thing I can see it's just because she doesn't wanna work. Especially when I can hear her on the phone cause she's not smart enough to even turn off the headset. Whenever I go there and Alex and the other man who works register over night are awesome and give great service. I get working overnight there sucks I did it for a year but if you tell me \"I'll be with you in 20 minuets.\" So I sit there and wait and watch 2 other people pull in behind me and then back out and knock on the door and she hides in the back. So I back out and pulled back in and I get the same \"I'll be with you in 20 minutes.\" To which I replied \"ya I just waited 20 minutes\" she said \"well it'll be about an hour\" at this point me and 2 other customers have wasted a half hour of our night because she wouldn't just tell us she's too lazy to work. I think if this location wants to make more money and improve in service quality (which they haven't since I worked there in 2015) you need someone who will actually work and not sit on her phone. Alex and the other guy are great never any problems with their service. But when I see this car I know I'm about to probably waste 30 minutes and not even get service so most of the time I just decide to drive away but tonight I waited the 20 minutes only to get another excuse that it would now be an hour while she's hiding in the back talking on the phone. So at that point I know she's a liar and also I know now never to even try and get food while she's there. I SUGGEST FIRING HER ?"}
{"text":"Why do people hate Jack so much. It is a fast food restaurant so don't expect some sort of 5 star food or service. Any of their locations have been quick and accurate when I have went."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service tonight. I stood at the counter with my 2 kids and not another customer inside. I wasn't even acknowledged until after about 5 min. Then she said we will be with you. I waited another few minutes while all they did was the drive thru. Then I simply left. Oh and the we don't make it till you order it claim does not exist here. Nothing was on the grill at all but I saw one woman put at least 3 separate burgers in the microwave and nuke them. Very disappointing as there aren't many burger locations at this corner."}
{"text":"Jack in the box is one of my favorites for fast food. The food here tastes good and is made fresh. For breakfast I like to get the Hearty Bowl it has all the breakfast foods mixed in including hash browns and it's pretty filling. You can't go wrong with the 2 tacos for 99 cents either, put some taco sauce on that and its good."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan usually of Jack, but I love their peppermint oreo milkshake. We went through the drive thru on Tuesday evening, and the girl working behind the counter had so many facial piercings, her phone was about to fall out of her butt pocket and she had SO much skin showing. She also was not in any type of uniform, as she was wearing American Eagle and pink brand clothes (don't think Jack is paying for that for everyone). To each his own after work hours, but I do not want to see your belly skin as you hand me my food. I had hoped that even though they were fast food that they'd have a professional standard. Not a fan, won't be back."}
{"text":"The customer service is great, very friendly and helpful (I like when they give me ranch for my fries for free). Food was good - basic jack.   The reason for the loss of two stars is the overwhelming homeless population that has taken residence in and outside of this location. One was passed out outside on a table. Another four (no, not exaggerated) were coming in and out refilling their random cups with soda, without asking, and certainly without paying... I could tell the guy behind the counter was frustrated, but didn't know what to do. I'm all for helping the homeless, but camping out at an establishment, with all their garb is not really ok. And if you need water, great, but at least ask..."}
{"text":"This was the worst customer service ever at 12:40am ..i know it's the time where the drunks come through but I was coming from a family reunion...and the drive thru said they would call the cops if we  did not  leave"}
{"text":"What does Jack in the Box put in their meat ? Beef, salt, yeast extract, corn maltodextrin, onion powder, natural flavor, spice, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, garlic powder, sugar, modified corn starch, beef tallow, triacetin. That was the most nasty mystery meat I have ever tasted in my entire life! It ruined my whole meal. I was looking forward to a a nice hamburger and it was the worst experience I've ever had. I didn't say anything or ask for money back because it's not the employees fault that Jack in the Box uses such crap in their food.  I found out that it's only the quarter-pound patties that they put all this crap in so if you get a bigger Patty then a quarter pounder then it's just beef. Seriously why would you even mess with it?"}
{"text":"Service wasn't very good and pretty slow but I expect that from most \"fast\" food. Jack in the Box has one BANGIN chicken sandwich though, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Came to this location 10:30pm and just saw a family leave dining room. DOORS WERE LOCKED all of the sudden! They advertise open until 12midnight. MANAGER on duty comes to door and tells me his registers are closed and can not be opened. Only drive thru open 24hrs. When asked his name he slams door on me after I told him I will call corporate about signs. This Manger was dark skin, tall and skinny. Just FYI fix your  hours sign. YOUR MANAGER SAID HE WAS GOING HOME AND did not have time to wait on me. Just plain rude about it!"}
{"text":"The policy of one order per car is ridiculous. I understand if it's during the lunch rush or even anytime during the day-but at 3am (no other customers around mind you) when someone else in the car just wants a couple extra tacos, I thinks it's stupid to make customers go through the drive thru a second time and wait double just for a \"policy\"."}
{"text":"This is probably the best experience I have had at a Jack in the box. To begin, my day started very badly. I'm a college student so every morning I already wake up moody because I have way too many assignments to get done; however, once I eat a good breakfast, which this morning was oatmeal with toast and eggs, I feel a lot better. Then, my Amazon account decided to change my shipping day for my new laptop that I ordered to three days later even though I payed extra money for one day shipping. Just that situation alone made my day from okay and trying to handle it to okay I can't take this anymore what the heck is going on. So as my day went on it slowly got better again. I did most of my assignments, got a 100% on a quiz, and ate some food. Later like around 1 a.m., I decided to go to McDonald's because I wanted a hot and spicy chicken sandwich, but no one was answering through the driveway machine so I was like might as well go to Jack in the box since it's right across the street. So I get there and I order a chicken sandwich. I drive up to the window to get my food and the lady was so nice. She thought I looked like a young little 13 year old girl. And was complementing how young me and my friend looked. And I just felt so much better and I don't know I just needed that okay? Then as she give us our food, she says \"just for how you girls are I'm going to give you large fries\" and MAN THOSE FRIES WERE STACKED BABY!!!!!!!!! I don't know about my entire day but what I do know is that this was a good Jack in the box experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger and crisp fries for a 2am food run.  They were fast and friendly and for $5.99 you got a cheeseburger deluxe, fries, and a large soft drink.  Yep, that's a win in my book."}
{"text":"Bad Contact phone Number! Both on the Receipt and listed online,so no other way to contact this Store. They screwed up my order and we wound up throwing half of it away.  I would have called the store to make them aware,but again Bad Phone Number. The number printed on their receipt sounds like an \"Old School\" Fax machine pinging away! It's 106* outside and I don't want to drive back down there in 5:00 Traffic. I hope the Owner/Manager actually reads this and updates their Contact info!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers that taste like spam....spam burgers ewwwww I don't know if they changed the meat or what but I will never get a burger from here again after that eeeesh"}
{"text":"I still consider myself a new Jack In the Box customer, since I'd never been to one until I moved to Charlotte. One thing that I noticed right away is that here they have a little bit of everything on the menu, salads, sandwiches, burgers and wraps.   But I've found that I really enjoy their breakfast menu. Especially since they serve it all day!   On this visit, I went with the Supreme croissant which has ham, bacon, egg, and cheese. I really enjoyed the sandwich! The croissant was flaky and fresh and they did not skimp on the toppings. My only request would be that they served crispy bacon on the sandwich!!! But other than that the sandwich is great!   Another thing that I like about this place is that the food here is always hot since they generally prepare it as you order it. I don't mind waiting for freshly prepared, hot food!  Overall, this place has good food at reasonable prices...I look forward to trying more goodies off the menu!"}
{"text":"It was about 95 degrees in the dining room. Then they screwed up my order. Then when I brought my tray back to counter for them to fix it, they gave me back a tray with only a sandwich and no fries. All in all, typical garbage fast food experience."}
{"text":"I love the loaded chicken nuggets!!! They are totally my fav"}
{"text":"Standard Jack in the Box restaurant. I came here a couple weeks ago for a quick lunch stop. I walked in, stood at the counter, and waited roughly 10 minutes before I had my order taken. In the meantime, a line was forming behind me  The service was not very prompt; I waited an additional 8 minutes or so before I got my food. This is not a place to stop by if you're in a hurry or looking for fast service. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"This locations in particular always seems to forget something, The other night i stopped by their drive thru starving and placed a $34 order - Upon arriving to the hotel room they forgot one entire order and charged me for it; i let it slide. Few days later i manage to find it again and order an combo along with a drink, they give me the combo and forget my drink. Now I am new to Vegas and wasn't familiar with the location etc. until i stumbled across this location again today and thought id write down the address and leave a review.   I've worked in the fast food industry and understand that sometimes mistakes are made and orders are accidentally swapped etc. but doing this twice? to the same person on different occasions just makes me raise an eye-brow, if its happening to me on two random times - it must be happening more often."}
{"text":"I have yet to successfully complete an order at this location. I admit I am trying to order items direct off the menu, non complicated simple stuff. Oh yeah and I'm ordering from the \"24hr\" restaurant at 1am on an early Saturday morning.   The three visible staff didn't even move this time. The drive thru pathway shows you the employees (can't call them workers) just sitting there.   I will drive over to Ann and Decatur. Jack would be sorely disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"The sourdough jack is a terrific sandwich if you're craving some meat. I get the value fries with it so I don't get too much and over eat. I can hardly ever finish it but I sure do love that sandwich."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep coming here, maybe I was desperate? Second time, no crowd at the drive thru, I was asked AGAIN to come in and wait for my order. The first time was for a chicken sandwich that took 15 mins. Second attempt was for a breakfast sandwich. What's the purpose of a drive thru if you have to come in and wait for your order? I guess this is what you get when a place has way too much on their menu and have nothing ready. Again, no one except me in the drive thru."}
{"text":"This Establishment served me cold food that tastes terrible and charged me for food I didn't receive! Why??? When I asked for a refund they put my money on the counter this is a great sign of disrespect. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This place was filthy. Had to ask for cleaning rags and spray so we could have a place to sit. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Usually swing by to grab coffee. Employees are friendly. Always have a smile. Not sure about most of the food since I don't usually eat here. Have grabbed a few breakfast sandwiches before. Works if you want a quick bite but a little greasy. The breakfast platter is a very good choice."}
{"text":"It's Jack in the box. If you're expecting a high class eatery..... you most likely need to be examined.  I LOVE that their breakfast is served all day. Today, we ordered some mini pancakes (8) and a breakfast jack. Both are $1.  My daughter and I loved the mini pancakes...I mean, she's two, but even I was impressed with how fluffy and tasty they were. We didn't even use the syrup that they gave us.  The breakfast jack had an egg, some ham and cheese. The bun was soft, and actually had texture without feeling like I was chewing on a sponge.   The guy at the drive thru window seemed a little flustered, and he wasn't the kindest..... but, hey. We all have shitty days."}
{"text":"Worker was probably lying.  You claim to be open 24 hours.  However went there at 4AM and the person who answered the drive through ( some older guy) told me they were closed.  When I mentioned that they are listed as 24 hours he made some excuse that the computers have to reboot at 4.  If this is true Corporate needs to inform the public of the times they are not operational, especially if this is a daily scheduled maintenance.  Otherwise it gives the appearance of deception.  I'm still not sure of the employee was just being lazy and didn't want to assist me."}
{"text":"Food was FIRE!! But, we thought that we could get in the lobby. Door was open. We were asked to leave. Wait time wasn't bad for drive through. Would go again."}
{"text":"4 stars is for the service, at that location, NOT the food.  It's still Jack in the crack...  sorry.  Just ok sometimes but at least it's freshly cooked fast food."}
{"text":"Super clean for a fast food joint and good food. The customer service could use some work though, but overall I walked in on a Sunday afternoon and it was dead practically."}
{"text":"The drive through can be a strange place when you don't know what you want as you arrive. Suddenly those signs on the window start looking good, but you know the food is going to look better than it tastes, yet you can't decide what greasyy thing to shove into you so you just go for it. This was my exact scenario as I rolled through here near my lodging. The signs for the new Cheesesteak melt seemed pronmising, but upon eating the thing we find some form of steak that doesn't even compare to steakumm's in quality and a mess of white cheese folded inside. The sourdough bread was grilled nicely and the fries were crisp, but I will now have to return to the dollar menu where I belong. The extra star is for the mini-pancakes on that menu. Ten silver dollar beauties with butter and packaged syrup - how can you go wrong with that?"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they mess something up. Whether it be medium instead of large, everything instead of plain, regular fries when I ask for curlies, this place does it all. Do not come here if you can help it."}
{"text":"Nice place to relax and get a bite to eat. Never had a bad experience. Customer service is always great friendly service. Food is served to you promptly. If you are dining in the food is brought to your table. Atmosphere is comfortable and pleasant. This is a place I will always be happy and comfortable to visit often"}
{"text":"Do Not Visit!!   No sense of customer service. I ordered 2 items and they got them both wrong. Kristina was not doing her job and it's a poor reflection of that location and company.  If you could at least get the order right, then poor service could be forgiven but no! they don't give a damn about their customers."}
{"text":"Man U see me with a white shirt on and u fill my drink up so full n throw my food at me so fast n then only give me one napkin... DAMN. Shit was delicious tho.  Mmmmmmmk"}
{"text":"Their food satiates strange cravings late at night. Also, they accept Android Pay. How can you reject a place that offers Android Pay?! The munchies box is great, I order the chicken burger one with some sort of white creamy sauce along with two tacos, and curly fries. Man, so good. And a drink. All for five bucks. After 9 PM."}
{"text":"cant go wrong with breakfast at lunch time! or breakfast any time!! sausage crossiant with mayo please( the mayo is actually mayoonion.)"}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly staff and GREAT breakfast sandwiches! Nice, clean restaurant and they bring the order right to your table. Amazing service for \"fast food\"!  DonaldBakewell.com"}
{"text":"Worst jack ive ever visited, if I could rate it 0 stars I would. Lady that was working around 11 pm on new years day has the worst customer service, she made me count my own dam money when shes clearly the one working."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan or fast food but Jack in the Box is my weakness. This location is always good to me. I only order the chicken strips meal. Every time I get my meal, the fries are hot and so are the chicken strips. And don't get me started on how delicious the chockate oreo milkshakes are. They are always so thick and it sends my taste-buds on a journey. The customer service at this specific Jack in the Box is excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is by far this WORST jack in the box location I have EVER been too! Horrible! Their curly fries are ALWAYS soggy and cold. Their hamburgers are cold and seems to be undercooked. I could go on and on about how crappy this location is but hopefully you get the point. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this store a two star simply because I love Jack-in-the-Box food. In the last three months I have had wait times of 24 minutes another of 27 minutes and another of 17 minutes. All three of these times there was no one in front of me. Yesterday I went in and with no one in front of me The lady looked at me and continued what she was doing for four minutes while I stood at the counter waiting to order. I told her I wanted to sandwiches with no condiments. She said they had no condiments on them. I asked her to recheck. From her Khios she read to me the ingredients which did not include condiments or sauces of any kind. When I got home there was sauce on both. If this was the first second or third time that I've had a problem at this Jack-in-the-Box I would probably not be writing this review today. I go in once a month and order $80 of gift certificates in five dollar increments. Three days in a row of being told that they could not help me. I want to enjoy my Jack-in-the-Box experience again. I understand the manager has only been there for a few days. The problem at this Jack-in-the-Box lies with the regional manager and above. The store concentrates on drive-through and neglects walk-ins. When my wife spoke with manager earlier today She  was more concerned about yelp review than she was about correcting the problem. I don't want anything for free. I just want the Jack-in-the-Box experience to be what it is in every other store. I refuse to quit frequenting this store for it is the closest to my home. Moral of the story Jack-in-the-Box is awesome just not this store."}
{"text":"Had the only vegetarian option and it was pathetic..! Slapping a few dried up veggies between a bread does not make it a dish...it's an insult to vegetarian food"}
{"text":"Fast food here isn't very fast. It took us about 15 minutes to get to the register to order even though only 1 person was ahead of us. Then it took us another 30 minutes to get our food even though ALL we ordered was 6 tacos and an iced coffee. Anyways, all of that was almost forgivable because I understand having worked in fast food that they were short staffed. However the cook on the line making all the sandwiches was SO rude to a fellow coworker about an order. Literally yelled at him in plain sight when we were standing right there watching them. Don't eat here if you're expecting fast service."}
{"text":"The manager Angelica is the RUDEST manager I have ever come across.  Not only did they make a mistake, but she literally started to raise her voice and be rude with us for asking for the problem to be corrected.  Then she said \"Go ahead and call corporate, this is a franchise!\"  Yet she is the manager?  Classic asshole!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in less than 24 hours to this location. I got hungry late last night and while I was out riding around the Charlotte area I noticed that they were open 24 hours. The line in the drive-through seemed to take forever but once I got to the window I receive my food in a timely manner. I ordered two of their new Jalepeno Hash meal mashups. When I get home to get ready to eat them I noticed that the box was full of grease. I did the survey on the receipt like I always do whenever I eat out and I just visited the restaurant to get my buy one get one free offer that they give you for completing the survey. The manager was my cashier and he greeted me when I entered the restaurant. He took my order and I received it within a reasonable amount of time. This was a much better experience."}
{"text":"Visited this location in the late night after a concert, we went in the drive thru where we had split order and the good people at jack in the box had no problem with that. They got our orders right which is always a plus after a night of drinking and how late it was. Overall Jack in the box is always clutch."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the reviews. This JITB lacks customer service, soda is flat and or the selected beverage is the wrong flavor. The team needs to be retrained or hire a new team"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here on the way back from Las Vegas. It wasn't busy at all at first, but these workers moved so slow that it was pretty packed by the time we got our food. It's called FAST FOOD, not slug your ass over to the fryer while you give everyone dirty looks...food. Okay, that's kind of childish, but everyone working there, with the exception of the tall brunette (didn't catch her name but was the one who apologized for the wait), was working as though they were making food for FUN! Even the manager, who was a guy dressed in a nice shirt, was working slower than anyone! The customers all kept they're cool but we were all shooting each other looks, in disbelief of what we were witnessing, since all the workers are in full view.   I ordered, waited, went and got gas, came back and waited, went to the restroom and then waited, all before we got our food!! Twenty two minutes for two tacos, a deli trio sandwich, and a pumpkin pie shake, which was upgraded to large and made on the fly by the polite brunette in a matter of fifteen seconds. Not to mention we stood there for five minutes before anyone took our order.  In conclusion: I don't think it would be going to far to FIRE THE WHOLE STAFF AND GIVE THEIR JOBS TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO EVEN FIND ANY WORK IN THIS ECONOMY!!! Simply unbelievable.  PS- If you look at the photo of this place, you'll see the big machine that you can order for yourself. It's the only thing that pulls it's own weight there."}
{"text":"Horrible hiring manager  (Nancy) Don't bother applying here, Nancy will just put you through the hire process Then completely ignore you and/or avoid you. I waited over 45 minutes, two different days to show her proof of I.D something that takes  (5 min or less) and she couldn't be bothered. She told me to have a seat when I first arrived and she never got back to me. She continued to watch me patiently wait, while she kept pussy footing around. UNPROFESSIONAL POINT BLANK! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME work somewhere else! no wonder that place has a high turn over rate I'm surprised they're still in business. Last complaint: Dirty tables disgusting! And food is over priced if you want my honest opinion."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Jack in the Box. It was early and I was hungry, the picture of a breakfast croissant in the window got my attention. The guy running the drive through was really friendly for such an early time, turned out to be Kevin the Manager. He was slammed and under staffed but he got my stuff pretty quickly and also ran another register. That guy was impressive, he needs a raise. The croissant was great too."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Javier has a few things to learn about treating people with respect. He got our order wrong and behaved like it was an inconvenience to fix his mistake. This is my closest Jack in the Box so I guess it looks like I no longer eat at Jack :("}
{"text":"Pretty convenient for me and my girl. Right down the block from our place. First tried jack in the box after I paid my car bill and was blown away by the bacon & Swiss buttery jack. Always coming back for more."}
{"text":"Crap food and tow crazy owners. I bet it's a nice business scamming starving students."}
{"text":"On 9/11/16,me and my wife stopped for breakfast on our way to work. In the drive through the acting manager Sean ( no name tag) refused to accept my order because he stated he couldn't understand that when I ordered a cresant supreme. This went on for over 30 seconds where I finally asked him if he was arguing with me because I wasn't saying a supreme cresant. He then stated its just don't understand what you want. I asked if he had an item on the menu that sounded similar to what I asked for when we finally agreed that he could put my order through, at the window I met Sean, a sweetly smug individual who had removed his name tag, I nicely asked his name which he told me then realized that I wasn't asking for the manager who he happened to be dressed as, Sean then shut the drive through window in my face and began furiously to write down information since now understood I was going to report this to Jack in the Box direct. Half an hour later in went on line Tuesday morning and gave my experience asking to be contacted and as of today 3 and half days later have heard nothing. I believe Sean is connected in some way to who ever owns this business so I've taken the time to post this so all of us with similar types of attitude can see that even the owners could care less so we should ALL take our business elsewhere, understand that I stopped at this location at least 2 to 3 times a week but no more."}
{"text":"Great awesome service although we went through the drive thru....George was fast and everything is always fresh and hot......we always get jack in the box after work.....he deserves a raise or somethin"}
{"text":"Had to stop for breakfast and used the drive through. Service was prompt, courteous, and fast.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on Saturday morning. They handed us our ice coffee, and my regular size iced coffee was missing about 2 inches of coffee. Who hands the customer a coffee that's not all the way full? When I asked them to top it off they replied we are all out of iced coffee. Ugh fine what ever I need my coffee. My daughters mini pancakes were hard, stuck together, and inedible. The rest of the food was your normal subpar jack in the box food."}
{"text":"This place gave me the worst service and experience I've ever had.  A medium problem is a big one. They shorted my $15 order a 3pc egg roll (that's 1/3 of my order).  When we called to get it fixed they didn't answer the phone. I drove BACK up there (a 10 mins Rd trip) only to have them tell me too bad, we can't. You need to come back when a manager is there. So, they mess up my order and then I have to go back twice?  Avoid this place.. or at least check your order before leaving. The employees don't give a damn about your satisfaction. Seriously.. they just wanted me to go away and leave them alone."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the staff here.I was sad that Ajay left but after speaking with her grandmother who happens to be the manager Ms.Linda who is absolutely the gem of this establishment I understood her reasoning.I normally come in the mornings for my breakfast before heading to work,i have never had an incorrect order and I always get enough napkins which now seems to be hard to come by at fast food places.Its just a great start to my day when i see Ms.Linda and she is such a delight and joy to my start of my hectic days."}
{"text":"First time here and the last.. We went thru about 11pm and ordered tacos and med Pepsi.  They had NO drinks available. So we just got the tacos. It took them a while to get the order and we only ordered 8.They even had us back up so the timer would stop at the window!! When we got the food we went right home maybe a 5min drive. the tacos were cold and hard. So what took them so long in making our tacos? They were not fresh, there was no one in line behind us nor inside the place. Will not go back waste of our time and money"}
{"text":"Long line, fast service, and yummy Diet Coke !!!!! I can't complain with the service."}
{"text":"Omg! We just waited 15 long minutes at the drive--thru to come home and find my medium curly fries with only 3pieces of curly fries!!! I am beyond upset!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be there worst Jack in the Box ever!!!!! It is convenient because it right down the street from my house but I literally dread going there and a lot of time I will drive to the one on  Flamingo!!! The people who work here at night are the WORST!!!!! I swear it must be a requirement to be rude as hell to work here!!! I am a younger female and when I go they are staring, have MAJOR attitude and whisper to each other making you feel so uncomfortable!!! Not only have I had this horrible experience but so has everyone who lives with me. If myself and everyone I live with have all experienced this imagine what poor customer service they give to everyone! The one Hispanic girl who works nights can't EVER hear when your ordering food, she will keep saying \"what\" and than gets a attitude when you have to keep repeating your self and she can't hear. If you hate your job so much you have to be  rude every time than look for a new job! I work customer service and never in a million years would I EVER treat a customer so poorly, very sad!!!! Find new workers with better attitudes and that smile, it is their job!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate in and the staff was really great, they brought me my food and came around to make sure i was enjoying my meal. the bath rooms were clean and this sounds dumb but they have a really cool drink dispencer"}
{"text":"For a fast food joint there not bad, clean, friendly and haven't screwed up anything yet.. it's my go to place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I came though this jack in the box because the service and food was terrible tonight the manager was helpful and nice! Kudos to the manger tonight. He was a male probably in his mid 20s' wish I would have got his name."}
{"text":"So I couldn't stand the inconsistency of this place but an employee who should be Mgr. \"DAN\" the man has kept me coming here. He has consistently gone out of his way and been very pleasant every time I've stopped by. I'm in awe that this man cares so much about doing his job. It blows my mind in the world we live in today!! I just prey someone notices this and give him the credit he deserves. I was done with j&tb.  He kept me coming."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru last night , Freddie had the worst customer service, you work there because you chose too ! Quit if you can't work it ! Ever going there late anymore !"}
{"text":"Such a small little place but very clean and the staff were all friendly and happy to be there. Food came out hot and fresh and correct. I would love to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Roach heaven. There are at least 30 dead baby roaches in their women's restroom light fixtures. It makes me sick thinking I just ate here.  Never again."}
{"text":"This Jacks day shift needs retraining on how to cook food. Half of the menu is dropped in the fryer so it's quite hard to mess that up but lord forbid you order something they have to make and it's over. I've been there a few time on day shift and placed orders but this last one ruined it for me. I was excited to taste the Buttery Jack Burger so I ordered both of them and my 1st bite I spat it out. Bread was hard and rubbery, beef patty was not juicey, lettuce was soggy, it's like they made the thing 4hrs prior to me getting it. Total disappointment. Will never go there in the day again. Graveyard shift hands down is when you wana order your food."}
{"text":"Good was fast, downside: cold food not even remotely warm & rude service. Thanks a lot, if you're gonna serve crap food, don't charge $6 for chicken strips that are cold & stale. Also, don't yell at me when I try to order a peppermint Oreo shake cause it's \"no longer an option\" yet you have 5 posters around the building promoting it. Bye."}
{"text":"This former Californian was very excited to see a Jack in the Box-- we have these in the South??   Jack in the Box has a special place in my heart. They have a ton of food options, with breakfast all day, and some good treats for vegetarians. I love me some curly fries and jalapeno poppers, and Jack's are super yummy.   The roughest part of my visit was the wait time. I stop for fast food and expect it to be pretty fast, especially when my order is minimal. I waited far too long for my food here, 2 tacos and an order of curlys took close to 8 minutes when I was the only one in the drive thru.  On the plus side, the food was nice and hot and the fries were definitely fresh. Not the greatest, not the worst!"}
{"text":"NOONE wearing gloves while preparing food. The girl at the counter said \"I'll be with you in just a minute\" and I asked  \"Do you guys have gloves?\" She completely ignored me. We made eye contact, she stopped, registered what I said, and turned around and grabbed ANOTHER hash brown with her bare hards. Totes disgusting. Brb, clling the health department."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru ordered my food like normal and paid with a $20 bill. The cashier then tells me it's fake and says she's going to call the cops on me if I don't leave. Stole my money."}
{"text":"So I come to the West Coast and I know they have some really good fast food places. I'm driving and see this location. I turn from Flamingo road into the strip mall and, going across the lot traffic, maneuver my car into a parking space from the opposite direction. A small feat considering I'm driving across the drive-in lane to park. But it's Jack-In-The-Box....It's gonna be worth it because I'm hungry. Go inside and a loitering customer is talking to the guy at the desk. Dude is friendly so I cut him some slack. The server is friendly too. I'm not sure what I want so I wait a bit before ordering a portabello mushroom burger. I wait a bit and it seems longer than usual because I'm hungry. I pace a bit sipping my drink because I have that part of the order already. When my order arrives, I walk towards it. A girl from back in the kitchen asks \"Who's portabello is this?\" When I step up to get it, she glances at me, makes a disparaging face and tosses the bag on the counter in my direction. Fucking bitch! It had been a long day and I was hungry and not ready to start a fight so I just took the burger, left and figured she has having a bad day. Nah she was just a bitch. I don't see myself coming back here again. Not like I'm in town all the time, but next day I went to In-N-Out burger and if you read my review of that location, you'll see why this Jack Off in a Box won't be seeing me anytime soon.  Two Stars because the burger was good, as were the drinks and fries."}
{"text":"Came in on our way to a game, most inexpensive bites before heading into venue that racks in $10/burger. So we walk in and the server immediately says \"We're closed, because we're short staffed\". We see a woman sitting at a table, alone, with a table filled of food before her. We're like okay, well then why are your doors opened. Without hesitation we turned around and left. Staff are rude!"}
{"text":"Never eating here again. My chicken strips were gross. They had that chewy guey taste like they weren't fully cooked. I tried ordering the strips again but with a salad hoping that nastiness might have been a one time thing. It wasn't. I will not make that mistake a third time.  Jumbo jack meat is horrible and all the sauces didn't cover up the taste. Never again!"}
{"text":"Best hours and best customer service! They are opened inside 24/7 on Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Love that! Food is good just fattening what else would you expect from a fast food joint that's chained! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The service here was very good.  I went with my son and wife prior to the air show at Nellis.  Breakfast sandwiches were deliciuos, the best of any fast food breakfast.  My son now says that JITB is better than Mcdonalds because of this visit.  He's 5 and likes this place better than Mcdonalds, that is crazy coming from a child."}
{"text":"Went today to try the Fajita Ranch Melt.  The sandwich was OK, nothing too special.  I would never want to pay $3.99 for it though.  I only got it because I had a coupon which got the sandwich free with purchase of a large drink.  It was not big enough to be worth the price.  Aside from this visit I have been here many times and I am usually happy with the service, but mostly I come here with coupons looking for a cheap alternative.  Can't beat the cheap 2 tacos for 99 cents.  I would consider giving JITB 4 stars for the breakfast alone though because it is so much better than any other fast food place.  Overall, good food, can be pricey or cheap depending on what you want, and the service is good, but don't expect too much because it is still just a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"All bad.. came here Sunday late night. Marisol assisted us at drive thru. As she took our order i knew it was bad already. Attitude to the fullest. Got our meal. Asked did you double check out order. Is this every thing said yes.. guess what. Incomplete order. Horrible service"}
{"text":"The workers here always seem to be in a rush. They're rude to you when it comes to taking orders and seem to yell at you. I don't know what's up their asses, but be kind."}
{"text":"place is very tiny.  you open the door and bam you are ordering food. not the best looking Jack In the Box i've been too. I even had some dudes try and sell me and Ipad...   Food is the same as all  One thing that i found weird, a truck brought their burger buns through the front door passing through the sitting area. Weird, why would they not do this through the back?"}
{"text":"Dirty, cup lids some missing no napkins, trash all over floor. Food decent. Personal not very professional,"}
{"text":"Very clean atmosphere and staff was very friendly and helpful... DM was in store and had to mention what a great job they are doing here."}
{"text":"Just came home from the drive thru. I ordered the new pork belly BLT and got a jumbo jack instead. Really wanted to try the pork belly but not getting that chance today."}
{"text":"By far the worst Jack ever. Food served was cold as a puppy's nose. Bun, and bacon was hard. Fries felt like i was chewing slippers, or i mean they were chewy like gum, not fresh. Came in at about 10am, prolly food left over from their midnight shift. And plus, manager was chewing gum which is NOT allowed at work. Terrible. Just terrible."}
{"text":"We always eat here but, mostly by drive thru. This time we decided to go inside. Only one person in the seating area. As my husband placed our order blueberry oatmeal and crossiant egg sandwich with hash brown I went to sit down. They have only one full booth and a half booth the rest were table and chairs. I sat down at the table and the chairs were very uncomfortable. We moved to the one booth. MUCH BETTER.  My husband went to use the restroom and he said they did not have soap to wash hands with and its the only place to go to , so that meant the male workers weren't using soap after the bathroom. He told the manager and all she said was OH, we will look into that. Most of the tables and the floor was dirty and this was 9:30am. My hash brown tasted like it was cooked in old oil. But, I do have to say the Blueberry oatmeal was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This location almost always gets the order wrong, even the simplest orders. The food is okay though, as far as jack in the box goes. I ordered late night box and got a very small amount of fries and the chicken sandwich tasted about a week old, the last time I went. Most of the other times the food was better. I always have to check what's in my bag to make sure the order is correct. I have gotten wrong orders and I'm usually short my order by not giving me something I ordered."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve this star, but hands down the worst Jack in the Box I've been to in my 22 years. I repeatedly ordered a regular Oreo shake, and small curly fries. I was charged for a large fry(which I didn't debate because I was hungry) and as soon as he handed me my shake, it hand a weird dent in the lid. I didn't think I had to check my food because I only had ordered fries. I looked down in the bag at regular straight fries, as I was pulling out. I immediately backed up and let him know about the error, and he acted like I was wrong. . After my 30 second drive home, I dig into a bag of cold fries. Never again. . ."}
{"text":"I just ordered 1 meal and some tacos and the guy said I could only get coffee with my meal....the number 30 breakfast platter & I also tried to order curly fries with my meal and he said they no longer has curly fries only regular fries...all of this is just him obviously being lazy. I couldn't believe it when he said it was exactly $20.00 and it was cash only. He didn't even try to hide putting the money in his pocket. This is the worst fast food employee I've ever seen."}
{"text":"This jack in the box may be the closest from me, but it's not even worth it. The people who work in the drive through are never nice. Ever. And the worst part about the experience is the wait. It doesn't matter what time of day I go, I always seem to never get out of the drive through under 20 minutes. And when I get up to the window, I except at LEAST and 'I'm sorry about the wait'. Nope! Just rudeness. So if you have the chance to go to another one, you probably should."}
{"text":"I usually dont have bad reviews especially for fast food but . . . .we arrived at this location, late food run since i did get off work 1am. The manager (male yes he is the mgr) was out side smoking and there was another staff smoking too. They seen us coming through the drive through and still made us wait. We finally ordered, got our order and ate, i tried the overloaded breakfast which consist of a chicken, bacon, cheese, and egg on a english muffin, we also got a hashbrown and 2 chicken sandwich. So while trying to enjoy my sandwhich i notice it had a really weird slimy feeling and i thought hmm maybe its just the egg no biggy. . . Then halfway into my sandwhich i finally tasted a weird powdery gross taste and that one particular bite just smelled weird so i finally took a moment to observe my sandwhich and notice it was alll green on the egg with green and white little spots on the cheese. I was grossed out and threw it away. My hashbrown seemed too cold and we didnt even bother with the other 2 sandwiches. I would have post a pix but no need all that plus you guys need business! You guys need to just be more fresh on your products and observe them. First in, fist out or something. Thank god i didnt get any sickness from this. Also wash your hands after you smoke, the smell lingers onto the food. Thank god i wasnt your health inspector hahaaa kidding."}
{"text":"I am over 60 years of age and had never been to a Jack in the Box.  I had been seeing a commercial on TV about their ribeye burger.  It looked great so we thought we would try it.  I asked the waitress what size the ribeye patties were (how many ounces) - no one knew.  So we ordered double meat and double cheese to go.  They were the worst burgers we had ever had in our life!!!!!!  It was like chewing shoe leather!!!!!   So dry, we almost choked!!!!  The curly fries were good.   We ordered the 7 piece jalapeno poppers.   Half of the order didn't even have jalapenos in them, just the breaded cheese.  We definitely will not be returning to this brand of burger joint.  :-("}
{"text":"5:00 pm. On my way home, stopped in for a sandwich. Asked at counter if #9 Chicken Ranch was breaded or grilled. She stared at the picture menu with kefir a minute. I told her I couldn't tell from the pic. Neither could she. She said she never had it so she doesn't know. I waited for her to ask someone else or look it up or something.  Nope, just stood there. So I ordered a burger \"for here.\" At the end of my order she asked \"for here or to go,\" I repeated for here, please.  Called my number a few minutes later and she put a bag on the counter. I took it and smiled and said \"this was for here.\"  Another blank stare.   Food was ok, fried were warm, not hot. Tables were semi-clean, which is not the same as clean."}
{"text":"Good restaurant and the food is what you expect from the franchise. Workers are always nice and they do what they can to keep it clean.   However, this location seems to attract some local tweekers who are nutty in their own right.  This is not the restaurants fault, rather by-product of their location."}
{"text":"First off . The lady working drive thru was a kings like it was rush hour and she didn't know wtf she was doing... someone needa fire her seriously. She don't know the menu-.- i order some egg rolls because they are always a good pick . Nice thick and juicy :) ...... nope Not this time these egg rolls where under cooked and tiny as hell wtf"}
{"text":"It's you typical Jack in the Box. The food doesn't blow you away, but its decent, affordable and convenient.   I usually hit up the drive thru on my way to work down the street, so I'm there between. 730am - 8am when I pull through. I've had a decently good experience in regards to customer service each time. They've been friendly, polite and efficient each time, otherwise I wouldn't keep stopping in."}
{"text":"Food is good for lunch because I work very close to here and this place pick up my lunch sometimes. I liked it and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I just butter jack buy one get one free, just for $4.99, it was very good deal and good to for my lunch! I like it!"}
{"text":"I normally love jack this is my go to spot usually at night! This time however.. went through The drive-through on Sunday, June 4, 2017 at approximately 2 AM. I ordered The jumbo Jack with cheese combo. I asked for no ketchup and to add mayonnaise and mustard to my burger. The server said so you want a plain burger? I reiterated I would like the normal Jumbo Jack with cheese I just do not want any ketchup and and I would like mayonnaise and mustard. (This is how I always get my burger) anyways, I got home and had a burger bun with mayonnaise and a burger patty. No cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions, tomato. I feel as if the server did this on purpose because he was having a bad night so he sent me home with a plain burger. Fast food is too expensive these days to not get what you order. I am still extremely annoyed about this my total was over seven dollars all for a hamburger with mayonnaise not to mention my boyfriend ordered the new barbecue bacon burger which should have onion rings on it which it did not!"}
{"text":"For some reason when i go there at night the same exact chick comes over the drive through and tells me they are closed.... with lights and the drive through open sign on, but surprise surprise when shes not there its open, worst customer service ever... even for fast food!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't write about a large-chain fast food joint like Jack in the Box.. but the conversation through the drive through was one I've never heard:  \"Hi, I'd like the #2, no bacon and Dr. Pepper please.\"  \"Ok, do you want any sauces with that?\"  \"Uh, yeah, ketchup.\"  \".........uh... What did you say?\"  \"Ketchup.\"  \"Chicken?\"  \"No, KETCHUP.\"  \"Oh..... okay. Can you do me a favor? Can you look on the screen and see if you're order is correct?\"  \"Yeah, uh-huh, it looks fine.\"  I drive up to pick up my food and the girl is trying not to laugh as she is putting my food together... She hands the bag over to me and says 'she put something special on there for you.\" I was like, ???... and said \"What did she put on there?\" (Thinking it was something nasty or weird). \"Oh, she just a smiley face on your food\". I look at the box that burger sat in and there was a smiley face drawn on top with a sharpie. OK.....   Did not know what to say to that. I drove away a little confused and laughing on the inside."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience at Long John Silvers walked out with no food. I told my wife lets just go to Jack. This specific Jack never disappoints. Can't say they have never messed up my order but over all they care about giving you a good eating exerience. There are some really good people that work at this restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give this Jack in the Box 0 Stars I would have they really need to clean up this restaurant they always have broken stuff in there their doors always has broken metal pieces and their bathroom always has clothes in there like jackets are t-shirts I guess people take bats in their sink and leave your old clothing on the floor"}
{"text":"This is my second time going to jack in the morning and I have to say that I have never been here and got my breakfast within 20 minutes. I have too stop driving by the bojangles (can't wait til morning)."}
{"text":"I ran through this Jack in the Box while visiting the area and needed a quick breakfast with a drive through.  It is hard for me to give fast food restaurants 4 stars because it is usually about the same (average), but when it is above average, then they earned it.  I ordered the Sausage, Egg, Cheese Croissant combo.  The lady in the drive through was very friendly, smiled, eye contact and genuinely acted like she meant it when she asked how my day was starting out.  The breakfast was hot, hash brown was crispy and the unsweet tea was good too."}
{"text":"Is this location shut down? It hasnt been open for the passed two days. I wonder if they got shut down or are closed for maintenance. Don't waste your time going here today 6/19/18. They are closed. Whatever happened to 24 hours? I guess putting up a sign explaining what's going on would be too much to ask for. Thanks for making me waste my gas and time."}
{"text":"Should be 0 stars, bread on our food was moldy! Called to speak to supervisor and he starts telling me \"maybe it got wet or maybe due to the freezer\" wow was he double lipping and making outrageous excuses. Bottom line is... I don't want your free food when I know that your food is already rotten"}
{"text":"They seriously don't even deserve 1 star, they do NOT listen to directions!!! Literally every time Ive visited this location in the last 6 months they mess up my order and I have to go back! So this time I just went back to get a refund, one of the employees said they put the money back on my card but she didn't! What a rip off! will never be returning to this location again. Horrible horrible service!"}
{"text":"this sucks that I have to write this sucky review because this is my neighborhood jack in the crack.    drive thru: don't usually have a problem with the drive thru... [tho I did have an incident last year with one guy who got really anal about taking a coffee order after I had driven away from the squawk box.  after I had refused to drive back around.. and make another order [yes, per his instruction] I threatened to scrap my order all together for having the audacity to tell me to do so.  after my husband said his piece..  he finally agreed to add it to our order, before making a smart ass remark about 'the next time..'  I swear I was bout to go mcnugget mad on this  and put my fist through the window for that nonsense!   I never saw him again.  he freaking acted like I forgot an order of 13 meals.  it was just coffee. it was just coffee dude.  I was dumbstruck because dumb asses rub off on me!  ugh.  best of luck in life buddy.  it is not that serious.  eating inside: hmph.. what can I say.  the employees are not geniuses... and it obvious.  there's like 2 ppl who understand what customer service is and the rest who didn't make it to that training.   so 2 stars to those employees.   we walked in one night for dinner.. and a girl was standing at the in between the counter and the kitchen.  it was jack in the box so we knew what we wanted and were ready to order as soon as we came in.  her rude ass I think was working drive thru this night.. so letting us know that someone else was gonna come out to help us was out of the question.  instead, she turned her pink underwear, big butt, low rider jean wearing ass and acted like we weren't there.    after we told her we were ready to order, is when she called the other lady.. [a much older woman] who I'm glad to say was apologetic and friendly...   tables in this particular jack n the box could be better kept.. we had to ask the lady to wipe a table for us before we sat down.   sigh..  I always hope that a neighborhood chain does justice.. but that's just one to many fails when it comes to customer service. idk who the he'll is hiring? mcdonalds maybe? but.. gaaaaah!  get it together!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've had jack in the box since the late 80s.   Let me tell you, things haven't changed.   I got the new bacon Swiss burger and what they gave me was just a greasy mess that had no flavor.    The best part of the meal was the new tech coke machine. (I love those things).  The fries I had were hot and fresh(ish) and tasted about like you'd expect from one of these places. They're all the same..  Three stars because the place was clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"DOES NOT LIKE LGBT..... Very rude, would not respond or even say Thank you! To be fair food was good........service, not so much. Even made comments thinking we left when we didnt!!"}
{"text":"Why do I try eating here? Oh yeah, coupons. I get lured by those coupons I find in my mailbox. My search for cheap and quick food sometimes leads me to dark places (which sometimes means a bathroom at night with stomach pains). The tacos and burgers really should be put on some sort of WHO (World Health Organization) watch list. They can truly be brutal on the gastrointestinal system. And oh yeah, they aren't even slightly tasty or even decent. But they do have jalapeno poppers. These are the one, sole thing that keeps JIB from being 1 star. I am ok with their jalapeno poppers. This location is easily accessible and the closest one to me. Their drive-thru employees would rather be anywhere else in the world but here (or so it seems). Orders are usually correct. But said orders are not usually received quickly. And always be sure to double-check your change."}
{"text":"Over the years this place has gone down hill. I work third shift and this is the only place to eat at that's open 24 hours. If I had another choice, I would never visit this Jack again. Maybe it's better during the day but night shift workers are rude at times, get my order wrong 75% of the time and the wait time is ridiculous. I hope the owners read what their customers are saying because this location has some serious issues that need to be resolved."}
{"text":"Burgers were way overdone and dryer than dirt. My kids wouldn't even eat their burgers, they opted for broccoli instead. I think Jack in the Box should be renamed Crap in the Bag."}
{"text":"Just tried the 'Wakey Bakey' and I'm not a fan. It had way too much oil which made it unpleasant, so I don't recommend this product at all. However, the service from the drive through employee was great, he was super friendly and my milkshake tastes delicious-- which is why I ranked this review 4 stars."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday at 4pm before I had a meeting with a client. My total experience time was more than 15minutes, I was parked and waited for half of that time. My order was just two meals. I was really inconvenienced at how much longer they took than expected. There was only five cars within that 15 minutes and the inside was empty. When I walked in because it was taking so long, the Caucasian manager gave me very dirty looks and didn't apologize or anything. Don't think I will spend money here again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS SUCH SH### SERVICE!!!!!! Crackheads workin at night got the drive thru bumper to bumper!! Mixing orders and cars. It's a mad house been here 20 min and still no food. I hate this place!! No organization. people behind me are getting their food before me im so angry!! This jacks always fails, chance after chance!!! Im officially done! Y'all needa get your sh** straight!"}
{"text":"First time at a jack in the box! This location was AWESOME!! The staff was super helpful, especially Shannon she definitely went above and beyond for us. When we're in the area again we will definitely stop by again! Keep up the great work y'all."}
{"text":"It's a chain.  Drivethru was fast and got my order right, some can't do that.  employee was pleasant and gave me enough napkins."}
{"text":"Jack did not do a good job with his new Ribeye burger. Ribeye deserves to be inside a cheesesteak, not a burger. This burger was chewy, gamey and did not taste good at all. On the positive side, Jack does a great job with coupons, so we didn't waste a ton of money. The $2 Oreo shake was good and if you go inside they have the freestyle coke machine."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly service from a helpful manager. They served me quickly and with a smile. Also offered ranch dressing for my curly fries without  having to ask. It seems most of their customers are drive thru as there was no one inside when I entered and only two other people by the time I left."}
{"text":"Last few times I've came here after work, (about 1030pm) I've gotten food that should not have been served. Second to last time I spent close to 8 dollars on a spicy chicken meal. ( 8 dollars isn't alot but I should atleast expect sort of fresh food since \"they don't make it till you order\") well my fries were cold and stale and the chicken sandwich tasted like it sat forever also it was very dry and bun was hard.  The last time I went I ordered two tacos and a chicken sandwich,   neither was made fresh and tasted like crap and I literally threw the whole meal away. I will not visit here again without complaining about freshness of my food since they can't even seem to give you the value of a dollar."}
{"text":"I tried a salad at a fast food place oh my. The sky is falling or I might have been faced with get something here or go hungry all night decision. The description of the Southwest Chicken salad sounded very appealing with grape tomatoes, corn, black beans, spicy corn sticks and three types of lettuce. It was topped with a full grilled chicken breast and served with a side of Southwest dressing. In an all out shocker, the salad was not bad at all even drawing minor envy from my hamburger and greasy ordering folks I was with at this moment. It likely won't happen again, but the Southwest salad is a viable option to get you a healthy meal here at burger central."}
{"text":"Kayla terrible customer service. Extremely rude, didn't help with my messed up order. In addition hung up on me. No wonder you're a manager at jack n the box."}
{"text":"I have had difficult experiences my last three times here.  First time they forgot an item I had ordered, they were very apologetic and offered a free shake which I appreciate but did not accept.  My second time their diet coke was not working.  Most recently they were out of large cups.  In all these are not huge problems, but it seems like whoever is running the place is letting it fall apart."}
{"text":"Live near by so I go when I need to get something quick for the family.. Every time my husband's burger is sloppily put together! There is one pickle half on the burger and the party is not even on the bun.. I know it's fast food but some kind of pride should go into it and make customers want to come back.. but since this is not the first time this has happened I can definitely say we will be going else where."}
{"text":"Stopped this morning at 825.  Ordered a breakfast platter for my son and a diet Dr pepper for me.  The worker seemed to have a hard time getting the order correct.  Once we got to the window, waited, which would have been fine, but the entire order was cold and soggy, even the hash browns.  Had to be thrown away.  My $2.29 soda also had to be tossed as it was regular flat Dr pepper and I cannot have sugar.  So nearly  $10 thrown away.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst jack in the history of man kind (which is saying a lot). Many a time have i had my order wrong (drinks or food) or the food has been cold/luke warm. And just recently I was given a \"our system is down, it'll be about 30 minutes\" only to go to the jack up the road who had no such issue. Seems like a very specific time frame for a vague issue like that, dont yiu think? Unless you like playing Russian roulette with your food and general experience, I would avoid this particular jack in the box like the plague."}
{"text":"Worst Jack in the Box.   I live around the corner from this location so I have given it a try a few different times. On 2/3 occasions I was missing something. The final time I only ordered a strawberry shake and it literally took 13 mins.   Now I drive to the one on sunset behind the sunset station."}
{"text":"I rarely eat fast food but hey, some times  a girl craves curly fries. This location has the absolute worst service: completely unable to get an order correct.  You would think they'd be able to find competent staff, being located across the street from a community college but apparently not.  1. Ordered a munchie meal to split with my guy. Order placed fine, payment matched the order, got home to a chicken patty on a bun and curly fries all over the bag. No tacos to be found, not the sandwich we ordered, no container for the fries.  2. Tried multiple times to order a smoothie. It's on their menu but they apparently just don't make them, or are unable to stock the correct materials. It's fast food, the ingredients are frozen, this shouldn't be that difficult.  3. Drove by on my way to dinner plans, cars in drive-thru. Dining partner called to cancel, turned around to go in the drive-thru myself. Menu board on, no service. Dining room lights off. Closed early? Weird. Drove around the block and grabbed something else. Came back by, and what do you know? They're serving out the drive thru window again.  I guess if you're only planning to really get the business of the community college, you can set your hours for whatever you like. But if you can't get an order right, you won't get repeat business. And if you can't adhere to your own hours, you won't get any additional business from the tons of residents in the area.  Please put someone on drive thru duty who has active working brain cells."}
{"text":"I seriously just left Jack-in-the-Box and had the most amazing experience I've ever had, Yolanda was amazing ever since she took my order in the drive-through window to when she handed it to me in the pick up window!!! I was honestly so happy leaving Jack-in-the-Box I've never had that kind of service at any fast food!"}
{"text":"ZEROOOOOO STARS Well I've been sitting in the drive thru for 15 minutes... stuck between cars, haven't even made it to the order box. This place will NEVER get my money again. What are they even doing? Always tell me to hold on & then some guy tells me to back up off the pressure point & pull back up so I don't ruin his drive times! Fuck that. I hope you suffer.. oh wait... I think we're going to start moving... nope wrong. Still waiting. 20 minutes now. Haven't even got to the box. Don't waist your time. I've waisted enough for the both of us. I've made it to the box. Nobody has greeted me. 3 minutes... sitting at the box UNGREETED! No please hold NOTHING"}
{"text":"Recently started to make changes here, I've lived in the area for about 2 years and had been here only like 3 times. They were all okay but overall unsatisfactory. Have been back in the last month a couple times and it's always been clean, everyone has been very nice, and the food has gotten more organized. It still tastes the same, but it's a lot neater, burgers not falling apart, curly fries aren't cold and soggy. Much better than ever before."}
{"text":"How can you rate them anything else? Went for a quick breakfast,  it was fairly quick and pretty tasty.  This location is much cleaner than some. But i literally only eat here once a year.   Sometimes you gotta have a junk food breakfast, and this place delivered."}
{"text":"Ok just got home and realized that they put my tacos in the bag this way!! Are you serious?? All the sauces are in the bag and some of the tacos aren't even in the paper!! You only have one job!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Arizona from Alaska and we did not have any Jack In the Box there...  Can we say delicious!! I am a huge fan of the breakfast menu! When I went here I ordered the bacon burger on the sourdough bread and fries. I was not entirely impressed with that particular sandwich just because I'm not a big sourdough bread fan but wanted to try something different. The fries were absolutely delicious though!! The service at the drive thru was excellent and freindly not your average here is your food blah blah blah.   McDonalds who? I will be back for more Jack In the Box!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this Jack in the Box. My kids got breakfast and it was good, so they said. I personally like Jack in the Box, they will make anything for you and its pretty tasty. I love the tacos and their onion rings are to die for. This particular Jack in the box was good, good enough for 5 stars."}
{"text":"worst Jack in the box I've ever visited. The customer service is HORRIBLE! I ordered all cheese burgers plain. They came out NOT plain, which I wasn't upset about. People make mistakes HOWEVER the girl roles her eyes at me and said \"ugh oooooook\" The food took extra long for them to remake it. Because of the extreme attitude I couldn't help to think it was intentional. She brought the burgers back out and threw them on the table. My son politely said \"thank you\" and she didn't respond and walked away.  I will NEVER come back to this place and I encourage you to steer clear of this one as well."}
{"text":"Burgers all day, 24/7! On our way to ASU Polytechnic, we decided to have breakfast at Jack in the Box. Our son was hungry for a burger. \"Son, they don't serve burgers in the morning.\" We were happily mistaken. We ordered a Jumbo Jack for our son. My husband and I decided to share a sandwich, the bacon and Swiss on brioche. I asked if they could cut the sandwich into half, and they were so obliging and courteous. The service was great! The brioche was tasty. I liked the mustard mayo, but my husband did not. My son enjoyed his Jumbo Jack. The curly fries were well seasoned and crispy. We enjoyed sampling the soda machine. The dining room was clean and decorated with fresh flowers. We were delighted with this fast food experience. The only downer was that we ordered the Jumbo Jack sans tomato, and they left the tomato. This made our take out burger soggy."}
{"text":"Great service, very efficient on their drive thru orders. Quick service and the food was good after a long road trip from Los Ángeles. Seriously it was 2am and the people were very energetic and helpful."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Ordered a sourdough Jack and the bacon is like rubber, and the curly fries are burnt.  $10 for a hamburger I can't even eat."}
{"text":"important!!! do not eat the deli trio from here .   i came to eat today with my family.  i ordered a sirachi sd jack. my son got a deli trio sandwich. he was chewing it. then spit out a nickel size plastic white piece. i told the manager. she said sorry. then made a new one. she then sent me off with weekly coupons. the ones you get in the mail. my son only ate half. so he took the other half home. he then ate the other half at 7:00pm. later to find another little white plastic piece in it.  disgusting !!! ill never return to jitb again.  yikess.... whats going on???"}
{"text":"Traveling this summer from Milwaukee so today was my first time at Jack In The Box. I begged to stop and go through the drive thru and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of options. Prices are a bit higher than other fast food places, but the quality of the meat on the hamburger was worth it. I got the Butter Jack burger combo, and wow was I happily surprised. I don't even know how to describe the flavor other than unexpected for a fast food restaurant. Kinda spicy, not too spicy, but packed with flavor. If I have time to go back before my vacation ends I really want to try their shakes and desserts.  Here's to hoping Jack in The Box comes to Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"The posted hours of operation stated that closing time for the dine in and carry out area is 10:00 pm/7 days per week.  Me and the rest of my party (4 of us total)  arrived just before 9:50 pm to find the lobby doors locked prior to the posted closing time.  A fellow patron/customer was walking out as we were discovering this fact and we proceeded to walk in the door that the customer had just exited.  We were then ignored for a few moments by the young lady bagging orders in the front (a shift/team leader named Gabby,  i later learned from another employee). She abrubtly told us,  with no prior greeting,  that they were closed.  Me and one other member politely informed her that it was 10 minutes from the posted closing time and that we only wanted a carry out order to avoid an extremely long line at the drive thru and would happily be outta their hair long before the 10:00 pm posted closing time.  Other than a simple \"Sorry\" followed by being completely ignored after up until we walked out,  we received no explanation or apology.  Given my 15+ years in food service,  this particular behavior/attitude disgusted me beyond belief.. Since it was \"Gabby\" that was so short and rude with us, despite the fact that it was Herself that was clearly just being rude and lazy while breaking a cardinal rule of service for a restaurant chain with set hours of operation, that is the sole reason for using my personal time on this type of review (which is an actual first for me due to my food service experience as well not wanting to cost someone a job due to a single moment of poor decision making). It is my belief and understanding,  that in food service,  the CSR is obligated to serve ALL customers until the scheduled closing time.  All we wanted was a to-go order which would have been only a matter of minutes but were denied regardless.  Being a server previously in upscale establishments as well as a lower tier restaurant chain,  I've had to stand around and wait over an hour on multiple occasions for a couple that was just sitting and having a cup of coffee or tea and I had to do it basically for free and with a smile on my face.  With those experiences in mind,  i dont feel \"Gabby\" is fit for customer service and should be reassigned from any shift leader/management responsibilities due to how she handled herself with a group of customers that were genuinely courteous despite the manner in which we were treated.  We ended up eating at Whataburger a mile up the road and were very happy with the food and the service."}
{"text":"I am a really big fan of Jack in the Box. We didn't have any when I lived in Hampton Roads and I am currently in Springfield and don't know of any around me. So, I was happy to see they were everywhere in Charlotte. This location had a great burger as always, awesome pizza bites that my wife enjoyed, a great chicken sandwhich and the churros.... love the churros. I am kind of glad I don't live right by on or I would be huge but when I happen to be around one, I stop in. I am happy that this location delivered on the goods. Next time I will try the tacos!"}
{"text":"I was so desperate for food and has never eaten at one of these before. I've heard the legendary stories and yes they are legends from a day when food was made with pride.  The pros:  1.  Price. It's cheap and you get cheap.  The cons:  1.  Just pretty horrid food in general. I think I crapped out a biscuit the next day due to the shock to my system. My cholesterol might never recover properly. This is what I get for choosing this spot to cheat from my otherwise paleo-like diet. I will write no more."}
{"text":"Stupid manager or whoever she is who works at night , I asked what burger sells the most & she tells me the whole menu like I couldn't read the menu she had attitude and was getting mad for no reason never going back there again !!!!"}
{"text":"Obviously people go to drive thru to get fast service but I was there waiting at least 10 minutes for the lady at the window to say sorry I didn't get your order. So I had to order again and even then she got my order wrong everyone in there seem like they didn't even know what they were doing. Smh."}
{"text":"Why must this restaurant so notoriously SUCK?! With the exception of a few of these franchises, this corporation has got their big round ugly Jack-in-the-Box heads up their butts. Usually stinky lobbies with bad service and way over-priced food that tastes like they dug it out of the trash bin out back in the alley. At this particular Trop location, I ordered some fish with fries... what did I get? 3 triangles of frozen fish pieces thrown into a fryer and then loosely tossed into a carton that could hold 6 pieces, and a serving of burnt soggy fries slopped onto the tray with no napkins and no ketchup. One of the reasons this dump bothers me is because the company's commercials have that nitwit 'Jack' with his ever-annoying voice trying to act 'funny' while he tells us how cool and hip he is with his 'low-prices', 'good deals', and 'great food'. What can you say about a company that raises the price of a small cup of coffee to $1.81? The 99-cent cup of coffee should never change - even during a recession. They should give a little back to the patrons whom have made them the conglomerate they are. But nooo!.... make that extra buck, that extra quarter, that extra nickel, Jack-in-the-Box. Don't take a small loss or break even for 6 months. Well, I guess they WANTED me to avoid their restaurants in the future, because that's what I do now. Oh look! There's a McDonald's! Let's go!"}
{"text":"I get off work really late and want to grab a quick bite to eat. Almost every time I go they say they're systems are down and can't serve any food at this time. What's the point of 24 hrs drive thru and lights on menu being on. I just want something to eat!"}
{"text":"Cashier was out of dollars bills and coins to make change! Didn't get any for the 10 minutes he requested it. The floor was full of dropped food: fries, nuggets. Looked disgusting plus numerous employees walked over it for the 15 minutes I was there which none of them cleaned it up. Tables definitely needed to be wiped."}
{"text":"Went to go get a munchie meal though the drive thru had a hard time ordering the sign for it wasn't  showing so I asked the person working what they had she seemed annoyed to answer my question finally got up to the window and payed. I tried to ask for some simply sauces she just kept say what like as if I were trying to ask her for so much more. So she turned around I thought she was putting the sauce in the bag but got home and realized she didn't. On top of that they burnt my food so I didn't even get to eat my food. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Fast food is typically the bottom of the barrel, so my standards aren't set too high when I swing through the drive through window.  The guy who took my order was friendly - he gets one star.  My drink was cold - another star.  My Sourdough Jack was missing the extra tomatoes ordered - minus 1 star.  it was cold - minus 1 star.  So we're the fries - minus 1 star.  Too far to go back and complain, so I just won't ever return here."}
{"text":"Besides the drive-thru taking a bit longer than I wanted at 10:30p on a Friday night, this Jacks is pretty average.   The guy working the drive-thru on 6/8 @'bout 10:30p was super nice. My klutzy ass pulled up to the wrong window, but the guy working the window was still nice, lol.   After biting into my 1st taco, my annoyance of having to experience a slight wait in the drive thru line, quickly disappeared because the food we obtained was super duper fresh! Also I'm a little extra, when I ask for extra lettuce on my tacos (why? Idk maybe 'cuz I feel less guilty eating them if they consist of more veggies). My hubby sourdough jack was again, super fresh \"of the grill\" good.   No complaints coming from this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. Plus they tried to rip us off and not return the receipt or change. Food cold and sandwiches were smashed and dry. Druggies wandering in and out of the dumpster area. Creepville"}
{"text":"Very good! Forgot my tacos this time, but the spicy chicken and curly fries were on point. Been here a few times and it's better quality than the others near by. Everything tastes fresher and is cooked properly."}
{"text":"Garbage! I've eaten here so many times and always have an issue. The food is always over cooked to the point you can't chew it. Curly fries are always burnt ends, chicken is always hard as a rock. Tacos over done. I get parked every time. Not to mention items missing from my order and not made as asked. I've moved on to the Flamingo and Swenson location. They know how to get the job done."}
{"text":"I would like a refund of an product I ordered and never received in the amount of 7.81. On 1/15 and 1/16 I attempted to purchase food from two different Jack In the Box's at two different locations.  I received only one order and it was wrong.   1/15 at about 5:20 PM I went to the Jack in the Box located at 620 E Buckeye Rd, Phoenix, Az for a #4, large size with ice tea and onion rings.  She didn't understand me so I had to repeat it for her to understand.  I went around to pay and there was two cars in front of me.  I pulled up payed one girl who gave me my tea and then disappeared to the back of the store.  Another girl gave me my food.  The food I received was a Jumbo Jack with no cheese and regular size French fries.  The lettuce, tomato and pickle were so far off the bun it was easier to just take it off, additionally the bun was torn.   1/16 at about 5:20 PM I went to the Jack in located at 3150 E Washington St, Phoenix, Az for a #4, large size with ice tea and onion rings.  After I repeated my order no less than three times because she either didn't hear me or she was guessing at what I said I told her to forget it and left.  I then went to 620 E Buckeye Rd, Phoenix Az since it was on my way.  Again, I ordered #4, large size with ice tea and onion rings, this time she understood it.  I pulled around and notice there was no one in line.  After I paid the girl she provided me with my ice tea.  She left the window open so I can see inside the store.  I noticed someone in a light grey shirt eating something as she was throwing something away into the trash can next to the window, the girl that was helping me was waiting or the Jumbo Jack and texting on her phone.  She then walked up to me and asked me to back up and pull forward again.  I have never been asked that so I asked why, she told me because the timer needed to be reset.  She said they are still waiting for the onion rings.  I told her no I would not back up and I wanted my food.  She appeared to be upset with that responded with, \"never mind!\" and closed the window.  She then went to the back of the store where I could not see here.  Not having the time to wait I decided to leave since this adventure was yet again taking longer than 5 minutes.  Both times I was on my way from my full time job to teach for a group.  I had only less than 5 minutes to get the food so I can eat on my way to teach.  With the substantial pay raise they received with increase in minimum wage you thing there would be some pride.  Is it that hard for a customer to ask of someone making at least 10 an hour to get an order correct and timely at a fast food drive-thru?  At the very least how hard is it to put lettuce, tomato and pickles properly on a burger? Anyway, I would like the money refunded back to my card.  I would also suggest that Jack in the Box review the level of training and/or skill of the employees working at the stores, specifically these two."}
{"text":"This is to inform the customers that this Jack in the Box has a manager that is rude, incompetent, prejudice and does not know how to treat her customers.  She does not smile and if she makes a mistake she will tell you it is your fault.  She did not have a name tag on and would not give me her name and I called the district manager Rudy and he called me back after four days and when I tried to call him back he would not return my phone calls and so nothing was done to the rude person at the business. Evidently, the main corporation does not care either because I tried calling them and received no response from them either.  It seems that the customer service industry is going to hell in a burger joint.  So if I were you I would not go to this Jack in the Box.  This business does not deserve a rating."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and they always seem to forget one thing from my order and it's just annoying, but it's Jack In The Box so what can you expect?"}
{"text":"Worst place I waited 15min for my order and all my food was cold and I was the only one in line the guy was a straight ass"}
{"text":"Very rude drive thru service ! How about instead of yelling \"what???!!!\" rudely after I say each item you say \"i'm sorry can you repeat that\"?  I'm sure it's loud and you were having trouble hearing through your headset but there's also a better way to treat your customers.  The food is good here but I won't return."}
{"text":"They have fast, friendly drive thru service in the morning.  But at times they get my breakfast sandwich order wrong. I like the grilled bfast sandwich without the meat (ham & bacon) and they normally leave the normally leave the meat on.   8/28/15 (5pm)- the girl at the window asked us for payment and without anyone in line behind us, she told us to pull around and park in the lot and they'd bring our burger and tacos. Lame. I'm guessing they are just concerned about their drive thru service time.  Not impressed.  But then again, it is a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru and everything on screen was correct. Got to window, after few seconds girl asked me to reverse and then pull back up so i did. Gave me our drinks, asked for receipt in bag and then asked me to pull around front to wait for our order. Waited and waited and waited. Guy comes out hands me the bag of food and i leave. Drive home with hungry kids and open the bag and no tacos and no receipt!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Oh Jack in the Box, how I missed you whilst I've been on the East coast. I pulled up in my car, told you what I wanted and you delivered it to me at the next window. I inhaled the smell and short drive to my house. I unwrapped you with my mouth watering. I took a bite and realised it didn't taste as good as I remembered. Maybe it was a case of absence makes the heart fonder, but I was disappointed with my sourdough Jack. And that made me sad."}
{"text":"You guys are ok, but lack any morals whatsoever. I pulled up to the Dt today,  and said \" can you please pull to the front\" I said no, i want to wait here. I used to work for arbys and I know what your doing,  your trying to beat the clock and fake report to your manager as well as the district supervisor.  I hope they see this as u guys try to Cheat and pull cars forward. I won't ever do that so your wasting your time with me"}
{"text":"I usually love this location because it's so close to home... Ordered a drink and the straw wasn't working and I opened it...   There was a plastic bag in it... wtf."}
{"text":"They don't make anything right I just got home with my food the was made incorrect called three times and they just don't answer the phone. management needs to step in and get rid of these jokes of employees it's absolutely absurd! I will not be spending any of my money there in till they fix there staff"}
{"text":"I went in recently with a coupon for a buy one/ get one free breakfast sandwich   All I asked for was extra \"mayo-onion sauce \" on the side. Yes, the sauce is real and has been around for ever. The guy is confused. Asked his co worker. I get my two sandwiches and it comes with extra ONIONS on it and a small box of ONIONS on the side! Seriously hire English speakers please! It was gross and a waste of money."}
{"text":"Fairly new jack in the box. Very clean inside & out. Really friendly customer service but they need the work on the speed a little bit more. All in all a great experience at this location."}
{"text":"Aside from my extra burnt tacos, cough syrup tasting drink and the drive thru lady asking me twice to back up and pull forward in the drive thru to restart her clock, this location took my aunt's back card and someone decided to go shopping after work. Be careful when giving you credit our bank cards to the staff at this location."}
{"text":"Terrible store. Line was forming and all they cared about was drive thru customers. Walked out and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"This jitb is one of the best. Go to place for some quick breakfast and the drive thru is ultra quick. Friendly employees also. Asian chicken is to die for."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Jack in the on the planet.  \"Fast Food Fresh\" is great and all - but not when it takes forty five minutes to get lunch. Pair that with a hungry toddler who just wants chicken nuggets, it makes for a rough afternoon.   Additionally, the restaurant was filthy. The floors were sticky, the tables were covered in crumbs and napkins and it felt very neglected - which was odd considering how empty the restaurant was.   We won't return here, no matter how hungry we get."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. The whole restaurant was full of flies and every single table was dirty.   We ordered 1 soda and 2 milkshakes which took almost 10 minutes.  On the way out I decided I wanted a soda, My husband went up to order and the woman said \"I'll be right with you\" after (literally) 10 minutes he came back to the table and said \"she never came back. I have to use the restroom\" so I went and got in line. The same woman said \"I'll be right with you\" and disappeared again. It took her 9 minutes and 11 seconds to come back (I timed it on my phone)  I understand it can occasionally get busy, and the front of the house might suffer, but if I can hear bouts of laughter echoing from the back - something tells me it isn't backed up orders keeping you from the register.   Won't be visiting this specific location again."}
{"text":"I would give less than one star if I could. I have never gone to this location without them messing up my order. The only time of the day the service and quality are good is during the weekdays mornings when their younger staff is still in school."}
{"text":"Hm. Just went through the drive thru & got a Jacks Spicy Chicken. Went home & bit into it & it's completely chewy. I could feel my teeth breaking into each layer. Most disgusting thing ever.  Tried calling and of course no one answers."}
{"text":"After visiting this Jack In the Box 1 month ago, the cashier spilled a soda in my car which went down into all of the power windows and locks. I asked cashier 2 times for a wet rag so I can get as much cleaned up as I can. To no avail she only handed me 4 paper towels.... I sent in my survey and contacted corporate office. The damage to my electrical needed to be repaired. The car dealer wanted $149.00 to remove the panel and repair damage. After waiting for one month for Farmers Ins ( Jack in the Box's Insurance) never returned any phone calls they had decided that it was not their fault. Although the video footage was very bright and he could not clearly see he still denied any and all wrong doing on their part...  The owner of this Establishment is JOTI MADHURA...... He has been contacted sooo many times regarding their neglence and NEVER  responded to Corporate or me.  What is  $149.00 out of their pocket, Jack in the Box makes Billions of dollars daily........ Well Jack In The Box you have reached the bottom of the list right next to Mc Donalds.  Congrats...... YOU WILL NEVER GET MY BUSINESS AGAIN.  I hope who ever reads this to STOP making these big Fast Food Restaurants RICHER......"}
{"text":"We had the fajita pitas and they got the order right.  Good service and decent prices."}
{"text":"ALERTIf I could less than a star I would. Would probably give a negative star!! ALERT!! Unsafe for citizens. Bugs in dining room and hair in my food which was incorrect. Horrible management and employees who don't care. Avoid avoid avoid!!!! Worth the extra 30 secs to eat anywhere else. Burger King around the corner or McDonald's by the freeway if you are looking for fast food."}
{"text":"3rd time in the row I've gotten 8 nuggets from a 10 piece nugget deal. I get that it's off the value menu and Jbox isn't getting the revenue from other meals - btw I order all normal menu items. But I should absolutely get what I order. No excuses about that. I demand managers rectify this situation."}
{"text":"Don't ever waste your time going here, especially at night. I ordered 6 things and they forgot 3 out of 6 plus my drink. And this isn't the first thing this happened. Never coming back! And found hair in my food."}
{"text":"This place deserves ZERO stars! The employees were too busy socializing and put absolutely NO EFFORT in preparing the food or ensuring that the orders are correct. We were charged extra for food we NEVER received and waited over 15 minutes for them to prepare our food only to be DISAPPOINTED! The service is horrendous and the food is terrible! Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money at this establishment!"}
{"text":"Just went through drive thru,  ordered breakfast burrito, fries and egg rolls.. Egg rolls were good but fries were not fresh and they were old and cold and burrito was horrible.  The burrito was not put together correctly... The girl said her name was Juliet when I called back to complain.  Juliet said she was the manager.  She was very rude and very unprofessional.  I cant believe they would have such a rude worker representing this company.  I have been going to this jack n the box for years and have never been given such a gross burrito or cold fries... Ever and I have NEVER recieved such bad customer service here like this...EVER.  Juliet definately needs to be retrained in how to treat guests.  Rudest service I have ever recieved at this location or any other for that matter.  I choose Jack N Box over other fast food and I pay the higher price because I feel its more upscale.  But tonight was the worst food and customer service I have ever recieved at this location.. Horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Time & time again. My family & i order tacos & they NEVER come out right. We ask to them to fry then longer to make them crunchy but they never seem to do it. We almost always go back to exchange tacos . They have forgotten half our order just a few days ago. It is a HASSLE to be driving back & fourth because things arent done correctly . I will     not be eating there & i demanded my money back from todays order but there is no Manager on duty & wont be back until Saturday ."}
{"text":"Been going there since 2006 while I was in high school and going in there always brings back fun memories. Thanks JB"}
{"text":"Order: 1 jumbo jack no cheese Six tacos extra lettuce I forgot to ask for the extra lettuce on my order. I went to the counter and asked if they could do that for me. I felt bad because I saw our order about to come out, and they went to redo it.  Order came, and with an AWESOME amount of lettuce! Thanks dudes"}
{"text":"Very very disappointing.  I normally look forward to coming to this Jack in the Box and been coming to this particular one at least 25 times.  I'm the duke here.  In the past, orders were exact, fresh and fast. So what happened today?   I asked for a croissant, add egg.  The drive thru worker says that the manager only allows for me to buy the supreme croissant, minus the meat.  This is a deceitful practice because you have to pay extra for what you aren't getting.  Almost double the price!  How about letting me pay for something I want, not pay for something I don't want?    This is no way to treat any customer, especially loyal ones.   Watch out for extra charges!"}
{"text":"The employees can't seem to count. 1-2-3-4-5 piece nuggets, not 4. SMH  Nuggets are pretty moist, but I don't care for the food here overall."}
{"text":"SLOW DRIVE THRU!! Jeez, I was here forever, and if I could have backed out, I would have. Food was fine, though."}
{"text":"i can now say with confidence this place rips people off. After last night, I have now been charged for food and not received it multiple times. Usually when I come to this location, they miss a small item that doesnt cost a whole lot of money. Last night, there were multiple items missing from my order and when I went back to get my order filled correctly, i was charged AGAIN for those items. I was called a cheap skate a liar, and an a** hole by the workers."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst night at the crack I ordered 1 egg roll a or jack a value ff and a bonus jack combo its new asked the drive thru lady for got fries and what do I get cold and not fresh fries I go back the line is long we tell her about the fries when we get to the window we asked for the order to be re made because we waited so long we pull around and park she come out a few minutes later and say we made it all fresh.... Lol that was a lie she gave us the same food smh never remade it and the fries were still cold wow after all that my husbands didn't even eat It  I should take it back tomorrow and save the rest of what I didn't eat because it was horrible and take that too"}
{"text":"paying 20 cents for xtra pickles!! wth!! and then you get none!! you lost my business and i'm fb it as well!"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick  snack . They have great curly fries. Their tacos are very reasonable.  And tasty . Jumbo jack is passable  . Services  were a little  slow . It was convenient  and easy to get to"}
{"text":"We were told to wait for our drive thru order at the front for 15 minutes. Two cars behind us drove away with their orders."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and there were several high school aged kids lining the drive way, it was almost 2am so they made me a bit uncomfortable. I told the person at the window about the kids standing along the drive way he said \"ya I don't think I'm getting mugged.\""}
{"text":"The manager is rude and short with you. If they only sold The tacos and The Breakfast Jacks, I'd still come back. Every person that has had a late fun night out has more than likely had Jack in the Box tacos at 2 a.m. Pretty sure it's just what you do, guess it's kind-a-like a part of growing up, late nights and Jack in the Box tacos."}
{"text":"Good service with fresh food. The employees are friendly and bring the food to your table. There a two younger guys who work the drive thru late night who are sooo nice."}
{"text":"If it were possible to choose 0 stars I Would do so. The person who took our order was rude and cut us off at the speaker and did not allow us to complete our order before speaking. Once pulling to the window the food was shoved through the window at us and the orders were wrong. We pulled back around and the manager rushed us and told us to pull to the front barely listening to our issue. Extremely disappointed with this visit."}
{"text":"Last night I want to jack in the box. I guess they where a bit busy for the night around 8:54 pm and I was being patient while the girl took my order. Went to the Window to pay and the girl told me if I could wait a bit since she was busy. I didn't mind waiting got my bf's food l. It took a bit long but I didn't mind. Over all good customer service. The girl that attended me was nice. Wouldn't mind waiting a few minutes since I wasn't in a hurry. Just wish they had some veggie burgers..."}
{"text":"Ok I kid you not, the people who take your order at this place are hilarious. I have NEVER seen them in a bad mood, it's trippy! You know you have good management when...  I gave this 4 stars though, because they messed up my order. =) No tomatoes and mayo, does not mean no lettuce and bacon & leave the tomato while you're at it...   hahah it's alright, ill still go there anyway, they make me laugh"}
{"text":"I have recently become obsessed with their jalapeño poppers. I've come a few times within the past week & they are always super nice ! They always ask me if I need anything as opposed to other Fast food establishments"}
{"text":"What a crap experience !  Get someone who listens and speaks clearly to work the drive through!  Hope that idiot working there tonight enjoys that job because Jack in the box is about as good as he will get!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this jack in the box. Every time I come here whether it's 5am to get my iced coffee or 5pm for an after work quick meal, I get the same excellent customer service. I actually stopped going to Starbucks in the am because the first person I would come in contact for my day there was rude. I want to start my day off right and have yet to have a bad experience with this location. Sergio and his daughter are great and as long as they r here I will continue to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"They are always so nice at this jack in the box, the customer service has been great so far, the food is usually warm and yummy as well."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. My order was wrong, food was cold and disgusting. I would never go here again, even if they were the only place in the state open."}
{"text":"If I could i'd give zero dam stars! Service sucks! Food was cold then they left out part of my order with no apology and shitty faces!  The people who work here shouldn't be!"}
{"text":"Good place to come to enjoy in olive park !!!"}
{"text":"I was hungry and I stopped in for a quick bite. I ordered two supreme crossiants and a courtesy cup of water. and they were very good and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a clean restaurant but the people hanging around here look a little shady.  I would recommend just using the drive thru and do not use the dining area."}
{"text":"Not too bad after a night of partying. I went here around 2 a.m.  There was a line, but it progressed quickly. The sirloin burger was accurate to my order.  I expected the burger to be a little bigger... The fried were hot.   It's fast food (that I don't need) so what else can I say?!"}
{"text":"I agree. The only time i ever went to this JITB, a fight broke out where people were smashing each others heads against the metal railing. I'll never forget that, i'll also never forget the fries they failed to serve me as a result of the chaos.  Stay focus JITB employees. We need our fries."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box opened only a few days before I wrote this review, I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of this location because the closest Jack in the Box in Centennial Hills had been Craig & Tenaya off the 95 until now. I went and chcked it out as soon as it opened. We all know what food Jack Box offers us, so I won't waste anytime on that. The food I did get was pretty fresh and tasty like it should be, but took a little long to come out to the table. I will give them the benefit of doubt for now, because it was quite busy inside and in the drive thru as it had just opened days ago. This location is unique as the inside dinning layout is completly different from what we are all use to with Jack in the Box, all of the old locations being the same pretty much. This one really hits the mark. Stylish, clean, has a really good feel inside. Extra kudos to this location for having the touch screen order kiosk right at opening, and the fountain drink selection is bigger too. I will be going back often, I'm so excited!"}
{"text":"I'm on my way to Texas and stopped by for a bite and guess what the fucked up my order in stead of chicken they gave me beef I was also missing some chicken nuggets when I went up to the counter it took forever for some one to attend me the lady in front was busy fucking around in the  drive-through, when I finally got attended she kept repeating everything back (which is good) but she did it because she kept forgetting what I wanted then when I asked for a bag she was fucking around dancing and well they really need to calm down and just do a thorough and professional job"}
{"text":"Obviously this wasn't the best food I ever had, but it was good. My fries and burger were warm and fresh. The place was clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"What do the drive-through asked the lady what was on the for for for she's told me to look at the picture. Negative attitude and just inappropriate customer service. What was even more shocking was it was the manager that was talking to me. Do not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy was I having an egg craving! I pulled into Jack in the Box intent on buying a bucket of eggs. 3 sides of scrambled eggs and a side of sausage made for an awesome breakfast and it was only $2.38.   I tried the same thing with McDonald's eggs and they tasted like some kind of fake egg filler substance. J in the B eggs taste like real scrambled eggs.   I asked them to put it all in the same container, and my eggs picked up the yummy sausage taste too. Ever since I've been running 2 miles every morning, skipping breakfast is not an option. I'm hungry! This is GOOD, cheap and filling. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"In the morning they will make it any thing the  way you ask if it's not super crazy inside.  It's in a nice shopping area in Henderson, Nv if your just in the area on the freeway it's 2 seconds from the ramp and it's one of the nicest areas in Vegas.  There is a view of both Henderson and Nevada and on a clear day you can see more points than anywhere because its the highest point in the whole valley without actually climbing a mountain and non of the mountains have structures or roads leading to view points like this.  You can sit on the lobby at the adult bar stools and see the best restaurant view without alot of hassle. They also have the best shakes ever so yah you could just go there and hangout with friends for a long drive. The new tacos are going to be so delicious , five stars. Its also attached to another building convenience store with liquor and gas.  I've been to every Jack in the Box in the City and this one is by far the nicest.   ps Don't Drink and Drive"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast food, but I went here for lunch and it was a good place! Nice people! It's a Jack in the Box food, but clean and friendly."}
{"text":"The girl who works the afternoon driver through is so very nice. She always smiles and seems very genuine with her conversations. Food is always good."}
{"text":"They had no ice for the sodas we ordered and seemed understaffed because the drive thru took a long time, even though there was only one car in front of us.   The no ice part is the worst part of it all."}
{"text":"I don't normally review fast food joints, but this place deserves a good review.  They hire good people and train them really well.   Fast food chains thrive on consistency and this Jack in the Box location is VERY consistent.  Jack in the Box done right."}
{"text":"Don't bother going to this Jack in the Box. I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 burger. I was charged for 2 burgers and instead of taking it off after I had told the worker what I actually ordered, she just said \"sorry but you're still paying for the 4 sandwiches.\" Last time I'll be going there. Learn to listen to the customer and their ACTUAL order. The number they have to call to complain is no longer in service, shocker"}
{"text":"They are always rude Africa not sure if that's her real name or she was being funny was rude. It's funny fast food workers want 15.00 an hour but what did you do to earn it?????"}
{"text":"Just went to the drive thru & couldn't complete my order bc the kid at the window, clearly SICK, was coughing all over the place. SEND HIM HOME FOR GOD'S SAKE!  Just called to speak to a manager & some woman who could barely speak English told me \"no managers until tomorrow after 9\".  So sad."}
{"text":"First time ever going to a Jack in the Box, instantly hooked! Friendly staff, good food, low cost. Even gave me a cute antenna ball to spread the love. Definitely going back! I got the #2 and was a little worried that the garlic sauce would be overpowering, but it was the perfect compliment to the swiss cheese. The cashier stated that their egg rolls are better than most Chinese restaurants and they weren't lying! Way to go!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would !  We stopped here for a quick bite after a long day shopping.  Just wanting to eat real quick & get home to our beds was a big factor in our \"fast food\" choice.  Some of us waited 45 MINUTES before we received our orders !  45 MINUTES !!!!!!  They completely forgot about us & when asked what the heck was going on, they tried to tell us what we ordered & give us other people's food.  In that time waiting I also saw plenty of people come in from the drive-thru with wrong orders.  Next time I'm in the Concord area I will make a point to NEVER eat at this location again !!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good, fast, helpful and convenient.  After a long drive from Utah, we passed by this Jack in the Box/ARCO/ AMPM carwash location. It was just right off NORTH Interstate 15.   There was a drive thru but we went in anyways to go to the AMPM store inside. Got a bottled refreshment and proceeded to stand in front of the Jack in the Box cashier, who helped us right away.  Orders were placed and the cashier (Dolly) provided me with possible non-meat options. She had a nice smile and very pleasant.  We dined in (Grilled Chicken salad, french fry, large drink and curly fries)  and sat on one of those tall bar stools with table. Clean tables, btw. Our order was called out almost immediately and she gave us the cups for the drinks. Self service on the sodas, utensils and condiments.  We liked this place. It was before the usual lunch crowd so the place was empty. But the crowd started coming in as we were mid-meal. Gas station ARCO gets good steady flow of traffic and the drive thru at Jack in the Box was busy.  I ordered a few items to go and my house dressing for the jalapeno stuffed peppers and onion rings (breaded with panko) were plenty. Salad was fresh and held up in the car during last weekend's 113 degree heat.  Will definitely keep this place in mind and will come visit again next time."}
{"text":"Don't ever eat here if your Black this store is very Racist against blacks and I never seen anyone that work there wash their hands from wiping off their sweat from there forehead or restroom .and do to them having an Bar next to them so all the alcoholics go there to do their Number 2 if u know what I mean If you eat there u must be really really hungry and if your black paint yourself white to get better service"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Jack in the Box I have ever been to.  I want to like this place because it is near my home.  Therefore, I have given them more chances to impress me then I ever should have.  Food is ridiculously slow to come out.  I'm talking 15 and 20 minute waits.  Including one drive thru visit where I was asked to park in front of the restaurant for 15 minutes waiting for my food.  Also one night they refused to take my order inside and forced me to use a kiosk to order on my own.  This place flat out sucks."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that I grew up on Jacks tacos in San Diego so when the concept came to Charlotte I was excited. It is sad to see that in certain areas either the management/franchise owner does not care and  let's a concept go to the ground. The employees seems to act like you are a bother and don't care. The food quality is horrible and and you run a very high risk of getting sick. Orders have been wrong and presentation of the food you would not serve to a dog. Clearly if management cared they would take action on the low health score and corrective action to improve customer service.    Now everyone can have a bad day but each and every time. I was cautioned about patronizing any establishment in that area but against better judgment did anyway. I know this is not a Chic Fil A but you can do better. $15 an hour you ask good luck. Stop by there and when you end up in the hospital you will have the perfect response to $15 an hour.   End result did not eat the food, and will never eat at any of the locations again. Sad that some fast food locations have no work ethic.  There is no option to give 0 stars so the only thing positive thing I can say is they cold ice, hummm."}
{"text":"I stopped in at about 11:45 PM. I went inside and I wasn't even acknowledged for 5 minutes. They clearly seen me and didn't say a word. When the girl walked up to take my order she just looked at me... So I just ordered & she replied my total and handed me a cup. It was done pretty quick, but the girl working asked me, \"You wanted this to go, right?\" .... Actually I didn't but she never asked. So I just told her yeah because I was filling my drink and when I turned around the bag was on the counter. I grabbed it and walked out. I didn't even get a \"Thanks for stopping in!\" Or even a \"Bye!\" .... Do your employees know how to talk? Are they shy? Where is the customer service here besides the quick food?"}
{"text":"Really fast service, those nasty little tacos came with lots of shredded lettuce, which I requested, and it's close to my house.  Thanks, Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"So I live on the east coast and never have a chance to enjoy jack in the box because they are not located in my neck of the woods.  Whenever I travel I look for this fast food restaurant because I love their two for a dollar tacos. I know they are extremely unhealthy and greasy but those little bastards are delicious!!! This time I also had an ultimate bacon cheeseburger and I really liked it. We also tried the chicken sandwich it was okay. We added some ranch and that flavored it right on up!   The service is extremely slow and the staff seems a bit young to be honest. The soda is flat tasting and the store itself was not the cleanliest. But like I said I love this fast food place and I will be returning a few more times before I leave"}
{"text":"Always clean food is great. Friendly service. A cheap alternative to earing on the strip."}
{"text":"Fast and efficient location, whether you dine in or drive thru. I never have to wait more than a few minutes for my food and it never gets too crowded inside. They used to have a self order kiosk, which was pretty awesome, but I just noticed that it's not there anymore so now you have to wait in line even when using a credit/debit card."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  Try the breakfast \"plate\" it is a good deal."}
{"text":"Good morning I'm gonna start off as we went through drive thru at 4505 Randolph Rd Charlotte, NC 28211around 7:30pm on January 17th, 2017 and we got home and instead of getting our 3eggrolls we got 9pc chicken nuggets instead which no one eats those and so I called immediately to jack n box and I asked for the manager which I wrote down her name as Tiki which I misunderstood her name. This is the location we visit which is usually twice a month because of the distance of location and where we live. We usually get the same order everytime either thru drive thru or dine in. We went Saturday February 4th 2017 around 2:30pm and were very mistreated as I explained to them and even showed them on my phone as the date I called when they mistaken my order back on January 17th...they told me I needed my receipt which I had at the house with the name Tiki written on it...I cannot waste gas and miles on 3eggrolls and I tried to explain this to the manager on duty which her name was T.T so I said then you must be the one I talked to and instead of Tiki I misunderstood and said it probably was T.T anyhow I told them I wanted the number to the the manager and one of the other associates called her on the phone and had her on speaker and she's yelling which they gave me her personal number and she was irate that her employees gave out her personal cell..I was very polite and asked her who was the general/district manager and she told me the name of Alex and said her employees told her my husband and son were laughing...MY F*CKING SON WAS CRYING!!! I was upset getting teary eyed over this whole senario-OVER EGGROLLS (REALLY????)IF I WANTED FREE FOOD I WOULD take the survey on all my receipts to get 2free tacos everytime--I have NEVER took those surveys as I PAY for ALL MY FOOD...I have it on video and my husband was shaking his head....they were EXTREMELY RUDE and need to be addressed on customer service as there were other customers who witness all this nonsense :( I will wait for a response before I take this location to social media and in the meantime find a different jack n box location as I'm originally from Texas and grew up with Jack n Box since the early 70's and I do love the food. Thank you, Tammy  Show quoted text I'm editing my review as Alex the district manager was concerned on my experience I had with this location. I will update on outcome :) just needed to vent as I NEVER really complain about customer service but Alex was willing to listen and will take action...thank you"}
{"text":"I can't say much about this location, we order at the drive-thru, so I didn't experience the inside of the place.  At home, we have an old TV set that doesn't get any of the \"regular\" channels, my kids watch cartoons either on Netflix or DVDs, and us, we watch stuff on Netflix or Hulu. Well, on hulu they repeat commercials over and over again. And one of those commercials they've been repeating is the Jack In The Box's \"Hot Mess\", and I love it!! I'm always singing the song!! So I had to get me a Hot Mess Sandwich!!! The Sandwich was ok, not too bad, I like the spice and acidity from the jalapeños, but that's about it. It is fast food, right!?  Can't expect a boutique burger, can you?"}
{"text":"bad even for fast food. cashiers cant math or run registers. food is grody. service is slow as nuts and they messed up several orders in front of me.  BARF-O-TRONIC"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst service ever of any jack in the box I'd ever been to. I don't expect much it being fast food but they are crazy slow here. Every time"}
{"text":"Went here a couple times previously and it was ok, but today it was especially awful. I had the buttery jack burger, and as soon a so but into it something was wrong. I'm not sure if it was the meat or what but it did not taste good. I tried to power through it but then I found a bone chip in the beef. Almost chipped my tooth. I complained about it and they said there's no way a bone could be in it (which if it's processed makes no sense) but they gave me some chicken strips as a replacement. Horrible also. How do you ruin chickens strips?  The place was extremely cold in temperature also. Not sure why it's a ice box. Maybe that's why no one goes here."}
{"text":"So... Yesterday someone was banging on my window for money. Today, they won't serve me because their speaker is broken?"}
{"text":"As you can see I did a review of this resturant back in 2015 and the service and food was top notch. Now, a new batch of workers and manager is in place and the food is HORRIBLE!!! You can watch them and see so much disorganization coupled with food safety violations going on like the person will be cooking food, come to the cash register and handle money while touching the register, then go back to cooking food with no new handwashing. My son and I came in for a bacon burger meal of some sort and when we drove off, he started eating his food in the car. He said \"Mom the order is wrong and the food is burnt\". There was no bacon at all on the sandwhich and as you can see, the pictures I uploaded tells the story of how this kitchen is being ran. What was interesting is I asked, \"Where is the manager?\", then one employee said \"She is right here in front of you\". The manager was so docile and acted like she didnt know she was in charge. She seem like the kind of manager that is too busy trying to be friends with the employees instead of taking charge. She seem scared to correct them or supervise them. That is why they kicking out burnt food and wrong orders because there is no oversight. Please bring back the old 2015 leadership. That person ran this place with pride. He made sure employees was practicing handwashing and wearing gloves, etc. This new manager clearly acted like \"Nothing going to happen..their complaints go no where\". Someone need to come in and bring order to this place fast. I hope they do an undercover boss thingy and come in here and see for themselves how horrible that evening shift is being ran."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing  Heck yes they mess up my order but they always fix it and give me a nic e sweet treat. Extra fries? Milk shake? Free drink? Hey, no problem!  This is where I go for my fatty needs. Mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers, egg rolls, steak burritos, 2/99 cent tacos, Curley fries and milkshakes.   Come again between 11 to 2, get two bucks off another order.  Good thing I don't eat here more or I'd weight 300 pounds"}
{"text":"I call to complain, someone answers and says their introduction so quickly that I didn't catch the name. I says good morning and asks for a manager. He says he's acting manager at the time, so I ask him to repeat his name. He tells me I'm the manager at the time. Being already familiar with the service at this place I bypass the obvious deflection and ask procedure for making a complaint. He informs me to follow survey instructions on receipt which I retort that I've already done. He goes on to tell me that his manager checks the surveys daily and will respond accordingly. I double check the entire conversation repeating back to him all the information he's willing to let me leave the conversation with, ending by asking him to concur that that manager is completely unavailable.  11:15 am 7/26/14  This was a follow up to the previous nights episode which I saved the receipt from so that I could complain.  The previous night I'd went through the drive through and as I handed my daughter the milkshake it fell. I handed it back politely and asked young Daniel son to replace it and he looked at me crazy then told me he had to charge me for it. I said to him, you just saw that fall chief, you mean to tell me you don't want to replace my daughters milkshake? You could've just said no my man. Are you saying no? (Pause) he looks at me m shrugs wit the sorry bruh face. I says ok and he gives me my change then closes the window. I notices the error in this entire transaction and realize that it's completely unsatisfactory so I decide to get refunded. Still within eyeshot, he ignores my triplet horn honk 3x over the course of 50 seconds before returning to the window.   Definitely not an experience to forget thus far."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way to work.  Typical Jack in The Box pull around and wait. As we did there was a truck already in front of us waiting.  Not a problem... it just means the food is fresh and being cooked as ordered not sitting pre - cooked .  Good food ... made to order !"}
{"text":"Sundays breakfast visit to the Jack in the box on Pineville Matthews Road was a cluster screw up.  I came inside (since I've learned that  sitting for 20 minutes in a drive thru line with only 2 cars ahead of me does not start my day off in the right way. )  There were 2 other folks standing around waiting for their orders to come out when I arrived.  Once placing my order I have to admit I was expecting a wait ... perhaps even a bit of a wait since there were folks waiting.    There were at least 4 employees working.  2 on the drive thru and one on the front counter and one behind the line preparing food.  One of the employees was continually making snippety comments to another employee ... we were all hoping they were joking and not quarreling in front of us.  It was so bad - I felt uncomfortable!   Then the unthinkable happened... my order came up before the other two customers who had both been waiting for quite awhile.   I apologized to them both & did the only thing I knew to do .... run !  Thankfully I got my food ! Those other two folks may still be there waiting... Jack in the Box Pineville is a mess ..."}
{"text":"Man oh man, this is my favorite place to get a mid night snack. There are a lot of friendly asian employees here and i'm a big fan of there munchie meals. Also their Caramel Ice coffee is the bomb. Yah yee yah Jack."}
{"text":"The food is never fresh and never cooked to order and the staff are always extremely rude at this location. I can try it every couple of months in hopes that they have caught on and hired better help but it doesn't look like that is going to take place.  The guy named Axl needs to be working in a place where he doesn't have to do customer service."}
{"text":"Standing by the register for long time waiting waiting waiting (they were busy with the drive-thru) finally employee showsup just as two people walked in and cut in front of me, to my surprise this employee takes their order knowing that I was standing there for long time."}
{"text":"Horrible service,we were in line for literally more than 25 minutes,(2 cars in front of us) seriously what's taking so long,by the time we tried to order the person said hold on and I can hear her laughing and chatting in the background,so we just decided to leave and we heard she made a rude comment.  We called the manager she said she was going to call back never heard from her again. We will never return to this location,who knows what they do to the food if they're so disrespectful."}
{"text":"My husband is allergic to onions and they put everything on his sandwich. This is like the 5th time. Horrible. I hate having to live by this location"}
{"text":"Could not find the check in so I created this one. I'm not quite sure what was going on here but it was very odd.   First, there was a non English speaking family camping at a booth. Like, straight up blankets and pajamas. As I was ordering, one of the kid girls was basically leaning against my leg, asking for something but I'm not sure if she was asking me or the manager who was taking my order.   Second, this place looked like they had just endured the mother of all rushes. All, yes all, sodas were empty. The light for the shakes was on saying it was low. The bathroom was a pig sty. Paper towels overflowing the trash and all over the floor.   I should've realized something was wrong when one of the kids working there was running out when I first got there and told me someone else would be with me. He just had this desperation look like something was wrong.   Was just very odd."}
{"text":"Crew was polite, and the service was swift. I stopped in on my way to work, and didn't have to wait a crazy amount of time like at some other places."}
{"text":"Omg those biscuits in the morning are so soft, like biting into two puffy clouds with sausage, egg and cheese in between them! Yum!"}
{"text":"It's fast food, not real healthy, some what good, and it fills the void when you can 't go someplace better."}
{"text":"What can u say it's Jack in the Box in downtown phoenix. Unless you want to be overrun by homeless people begging for change inside and outside I strongly suggest using the drive thru."}
{"text":"Apparently this location didn't exist but it does, trust me. This is the closest late night restaurant by my house (besides dulce doughnuts) so I end up going here more than I should sadly. Anyways the place is usually clean and the customers are usually some what normal. At times you can get a weird crowd but mainly kids from the high school or families dining in. Recently I got coupons for a free pita so I decided to give it another shot. The pita was actually delicious, I was surprised. I enjoyed it and actually thought about getting another but I was lucky on this time around. This place is clean and the staff are quite friendly but Jack in the Box can cause some serious problems internally to you. To be honest, I only enjoy the breakfast sandwich, platter, the munchies menu and now the pita. Stay away from the tacos and 1$ chicken sandwich. Best of luck."}
{"text":"Stop by for some curly fries (craving) after work, me and my boyfriend ended up throwing up all the fries that we had... It gave me a stomach ache and right after I threw up all the fries I felt better... Maybe the oil the fry it in was very old because I tasted it.... The fries was not crunchy it seem like it was already pre-made and handed to me cause it wasn't hot and the fries once again was not crunchy it was more like soggiesh... If I could rate it 0 then I would... Never will I return nor eat fries again..."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is full of idiots now. I ordered 4 tacos no lettuce, all have lettuce and 2 had no meat, I mean how dumb can you be! Also ordered a large oreo shake, got a small one, curly fries and wanted to add cheese but had already paid, they had no way of charging for a side of cheese, wanted to refund the whole order and start over, I mean, its a tiny cup of cheese. I will definitely never be back to this one!"}
{"text":"Lol wtf is this. No cinnamon and apparently people can't count these days. Y'all need to go back to school cause even this job is too much for you!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, the lady had the nerve to be mean and nasty at the window, then we waited for so long in line, we stop being hungry, she dropped my nickel and then told me I owed her five cents,...somebody tell Jennifer to do better with her service."}
{"text":"Usually come to this jack in the box. Where else can you get 2 tacos for $1 something. It used to be $1 but everything is going up in price. Also they have a menu for $1(monster taco), $2( chicken sliders) & $3. Their chicken strips are amazing!"}
{"text":"This JITB is the worst EVER! The food is always cold or old. Their customer service sucks. Im done with this place. Ill make the trip somewhere else from now on. I really hope the manager see's these reviews. I definitely think they need new management one who actually gives a crap about the business. Guys and girls with hickies in their neck should automatically be sent home until they recover. The staff looks unprofessional (shirts arent tucked), some can barely understand english (asked for hot sauce and only received ketchup). Orders are always messed up. Moral of the story is, If the staff looks like crap and the service is crap, chances are the foods going to be crap too! Lesson learned after giving them like 50 chances."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, the place was filthy, no clean tables, dirty floor, trash can full! No lids for drinks! Asked if he would wipe table, he mumbled something (he was not busy, no one waiting) so hubby cleaned table! Nasty bucket of water sitting on front counter! So then he decided to do trash, and when done, never washed hands but handed out food! Our food was not good, potato cakes were so over cooked or refryed they were uneatable, sandwich was not made fresh, and not even warm! We will not ever visit this place again! I guess others have discovered this too as 1 car in drive thru and one other couple eating! What happened, it used to be so good!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, anytime. Jack in the box is one of my favorites! Not the best food, not by far, but good for late night. They're also good if you want something simple. Great safe area."}
{"text":"Worst service ever . Very slow . I ordered carne asada fries and litterally only 3 lil bits of carne is in the box . Very disappointed ."}
{"text":"My two stars are for the nice kid that placed my order correctly and the manager who politely gave me my refund. The missing stars are because there was one car in the drive thru and no people in the restaurant when I walked in yet tables were dirty, food was slow and when my sandwich came out it was missing the cheese. I sent it back and it came back with two cold pieces of cheese. I seriously can't tell you the last time I asked for a refund on anything because I usually take it on the chin but this was about as pitiful as I've seen of a sandwich. Moving on with my day."}
{"text":"I had to try the ghost pepper sauce chicken sandwich and it was a great choice. Not too spicy but had a ton of flavor. They do have the best curly fries around though. Also, don't get the siracha burger. It was awful."}
{"text":"Sigh, why can't Jack in the Box actually finally open up a few locations in the Chicago area, like they did until(from what I've heard) 25-30 years ago? I think they'd do great, if they ever came back.  Anyway, just got a quick bite since I couldn't decide on something to eat while inside Stratosphere, and it was good as usual. Love that you can get breakfast items all day, and that it's disappointing it took McD's until this year to finally test a (partial, unfortunately) breakfast all day menu in some San Diego locations. Ranting aside, I got 2 breakfast sandwiches that were great. Customer service from the employees was friendly, and I didn't encounter too many weirdos walking up to here during the late afternoon. I suspect it might be a different story at night, and possibly not so good to walk to at night."}
{"text":"Thanks Kevin and crew for the hospitality. I appreciated the positive demeanor and quick service. Service was superb, and I am a big fan of JITB. The dining area could have been cleaner, but it wasn't terrible. All-in-all, a great experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"This jack in the box is so pathetic i have gone back 2 times and my order is still not right i have wasted my gas to return for the right food 1 time already i get home and still messed up pay better attention i will never return to this location amd after going back in there customer service was horrible they kept my reciet after i came back the second time so on the third visit to get my money back the cashier rolled there eyes like i was being a inconvience to them"}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru guy name JOSE ( with the glasses)!!! Rude ! Aragant and just awful.  I can understand when the drive thru gets busy it can be overwhelming but you don't have to be a JERK. If you don't like your job drive thru fast food guY.....get another job!  I'm waiting at the intercom.....window down...no music on. I nerve heard a work until I hear someone say \" are you ready to order for what?\" ...... I said \" excuse me\"? ......JOSE then states he has been saying hello can I help you for the \"last 2 mins\".  I go ummm sorry I didn't anyone say anything at all, but its very rude for you to speak that way.   He then continues to argue that he knows I heard him. And I asked to speak with a manager so I can put my order in because I'm not gonna argue with him.   He says have a nice day and you don't have to order.   By this time I'm thinking what the heck is wrong with this person.   I then say you are being very rude and I understand you're busy but that's not very professional. He then rushes me through my order. And is STILL rude when I get to the window.   I have been a resturant server for a year now and I would NEVER make a guest ...rather drive thru or not ...feel the way Jose made me feel tonight. I'm not even gonna eat the food....he may have don't something with it....with his nasty attitude.   Poor service ....what a shame.    I will be calling the manager AND corporate in the morning. Just RIDICULOUS"}
{"text":"Two thumbs down fast food restaurant doesn't Have change for 100.00 during the day i can understand at night time but during the day that's ridiculous. I love jack in box but this place i give it 2 thumbs down on customer service"}
{"text":"The worst service ever! A month ago they served me a moldy biscuit and last night the manager said she wouldn't do separate orders and to move along? LOL loved her hard little attitude"}
{"text":"Yea its a review for a Jack In the Box. Why!? I always loved Jack In the Box as a kid but then they shut down. So I might be making up for lost time because I'm always going to a Jack In the Box when everything else is closed or when I just want a quick bite without the hassle.  I like this location, convenient and clean, friendly service with good late night conversations, good easy listening jams playing when dining in.  $1 any size drinks, jumbo jack, and fries always does the spot for me."}
{"text":"The service is beyond amazing but only late hours. I've dealt with the establishment during the day & I wasn't really feeling the welcomeness. But at night the food was fresh, employees are friendly & kind."}
{"text":"So here's the deal on JITB.  In the 5 years we have lived in Buckeye we have only gone through the drive thru at this location.  We have only gotten the oreo shakes.  (Little tip if you bring them home and put them in the freezer for a couple of hours they are simply awesome you eat them with a spoon)  So yesterday my wife and I decided to stop in here and get some of the food.  The service was very friendly as it always has been. The dinning room was cleanish, but for whatever reason the men's bathroom was closed.  The food honestly was not good.  A couple of cheeseburgers, an order of curly fries, a couple of tacos that I have heard people rave about, and a drink.  The meat on the burgers is obviously a frozen patty that was overcooked and dry.  The fries were ok, but the tacos were not that good, and I cannot figure out why people would rave about them.  Really aside from the occasional oreo shake I will not be returning to this place for anything else."}
{"text":"I'm well aware that Jack In The Box is by no means a purveyor of healthy and innovative culinary creations.  But unhealthy as the food may be if eaten on a daily (or even weekly) basis, I don't see much harm in occasionally succumbing to my latent junk food addiction.  Whenever I'm in the mood to throw caution to my waistline while holding tight to my wallet, JITB is invariably the first place that comes to mind--at least so long as it's been a respectable 3+ weeks since my last visit.  Setting aside the broader debate on the extent to which fast food may or may not be to blame for all that is wrong with America today, those of us who do at least occasionally frequent what I like to euphemistically term \"accelerated dining establishments\" are sometimes faced with important choices about where to fill up on empty calories.  For a number of reasons, I think JITB stands above the rest.  First, JITB serves both breakfast and lunch/dinner at all times, so if you arrive at 11:30 am in search of a breakfast sandwich, you won't be stuck getting a burger instead.  Second, JITB always seems to have new and interesting menu items.  Third, and most importantly, the Ultimate Cheeseburger is always delicious.  As for this particular location, I've been twice.  Both times, I found the employees to be the friendliest and most courteous I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant (though the people working at the KFC/A&W location on the corner of Baseline and Central are similarly deserving of praise), and everything I've tried has lived up to my memories of what JITB should taste like.  If at all possible, though, I suggest eating on-site or in the car instead of waiting until you get home, as the food is never quite the same again after those first few minutes pass."}
{"text":"Remember this is fast food. The expectations are not high, but the cleanliness of this location was amazing. Nicely decorated inside and clean. 2 stars is my normal for fast food,  but this location gets 3 stars for the cleanliness."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I have been in a Jack in the Box where it took as long as to get my order as this location the other night.  I have a sneaking suspicion that people in the restaurant are going to be taken care of after the drive thru is handled.  People that work there are nice enough.  They could spend a little money sprucing this place up.  It's looking a little worse for wear even for a Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Was going to a different fast food place, but was enticed to come here after seeing a few signs out front promising a cheap combo meal. These days, seeing deals that offer a full meal with a drink will help me to decide where to spend my money. I was able to get an All-American Jack double burger with cheese, medium fries and a medium drinks for about $6. That's a lot of food for $6. The service was ready before I was ready to order thankfully. The order did take a few minutes to arrive, but I was just happy it was all hot."}
{"text":"Order taker was rude, he cut me off before I could finish ordering. Doesn't seem to enjoy his job very much. I understand it's Sunday but, customer service is always number one. He handed ice coffee with coffee dripping from the top and no napkins. Probably worst experience here."}
{"text":"It's fast food.... Need I say more? Points for serving breakfast all day.   I only go for $1 large diet cokes."}
{"text":"Beyond slow service.... waited in  Drive-through for 25 minutes just to get shorted my food. AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST!!!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food, never had an issue and it's funny how people still complain about this Jack but still go back to it. Smh.....Keep on doing your job guys you, guys have been doing an amazing job and ignore the negative comments, because apparently they still like Jack food otherwise they wouldn't go back to it and instead they woukd take their own food from home to work.   Awesome job Jack in the box crew!"}
{"text":"I honestly like coming here the service has been beget and food as well. The only thing is so many homeless people some ate nice but some are just dangerous. Also if you guys(the others comments) are going to complain about dumb things like not being given a cup then just take your service somewhere else lol. Also if you keep on coming back and still hate the service then keep it moving  (I would if I was you)...But I came to realize is that some customers are just a**holes and they think they are better than any fast food employee. Seriously give this guy's a break. Also I don't care if whoever reads this takes it personal or gets offended but I think this Jack has a good manager and good employees, so keep up the work."}
{"text":"Why do you guys use a long stick out of the window before I pulled up on drive thru? I mean if you scratch my car are you going to fix it??  Well I came through here and to be honest the service wasn't that good. The food was not even warm. The tacos didn't have enough sauce. Like come on your phone is expensive as it is and you guys can't even give me hot fresh food. Wow well I will be taking my business to chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Jack-in-the-Box part two. Arrived at 12:05 PM and there were 11 cars in the drive thru, so I parked and walked in. Eight people waiting for their orders and two in line.   The manager, again, taking orders. As I walked to the counter, my shoes stuck to the floor. Nasty!  I ordered two burgers and two fries (a coworker was with me) and my order arrived in 15 minutes. So much for 'fast' food.   As I'm waiting, the manager yells out \"Okay, no more breaks or lunches for anyone!\".  Not professional.   On to the food: tough to screw up fries but they sat for 10 minutes waiting for the burgers. Too bad.   The burgers were okay but mine had three jalapeños on it, which was very disappointing. The other burger had plenty.   I would drive further to another Jack-in-the-Box if I were you. These guys are way too inconsistent."}
{"text":"Fast. Clean, and they give discount to professional drivers. Better than the McDonald's across the street!"}
{"text":"I feel ashamed for even writing this review. But, here it goes...  So, Christmas Day comes around and I'm waiting for a family dinner to occur that night. I hadn't done much grocery shopping during the week and therefore didn't have much to eat at home. So I did what any rational person would do. I ventured out on Christmas Day to find a bite to eat -just to hold me over until the family dinner.   Nothing was open. Man, I must have drove around for 30 minutes looking for a place that was open for business. Finally, I found this Jack just up the street from my house. It was on the other side of the freeway, which I didn't look that way the first time so I didn't see it. But, there were cars in the drive thru, meaning that I wouldn't have to wait until dinner to eat.   The drive thru gal took my order and the line went quickly. My order was flawless and hot. I appreciated that they were open on Christmas and had competent people working there. In the end, I was happy with the order and the service at this Jack. The location is a bit tough to get to from across the freeway though, but that's my only gripe with this place."}
{"text":"Great place everything was on point everything was clean and food came out to order. Really good experience.   Zack is exceptional at customer service.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Wish I would've seen reviews..... Service here sucks, it never fails! Took a coupon, she didn't know how to enter it, charges me full price, keeps my coupon and doesn't give a receipt so that I don't see that she charged me full price.... I don't mind that I paid full price but don't be shady about. Her name was Maria"}
{"text":"Stuffed Jalapenos must've been freezer burned or old. I think I've outgrown Jack in the Box. The milkshake was decent, (Real Ice Cream)"}
{"text":"I happen to run into the manager of this store when I was doing some shopping.  He is just such a personable guy even when he is not at work!.  We discussed which furniture he should buy.  The crew is a reflection of his attitude.  Even more of a reason to go to this Jack in the Box.  If he reads this, I hope the table worked out."}
{"text":"Ask for 2 vanilla milk shakes and I start to drive to see what I got was 2 cups of ice milk not a shake. Crooks is what they are wasting my time selling me a product and giving me something else. either your employee was lazy or this is a common practice of your locations. never again thru away my ice milk vanilla shake or what ever it was just awfull practice."}
{"text":"I stopped in Friday around 11:30 am for a quick lunch. I order Jumbo Jack without lettuce and received one with lettuce I could see the female putting hamburger together was mad she make Six burgers before she make mine like I order it. Customer service is not a strong value at this restaurant."}
{"text":"You know, it seems almost silly to review a single fast food place. But what the heck - life is short, the time is now, and there's nothing to lose but patience.  I'm torn on this place, which happens to be across the street from my office. The management seems very nice and friendly, and committed to good service. On the other hand, they seem to have some kind of climate control issue every time I come in. In the summer the food cooks itself, and in the winter you find yourself clinging to your icy beverage for warmth.  Foodwise, it's a Jack in the Box. Not much more need be said."}
{"text":"Wow!   I will never visit this location again,   The employees were preparing food with bare hands!   They were wiping their foreheads of sweat and then touching food,   Absolutely disgusting!  I reported it to the manager who said they would remake our food,   No Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Looks they hired some extra staff for lunch rush, drive through wait time is much improved!  Well done."}
{"text":"Breakfast platter is the best breakfast value anywhere add that good and friendly customer service and you have a winner!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, there grill is always being cleaned so they never have any food, when you order they always say it's going to be a twenty minutes wait. Never coming to this location again ."}
{"text":"The most disgusting place I've been I mean fast food is better then this nasty place never coming here again not only is there food nasty I also didn't get a recipe from the crazy lady at the drive thru"}
{"text":"I was on the way to pick up a friend from the airport and my son and I were starving, knowing it'd be a long night, figured I should feed us before we get our friends. There was no line on the drive through, my food was made on order and we were on our way.  Oh how I wish pumpkin pie milk shakes where year round."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write reviews but I couldn't resist with how god-awful of an experience I had tonight at this Crismon Location Jack in the Box. First of all, they were not busy whatsoever. They had maybe 3-4 cars in the drive through and not one single person in the dining area until me and 4 friends walked in.  Not mention it was 11:30 at night. We all ordered our food at about 11:40, total of 4 orders. One order was given to us, about 10 minutes later. After about 20 more minutes of waiting we got a little frustrated and asking about our food. They then proceeded to ask us what we ordered because they seem to have forgotten what we ordered. We waited another 20 minutes, and they then proceeded to ask us about 5 more times what we ordered. One more order came out, then like 10 minutes later  another came out. Then we received our last order with half of our order missing. We then waited about another 10-15 minutes waiting for the rest of our food. They then encountered a customer flipping out through the drive thru probably for the same reason, and they then called the cops, and put everything on hold for about 10 minutes. It was close to an hour before we finally got the rest of our food. And to top it all off, after asking for a refund for the poor quality service they denied it. Don't come here ever."}
{"text":"The attention is poor they are very slow. Today wait more than 25 minutes and attended in drive thu before the customer inside of the store. They excused themselves that they were forgotten."}
{"text":"Typical JIB. Food is always hot and served fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the ask me to \"pull around\" after taking my money. No, give me my food now or give me back my money. The looks you get after saying this is amusing, they don't know what to do, and what do you know? My food pops right out! Thank you sir may I have another"}
{"text":"Roachville...it was crawling on the counter...gross...always bums hanging out in parking lot....this place needs corporate come and fix problem come on now....roaches...omg"}
{"text":"We stopped by here after school today because we were hungry and dying of thirst due to the heat and there was no way we would make it till dinner. The food was ok....but it's Jack in the Box so I am not expecting steak house quality. The curly fries were hot and the sprite was ice cold. The service was great. The young man working the window was pleasant and efficient. We were on our way in just a matter of minutes."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful today! A young man named Nicholas was on drive through and was super pleasant! He had a big smile,recited our order back to us to make sure it was right and thanked us,wishing us a lovely day. It is rare to get this kind of service anymore. The food was hot and delicious and served promptly even though we had a special order. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Thomas made my 1st experience phenomenal. Amazing for my first time at this jack in the box location! Most restaurants including the one on Rittenhouse and Ocotillo, which is closest to my house, Have treated me like dirt and that my food doesn't matter. I stopped here out of hunger for food and found the workers great and entertaining while still being professional! Jason and Neal were also fantastic delivering my food at the window and cracked a few fast jokes and made my drive thru experience memorable! Thank you guys and keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular at this store but from time to time I'll stop by, I've been here a couple of times before and it was alright but today I came for lunch and I AM NOT IMPRESSED!!! Wow...my burger looks like it's been stepped on and the sauce is gushing out like if they squeezed the life out of it and my 5 fries they gave me are soaked in oil. 1 out of 3 isn't bad but it only takes one. A JACKed up burger and fries @jacknthebox"}
{"text":"Floor was sticky. Food was warm not hot. Service was not in any rush."}
{"text":"Overall on customer service is good but I'm giving a low star because I ordered 2 caramel coffee and the cups are so flimsy that the coffee spelled on me why are you guys getting cheap on the cups!?"}
{"text":"Worst jack in the box ever!  How the hell do you run out of French fries?  Then expects me to pay more for curly fries.  Get out of here with that bs."}
{"text":"I'm here a lot, it's right around the corner from me. The food is always correct,hot,fresh and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"So disappointing! This location is usually pretty decent, today was NOT one of their good days.  Ordered 2 Havarti & grilled onion rib eye burgers, 2 fries & a couple other items.  Both burgers were so over cooked they could be used for hockey pucks & the buns were so stale the boxes they came in probably were more pliable & had better flavor! If that wasn't bad enough, the fries were terrible. My fries had at least a third of the order so over fried as to be inedible & several were actually rancid tasting which instantly flipped my stomach leaving me feeling nauseous."}
{"text":"Dirty gross and downright nasty - even for a jack in the box. Actually, they usually aren't too bad - but this one is. My sandwich literally fell apart in my lap. Their only salvation is that the window employee was very nice. The reason i even went there was to use a coupon i had. Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Hello. I have just been horrifically treated by some lady that did not understand the word peach. if you are going to get some freestyle coke from the cool machines do not use the drive thru. She will end up asking you \"leave, I will not take your order\" idk if she has a problem with white girls or she doesn't know English. Because she hid from us when I went to the drive thru window and would take my order through the speaker. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NEVER GO TO JACK IN THE BOX. I want a free peach, raspberry lemonade!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! My very first visit to a Jack in the box and NO ONE even greeted us, not even the employee who was leaving! There was no one up front to take orders. We left and went to Sonics next door for our dinner!!"}
{"text":"You suck you suck you suck  I got to get a shake for my father who is sick very sick and a medium fry for my self to go with a samwhich from Arbys because their shakes are down and i dont like their frys and your frys and not even fresh 6.00 for a med fry and a regular vanilla shake and the frys have been sitting for i wonder how long  Thank uou for taking my money so i can throw your crappy frys in the trash  Thank you"}
{"text":"I just threw up a little hearing the name \"jack in the box\".  Hope you are ready for some food poisoning."}
{"text":"One of the better Jack in the Boxes.  They don't overcook their eggs in the morning."}
{"text":"If you want to get sick for several days,  this is the place to go. We stopped here last Monday, and I had a fever that same night.  Thanks Jack in the box for getting me sick"}
{"text":"Been sitting in this drive through for at least 20 minutes behind only ONE car. Talk about slow service..wow"}
{"text":"I have been surprised over the years on how hard Jack in the Box has tried to improve their image.  The food is good and for the most part the workers are very friendly and helpful.  I don't know where they fit in relative to the fast food wars, but they are definitely moved up the ladder.  Now, if they can bring back the larger Taco for $1.00...  A+ for effort and execution, Jack!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Went to jack in the box at a prime time 7pm, want to notate the time to make sure no one thinks I went at like 11pm expecting good service. Anywho, went there and ordered my food and when I got to the drive thru window the chick at the window asked me to back up and drive forward to reset the timer. Wtf? So I did. We waited a pretty decently long time for the food, got home and realized that all the food was literally just thrown into the bag, fries were all over the bag and none actually inside the fries container, not to mention the quantity of fries actually given when we put them back in the container was a small when we actually ordered a large. To top off this AMAZING experience, ALL the food was cold. So thanks Jack in the Box, I WON'T be returning."}
{"text":"This is the worst Jack PERIOD. They charge you for things you want done to your order then they dont do it. They take forever to make the food so why are my orders always wrong. And I mean EVERY SINGLE TIME. Ill be calling corporate later today."}
{"text":"Came thru the drive thru, Samira was so nice. The cooks messed up my order, because on the receipt it was rang up perfectly. She was kind to make it the way I wanted, personally. It was perfect and she was very quick. It was so busy! And she managed to keep claim and help. Will definitely be back! Thank you"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service!!! Bad attitude rude BH there yesterday at 6:30pm!! Thank goodness we don't live near this location! I would go off on the corporate office!!"}
{"text":"On Feb 13, 2016, Jack in the Box texted me a coupon for a free hamburger as a part of their million burger give away.  The coupon and coupon code expired on the 15th.  I went to the 2330 East Baseline location, showed them the coupon and coupon code for a free hamburger.  The shift super told me that they could not accept tcoupon unless I went and got it printed out.  She said she required this so I could not get more than one free burger.  I pointed out that her employer sent the coupon and the coupon redemption code to my phone and that they expected their customers to use the coupon that way.  Besides I told her, if I really wanted to \"cheat\" her employer, I could have printed out 20 coupons and redeemed them at the numerous Jack in the Box locations in Phoenix.  The little \"hitler\" still insisted on her arbitrary self-made policy.  I left and drove to the Jack in the Box at 24th St and Van Buren where they gladly accepted the cell phone coupon with no fuss or incident.  There is no need tfor me to give any of my business to the Jack in the Box location at 2330 East Baseline where their employees have no clue as to their company's policies and promotions.  Obviously, the managers and district manager are incompetent to unleash ignorant and mini-hitlers on their customers.  AVOID THIS LOCATION IF POSSIBLE.  There are many, many other food options in the area where they want your business and care about their customers, unlike the Poorly run Jack in the Box at 24th St and Baseline."}
{"text":"I pulled into the drive thru at 7:20 pm. I ordered the breakfast platter. I'm told over the speaker \"we can't make that because the grill is being cleaned\". I ask \"so you're not going to make that?\"  I'm told \"no. The grill is being cleaned\". I left. The chik fila at the arboretum has a line wrapped around it. They are interested in taking care of their guests. Jack In the Box doesn't want to take care of guests. They don't care. My daughter wanted the breakfast platter. It was her favorite. It was for her. She won't be getting anymore from Jack In the Box. I will spread this experience far and wide across the landscape of the internet and personal acquaintances. I will make sure both friend and foe know not to come to your locations in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Crappy service.  Employees are inarticulate and moronic.  Doesn't know the menu or prices.  I wrote a complaint to HQ about this franchise and got nothing; not even an acknowledgement.  Don't frequent JIB, they are not worthy of your hard earned money."}
{"text":"So...JIB is a fast food joint that prides itself on highly processed food with an outrageous caloric content...  But, when it's the only place open within a 5 mile radius at 2am and you have slightly inebriated friends who are hungry, choices become extremely limited.  Open at 2am? Yes. Fast Drive-Thru? Yep. 3 cars = 5 minutes.   And you know what, working in fast food is a thankless job, so if you can work the 2am shift and do it with a smile and use thank you and please and can make jokes, I commend you. The lady working the drive thru was very pleasant - I was surprised.   Anyways, anything could have been in the space of land and as long as it was open we would have gone for the drive thru."}
{"text":"They always do custom orders to meet our \"no carb\" diets we have been working on ;)  Two eggs and Two sausage patties for breakfast!"}
{"text":"You know this place would be very beneficial and profitable if they learn about public relations they don't give you much fries and a three dollar Asada deal they barely gave you three pieces of meat more like a teaspoon of it I went to anotherJack-in-the-Box and at least they make it to where you want to eat it and they smothering it poor service"}
{"text":"This time service was a lot better and restaurant was a lot cleaner. Only problem is there are still beggars outside. Got home with my order and my order was messed up again. Asked for no mayo and of course they put a lot of mayo and no ketchup."}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on with this restaurant but every time I go they mess up my order. I ordered a burger only ketchup and it had the works on it. Most the times they give me the wrong  items. Management needs to step up and make sure there people are doing the orders right."}
{"text":"BEST Jack In The Box!  Ordered drive-thru first thing in the morning after arriving in Vegas from an all night drive from San Diego. I always special order. My order was handed to me fast, fresh and accurate. Juacquin was cheerful and happy to serve despite the morning rush. Wish all Jack In The Box were this quick and accurate. Thanks Juacquin!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-through at the Jack-in-the-Box and The cashier was very friendly nice young man the food was hot and fresh tasting and the fries were hot which is something you don't always get at the drive-through I will return."}
{"text":"Not even 1 star let me start off by saying I loved Jack in the box but now I'm really grossed out by my experience there. I walked into the bathroom to wash my hands and it smelled really bad and it was very dirty! Then I went to order my food the cashier was really rude. As I looked around I noticed there was food on the floor all the tables were dirty and everything just looked gross. My food came out cold everything tasted like it was not even prepared. Through it all away idk how that place is open. Just want to say I'll never go back"}
{"text":"Its clean its fast its good food that wont break the bank :)"}
{"text":"Didn't give us a receipt OR our  jalapeno poppers, and there were literally only 2 curly fries in my bag. A combo is cheap, but I literally wasted my money driving to get 2 fries & zero poppers. No wonder this place had a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Ok so I know it's fast food but you have got to be kidding me! Check out my pics. These people put cut up American sliced cheese on my monster tacos! The owner should do us all a favor and fall on his sword. What an idiot. You have to go all the way to the top to place blame on this kind of crap. I have some cheese for you dirtbag! From unda cheese!"}
{"text":"Usually, I enjoy jack in the box. I eat at this location often, but after today's experience I don't think i'll be going to this particular location again.          On May 19th I received an email from jack in the box, describing a promotion where you could buy one buttery jack and get another buttery jack free. I placed my order at the drive through, and pulled forward to the window.  At the window they told me that they couldn't accept the coupon because it was on my phone, even though it says explicitly at the bottom of the email, that all I had to do was show the cashier the email. (image attached) I asked what I could do for them to accept the coupon (print it out?), and they couldn't provide an answer. I decided this was a lost cause and paid full price for the meal. the team member handed me the to-go bag and asked me if i wanted any sauces, I replied that i would like ketchup, she then proceeded to hand me 6 packets of taco sauce. by this time i had realized how much of a mistake I had made to come get lunch at this location. Also the fries were beyond old, and the team members were giving me attitude the entire time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed both the service and the quality of the food. I came here and got some chicken tenders, fries and a drink. The woman was very kind and straightforward, I didn't end up waiting too long, and the food was FRESH and delicious! I am glad I have found a place to enjoy a quick, freshly made fast-food meal."}
{"text":"Literally the worst customer service ever! I've been to many jack in the boxes and this has to be the worst! The woman that helped me out at the drive thru was rushing me to order, put a stick out the window so I would not pull up and then when I asked for ranch, she just said don't have any and gave me my card and walked away. I do not recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever . I went through  drive thru and the were so rude took them forever to take my order and their was only 2 cars ahead of me and I would never go back ever again"}
{"text":"I eat there all the time and have had no problems at all I always get the sourdough chicken grilled sandwich and if there were more stars it would be done"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's a Jack in the Box - I'm not exactly expecting Alton Brown to be flipping burgers.  However, this specific Jack in the Box seems to constantly be running in slow motion.  Since they are open 24/7, it's a great late night drive through spot, and most of my experience is with the drive through.  I don't think that I have ever waited for less than 10-15 minutes from ordering to getting my food.  Even if there are cars in front of me in line, I still end up sitting at the window for at least 5 minutes.  It's like the staff there runs in slow motion.  Of course, when you do get it, the food is hot, which is one of the reasons I keep going back.  I would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy.  Even going inside is like entering a time warp.  The last time I went inside, I waited for 15 minutes before my order was taken.  There was one other customer inside the restaurant.  I then waited for another 10 for my value meal.  At once point a server did offer me a free shake for the wait, but by that time I was almost done eating, and really didn't have another 15 minutes to spare for them to make the shake.  As far as Jack in the Box's go, this one is pretty sad, but they are saved by being about the only 24/7 drive through in this area."}
{"text":"We were in the drive thru over 30 minutes.  I would have left but there were cars behind us.  We only came for a shake.  Next time McDonald's at least they get you thru the line quickly."}
{"text":"One of the worst burgers I've ever had, cold fries and flat soda. The burger bun was stale cheese was sitting out for a day and hard as a rock. What ever happened to taking pride in your job and not giving a crap take over. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Jack and the box, one of my favorite places to eat. Up  Till now. Two bad experience with the same thing.  French fries, curly fries. The first time went to the drive thru, second time, I decided I would go in side.  Thinking I would get fresh fries. But no, wait !!  Served from the same manager. I called, made a complaint. They said they would  Talk to him about it. I go back same manager,  Same bad service. So I take the food back ask for  A refund. I asked him would he eat these fries.  He looked at them and said no. He than said  Sorry. Given my money back. Then he says You can have soda. I said no thanks !! I really wanted to  Eat some jack and the box. That day, I had to settle  For (Burger King). But got fresh fries $$"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Takes forever to get your order and it is fucked up. The soda machine is out of coke and dr pepper. This place is run by retards."}
{"text":"These 5 stars are for dude who took my order. He didn't hear me say plain, but with no hesitation & a smile on his face, he changed it quick. He looked like he was the only one that actually cared about us. I over heard him saying that no one was helping him but still he gave amazing customer service. He was a young, Hispanic gentleman & I just wish I knew his name! Keep him!!"}
{"text":"I love Jack in the Box! It is my favorite fast food ever!  Their chicken sandwiches and hamburgers are just amazing! The seasoning is so good and you can't find it anywhere else.  Their staff is friendly and very efficient. I went there to grab a quick bite and ended up ordering a teriyaki bowl. The bowl was way better than I expected, just the right amount of food and great flavor! In my opinion is the best fast food place in town!"}
{"text":"The employees are great here. Great customer service. My biggest complaint is the manager she is never on time. She over works employees and needs a lot of training for herself."}
{"text":"I love their food quality and the price is great. I always get the Big Cheeseburger and two tacos. I love it. The managers are great!"}
{"text":"What can I say... Well they are very busy at this particular Jack-in-the-Box! I frequent Jacks all of the time. I love their Big Cheeseburger for $1.29 and their free tacos when you purchase with the receipt! I always get it the same way, all of the time! I asked for them to add tomatoes and they were going to charge me extra for it. I said \"No\" and asked if they were a franchise. No other Jacks will charge for an add item. That is one reason why I pick Jack! Of course they were a franchise. I was fine with that then I told them to only add chipotle sauce and left it at that. It took forever to get my order. When I got the food I ran out the door. When I got to my destination I looked at my burgers and they were both plain except for one which had mayo and ketchup on it and NO Chipotle Sauce as requested. I tied calling back to complain but the phone rang and rang and finally switched me over to their fax machine. I plan on requesting the correct order when I go back there this afternoon. This is the second time I have been to this particular store. I went there over six months ago and had a problem with their kiosk that you can order from. It didn't give me my change back and I complained to the manager. She was not going to give me my money back and I complained and told her to run the video and she finally just gave me the change from the register. She made me look like an idiot and liar. I vowed never to go back there again, but unfortunately my wife and I were hungry and did not feel like eating at McDonalds. I will go back to get my order correct this afternoon and after that will not return to that store again or any of the same franchises..."}
{"text":"Maybe because it was NYE but workers were friendly. It's connected to a convenience store that also has a few slots and a gas station too. There's a lot of cars going in and out of the parking lot.  In general I think Jack In The Box is decent but this location was slightly disappointing because the fries were not warm and soft when I received it...they were room temperature and kind of crunchy."}
{"text":"So the entire point of fast food is supposed to be that it is quick and easy right? Not so much the case at this particular chain location. I have been here twice now. The first time was just for the drive through and all I order was a shake. After placing my order I waited in line for the cars in front of me to get their food for more than 10 minutes. While the cashier apologized for my wait, I then personally waited at the drive thru window for over 5 minutes while he made my one shake. Not really sure what that was all about. More recently I went inside and was the only person in the restaurant. It took more than 5 minutes to get my food too, and the employees spent a lot of time joking around with each other while I stood there just waiting and watching. They then realized they didn't have any curly fries made and I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for those. Food is eh, though the shake was good, service was HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Not very good manner of manager or head and crew in here.  We just ate breakfast. We ordered meal 21 and 22. I told them my 22 meal doesnt have the sausage.  They said they will bring it out again. It took some time and husband get it and they gave 21 sandwich which she said i ordered.  I said i got the 21 but the 22 doesnt have the sausage.  They are not even sorry for making mistake and giving a mean look as she hand the sausage sandwich.  I mean, they are the one who made mistake...a sorry will do.  Giving a mean look as if we are bothering them is too much. Very bad customer service....will never order again here!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here 2 times in a row now. Every time there are long lines. They are understaffed. And the food here every time I ate here makes me sick. I don't know if it's just this location. Or Jack in Box in general. The staff is very unfriendly. And do not want to explain what is on their menu items. If I could I would put no stars due to customer service. And the lack of respect that they show their customers."}
{"text":"Always something wrong with being able to order what I want. Frier not working or system is restarting. Don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The worst place ever. Employees yelling at each other. Service was terrible. Had to wait 15 mins to get my food. This happens every time I come here. Never coming back"}
{"text":"It's $0.99 tacos, come on people, if you expect gourmet, this isn't the place. I go here for quick food and the fact that's it super cheap is a great bonus. Love their egg rolls, jalapeño poppers and tacos. Service is surprising good, people seem to care and always seem to have a smile."}
{"text":"I decided to stop for a breakfast sandwich combo this morning only to end up throwing up less than an hour later.  I order the #24 a bacon, egg, ham croissant combo with orange juice.  I left a message for management but have yet to hear back from them.  Needless to say my morning is off and my stomach aches now. Be wary!"}
{"text":"Its always something when i come here. The staff is extremely slow EVERYTIME i come here. Today the grill is out of order, u specialize in burgers, but u dont have any??????? Then the manager tries to over talk me and rush me out of line, because we could only order fried foods. Last but not least, they still got my order wrong!"}
{"text":"Had a combo for breakfast this morning.  Food was good & hot, order was correct, service through drive through was friendly... Not much to complain about, good job Adel F. and crew... God Bless... Todd"}
{"text":"We found out last night that the Buy One Get One coupons are not that good of a deal. We ordered two ultimate cheeseburgers, two medium curly fries and one medium soda. An ultimate cheese burger combo comes with a medium fry & a medium drink at $8.59. So we ordered an extra curly fry & an extra burger. The total was $16.76. My wife ordered as I was standing by waiting. I didn't think the basic NUMBERS of it all made sense. I complained and the flustered young lady went and got some other lady who said that there NOTHING they could do. So this $8.59 combo is being charged at $12.17 because we want to use a buy one get one free coupon. The total should have been $13.17 which is $8.59 + curly fry upcharge of 30 cents + $3.19 curly fry = $12.08 & $1.09 tax for $13.17 INSTEAD we were charged $6.69 + $6.69 - $6.69 + $6.38 (2-medium curly fries) + $2.29 = $15.36 + $1.40 tax for $16.76. NOWHERE in the E-mail or on the coupon does it state that this is A LA CART ONLY. It has NEVER been an issue in the past. So, the BoGo coupon really isn't for a free burger at all! It's for some sliver of a remittance that will deem you should get!! Food wasn't bad though."}
{"text":"I've said before that Jack in the Box is one of my favorites fast food restaurants, which is true! This time my husband and I were not lucky, we got there and the place was so smoky you barely could see!!! We decided to order anyways because we were hungry. I started coughing like crazy because the smoke. I don't know if their vent was broken or if they burnt something but the place was a mess. Even the cashier barely could take the smoke. Btw the staff was super nice and the food good as always but I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The first few times I went to this location I didn't receive some of the food that was on my order but didn't realism it until I got home . From then on I check my food from this location before I leave and they always forget something. Just went today and ordered 10 mini churros and they gave me half even though the screen said it was a full order. Maybe they just need to train the staff better"}
{"text":"Post a big night out, there's something so magical about being able to pull up through a drive through and leave with a customizable egg sandwich!  That's truly the reason why I LOVE JACK IN THE BOX!  I like to get the Breakfast Jack ($0.99) (available 24/7) with 2 extra eggs ($0.49/extra egg) and no meat.    PARTING THOUGHT:  Throw in some mini churros (5 for $1) and you have delicious hangover insurance for just $3.25!"}
{"text":"After receiving my order I ask for ranch and the guy acted like he put some in the bag but he didn't. I park my car to check if my order is right and of course they didn't so I go in to ask for ranch and to get my correct order. Mean while the guy taking the orders was talking about pitos which means dicks in Spanish. I don't know his name but he works night time. I felt so uncomfortable because my daughters heard them. Never again"}
{"text":"I went to drive through today and as I was driving off I checked the bag and noticed I was missing a couple items, so I went back in to retrieve  those items, which took another 30 minutes. When I arrived at my destination I realize that items are still missing. I'm very disappointed at the fact that they had to fix my order one time and the second time it was still incorrect."}
{"text":"I tried this location because it was close to work. I will not be back. I have been to Jack in the Box several times at the location near my home which always has good customer service and fresh made food. Here, I wasn't even asked if I wanted cream or sugar for my coffee. I asked for cream but after I left, I realized I didn't get a stir stick. Gee thanks. On top of that, both my hashbrown and breakfast sandwich were cold. At least I had access to a microwave."}
{"text":"Clouded judgment on the way home from a night out led me here.  I had a giftcard. so I figured why not?    A couple hours later I had a conversation with \"Ralph\" on the big porcelain telephone  that gave a couple answers to \"why not\".  Ugh.  Maybe I deserved to be punished."}
{"text":"I've given this place 2 chances the shift leader or manager whatever the heck he was was just the rudest !! Just straight disrespectful and was just if he hated his job  But  litterally worst place if you can ignore this jack do it!!!! Go to the one down the street on 35 ave Thunderbird"}
{"text":"Food was not its best but my old coworker works here and she the shit !!! So ill give it 3 stars"}
{"text":"Went through Drive-Thru, \"ERIKA\" claims they had no tortillas, so I ordered a 4 Breakfast Jacks instead. They came with no ham, but BACON instead, and NO RECEIPT WAS GIVEN.. WAS CHARGED over $7 ! Since when does a Breakfast Jack go over $1.50 ??? If I had wanted a Breakfast Jack with bacon I would have asked for that instead. Clearly very upset and will not return to this Jack In The Box location, ever again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent grub (I can't, in good conscience, call J-in-the-B food) - They've got a value menu, teriyaki bowls, tacos, pitas, burgers... really an entire tableau of global cuisine.   My chicken sandwich was crispy, and the lettuce was a nice touch. A cute reminder that I should have just eaten a salad.   It's a Jack in the Box. You know what you're getting into."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my food. Tacos were so greasy that when I picked it up by the wrapper..the wrapper ripped.  My curly fries were the bottom of the bag pieces."}
{"text":"I know it's not fair that I am putting 1 star and I didn't even order \"food\". Out side of the store is very gross. There was a dead bird without head, trashes and nasty smell drink machine... Very disgusting. I definitely want health inspector to take a great look at the store."}
{"text":"0 stars  By far the nastiest dirtiest Jack in the box I've been to in my life, I will never come back to this dirty place, nobody has time to clean tables, sweep floors etc.. Restrooms are disgusting and smell very bad like a sewer.. Soda machines full of left over spilled soda and no worker shows any interest to keep there work area clean. Won't be coming back here again, drive to the next jack in the box."}
{"text":"Consistant food and the take out like is fast. Right off the 215 which makes for easy grab and go."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! I took my Dad(a marine vet) and my son here last night. First of all they were changing shifts(that's fine absolutely normal) but their were 3 workers who were already clocked in and not doing anything! We decided to wait for a worker to clock in (the only one who spoke with us)!So I took my son to the restroom. When I got back my Dad looked PISSED! He said we're leaving I said okay and asked what was wrong. My Dad let me know that the cashier who we were waiting on asked the 3 workers that were clocked in if they got my Dad order yet and they said \"No, we didn't serve him\" with a snarky attitude as if they ever would! The cashier we we're waiting on continuously apologized and asked us to stay, but he said he would understand if we left.   My Dad risked his LIFE for this country! And to turn around and be treated like shit!!! I will NEVER GO BACK HERE!  Long story short, they were racist and rude! I definitely went back after I put my son and my Dad in the car and told them about themselves. And a customer that walked in while I was putting my son in the car left out with me after she heard what happened! Racism will get you know where! ESPECIALLY in customer service!   #HighlyDisapointed"}
{"text":"This location is trash. Once gave them 5 stars. But tonight a male employee named Mark was beyond disrespectful. He literally looks like a monster and had the nerve to flirt with customers, wasting people who were waiting's time. But I guess some people will do anything to \"feel\" important, even suck at their already crappy job. Then I asked for a manager he claimed no one was their till the morning to help me. A lie. I had already called and the woman told me to come in the store at that time to get my refund. Mark continued to make disrespectful remarks and I began to record him. And he threatened to physically harm me. He said I had one more time to point my phone at him or else. Well I got it on video. This location is trash, like the food that is served here. Will never return. Ewww."}
{"text":"I know a yelp review for Jack in the Crack won't go anywhere & their management team probably doesn't care. But holy crap I have never gotten such terrible & rude service!! Tall white guy, not sure of his name, was SOO rude. Very short. Abrupt and unhelpful. Had us pull around to the front for our food, came out & we asked for ketchup/ranch and quickly said \"it's in there\"and bolted... checked, nothing. & when we yelled out to tell him he gave us a rude \"thumbs up\" and kept walking. Drove back through for it and he was just as rude as before. I don't care if this is fast food, this guy gets paid to do this!! Not to mention, I take a bite of my sandwich, COLD. Nasty & I will never go back to jack in the box for my late night food needs. Went to Taco Bell after & had awesome service and hot food!!"}
{"text":"Done with JITB altogether after this visit. 20 mins to get through the drive thru. We only went there because it was our only late night option so we weren't stoked in the first place. The service was mediocre at best and the food was a joke. Not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"The staff at this jack in the box is always sooo friendly and t here food is always nice and hot! love this one"}
{"text":"Jack in the Box is the go to place after a long Night! With their insanely cheap food and being open 24/7 It is the go to spot when hunger strikes. They also have wonderful customer service and greet everyone with a smile :)"}
{"text":"I come here regularly for my work lunch, when no one is there service is fine, but as soon as more than four people show up expect things to fall apart. Service seems to fall and the time it takes to get your food honestly seems to double. It also bothers me that they seem to prioritize drive thru over dine in. I can watch multiple cars come after me but get their food before I do. Just because I want to dine in does not mean time is not as valuable (I get a 30 minute lunch).    Usually I just let this slide, it's an inconvenience but nothing I'd take my time to complain about. The difference this time is I went in and saw a bunch of people waiting for their orders ( maybe 4 waiting, 5 others eating and one car in the drive thru). There is a guy waiting for his food by the counter, so I off set behind him so I'm in front of the register. It takes him a while to get his food and even then they forgot an item. He walks off and I step closer to the register to place my order. I stood there for maybe 3-4 minutes without any sort of acknowledgment. By that point I just left."}
{"text":"I'm not proud.  No, I mean I'm really not proud. This was the culmination of some last minute (non)planning and some wicked weather and all kinds of things that led me to the doors of Jack in the Box. So while Mother Nature has some blame here, and a long road trip and the amount of gas in my car can certainly shoulder a little bit of responsibility, ultimately I'm the one who decided to put lips to the food.  That's maybe a bit dramatic. First, the food was fine. Not great. But fine. A chicken sandwich. That's not too terrible. And just a small fry, which seems like the right choice, with a small drink. I barely remember it, which is, after all what fast food joints like JITB are all about: cranking out your food. I got it quickly (almost too quickly.. but not complaints here) and sat inside and ate it before venturing back out into the driving rain.  You see, I was just passing through town and had to stop for fuel. Traffic had been nasty and I'd hoped to get all the way to St. George, Utah, where I know the local spots a bit better. But between the driving rain and the construction, I get behind. When the fuel indicator got down to E, I knew LV was the stop and resigned to grabbing the quickest gasoline and food I could find. I had to pack in the food, because as I sat fueling and contemplating my move, it occurred to me that the rain wasn't going to let up, and once I crossed into Utah it would start turning to snow. So I was going to have to go as fast as possible to stay ahead of it, and wouldn't be stopping to spend the night nor eating a local, unique meal, nor just snacking from the car. Order the sandwich, eat the fries, drink the drink. Be done. Be grateful for the convenience, and the efficient service, chalk up another victory to fast food."}
{"text":"The detest burger EVER!!!! The 2 stars is for the fries and service. My a first and last visit."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Jack in the box. But really not anymore. Some bad customer service from my last visit and up till now today And went inside as well and bathrooms were beyond gross."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave zero stars.  Ugh every time I go there,  the mess something up.  They really know how to screw up the simplest orders. The cashiers are not friendly, or competent. When you try to call their number to complain, you don't get an answer. This location was the replacement of the one on 7th street and Indian school because they sucked so bad,  but it looks like I'll just stop having it all together."}
{"text":"Thank you for not putting ANY taco sauce in my bag FULL of tacos you can imagine how pleased I was when I got home and was expecting that maybe they were in the bottom of the bag.... tapito it is..#THIS WOULD OF NEVER HAPPENED AT DEL TACO"}
{"text":"To worried about talking to there friends in Spanish to take your order.. I used to like this place now I just feel uncomfortable walking in"}
{"text":"Since this is the closest Jack N Box to me, I sure am glad they do a great job! Food is always fresh and made pretty quick compared to other JNB! I really like the Strawberry Smoothies and the way my car is made, the small cup sits below the rim of my cup holder making it impossible to get the cup out with out making a mess, but they always accommodate me and make a small smoothie but put it in the large cup! Glad to have this fast food place close to me!"}
{"text":"JACK and THE BOX OWNERS HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH A TOWING COMPANY Buy food here and watch your car disappear to a dark fenced in dangerous towing yard in phoenix. Don't park here. ever. had receipts for food at time of towing they wher 2 minutes difference. Still tried to con 200 dollar for of me for towing.. Got the cops and got my car back for 0.00. AS for jack and box food. That also get one star. I wondered why the parking lot for this place had no cars parked. Thier con job is BLOWN right here!"}
{"text":"Their 10 pc chicken nuggets are so good definitely recommend. I come every 2 weeks or so (oops) and I have only had one bad experience and that was with the curly fries tasting weird. I recommend because it's very affordable and good food"}
{"text":"My chicken was undercooked and was onion filled in my chicken fajita pita made me not to ever get one again thanks a lot"}
{"text":"Love the new chicken breakfast sandwich. Sorry I posted a pick of a mess in the back of the store, but that was not this location. It was the Ray red store in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So I stop in today to get my usual tacos and guess what they are out of lettuce so instead this time they use hamburger lettuce not even cut up or diced what a sad establishment! !!"}
{"text":"very nice customer service. I order a sandwich and they accidentally make a wrong one. But without any problems they make the one i want it. and they let me have the wrong order.  Food was really fresh and tasty.   :))))))))))"}
{"text":"Woooooow WTF.... So I came through here around 3:50am and go up to the box, the guy says their system is updating and it will be done at 4:10. So I leave and go to another Jack in Box close by. (another bad experience, btw) Anyways, I end up coming back because the other location was straight abandoned. So it's now 4:17 and go back up to the box. The guy says we are still updating, will take a few more mins. I resolve to just sit at the box and wait these few mins. But no. Guy comes back and tells me to move, park over somewhere else and they'll come out and tell us when they're ready. Okaaaay. So I do as they say. 10mins go by, no one came out. Another car drives up to the box, and SURE ENOUGH we hear \"Welcome to Jack in the Box, how may I help you\" and takes the order. How rude. Heard laughing and general unprofessional-ness throughout that order. Sick of everything, I just get in line behind them and order. Took FOREVER once we're waiting for the food. And they messed up the person in front's order, they were handing bags back and forth for a while. I mean, c'mon."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru right now at 3:55am. Sat at the menu screen/box for like 5 mins, no answer. Drove up to the window, sat there for like another few mins, no one in sight. Inside the store there was food all over the tables.  Side note: this was after I went through another Jack in the Box in the area that couldn't take orders for another 25 mins because their system was updating."}
{"text":"Great to have something new in town. We have been here a few times and had great service. The staff is friendly and helpful every time. The food seems smaller then I remember but that's how things are in this new age of greed and oh my god fast food made me fat. Over all the food is good quality and put together well."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the service that I got from Sheila. The fastest I've ever gotten through this drive-through hands-down! Her customer service skills are impeccable. She's professional and she makes you feel like there is a sense of urgency and there was. She's too good for this place. Jack-in-the-Box I suggest you do whatever it takes to keep her. You're awesome Sheila!"}
{"text":"I should have known better due to this location. But time was restricting me to travel elsewhere. FLIES everywhere. Seriously the worst. Disgusting. Oddly enough the food was good but if there are flies in the dining room I don't want to even imagine what the kitchen looks like. Won't return again. 2 stars for good food and freshness. But the flies ruined my eating experience."}
{"text":"Came here at 8pm on a Friday night. The service was great and it wasn't packed or crowded. The restaurant was super clean. Like way cleaner than any other fast food restaurant. As based on the other reviews, I didn't have a bad experience with service and had quite the opposite experience. Quiche the cashier was quick and efficient and spoke clearly. She got my order and I paid in less than 30sec. I mean what else can you ask for?? Then while my friends and I waited for our sourdough Jack, buttery Jack, home style ranch chicken, chipotle chicken sandwich. We got drinks at the custom Coca Cola machine with more than 20+ drink combos. Fun fun fun!  And Ang3L- food distributor-as per lack of better words called our order and gave us as many sauces as we wanted. Great experience.  I can see how people would say it was divey and sketchy but it is in a good area!! Drive thru is open  24hour and the dining area is open until 12 midnight. I mean come on people this is fast food! The only reason I couldn't give it a perfect fast food experience is because they didn't give us ANY napkins!"}
{"text":"This Jack in The Box always on point food always right great attitude from staff. The place is clean bathrooms well kept."}
{"text":"One of the only 24 hour spots to grab something to eat in the area. I've never came here late night and then not have been open. I've been here many times before, however tonight I had it delivered. I'm just happy I'm fed and can go to sleep with a full belly. While I didn't order it tonight, I love their bacon ranch tacos. Also the Franks red hot dipping sauce that comes with nuggets is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times both Dine in and Drive Thru.  Order accuracy and speed are always superb for the Drive Thru.  The location tend s to be very busy for lunch so sometimes your ticket times will be slightly higher.  I must say that if you chose to dine in, this is a great place to people watch.  you get all kinds of crazies wondering around on both the inside and out.  They have a bar and high stool type set up along the front windows which will give you the best view of people looking for cigarette butts or cans in the trash can.  To the crazy guy in the pink halter top and wild stretchy pants...ROCK ON!!!  On the day I went the drink station ice chute was practically dangling from the soda fountain and creating a leaking slimey mess everywhere.  I do not think this is a health department issue but definitely a lawsuit waiting to happen in the LV.    Food was decent for Jack in the \"Crack\" this location will put the emphasis on the \"CrackHead\". Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Location is in an area that's a bit run down, but food and service were great. There was a bit of confusion over my order (my fault, not theirs) and they happily swapped out what I'd gotten for what I wanted even though my new choice was more than twice the price.  Also, they have a groovy order kiosk where you can order in an online fashion if the counter lines are long."}
{"text":"Disgusting food and management! We had an issue that could of been easily taken care of but the manager chose to be rude an unprofessional and would not even tell us what his name was. Apparently this type of service is a learned activity as we have been leaving messages with the Stein ownership group without returned calls. We will not be eating at this Jack in the Box or any other locations until this is resolved. The food we received was cold and sloppy and made wrong. The bread was to be toasted and wasn't, virtually no chicken and rude people."}
{"text":"I go there often for breakfast cause I have to be at work at 5 am. Usually I swing by around 4-4:15 am before I head off to work. I've never had a problem there but this morning when I went through the drive thru the only person working tells me she can't take my order. When I asked why that is she said she can't take my order right now. To me it sounded like the worker there I just lazy and didn't feel like cooking or serving a paying customer. I won't be going back to that Jack in the box that's for sure. Based of these other reviews sounds like corporate needs to go through there and clean out the staff and replace everyone."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and got a couple of shakes. It was 6pm on a Tuesday Both were chalky and powdery. Not sure if they had been sitting too long in the machine but after tasting each other's we decided to dump them and have wine for dinner."}
{"text":"fast +cheap if you order the right thing + open late + makes goofy commercials  = Jack in the Box"}
{"text":"All my food was wrong and ice cold. The website makes it impossible to complain and no one answers the phone when I call. I didn't even special order anything, So upset"}
{"text":"We came here after a night out for q quick bite and the service was horrible! The guy at the register seemed more interested in gossiping with his friends than taking our order. when he did get our order, it was \"what is it?\"   Good was good, we got the 2/$1.00 tacos and curly fries but other than that nothing big. The place was clean though but just the horrible customer service was very unnecessary."}
{"text":"This location has always gave me problems with a few things.  Customer service was always been the main issue.  Reached out to them via email to help them understand the kind of employees representing their establishment.  Things I have encountered at this location, rude service and it was from different cashiers from different times of day, given wrong orders, and charged wrong."}
{"text":"My go to Jack in the Crack for soaking up the booze late night or munchies for that matter.  You can never go wrong with a cheese burger and fry.  Jack is constantly coming up with different and unique sandwiches so the menu does not get tired.  They always have the top sellers but it's nice to try new taste offering's.    Another great thing about Jack, is that they serve breakfast ALL DAY! Not til 1030 only unlike the other chains.  Oh yeah don't even try to order breakfast at 10:32 because you just won't receive it.    The one thing at this Jack that I cannot wrap my head around is that they have a fire place that can be visible from both the inside and out.  I cannot imagine them doing a Fireside chat at Jack in the Box.??? If we lived in Colorado or Montana I could understand, but this is Vegas. Why does any one need a fire place.   This location is always quick to take care of the guest and food comes out hot.  Thanks for the consistency."}
{"text":"I still order around 2 times per week and still get club salad with crispy chicken.  They have been messing up my salad a lot recently. Wrong salad, wrong dressing or just a couple hours ago... gave me a southwest salad which I gave back and then made my salad with a SPICY  chicken that was obviously ripped in half.  Ugh.  I just want some lettuce with bacon bits, crispy chicken and ranch.  Is that too much to ask for?!"}
{"text":"Is it possible for there to be a tooth in the burgers? I just bit down on part of a tooth and it's not one of mine.  Also, I asked for lots of hot sauce, she gave me one. I asked for more, she gave me ranch. What?  I always know if I'm going here at night to not make my order too complicated. The forget half of the simple orders anyway. It's close. The only reason I really go."}
{"text":"Ordered a cholula burger with bacon and cheese.  Paid extra. Long wait time recieved said order with no cheese or bacon.  Smh fail!"}
{"text":"Food is fine but the restaurant is filthy. Ketchup splatters on the wall that have probably been there for months, floor is disgusting and bathrooms are not serviced regularly."}
{"text":"Great service! The drive thru lady alma was very nice she was very sweet and made it pleasant. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is in a great area. I love a good burger. They are slow on service and sometimes I get a great burger and other times i get a decent burger. The bacon cheese burger is the best. This is typically a good clean place. The staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I'm giving JNB a better rating then it probably deserves, but I have a place in heart for this FF joint.  This spot has a few thinga going for it IMHO.  One, they just remodeled and it's beautiful, but I'm going to miss the old portraits of movie stars they used to have hung up for art.  They had Albert Einstein with his incredible shock of hair, a personal favorite hero,  a young Ella Fitzgerald, Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn(Breakfast at Tiffany's).  These photographs really jazzed up the place, but the wallpaper, rugs and other furnishing need updated, so I guess the remodel was good.  Two, when I first arrived at Arizona(Flagstaff), via Greyhound bus, we stopped near a JNB, so technically this was the 1st chain I ate at in Arizona.  I order the Jumbo Jack which hasn't changed since I ordered it back in 1985.  They did raise the price from a dollar(Bah humbug!  Now, I just order a 99¢ hamburger for value.  Also, good on the menu:  Egg Rolls, SourDough Bacon cheeseburger, Jalapeño poppers, and the super yummy Breakfast Bowl.  Service is very good.  They almost never mess up my order as they are careful to repeat the order if they don't understand me.  They are fast too.  My only request would be to find a way to clean up the  garbage can and grease bin out back.  They need to control the odor that emanates from there because it causes potential guests from losing their appetites(especially those who drive through)  Other than that, I like the restaurant and have been dining there close to 20 years now."}
{"text":"Avoid this location. Ya it's fast food, but I still expect it to be at least warm and semi fresh. Every time I have been here the food is cold! Get it together \"managers\". It's fast food, not that damn hard."}
{"text":"I came from Florida where we didn't have Jack in the Box. I love the fact that you can order breakfast 24 hrs a day. Also it has a great value menu, 2 tacos for 1.29, nuggets for a $1 something, burgers shy of $1.50 etc. not too crazy about the fried but that's preferential. Always great service for me. 4 stars simply because I don't crave the location but I enjoy it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan favorite of jack in the box since the 90's. Naturally this location is near my home so I come here often for lunch and sometimes dinner. The employees are kind to me and the food is always hot. I also like how this location is connected to a gas station for my everyday needs before and after work."}
{"text":"Food was great!!  Such a nice change from Mcdonalds and I got a taco (way better than taco bell)"}
{"text":"This place use to be good but after a few situations I will never go back, THEY ARE KNOWN FOR OPENING LATE but I think the late night people are a bunch of liars and lazy pot smokers who ALWAYS SAY THEIR SYSTEM IS DOWN we can't take your order, or we can only accept cash bc the card reader don't work and then they calculate the wrong total and probably pocket The money. Jack needs to get on top of late night staff, this is ridiculous"}
{"text":"From 3/17/15  We came in here to grab some food before heading out to Freemont for the St Patty's extravaganza. This was my first time trying Jack-n-a-Box since we did not have any in NY. The name \"Jack-n-a-Box\"   always makes me think the spoofy version called \"Yak-in-a-Box,\" in a cartoon from my childhood which name I can't remember off the top of my head for some reason.   Anyway, I got the Sourdough Jack-burger, which has bacon, swiss cheese,  and  mayo sauce. It was actually pretty good. As for the environment, it was weird in there only because of the people who were totally loitering in there, plus  this place had that weird fast food joint odor."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru last night around 11:30.  The lady came on the intercom and was so rude.  All she said to me was \"GIVE ME A MINUTE\"... No good evening, no hello, no welcome to Jack in the box, NOTHING.  After waiting a few minutes I said hello?  She said again, GIVE ME A MINUTE!!  Rudest person I have ever encountered working in the service industry.  I came around the corner to her BS'ing with the car in front of me.  Needless to say, I didn't order anything and will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"First of all, it does not matter whether you are a lawful paying customer or not. If you use their parking lot, you are guaranteed to be towed. I wonder if this is how they make their money. There are actually more Jack In the Box restricted parking spots than seats in the restaurant. It's that way by design.  I came back out to my car and there was a weird guy who was touching my car and had set off my car alarm. He was already on the phone with the towing company. I just walked up to him, gave my best smile and said, \"you need to get your  hands off my vehicle, and get out of the way. You are impeding me leaving.\"  I really wish Tempe would start policing these guys.  Oh, and their food is gross, even by fast food standards. I treasure my health too much to ever attempt eating there again."}
{"text":"The person taking out order was a bit confused with our request so only put an order in for 1 chicken sandwich. By the time we made it to the window to pay, we told them it was 2 only 1 had tomatoes. Less than 30 seconds they fixed our order and it was so fresh n hot when we double checked the order, burned my hands a lil lol.. Latierra and Delia were working drive so the manager on duty was awesome to have their employees doing so well on customer service! This team should lead and train other teams on how to be awesome!!"}
{"text":"I don't expect much from jack in the box, however if could leave no stars I would. You can't just have wet floor signs in the drive through in the middle of the night and call it closed because you want to sit in the parking lot. If you can't operate with only one person there  because your co worker called in sick, why is your operation wasting its own money and staying open? Damn I just wanted some curly fries and tacos. Maybe even a shake if you're machine wasn't broken but it's the middle of the night so it probably is."}
{"text":"Food tasted horrible.  Had breakfast burrito no flavor and mush inside.  Hash brown was crispy on outside and mush inside.  Will avoid this location."}
{"text":"Health code violations!!! Food all over the floors drink station a sticky mess, all the self serve condiments were a hot mess. Staff members eating while preparing food and playing inappropriate music while yelling back and fourth with each other. Mostly just mad at myself for eating the sandwich. Not sure who the manager on duty is but ... they are failing at the moment."}
{"text":"As I was at the Drive thru at exactly at 10:42 PM a gentlemen had a very poor attitude. This is his tone of voice \"I can't hear you.....or what kind of drink?\" In a very rude way. I literally backed out of the drive thru. If you don't like your job please give it to someone else that do. I don't know if you're having a bad day, either you're tired or whatever the case maybe don't have that type of attitude please."}
{"text":"Not only does their whole drive thru system need to be fixed so they can actually hear you rather than asking you 5 different times what you're saying but they also can't even fulfill an order properly. I got regular fries instead of the curly fries I asked and PAID for. I also got a burger that was made completely wrong: no bacon yet there was lettuce and onions that I DID NOT ask for. When I called to let them know they completely screwed up my order they didn't give a damn. I enjoy Jack in the Box but this location is a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"We stood there for five minuets and two worker made eye contact with us and still ignored us and we said hello and nobody came and helped us i would give them zero stars but we can't"}
{"text":"Sunday 850pm expect this type of service. The jumbo jack was a joke, the sourdough bacon thrown on a corner of my burger, my large drink wasn't filled to the top. All my photos are 100% and not manipulated in any way. I don't expect class A service but damn even when I collected carts and bagged groceries I cared."}
{"text":"Never going to this location again. Every time I come here my order is ALWAYS screwed up. The first time I came here I got the wrong order. So I was just like okay whatever it's not a big deal. But tonight, I ordered a cheesecake with my meal... after I get my food I realized they forgot the cheesecake. Already slightly irritated, I drive back around to the window (it was not busy at all) and let the employee know that he forgot the cheesecake. There was no apology at all. He just handed me the bag. It was kind of strange because all he did was stare and didn't say a word."}
{"text":"I live in Denver. Phoenix was my childhood home. When I go to Jack in Denver, it's a different franchisee and it's obvious. The Jack's in Denver get my order right 25% of the time. This place gets it spot on every time. Thanks for being consistent. Never thought I'd give a 5 star review for fast food but you and your franchisee deserve to know I appreciate it."}
{"text":"I'm making a comment here cause I hate racism of any kind. By the way my favorite fast food joint is J of B so I don't have any cross to bear w/them as a restaurant in general. Tonight I witnessed blatant racism that involved me & I wasn't happy about it at all. I am a white, 55 yr old person who walked into this restaurant straight off the street at 8 pm. I had never been in there before so they had never seen me. I wanted to use the restroom, saw that they only allowed customers to use them & you had to be buzzed in. I walked straight up to the counter (I hadn't even attempted to purchase anything) & asked to be buzzed in. They buzzed me in. A black man, probably in his mid-twenties, clean cut, came in right after, walked up to the counter, asked to use the restroom & they started hassling him, saying he had to buy something etc. The guy told them he had been in earlier & they just kept hassling him. I have never been so embarrassed to be white in my life. I did talk to the young man while he kept waiting for them to unlock the door. He wasn't high, drunk or anything else, he was just black. Finally he left after 3 different employees gave him the run around. I will never frequent that restaurant again as I can't condone racist behavior like that & anyone that reads this I hope you also go somewhere else"}
{"text":"If possible I would give it 0 stars. I just came to this location with my fiance and we literally sat at the drive thru for 20 minutes and no one came to the intercom. So I call the store asking if they were io3n and the guy that answered told me \"yes we are open why?\" And I told him I had been waiting I'm the drive thru for 20 minutes and no one took my order. He then said \"we got a huge order\" And then just hung up on me. I then wait ANOTHER 10 minutes before anyone comes to the intercom. After he finally come to the intercom he asks for my order. After the first item he tells me to \"hold on\" then disappeared for another good 5 minutes . After almost 30 minutes of sitting and waiting to order. He finally gets my order and I pull to the window. That was the longest most ridiculous trip to a fast food restaraunt I have ever made."}
{"text":"JACK, WHAT WOULD ALL THE DRUNK AND HIGH PEOPLE DO WITHOUT YOU AT 2 IN THE MORNING?  That includes me because when you dont have much money and you're starving, 2 bucks for 4 tacos goes a long way!  This place is at what I think is at a nice location. It's at the beginning (or ending, whichever way you look at it) of the strip. Right next to them is a 24 hour gas station. Im sure hundreds of you that are reading this have made a stop here one time or another whether you were gassing up or just wanted to save money because of the expensive buffets the past couple of outings.  Service is decent about 80 percent of the time. A couple times I have done the drive through and it took forever to get my food. No, there wasnt a long line and it was at two different times of the day.   Foodwise, everybody knows that their 2 for 99 cent tacos are what makes them a good choice. That and the fact that you can order ANYTHING off their menu is a huge plus. It's 8 in the mornig. Want a jumbo jack? Sure! 6 pm dinner time? How bout some mini pancakes? Ok!  So Jack, if you're reading this, dont change a thing! Oh, also don't stop making those funny commercials!"}
{"text":"I hate the location the people who work at this location are rude and very disrespectful.. I try and not go to this location ever... the guy last nite tried telling me it was 12.97 for a large jumbo jack meal.. so I just drove away and went to another place to eat..."}
{"text":"We stopped at this location this evening.  No one wanted to help us.  The two girls were too busy in the back chatting to take our orders.  I even called out to them.   I told them we were leaving and they didn't care."}
{"text":"I ordered 8 tacos and large curly fries for my little brothers and I. The tacos were okay and just warm. Other than that good customer service. We asked for ranch and hot sauce at least we received that.   Next time I'll ask for no hot sauce on my tacos and update my review."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, i'm definitely a fan. I ordered the sirloin burger with fries. The burger was big and loaded with fresh lettuce, tomato, and red onion. How did they know I love red onion? I will have to pace myself since this location is so close to my house. I don't wanna over do it on a good thing. I'm gonna try What-a-Burger this weekend. We'll see who has the better burger."}
{"text":"H O R R I B L E !! If I could give negative stars I would. Went thru the drive thru and was told everything was there. Went thru the bags and noticed I was missing items I paid for.   Drove around, parked and went inside. Had my receipt in hand and told the drive thru cashier I just seen he forget a few of my items.   The older Hispanic women had the nerve to tell him in Spanish I'm a liar ! WTF ! Lucky I speak Spanish as well. Not only did I tell her off, tell the manager and got more items for free !   B.S location and I will never go there again ! Rude employees !"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!!!! IF I could give this location negative stars I would. Went through the drive thru and the young man at the window was rude. His interaction and conversation was very short he told me my total took my money and said not a word until he asked if I wanted any ranch. I assume he was the manager as he has a vest and dress shirt on. I got home opened up my cheddar bacon potato wedges and gross doesn't describe it. Overly fried with one clump of dried up shredded cheese with a small pinch of bacon bits. My tacos were fried so bad they were crispy and broke like they were tortilla chips. I couldn't eat any of it, money down the drain. I tried calling the store a few times and no answer at all. I will not be returning to that location ever again. Based on the posts I've seen this is normal for this location and Management doesn't care to change it or make it better."}
{"text":"The worst drive through ever in my in Las Vegas it's soooo bad I was waiting in the drive-through line for more than 20 min, and when I get to the screen order they ask me to wait for a few seconds and nobody respond to me I was waiting around 10 min, and wen I went inside to speak with the supervisor or the one in charge I find a guy his name Kave i'm not sure if I spelled his name correct because nobody wearing name tag, so he told me \"i'm busy cooking so I can't take your order\", and the other lady whose taking the drive-through order \" says to me we have a bunch of locations in Las Vegas you can go to other location \" she's like kicking me out!!  And I listen to her advice but i didn't went to Jack in the box, but I went to other restaurant.   Jack-in-the-Box Hiring Manager!! You should hire people who can manage this location better than losing business because I saw more than 3 cars change their mind from your bad customer service"}
{"text":"Hey Jack, use better bags for to go orders. Something that won't literally rip in half and spill the food in the parking lot before reaching my vehicle. Paper too thin. Bad idea to get cheap and cut corners with bags."}
{"text":"Came here intending to use a coupon for half off a milkshake and another coupon for a free taco with any purchase. Placed my order for a large Oreo milkshake at the drive thru (the only thing I bought) and before handing over my coupons, asked the worker if I could use both and said yes. She rang up my order for $4.01 cents, which for a half off milkshake, would've meant its original price is $8.01. Immediately, I asked if she used the coupon and she said she forgot and acted in an \"Oh well\" attitude. Like, OK....you forgot... So are you gonna refund me my money and ring it up correctly or what? I hate to seem rude but I had ask her what she would do to fix it. She just hands me two dollars and my taco and we drive away disgruntled. As somebody who also works in the day food industry, ive forgotten to use a coupon before, but have instinctively been apologetic and do everything I can to resolve the issue. I was taken aback but the lack of effort and customer service on this cashiers part and is what began the downhill experience at this establishment.      Now, it wasn't a big deal to me, but my boyfriend was immensely annoyed at how thick the \"milkshake\" was and that they only gave us a straw and no spoon. I personally didn't see it as that big of a deal but once he pointed it out, it was rather careless on their part. The consistency was thicker than concrete mixers from Culver's or frozen custards from Freddy's. Upon recollection, those chains have always gave us spoons with our milkshakes. One could argue that the ad clearly says that the milkshake is thick, but in that case, a spoon should be expected. Sometimes, it really is the little things that stand out."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. They are suppose to be open 24hrs and not two, but THREE times in one week I can by around 4-4:30am they told me their system was \"processing\" whatever that means. They didn't even say sorry or anything. Never going to Jack In the Box again."}
{"text":"They took my order to my table most Jack-in-the-Box don't even do that nowadays. All the people here are jolly and cool ."}
{"text":"This place is a fucking joke. You have the worst employees including the managers. The staff has no clue what they are doing and the managers barely speak English. I went through the drive thru on a Monday night at 8:30pm so it wasn't busy at all. The girl working the drive thru kept getting my order wrong (I believe her name is lasonna) anyways after multiple tries of her trying to comprehend the words I was saying (born and raised in Vegas, I have no accent at all) she tells me to pull-up to the window. At the window she ask me for money for the bill and I'm like you didn't take my order...remember???? I was beyond irritated by now. She finally took my order which took another 5 minutes and then I was told to pull in front even though there was no one behind me. Whatever I pull in front and 5 minutes later the guy walks out with our order. I start backing up my car and the 3 African American people start pounding on my window and yelling so I unroll the window to see what the hell they are doing and they accuse me of calling their daughter (drive thru girl) a bitch. I could think of a few choice words for this idiot that is more fitting than bitch. Her parents continue to yell at me and pound on my car (my 4 year old was sleeping in the back) so I took off and turned around and the two workers bitch 1 and bitch 2 were standing outside laughing. So here I sit trying to make a decision while I'm in a 2 ton vehicle and all of them are on foot, but I'm not about to catch a case on the bitches at jack in the box. I called the manager who barely spoke English and she hung up on me twice so I called in the morning and spoke with the manager that was worthless so I just went to the top to corporate. These fuckers are lucky I wasn't carrying and that I had my little boy in the car because those little bitches fucked with the wrong girl."}
{"text":"I went to Jack-in-the-Box just to use my Apple Pay, and to get a spicy chicken sandwich. They don't except Apple Pay, at least not in the drive-through. Their food is mediocre, that's why it's somewhat cheap. But for the price of just the premium sandwiches, they really are, almost, as big as how it portrays in the pictures.  I like how this last time when I went they were really quick to get my food and order. Once a lady gave me both of the shakes I ordered Even though I only had money for one shake.  Usually the outside exterior of the store turns me off, because there's always a lot of kids in the afternoon, and a lot of hanging out in the evening. But the staff really puts the customer ahead of the commotion That might be going on outside."}
{"text":"I see the 3 previous reviews are bad, our visit was nothing like it. Not one car in drive thru. 8 cars in parking area. Not only was Caleb friendly, he repeated our order exactly as ordered. Including the large water (no charge, like other places) we visit my mum every other month in AZ & the service was so good, as was the chicken sandwhich & my daughters mini pancakes, we will be back. Probably one of the more perfect drive thru experinces we have had. We travel 3000+ miles every few months & have had our share of lousy service. This was a nice change."}
{"text":"If I could give fewer than one star, I would! Consistently rude service, a shake machine that's always \"out of order,\" and seemingly unable to deliver any of the items on their menu such as munchies meals or simple sides. Spare yourself the time & energy and go to Whataburger down the road!"}
{"text":"Thank you for being open on thanksgiving!! Although I kind of wished the girl that was helping me would have had a chance to be with her family because she seemed sad so I asked her if she had a choice to work or not and she said no, she did not have a choice and she was sad that she could not be with family. You know, I'd rather have the place close on this one special holiday than force someone to be away from their family to server me a taco on thanksgiving. I am also willing to bet that if the manager put some effort and thought and communicated with the staff he/she would have been able to staff turkey day with only employees that really wanted to be there -- put your workers first. I could see three or four other employees inside and the diner looked empty you could have gone with a skeleton crew and let anyone who has children and/or a family that they wanted to be with, go home. Please work on that, people matter and I could have found somewhere else to eat and would willingly had done so for her to be with her family. Anyways the tacos were great, per usual thank you so much for being open on a day where I usually eat KFC and they were closed."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I would have to say don't trust the reviews. Let me start by saying my fries was so hot I couldn't even eat them as fast as I wanted to. That's a good thing by the way. Of course I wouldn't want Service to be super fast just because it's drive-through service but everything was accurate I didn't feel rushed, my food was good and I would definitely be back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"You could take your own order, cook the food, run a marathon, and take a nap in the time it takes just for them to take your order. Expect 30-40 minutes to be served."}
{"text":"I have wonderful memories of eating at Jack in the Box here in my neck of the woods (Norfolk & Va Beach, VA.) when I was a kid. However at some point while I was a teen they pulled out of the area and never came back. Much to my surprise I saw they were available while I was down in Charlotte last weekend and decided that I would grab a burger on my way out of town.   I popped into this Concord location and the building looked pretty cool, nothing like the buildings 70's era design that remains in my area. The staff was friendly and I ordered the Classic Buttery Burger with some curly fries and an iced tea. After a short wait they handed me a tray with everything freshly made and I took a seat and prepared to eat my meal. Then ARG!  So let's just pull the bandaid off. This burger stunk. No I don't mean it smelled bad, it didn't. It was dressed well, the meat was fresh, it was cooked properly. It's just a bad burger. I felt like I was eating something from a Murray's steaks. The thing was just beyond sub par.   End rant. Everything else about my burger was fine, Bun, toppings, etc. The curly fries were also excellent. If anyone from Jack in the Box ever reads this, guys you need to change your burger patties. Everyone's is better than this turd.   I've been told the taco's are good, and the chicken sandwiches as well so next time I try a Jack in the Box I'll go that route. But I'll never eat one of those beef patty's again. Not if it's like that. Never."}
{"text":"The staff here has always been fantastic, nice, and extremely personable; way above normal for a fast food place. The inside has been above average clean every time I've ate/ordered there. Food is what it is: cheap and greasy."}
{"text":"Not a bad visit...the drive through worker was polite and the food accurate...condimates were not all there..but nothing serious...good overall!"}
{"text":"Horrible service by the cashier Lucia. Not very friendly and does not say thank you or you are welcome!!! The company needs to see who they hire. Before putting a ugly face to serve you."}
{"text":"Kinda crazy seeing all the 5 stars, im throughly disgusted at the moment tho. I eat at the one on Power and McDowell all the time. Today I went and I ordered my usual Sourdough Jack NO BACON onion rings and a Coke... I get home and Open my nice cold Burger even though it's only a quarter mile away I take a bite all I can taste is bacon. I order my food special because I want it fresh and hot. They clearly just peeled the bacon off. The reason I order no bacon is because that bacon that they serve disgusts me it grosses me out and doesn't taste like bacon. I'm sure they're busy and they just wanted to cut corners or something but I've been busy too and I worked all day and I was pretty hungry so I decided I was going to give them a little jingle and let them know that I don't appreciate and nobody answers the phone there. That's why I came on here. Next time I have a craving for Jack in the Box I'm going to Carl's jr. This seriously is the last time. I can't even get ahold of them to fix this. I'm sure they won't feel the loss of me but if they keep up this kind of service they're going to feel it"}
{"text":"Well, i'm actually right here right now and first of all, they didn't give me the right size of my coffee, and when I told them to change it, they weren't so nice about it I guess you can say. I went though the drive thru and since it's super busy I didn't wanna give them any problems. I had to go back because they did not even write down a burger i ordered. It's a mess, right now atleast."}
{"text":"Just a heads up, this rating is only for cravings past 2am, usually when drunk and/or completely starved, this place is a hole while the sunlight is up.  Now having said that, 2 tacos for 99 cents and super scrumptious milkshakes, not sure what else you could ask for!!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through with a very rude order taker. I asked for a salad and drink along with some burgers. Very disappointed. The order taker refused my request for no tomatoes and then he never asked what type of dressing. He seemed very argumentative for a teen. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"The food is about what you'd expect from any JitB, but they left one poor, bedraggled guy working the drive-through AND cooking the food (!) at the very busy post-club time of night.  Wait time was protracted, cars were backed up to the street.  He did his best, but I'm unimpressed for this business' management for allowing this to happen."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could . I go to this jacks artlessly once a week . I ordered a shake I opened the lid to eat some off the top and noticed a small black hair . Susan was the drive Thur attendant whom argued with about it being my hair and then forgot the dipping sauce that I had asked for .. Terrible customer service"}
{"text":"The ultimate drunk food! 2 tacos for .99! Give me 6 please! Lots of hot sauce (more like mild sauce). I usually order 4 tacos and a jr bacon cheeseburger or jr jack. Cheap convenient meal.   Those tacos are so delicious! 2 free tacos if you do a quick survey from the receipt. That's 4 tacos for .99!"}
{"text":"So here's the thing, it says it's 24 hours, but I would say that after 9 o'clock there's only one person working because it always takes 30 minutes to get through the drive thru. Just go to Vegas. Food's what you expect thus 2 stars"}
{"text":"Dude made me cheat his timer. Yeah, it was late (like 2am) but I know the game; you let him cheat the order timer and he hooks you up. Not this time. That's why I'm putting him on blast. No one answered the phone for two hours after I left so I turned to yelp. Either do things ethically or don't and pay the dues. That's how it works. If Miguel or whatever his name is doesn't want to play the game then I'm gonna tell the manager that he's cheating his numbers. The food was exceptionally bad plus I backed my car up so it looked like he was doing a good job timing wise. He did a poor job. That's it.   This was at 2am 6/8/14."}
{"text":"First off, yes, I am giving this Jack in the Box 5 stars under ONE condition.. If a gentleman named Kevin is working. He is the epitome of an all around great employee who knows how to carry himself, showing a great representation of the establishment.    So my boyfriend and I pull up to the Jack in the Box that actually looked pretty busy. Mind you, it's 3 AM in the morning.   As soon as we pull up to the intercom, we get greeted by this really nice guy. Professional, friendly and clearly the perfect man to be working a night shift. I can't tell you how many people we've run into that work grave shift who are completely unhappy to be there....and show it.   He's totally an easy going mood, making small talk as we wait for our food. We get our food & drive away thinking \"man, that guy was good.\"  Unfortunately, there was a confusion with our order. We show back up to the place & Kevin greeted us with the same Welcoming smile that he had our whole experience. He was completely understanding and accommodating about the whole issue and I've honestly never encountered someone with such poise..working at an establishment such as this. Regardless of the reason, this place is lucky to have him and I would make a trip back here, just to say hello to him!"}
{"text":"Sat in drive thru for 15 minutes and was told they were going through a shift change which would take an additional 15 minutes before I could order. This was the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight. Worst experience ever I will not go to this one ever again. If I could I would give no stars. So after a meeting me and a friend have to pick up food for both families so we go in the drive thru and the manager was so rude. First he asked how we were paying don't see why that would matter then told us our order was to big for the drive thru. Then he told us he was going to call the cops cuz we called the feedback number. So we took our business to a different jack in the box who was more then happy to take our money and order in the drive thru. If you can avoid this location worst service and management ever."}
{"text":"Melinda is the best worker there. She goes above and beyond for her customers. Absolutely love her!"}
{"text":"I guess I've had a better experience than most. But every time I go, they're very friendly and the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Decent Jack in the Box. Friendly service. Relatively quick. Frequent often and have enjoyed the munchies."}
{"text":"Not that bad of a place. The workers at the time I went were friendly. Although they have forgot my cheese cake 2 times now. If you ever come here just check the bags for everything before you leave. I would still come back...not ordering my cheese cake here anymore, though."}
{"text":"I've got to say, I'm impressed. The manager, Nino, contacted me immediately and invited me back do he could make things right. He apologized for the previous experience, replaced the item I was unhappy with before, and even gave me a free soda while I waited.  The swift response and desire to make up for a negative experience was very appreciated, and Nino was a very nice guy. Thanks!"}
{"text":"They will ask you to pull out and park in front if you go through the drive through to cheat their numbers. They forget your receipt. The food is acceptable."}
{"text":"Total bullsh*t they are supposed to have the lobby open til MIDNIGHT on certain days as stated on their door and yet they are constantly closing it early. Went at 11:30 p.m and of course closed, are you kidding me?! Seriously I was about to buy $100 worth of food for my entire family but nope.. I'm just gonna skip this place from now on and go else where. Their employees suck (talkin to you dude with stretched lobes), the food is mediocre, and they cant even stick to open hours."}
{"text":"I thought I would pop into this location to grab my 16 month old a kid's meal since we were a ways from home and I knew he was hungry. We used the drive thru and I noticed that the people ordering in front of me had the rudest lady taking their order. I thought omg! Fortunately I got a different voice that was much nicer. No problem with service but my son LOVES the toys that come in the kid's meals why I always get them. This trip he got an antennae head as a toy even though the plastic covering for this \"toy\" clearly states \"this is not a toy.\" Poor kid was so disappointed. I ordered the kid's meal chicken nuggets and my son was loving them. He LOVES chicken nuggets. I noticed after the third one he was trying to remove a small rope like string from his mouth. I took it out and I'm pretty sure it was in the chicken nugget. It looked like a white string stained brown probably from being in the breading of the chicken nugget. Now if it was cooked into the nugget this wouldn't be Jack in the Box's fault but I thought it was quite strange. I give it an extra star because my burger was delicious! I do miss when they used to put the burger in just paper so I could eat on the go but I get the competition and having to make it all fancy. But the cold fries, tainted chicken nugget and antenna head as a toy is why my review is a 2 star."}
{"text":"Picked up some lunch for my son this afternoon. Ordered a breakfast sandwich and substituted the hash brown for french fries. Once we inspected the bag we realized they forgot our fries. So we turned back and went back through the drive thru and advised that our French fries were forgotten. Their employee,Bernice, immediately went into defense mode. \"The meal comes with hash browns\". Our response was that we asked for a French fry upgrade and was even asked what size French fry we wanted. So clearly our order was heard correctly. Bernice then proceeded to argue about the price and was charging us the full price for a French fry instead of upgrading to the difference. We wanted to speak to the manager, and she stated that she was the manager for that day. Then she proceeded to yell at her staff to hurry up with the fries. Once we finally received the bag of fries, it was already leaking with oil once we drove home 2 minutes away. This was a disturbing and disappointing customer service experience especially coming from a lead team member which shows lack of professionalism and commitment to customer service."}
{"text":"Welcomed to Arizona with a delicious meal from a fast food luxury. Our favorites were the garlic herb fries: absolutely astounding. But there are no words to describe the world famous Chocolate Overlord Cake. We literally worship this decadent dessert. Amen."}
{"text":"The cashier is nice the food is a bit dry.  I ordered extra mayo and ketchup but they skimped on the ketchup.  The first flight of burgers were warm, not hot, and the sourdough burgers were cold.  Plenty of whipped cream on the milkshake.  The eating area is fairly clean, but there are smudges all over the tables.  Parking was great, plenty of spots.  It is what you come to expect from a Jack In The Box."}
{"text":"Omg I think that preschool kids could have done a better job and been more organized then the staff that was working last night 10/6/16 @ 9:30 pm. I was the only one in the lobby and waited 10 minutes before someone took my order. I had a few questions about there hamburgers I asked her \"what one of your hamburgers is the biggest.\" and she asked me \"chicken or meat?\" Lol again I told her a hamburger and was asked the same question \"meat or chicken?\" lmao I told her the round meat from a cow. Now after getting that strait I placed my order a double jumbo jack combo, 4 tacos,  3 egg rolls and jalapeño poppers and shit you not it took 32 minutes to make my order. Standing there watching them was like watching an episode of of the 3 stooges. Lol"}
{"text":"The people who work here are the best! I have twin autistic daughters who will only eat the chicken nuggets from here. They are always welcoming and know me by my voice. I know that's not great to be recognized at a fast food place (could be worse-could be doughnuts! Lol) but they are always great to us! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"I freaking hate this jack in the box. They are brand new and seriously suck at their job. I work night shift in the area so our options are pretty limited. I came here when they first opened and was not impressed. My food was cold and stale. The fries tastes like they were sitting out for days. I didn't finish it. The second time I went they forgot a quarter of our meal so we had to go back around and pick up the rest. I had gotten chicken strips and was not offered a dipping sauce and I forgot to ask so I had dry ass chicken strips for lunch at 3 o'clock in the morning. I'm tired of them forgetting our stuff. Not to mention the people there are pretty freaking rude. Usually carpool to get lunch and they wouldn't let us pay separately. We were the only people in the drive thru!! I will only continue to go here because it's honestly one of the only places open around and I rather not have filreberto taco shits at work.  Update as of 09/30/16 0109 am I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich. Got back to work and it was a plain chicken .__. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Basic standard JIB.  Bathrooms are paying customers only with a key behind counter that employees use to open for you.  No loitering signs for longer then 30mins near the Bathroom.  Staff was ok, no smiles, no thrills.  Food was hit,, quick and typical JIB.  Change was correct for cash (I've recently had younger kids not sure how to make change when doing cash).     Door dash delivery sign on window.."}
{"text":"being so close to the strip im sure they get a bunch of wild folks   the guy in the drive thru was more than nice and when the car ahead of us had a giant order - he knocked 10% off our order just for making us wait.  They really know how to keep their 2am-ers happy"}
{"text":"Stopped by around 1:45 am after a failed attempt to get a Oreo shake from the Russell and Mtn Vista store. Having already received food, I ordered just the Oreo shake. One car ahead of me wait - by the time I got to the window the shake was all ready to go AND the kind young Hispanic dude hooked it up for free! I didn't even tell him about my venture from the other location or the reason I wanted just a shake, he just was nice enough to pass on some good karma! Thanks JitB guy!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the drive thru policy is at the 7th street and Union Hills location.  Seems I remember adding stuff to your order at the drive thru window was something they advertised like a desert or side item. After working 14 hours straight on my feet I decided to stop by the newest location for north Phoenix and get something quick to eat around 12:30 in the morning. I ordered 2 of their new munchies items and a taco for me and my wife. While waiting in line at the drive thru I checked my phone to see if I had any messages and my wife said she wanted an order of chicken nuggets with ranch dressing.  When I got to the window to pay I said I needed to add to my order. The guy at the register shouts back \"No add-on's\"!  I said I need an order of nuggets and he says \" NO,  you'll have to drive back around and order, no add-on's at the window!  All while not making any eye contact. To tired to argue I reluctantly drove back around and placed my order and was now behind the car that was behind me a minute earlier. Pulled up and paid and drove home to eat and get some much needed rest. The food was good and all but if there is a next time I'll just sit there at the window and slowly eat my order as the cars pile up in the drive thru lane till he takes my order for any add-on's.  I'm not driving back around!"}
{"text":"Got sick...Used to be a great location...under new ownership maybe? Went last night... service was poor and food tasted old!  My family ate it when we got home and all of us got sick! Called management and spoke with Maria and she was arguing with me and very nasty.  Will not return."}
{"text":"That is by far the worst Jack In the Box i have ever been to ,unprofessional , and their corporate don't even bother to call back . I live close by ... i went there a few times and the taste of their meet is old and their frys was warm not hot , but of course being the only burger place by me thats open 24 hours and i want something to eat I'm forced to go there .The other day i was walking back home and i didn't have my car  , it was parked at my place which's a mile down the street, it was 2:30 in the morning and i wanted to get some food , so i walked there and i checked to see if the door was open , the front door that is and it was .... so i walked in and i wanted to make an order and Frankie and another lady that was  working with him the second they saw me they were like you got to leave how did you come in , i said the front door and he was like it should've been closed , I'm like well it's open and I'm here can i put an order , he was extremely rude and was like no it's only drive thro ... i said i don't have my car and I'm already here and don't mention your door is open so just get me my order ... he was extremely rude , him and the other lady and kicked me out , and they used the F word a few times as they kicked me Out , they were unprofessional , used the worst words , and they made the mistake by leave the door open .anyway ..i called their corporate and to make a complaint and that was two days ago and no one even bother to call me to ask what happened or what my complaint was about or even to apologize ...: i strongly suggest no one goes to this place."}
{"text":"Two stars only because I like the breakfast items.  However, on recent visits - had the following.    1.  Extra charge of .49 to scramble an egg.  Really? 2.  Meat Lovers Burrito - meat only and a tiny bit of egg.  Not had that before! 3.  Previous visit - hamburger had an off taste and a bone chip. 4.  Chicken strips as a replacement were cold and tough. 5.  Chicken spicy sammie was tough with crunchy tomatoes  I'll give it another go for breakfast but lunch scared me away."}
{"text":"The cashier was nice  . . . The spicy chicken sandwich was not fresh. Lettuce was sad not crispy like it should be.   Unfortunately I Don't think I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Jack in the Box ever.  There was one customer ahead of me, already sitting at a table.  The cashier was very nice - gave me time to decide before I ordered.  So I got my cup for my soda, filled up and waited.. and waited.. Finally after 10 minutes the one customer ahead of me got their order.   My order was to go, so I'm standing there watching the back.  I finally got mine 10 minutes later - but I saw that my burger was done and sat at the fries bin when they decided to put fries into the fryer.  Then the fries were done, dumped out, and they too sat there while the cashier took orders for new customers.  Apparently the man who puts the fries into the fryer cannot scoop them into the sleeve.   So, when I finally got my food, it was 20 minutes after I ordered - burger was cold and fries were luke warm.  Guess I won't be going here again.  If they were busy, I would understand.  But everyone was standing around gossiping."}
{"text":"I visit this Jack In The Box every Friday, and tonight's visit was very disappointing. No customer service skills at all. No smile, no greetings, and no acknowledgment at all. Didn't even offer anything else at the end. Didnt engage in any type of conversation or even make eye contact. She wasn't wearing a name badge not sure if she is new, but she definitely needs customer service training.  I don't think she even smiles ever, she certainly doesn't take pride in her job at Jack In the Box. The worst part is she doesn't have any type of listening skills, I will drive 5 minutes more to the other location by my home."}
{"text":"Friendly people and fresh food.  Priced just right! Very satisfied! Would come again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible both my sons & husband had gotten food poisoning none of us will ever go back!"}
{"text":"Just another Jack in the Box...  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very memorable. & I know fast food places CAN be memorable.  I love their smoothies. YUM!  The fries were good. Regular & curly were both crispy & tasty.  They got my order right. No mayo, add pickles & onions. It's amazing how many places mess this up.  I love the sourdough bread sandwiches but the bread seemed especially greasy this time. Ick all over my hands.  Jack, you do rock for being open 24 hours though."}
{"text":"I went to jack in the box tonight ordered a spicy chicken sandwich got my order went home started to eat and halfway through eating it I found a Long piece of hair after taking a bite of my sandwich. So I immediately got into my car drove back to jack in the box and explained to the cashier that I got a hair in my food. So the cashier went to the cook and he came to me telling me he has been on the grill the whole night and that was not his hair. I would not plant hair in my food and waste my Time and gas to drive back there and be told that I'm wrong. I'm the paying customer that deserves to be treated tight. I felt disrepected by the cook accusing me of putting the hair I'm my own food. This is horrible customer service and I'm very disappointed I the service I hot tonight. I go to this jack in the box alot, and I have NEVER been treated like this."}
{"text":"Excellent fast-food breakfast sandwich and fast service. In my book, Jack wins the fastfood breakfast war in terms of food quality! The hashbrown needs work, but the breakfast sandwich is filling enough. for sub $10, this combo is a winner.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Usually,  I don't eat fast food!!! Recently I've been forced to. There's a Jack-in-the-Box by my house that I have either used the drive-through, or carry out three times in the past two weeks. All three times my order was wrong. The crispy chicken strips were well done, no buttermilk ranch dressing, no taco sauce for the tacos, the fryer wasn't working so no breakfast jacks for my family, etc., etc., etc. There was no one to meet you when you walked into place your order because they're understaffed. It's not our problem as consumers that they don't know how to order food properly so that when you come in at midnight they have it stocked. On your receipt there is a survey to take. When you call, the beginning of the survey says \"we want the best customer service available, please help us by taking the survey\". So, of course, because the order was wrong I took the survey. I answered every question honestly & gave my feedback. The first time they replaced my meal. The second time I got a call from the district manager ( Rudy Palmaune) saying he would look into it. Today, the third time I got a call from the store manager with some shocking news. She told me that after reviewing video tapes, & looking at my receipts that they have decided: that since they cannot satisfy me as a customer they are not allowing me to come back to that store. Stephanie (the manager) said \"I can go to any other fast food restaurant I want, but not just that one\"..When I was told this my mouth dropped to the floor. My response was: so what you're telling me is that instead of trying to make a customer happy, you're telling them to get lost. She said \"yes \". This is the Jack-in-the-Box at 9840 W Lower Buckeye Rd. Obviously they don't care about their customers and I would appreciate it if you would please help me by liking and sharing this page. Thanks  #BoycottJack-in-the-Box"}
{"text":"Brisa and Maria are by far the best managers they have on staff at this location. (I have yet to meet the GM) When they are on duty, their team is constantly working and performing tasks when they have downtime. They run a tight ship and I couldn't be more thankful for that. The entire staff is great and 100% helpful and very attentive.   I wish I could give this location and staff 10 stars for their performance they give us every single time we are inside this specific location. We have the opportunity to go to quite a few different locations, but because of the friendliness of the staff and the way the food is always on point (not to mention, they keep the restaurant CLEAN AT ALL TIMES), we keep coming back to this one and will continue to do so.   Thank you to everyone on staff for all of your hard work and dedication, you deserve to be noticed for this. I hope my review will get you guys a little closer to being noticed by upper management. See you all soon!  - Liz & Jay (aka the girls with the short hair )"}
{"text":"Omg worst service ever. Walked in with my Family ready to order while the girls their were just chatting and laughing talking about \"boobs\". Finally one turned back and walked over to take our order. \"Didn't look to happy no smile no hi\" anyways all the tables were dirty and the drink station was full of a mixture of soda and ketchup! I told one of the employees if she can please wipe a table down for me and wow she just smeared the table and walked away. Geee thanks! Never coming back that's for sure"}
{"text":"I only go for the oreo chocolate cookie shake and half the time I go there, their \"machine is down\".  I called when I got home to ask the question I didn't when I drove off aggravated, \"why the hell is your machine down all the time?\"  However, no one answered the call.  Nice.  Lost my business."}
{"text":"Late night stopped to get some food at our new neighborhood Jack in the box and was totally disappointed. They had us pull around to the parking lot and we waited 15 minutes. Then they brought us a bag of food that was not ours and argued that that was our order. We showed them our receipt and they said oh we gave that food away already. So then we had to wait another 15 minutes for them to make our order. When we got home our sourdough Jacks were not grilled so it was soggy bread and just not a sourdough jack, the onion rings were cold, but the curly fries were awesome.   This location needs a lot of work before I even attempt to try it again."}
{"text":"Consistently the worst service during late night I've ever had from any business. On top of being slow they are ALWAYS rude to us. And we're never even going there drunk or rowdy. My bf and I work late so we try to go here to grab easy dinner here and there and they're so awful. Also they shit off there shake machine by midnight like every night. I've come here as early as ten and they don't have shakes even though they close at 3 am. They're awful don't waste your time unless you want someone to yell at."}
{"text":"On my way to Mountain Vista Medical Center, with a limited restaurant selection in the area, I caved and went to J in the B. There is a Burger King under construction in close proximity, but I would have still opted for here rather than there. The service was courteous and the wait time was short for it being a fast-paced lunch hour. I was looking for a cheap bite; $5 or less was the goal. I ordered the junior bacon cheeseburger and 10 piece nuggets. The burger came out flat, but ok. Lots of bacon, though not much flavor. The nuggets came out piping hot and were the best part of the meal. There's a digital soda dispenser if you choose to dine-in. That was a nice touch. Overall, no strong complaints. It was the quick meal I needed on the outskirts of town."}
{"text":"Okay I know I'm giving a fast food place five stars but, the service and food is great here. The gentleman working the grave shift is always nice and courteous. Food INCLUDING fries are always fresh unlike so many other fast food joints.  Food may not be super fast due to employees making fresh products. I'm willing to wait. Thank you Jack In the Box-- Ft Apache."}
{"text":"They advertise that they are open 24 hours a day seven days a week, however, they are closed early between 330 and 430 in the morning. Garbage."}
{"text":"I am not a huge JITB fan, but I needs to gets my chicken nuggets fix now and again, and this happens to be the closest JITB to my house. The ladies who work the drive thru are so rediculously friendly here! They ask you how you are doing and when I asked her how she was doing, she replies that she feels very blessed! Not exactly what you expect to hear at your JITB drive thru! lol I don't know why, but I just love that! Positivity is contagious, I guess!  Other than all that, its a typical JITB.  Than again, I guess that really underscores the point that good customer service makes all the difference in the world!  I do love those chicken nuggets though! They are better than BK's and Mickey D's IMHO!  4 stars.  btw...is it just me..or are those \"Hot Mess\" commercials great?? lol   oh nm..  :P"}
{"text":"I would like to say to whoever was our server at midnight their service was unacceptable  at midnight always double check the order completely before serving it to the customers to whoever they purchase their meal well they need to either repeat the order back and always double check of the food is all there before giving their meal. If they don't they need to double the order next time. This is the second time they screw our order. If we ever go back they need to double our order or else I'll give this a no star added. This service is awful"}
{"text":"Drive thru takes a long time. Not sure if it was just a busy day but for drive thru they take too long. Tattoo covered girl keeps calling everyone honey like she knows everyone."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for breakfast. The drive thru line was long so I went inside. There was one person making food and one person taking orders for the front and drive thru. She just went back and forth,alternating taking orders inside and outside. There was a third guy just kinda walking around looking lost and not doing anything to help. Mngt really needs to schedule enough people to run the whole store."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Incompetent staff. Can't even get a simple order right and on top of getting everything completely wrong they couldn't even just give a drink for free to make up for their mistake. When someone says no fucking meat they probably don't eat dead animals :) please learn how to listen to people if you're going to be in the service industry. This is coming from someone who works in the industry myself."}
{"text":"Only eaten here once.  They charged me for but left  bacon off my sandwich.  Pretzel bun was dry."}
{"text":"So once again I got duped!!!  There once was a time when one could go to Jack in the box and get a nice hot and reasonably priced meal.  Those days are long gone!!!  This evening at about 11:30pm, I place an order an order.  Two tacos no lettuce, extra sauce, 3 piece jalapeño and the newly advertised bacon buttery jack.   I pay almost 12$.  Before I could leave the drive, I place my hand in the bag to feel ICE COLD tacos.  I wave at the cashier and explain to her, these are cold... LOL. I get \"Really they were just cooked.\"  I had her the entire bag with my complete order.  In my head I thin to myself this is your opportunity to make it ALL right.  Not more that 10sec later she returns with my bag.  I drive off.  I admit in that moment I should have checked the remainder of my order.  I get home not more than 3 minutes later.  No receipt, remaining items ICE COLD!!!  I wonder what an employee of the company would do if served these items. Why Can't I Get Fresh Food Here?!!  So disappointed!!!!  #jackintheboxsucks #neveragain  I in my teens worked at Jack in the box, and quality and freshness was of the utmost importance.  How things have changed!!!  I will be sure to tell everyone of my experience, and tell them to seek someplace else to spend their hard earned money.  I guess the we don't make it until you order it doesn't apply to actually cooking the product...hmm!!  I wish I could be a secret shopper.  There was a time that this happened back in the day.  They'd order an item from each station. Grill, fryer, and beverage all separate, that's how we'd assume it was a secret shopper. We'd make sure those orders were on point.  In my opinion all orders were on point. Now a days I can't say the same.  Who wants cold tacos, a rock hard patty, and cold jalapeño poppers, and no receipt...  Not me!!!!  I will be copying and pasting this!!!  #boycottjackinthebox .. Next to post on YELP."}
{"text":"As you can see a lot of reviews say this place isn't worth the time of day. However I received my food rather quickly. I do know the gentleman in front of me did wait quiet awhile though. The floors are dirty and got my shoes all sticky but at the same time it is a fast food restaurant (not saying a fast good place shouldn't be clean just saying it won't be spotless). It was awkward waiting for my car to get done here and having the 16 y/o cashier hitting on me when I'm not even giving her the time of day. I did end up getting free tacos though for waiting so long for my car haha so that's why they get 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Customer Service is horrible here! Today's experience triggered my leaving a review. But it started yesterday. I walked in and there's was no cashier. A older Spanish lady saw me but proceeded with drive thru without even acknowledging me. Not to mention there was already an older gentleman waiting on service a few minutes before me. I waited 3 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Finally the assist the customer before me and finally take my order. No apologies to either one of us even after we both expressed our disappointment.  Then today I'm in the drive thru and the register in the drive thru window was reading my bank card. Mind you I've purchased inside with no problem with the same bank card. They said I have to park and go inside for them to ring it up at the other register because they were concerned with their drive thru window time. Really!? I'm a drive they customer and I'm concerned with my time too! With only minutes left of my lunch hour I go inside and it literally took her NO MORE than 30 seconds to ring up my milkshake! All that for what!? For company stats!? I'm so disappoint and will NO longer give my business to this particular location."}
{"text":"First time at a Jack in the Box.  I feel like people rave about this place, but I don't get it.  We were the only people there and we waited forever to get our food.  It was around 7pm on a Sunday.  The food was nothing special, but it didn't make me sick or anything.  I wouldn't ever choose to eat it again.  I would go to the Starbucks next door and get a sandwich from them instead."}
{"text":"Their tacos are ok when you're in a hurry. I wish that Jack-In-the Box would get with it like McDonalds and offer $1 large soft drinks. That keeps me from patronizing Jack on a more consistent basis."}
{"text":"There are people who complain about their order getting messed up. You know what - it's hard for them to hear the drive-thru speaker box. Food gets messed up. It happens.   My review isn't based on that though.   My rating is based on my experience with an employee's lack of principles and morals. Order total was given, and I gave the cashier an amount that would give me change back.   Which he didn't give me.   When I asked about it, he turned the story around and stated that I had shortchanged him, refusing to print a receipt. Absolutely absurd."}
{"text":"Aweful!!!!!! Stopped by on our way to Az. How do you screw up a spicy chicken sandwich & a buttery jack? HERE..  Spicy chicken sandwich that had bacon on it and we got a double cheeseburger not a buttery jack with bacon on it the fries were cold and the rice bowl that we ordered with no chicken had \"chicken\" on it don't go here. They asked for the food back but I'm going to Arizona. Kiss it.."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant and ordered 2 chicken sandwich's and 2 jumbo jack jr I was expecting the food to be ready really quickly. I ended up sitting at a table and waiting for about 10 mins, during that time the CSR for the front was arguing and fighting with another worker in the kitchen area. Finally after several mins, my food was ready. As I was leaving the parking lot, I checked my order and to my amazement everything was wrong. As I walked in and started to explain that my order was wrong, the CSR cut me off and grabbed the bag and started once again arguing with the manager and the other employee that she had previously been fighting with. If everything could go wrong for those poor guys it did that night. I have them a star for showing up for work. Hire you a new CSR or Front person!"}
{"text":"Sick of this location refusing to serve me milkshakes anytime past 9pm it seems (sorry I work late) and claim \"the machine is down for the night \" aka \" I'm too lazy to clean the cup again screw you customer\" please fix this jack corporate and I'll delete. Just give a man a milkshake allready"}
{"text":"We had to wait quite awhile, but the food was hot and fresh. We arrived at midnight and there were a few groups ahead of ours.   A homeless man asked if we would would buy his dinner and another group offered him a drink.   Sketchy neighborhood but close to the strip."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here. I would rather eat my own fesces than this \"Jack in the Horrible Food.\" I ordered a hamburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions. I got a soggy, disgusting pile of trash with cheese and ketchup. If you see this review, NEVER EAT AT THIS HORRIBLE PLACE."}
{"text":"I had no idea that jack in the box had cronuts! Well I never really understood the hype since I'm not much of a donut lover but I've been craving something sweet so it seemed perfect. Basically it's a croissant in the shape of a donut, covered in cinnamon sugar. It's actually really good and a cheap alternative that you can get 24/7. Don't knock it til you try it."}
{"text":"Every time I go here the people are always nice. that new waffle breakfast sandwich was way better than i thot it wud be. beats mcdee's nasty equivalent. whatever its called. the cheesecake at JITB is too steal for! (i'm not dying for it lol). wish the rest of JITB's food was up to par."}
{"text":"Slowest drive - thru in the world. Don't know about the food yet.... still in line...."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful encounter at this Jack in the Box.  I had the worst experience at a different location and the manager at this location, Javier Rojas, stepped up and made things right- when the other location failed to do so. Javier was super nice and understanding of my frustration. He refunded me my money for the horrible, horrible service at the other location.  I will continue to come to this location as my JITB of preference.  Keep up the great customer service Javier!"}
{"text":"If I could have given them ZERO stars, I would have. Horrible customer service. Went thru the drive thru one night, and when i got to the window no one knew what they were doing. They handed me my drinks and the guy said \"diet coke\"... i'm like No,it should be coke. He didn't say anything else but walked away- leaving me to wonder if i have coke or diet coke. I was handed my food bags and as I moved forward i heard him say \"did you get all your food?\"  WTF? what do you mean, you are the person handing me the food and you don't know? I decided to pull over because of that comment and make sure I got all my food for sure. NOPE all my food was wrong. I was looking for my receipt in the bag, no receipt. I WAS NOT GIVEN A RECEIPT. I went inside and the cashier got the assistant manager on duty to help me. I told her I never got a receipt, she printed it out for me. Then I told her everything I was missing/wrong, which was almost the whole order. She went to the back and made the food herself but seemed annoyed the whole time. I was not given my money back or no comps for my inconvenience.  I went thru the drive thru to avoid getting out of my car, since my son was sleeping in the backseat. The employees here are a joke. They are allowed to be all tatted up and pierced and show all of it. Its very unprofessional. When I got home my food I thought was ok was not, no cheese on my cheeseburgers, and no syrup for my son's pancakes. My husband attempted to contact the manager or corporate and NO ONE at this location was helpful or apologetic. Joel or Joe the manager was very nasty, and refused to give my husband the corporate office phone number for to help make things right. He basically told us in a roundabout way to go Fuck ourselves.  I would suggest not ever wasting your time or money at this location. These employees do not care about you or getting your order right. When its wrong and you bring it to their attention, they treat you like scum. Like you are asking for a handout to get your correct order. We can go to any restaurant when we decide to eat out- I for sure will not be wasting my hard earned money at this dump. Do yourself a favor and go to a different location or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Whomever was working the drive thru this morning at around 9:16 (my receipt says his name is Antwon) please know that your smile made all the difference this morning. You were so sweet and so fast! My food ( a loaded breakfast sandwich combo) was delicious. Employees like you are what make the places you work great, so please never lose that wonderful smile of yours!"}
{"text":"Dirty inside, nothing stocked up. Gave me cold curly fries with my meal. They did however replace them."}
{"text":"Can't really judge the food or service because there was none. We were the only ones in the dining room and after standing at the counter for awhile we realized we were being ignored. Maybe they should have more employees on shift or just better ones"}
{"text":"Horrible. First my burger had no bacon which cost like 2 bucks extra. And when i go to call to get it corrected cause im not driving back due to it being midnight, there damn phone don't even work. The heavyset brod with the face piercing  has no customer service skills ever. Stick her behind the dam grill Or cleaning the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Best Jack in the Box I've been to. The lettuce was super fresh and crisp, which you don't get often at fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Decent location with the standard chain offerings. It's close to our apartment so it's easy to stop here on the way to / from work for a quick bite. The food is made correctly and comes out hot. The staff is friendly and efficient with keeping the line down both inside and in the drive-thru.  This location can be busy during the rush times, which is true of just about any fast food place as long as they are a decent stop. I'm sure I'll be back here again for a quick and easy meal with an \"a-ok\" vibe."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!! We stopped in for a bite, waited over 30 mins for our (very simple)order to be completed.  Staff wasn't rude, but couldn't tell if they had a pulse.   Awful awful. Next time it's the sonic next door!!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Tacos were fresh. Got off to use the restroom and was really surprised how clean it was inside."}
{"text":"I've had several unpleasant experiences here. A lot of the time the people aren't all that nice, last time I went there they had me wait for a while at the window and comes back and says \"uh... Can you like go around one more time?\"   I just look at her like.... Umm what's?.....   She goes \"yes!\" And nods......  There was no one behind me waiting, I literally had to drive around the building for no reason......  And the didn't give me one of the sandwiches I bought......   They need to work on there customer service and get it together"}
{"text":"This used to be a good location. haven't been here in a while and never will again.  so get a burger and drink and 2 tacos. guy at the window doesn't have gloves on. and he's digging around in the ice bin, chips flying... no doubt some are touching his skin. he then puts the ice in my cup some miss, so he picks the ice up off the counter with his bare hand and throws it into the cup...  i get home (4 min) drive and realized that he's been touching money and what not and his dirty hand put the ice in my cup. trashed that first thing at home. start in on the first taco and it's cold. 2nd was too, did not eat. They shouldn't call these tacos. They should call them pepper with organic bits. Threw those out too. 0 for 2 so threw out the rest. not gonna take chances to get some 1 or more random disease from these guys."}
{"text":"Stop off here a few times, never had a problem. Service is good, the only problem is not their fault. There is a lot of construction on the streets in the area."}
{"text":"This place is alot better than the one near my home. Service is a lot better, food is hot and the crew seems a lot more friendly!"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever! Then the cashier can't  get your order correct, or maybe it's the cook.  Whichever it is, I def think they need better management."}
{"text":"Good service here, they're never out of ingredients or anything like that. The buttery jacks are the best imo. There's lots of parking and lots of seating. The drive thru is fast too."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. It's unfortunate they're the only one in the area and luckily the staff are just competent enough to make the teriyaki bowl right, sometimes. If you enjoy being asked to wait at the order screen for 15 minutes (even though theres only then waiting 15 minutes to get to the window and another 5-10 minutes at the window regardless of the time of day, then this is the place for you. Hands the worst staff at any fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Place has improved a lot, but of course there is not too many customers at 5:00am on Saturday. But overall, it's getting better here. Figure since I am going through my 1-star ratings, I should give this place a better review!"}
{"text":"Been here on a couple occasions, wife works not to far from here. I'll stop off and get her lunch! How nice of me!!!! Jack in the Box is alright. I do love their jalapeno poppers! Wife loves their tacos!!! Which I do to, I DON'T CARE IF IT CONTAINS MOSTLY OF SOY!!!! Daughter likes their teriyaki chicken bowl! Service is like most other fast food joints. Overall it's not a bad place to visit, you get what you want!"}
{"text":"Wasn't to happy with the cleanliness of this location. The floor needed mopping and had a lot of flies. Wanted to give the kids apples with their kids meal, however they only had enough for one? I ordered a chicken salad, and they were out of the salad dressing that comes with the salad.  Noticed a lot of transient traffic at this location. We all still ate, and it was fine."}
{"text":"Ok, it's a J in the B.  Stupid to write a review.  But I rarely eat fast food and almost NEVER J in the B.    During a recent adventure in S Phoenix, I was in need of some lunch and this was the only place around.  Well, this and a Whattaburger, so my choices were pretty limited.  Wow.  This place is CLEAN.  And the woman who took my order was both FRIENDLY and COMPETENT.  My order came out QUICKLY and was CORRECT.  All things I usually never experience at fast food joints, or at least all at once.  5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered spicy chicken sandwich ask for extra lettuce and what I got was one skinny leaf disappointed they can't even get that right"}
{"text":"This jack in the box is independently owned and the service inside the restaurant is bad. I just waited almost 20 minutes for my food. When inquiring about it i was actually told that they take care of the drive thru first because they are timed on it. Will never go inside again!"}
{"text":"This is during the late hours. The MANAGER was very rude and said some very inappropriate things along the lines of \"Thanks for ordering a big order, we only have three people working and that made our day so thank you for that!\" As of this date 12/26/15 at approximately 12am, the guys needs to be fired for this. Will probably be calling for complaints about this. You should be professional wherever you work at regardless. Most terrible service ever! Worst of all Jack in the Box! Never got the name because he left right away after throwing the food at us."}
{"text":"Chicken was not crispy and was soggy and lettuce looked extra soggy. Looks like they are very rushed avoid this jack in the box if you can."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The staff is always polite and friendly, the food is usually hot and fresh. The mango tea is delicious!"}
{"text":"Fast food place so it is what it is. The place has always been clean when I am there but lunch is crowded so yes things can get messy as with any other place.    Drive through is my prefered method and is always fast and easy transaction with no order errors.  I love the chicken sourdough club and the curly fries.   I am not a fan of their breakfast menu items but for lunch this is a good place to get a quick meal."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often & it's usually good but tonight was the last night. The drive through server, Jessica, is so rude. Unbelievably rude. I'd go to the one down the street where people have customer service skills & not an attitude. Like you're working at jack in the box. I understand it sucks but if you can't brush it off & be kind to someone who is trusting you with their food you simply shouldn't work there. You do not stare someone down because you're tired of people going through the drive-thru. It's YOUR JOB. The manager however was awesome, I called & spoke with her, she made me feel better about the situation, if she's going to actually talk to her about it, I have no idea. But I won't be back."}
{"text":"I work late nights and often when I get off my dinner options are very limited. Just moved to this area from Henderson and have visited this place a few times. Can we just talk about the late night drive thru guy? Holy crap, this dude is the most cheerful and polite person I've ever encountered in any restaurant setting, fast food or otherwise. He never messes up my order and he is always on point. It can be 1 in the morning and this guy is just awesome! He was wearing a shirt that said \"boss\" on the back so hopefully jack in the box is paying him decently because with customer service skills like that he'd excel in any job he can find. The only negative thing I could say about this dude is he makes me question my own job performance. I'm a server at a restaurant working for tips and I'm not on this dude's customer service level.  Keep it up drive thru guy, you're the best!"}
{"text":"530 they were slow no one in drive thru....the lady was clearly in a rush, I had to keep asking her to add because after each item she would give me total and told me second window, then she said I'm all set after paying and she forgot to give me my shake,I felt as though she was busy doing something else, even though there was no one present.  Terrible service, shakes were below average, burgers were good and so were churros...."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch because I had a mad craving for a milkshake and who could possibly turn down an Oreo milkshake? Crazy people that's who. Anyways, I went and ordered my delicious shake. Fantastic flavor. Greatness in the mouth. I have one complaint about it. Not so much a complaint, just disappointed. I ordered this amazing milkshake but nobody came to my yard. It was bare. Not a soul around. Bought this thinking it was gonna bring them all to the yard. Hopefully next time they will follow through and my yard will be flooded with them."}
{"text":"For fast food yack in the box they had fresher fries drive through staff  were great you could even understand  them huge pulse for us... thank you,thank you!!"}
{"text":"Do you enjoy Jack in the Box milkshakes? If so then don't come here because the machine is ALWAYS \"getting cleaned\"  or \"broken\"  seriously! It's happened to me at least 4 times."}
{"text":"They do not even deserve a 1 star. I went through drive thru and he told me to pull to the front and my food should be right out and i was understanding about it, but we waited for 30 minuets which is really disturbing then come to find out, i get home and all my foods are burnt i ordered the simple (3)2 tacos for $1all of it is burnt My brother bit in to one taco and black grease was coming out of it, i ordered #15 Chicken fajita pita with no tomatoes and there was tomatoes in it not only that my chicken is tar burnt and my pita bread is hard as a rock. I am beyond pissed off this is the worst that i have ever came across. Im not one to post reviews but this is something people need to know. Sahara and Ft Apache. I want a manager to contact me or i will go to corporate and call the news channel."}
{"text":"I was there early at 430 am. They cater to me just the same. With a great smile and prompt! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru today for the 2 for $4.00 crescent  special. I wanted 2 orders which would make it $ 8 plus tax. However I wanted scrambled egg which they charge extra for .49 cents. Somehow our order was going to be $ 17.36 cents ! I'm shook!! So I cancelled order. Pay attention to what your being charged folks cause they are charging for things that don't make sense."}
{"text":"Well leave it to JIB to find a way to enhance the already disgusting flavor of their dog food tasting hamburgers, introducing their  Ribeye burger. Worse flavor than their other burgers and served cold on a thick doughy bun. Shortly after eating it you will have the irresistable urge to vomit. No stars for this location. Cold burger on cold cheese. Why do I even waste my money thinking that they could possibly ever make a real burger."}
{"text":"This has happened to me a few times... Today, December 30th at 2:30am we came to the drive thru (which clearly states \"open 24 hours\") and whoever was working inside completely ignored us. We waiting there for 10min before driving away and going to del taco right next to it. Even when you do eat here, they're always rude and act like they hate their jobs."}
{"text":"If you are rushing from point A to point B, and find yourself at the intersection of 27th Ave and Camelback, this Jack In The Box will get your order right.  I've picked up many a Diet Coke here, plus the occasional lunch.  Sometimes it's busy, but you can count on friendly service and accurate order fulfillment."}
{"text":"Tried to come at 1028 for a food run and the guy tells me he isn't serving food anymore. Said car in front of me was the last order for the night. I asked what time he closed and he said I'm done taking orders for the night. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Not that great, workers don't wear gloves often and hamburger meat be dry most visits so I stopped going overall. The cleanliness of the kitchen and overall hygiene is poor."}
{"text":"I get off work pretty late. So when Im hungry and lazy to make food, I go to Jacc because it is very close to my home. I believe the person that works the grave shift is named Hector? Everytime that I order with him, I never have to double checc my order and he is very fast and always in a good mood."}
{"text":"Jack in the Box is usually fine, but I will never return to this one. I usually would stop at this particular location after a late shift at work and I'm hungry (nothing else is open). There is this specific employee who works the 10-6 AM shift (he specifically told me), who constantly makes inappropriate flirtatious comments that make me incredibly uncomfortable. He clearly cannot tell that it makes me feel weird even though I've made it explicitly obvious that no, I do not want to exchange phone numbers and I don't want you to take me out. I will never return, very unprofessional."}
{"text":"So earlier this morning. Let's always around 4 am I pull through the drive thru and order my food. Of course pull up to the window gave this employee by the name of Lamar $20 for food of around $5 and some odd change!! I get back freaking $4!!!! I questioned in and even told him I know I have him $20 and this fool is gonna tell me he know he gave it to me and he seen it with his own eyes!! And said he was about to close his drawer and I could come inside to count with him!! Like what the hell!!! Needless to say he stole $10 from me. Merry Christmas asshole!! Must needed it bad. Then I call the store to complain and no one answers, so then I call the number on the receipt and tried to leave a comment In which they took the my negative and turned into a positive."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ever try Jack in the Box - they have always let me down. I was in a hurry - the person at the drive through was too apparently - she gave me my food fast and left - no receipt. I waited so I could ask her for it for a good couple minutes...beeped horn... beep again... I go inside the store, now upset to get receipt. Manager greets me - can see I'm upset - I tell him what's up - he says he heard me beeping. Yet he didn't nothing - what a manager. Anyway the service at this location is so awful, I won't be back and don't recommend this location - theirs a Wendy's across the street FYI."}
{"text":"The new Bacon Insider is DELICIOUS!!! I'm so shocked that this quality of sandwich is a quick drive up the road to my local JnB's!!! Who knew! I do and now I am able to enter Burger heaven any time I please. Too bad everything else in life can't be this simple.  Oh yeah, the store was clean, I received my food in record time and the strawberry Fanta was very fizzy. What more can you expect from a JnB? Exactly..."}
{"text":"Went here at 11 on Saturday night to get something quick to eat. Placed order at drive thru, paid, and was asked to drive out front and wait a few minutes for my food to finish. After 25 minutes, I went inside to inquire about my order and was screamed at by the employee working behind the counter. The employee ended up throwing my money back at me while continuing to scream. I do not think I will be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"(+) -option of ordering at the kiosk instead of waiting in line  (-) -dirty -ghetto -small -locked bathroom that you have to ask the cashier person to open.   I didnt order anything but i used the bathroom, they press something from inside that unlocks it. its not very clean....  my friends ordered from the kiosk which was handy and easy, no problems getting what they wanted.  small, only 10ish tables for 4 and 2 tables for 2.  this place is ghetto, sooooooo ghetto. unless you reeeeally want those 2 for a dollar tacos, go to in and out across the street instead (bigger, cleaner, but longer lines)  wish i wouldve read these reviews beforehand, wouldve avoided this place."}
{"text":"El peor drive through en el que haya pasado. El joven despachador súper despistado, atendiendo de muy mala manera. Le estuve llamando más de 5 veces para que me cambiara en popote por qué el que me dio estaba abierto y mordido. Además pregunte por aderezo y croutons de la southwest salad, y de muy mala manera me dijo \" yeah yeah\" like telling me cállate. Luego cuando por fin me dio el popote que le pedí yo le regrese el otro para que lo tirara y me mira y otra vez de mala manera me dice \" was is wrong with the straw\" by looking at me like, what else do you want?. La verdad no quise ni bajarme a quejarme por que iba con mi niña y era mi cumple y no tenía tiempo para esta jovencito. Maybe he was having a bad day or I don't know, but that is not the way to treat your customers."}
{"text":"This is the worst Jack In the Box EVER!!! Not only is it completely over priced , but the quality of food you get is terrible... today I ordered a regular hamburger plain, got home and the burger and bun is as hard as a rock!! Really people you have a responsibility to make at least a quality of food that is eatable!!!! And you can't even do that. No one in the restaurant no one in the drive through except me and still can't get decent food!!!! Terrible just terrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean with friendly professional staff. Only issue is there is one soda dispenser. It has 25+ options for soda with a touch video screen. Each customer stares at it in shock and flips past endless options of drink choices. Only one customer at a time can use it and the average person takes 3-4 minutes deciding what they want, pulls their drink choice and how much ice they want. Long story short, if you have 4 people ahead of you, it can take 10-12 mins just to get a drink. Fail."}
{"text":"Terrible doesn't begin to describe the service or food at this joint. We all know the difference between great (OMG, this is the best burger I've had in a while), good (meh, don't judge me. I was hungry) and gross (ok, this is coming back up) fast food. This Jack in the Crack's selection is one of the worse I've ever had the misfortune of eating. The fries were cold - both regular and curly, the lettuce was soggy, the buns fell apart and the cheese was literally non-existent. No kidding. They forgot the cheese on all three of my kids' Jr. Jacks...but charged me for it, of course. Did I mention that I even asked the chick at the window if she put cheese on the burgers, and she had the audacity to say yes? No?? Well, yeah. There was that, too. Perhaps the whole fiasco was my fault for violating Cardinal Rule Numero Uno of the Drive-Thru Handbook. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE DRIVING AWAY. Or maybe it was due to the window lady's \"stellar\" customer service, \"winning\" attitude and \"eagerness\" to please. Who knows? Either way, you couldn't get me to go back to this place for all the money in the Megabucks machine. Alright, maybe then I would. But it would only be to buy it, tear it down and turn it into an extension of The Sushi, which is in the same parking lot. Now THAT spot is the business! As a matter of fact, just go there instead."}
{"text":"Service is bad and they can never get you order right last 3 times everything had been burnt"}
{"text":"I have been going here about once a week for almost 2 years. Ruby is usually working and she awesome. My order is always right. Ruby, valetine, and whoever makes the food in the kitchen is great. I see bad reviews on here but maybe because im there for lunch the night crew is different? The location is in a bad area but that should reflect the store itself because they do a great job. The employees are friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"I stopped by at that shop three days in a row for early breakfast. They have a lot of reason not to take order. That is not 24hrs shop."}
{"text":"I try not to eat fast food, but when I do I pick Jack In the Box. The food is prepared quickly and look very similar to how it looks in the picture in the menu. The food has kind of a greasy taste if I order anything that's deep fried, so I try to avoid those items on the menu. Good for a quick bite for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"This Jack In The Box is located on Washington and Decatur. I last visited this place January 6, 2016.  Atmosphere: Nothing Special It's really the people who make up the atmosphere. The neighborhood in which this Jack In The Box is located is not necessarily the best neighborhood, so there might be some shady looking individuals on your next visit. There are plenty of places to sit, but coming in during the week day around lunch time expect this place to be a little crowded, especially since there is a high school right down the road.  Service: Good, but nothing extraordinary I was served right away and my food came to me in a timely fashion.   Food: No Strings Attached, Up to Par I ordered a Sourdough Jack. Tasted like any other sour dough burger I've had from Jack In The Box. The bun was toasted, the bacon was crispy, and the burger was warm.  Overall: OK Nothing truly memorable from my last visit other than seeing some shady customers walk in and out of the restaurant. Luckily, the staff isn't shady at all, so don't worry about your order being compromised."}
{"text":"Jack is usually pretty on point, this one is lacking a lot. Stopped by for breakfast for my 2 kids and I, i order for one kid and was told to go to the window for total, even though I said I had more to order, I was told my total and to go order the rest at the window, my other kid didn't get to order and was done by then so I didn't order either.  I thought they were in the business of food services,  apparently not this one."}
{"text":"The customer service you receive at this location is horrid. The staff is so rude and unwelcoming that you can't help but to never step foot at this location.   We ordered food through the drive through and they rudely requested that we pull in front of the building so they can bring it to us.   The woman that was working at the drive though seemed like she didn't enjoy her job and was taking out the frustrations on the customers. I really  don't think that they understand that the only reason they are up and running is because of customers.   At this economy I really wish that people were appreciative to have a job. These employees really need training or to be replaced with friendlier individuals.   Regardless of that, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place. A couple months ago I tried Jack in a Box for the first time because they sent me a free birthday dessert. After that, we kept receiving emails from them on their specials and we decided to try some of their deals. We tried the late night munchies deal and that was a disaster. The burgers had no flavor and they were poorly put together, the tacos are as flat as a sheet and the shells taste stale. The only thing I liked from the box was the French fries. We thought that the poor quality of the food was just because it was a late night special so we gave jack in a box another chance. A couple days later we tried one of their barbecue signature burgers, it was also disappointing. It tasted like someone took a cold patty and dipped it in BBQ sauce before they served it in a bun. I try to stay away from jack in a box because I have not been pleased with the quality."}
{"text":"Wanted to order the jalapeño bacon burrito. Big picture on the drive-thru menu  but no price. So I ordered a breakfast Jack. When I asked the cashier about the price of the burrito, she took my money and said, \"thank you,\" in a very mechanic voice."}
{"text":"By far the worst Jack in the box. I avoid this location but rare occasions running late and it's the only thing open to grab breakfast near work. Every single time they are either rude, line backed up and or they mess your order up.  Today girl had attitude when I asked her to repeat my order at the window.  I asked for 3 sweet n low packets for my iced tea. Attitude again so she hands me a handful. I asked for three. I tried to given them back and she walked away and the window was open and wind blew a few back inside. Then another girl with attitude said something to her then she turns and gives me attitude. At this point I wish I could have pulled away but they already had my money. 14 minutes after pulling up to speaker I get my food. I get too work and it's wrong.  You had the nerve to get upset when I asked you to repeat my Oder and you still messed it up.  The only good thing I can say is when I called the girl that answered was  friendly. That was a first."}
{"text":"My experience at Jack-in-the-Box was great the staff was friendly my food was hot I didn't have a problem I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'll take a pass  Jack in the box has been in the business of serving food for a very long time and their service is usually fast, friendly, accurate, and the food hot and fresh. However, on this visit that wasn't the case, actually the last several visits, have been less than favorable. On this particular visit the food was not fresh or hot.  The burger patties at Jack in the Box aren't thick, however, the lettuce, tomato,onion, pickle, mustard, and bun usually makeup for it. However, this time I just wanted a hot fresh plain hamburger. What I received was a dried, burnt, piece of meat that looked like it was extremely old and NO amount of condiments would have made this food taste good. I tried calling the store for 30 minutes with no luck, kept getting a busy signal.   I'm not sure what was worse, trying to call the store and constantly getting a busy signal, the lack of customer service, or poorly executed food.  If this is the first time I experienced poor service and food I would write it off. However, this is by far the first time, needless say, I will never come back to this Jack and the Box again."}
{"text":"So I just went through the drive-thru and purchased their new BBQ Bacon cheeseburger meal. I choose the spicy BBQ. Arrived home and was disappointed. First off, it was put together very sloppy. Second the hamburger patty was very small, which I don't understand. I think they put the wrong patty on. So all I was eating was the bun. That's why I hate going through the drive-thru because if I ate there I could have showed them and complain. But sometimes your just ready to be home.  The flavors were good but the overall experience was very poor. Jack in the box is not cheap so I would expect what I see on your commercials and poster to be what I get. Not a messy, sloppy, very small patty meal that I received."}
{"text":"Will  do in a pinich  Jack in the box has been in the business of serving food for a very long time.   You can't make it in the fast food industry for as long as Jack in the Box has without serving you qualiry food.  The service at Jack in the Box is always fast friendly and accurate my nephew and I order our food, go to a table, and before we know are number is being called.   The food is fresh, hot, and pretty good for a fast food establishment.  The burger patties at Jack in the Box aren't thick, however, the lettuce, tomato,onion, pickle, mustard, and bun makeup for it.  So when we need something fast, good, and inexpensive, Jack in the Box will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Fast Service  Today we stopped at Jack in the Box for a quick lunch, tacos, eggrolls, chicken nuggets, and curly fries. We were greeted as we entered, and our orders were taken promptly. After placing our orders it was challenging finding a clean table, as most of the tables were left dirty.  Our food was brought to the table quickly, and our items were hot and fresh.  My only complaint was, in the chicken nugget meal we were given a tiny piece of chicken that appeared to be a small broken piece and it was actually counted as being a nugget.  The staff was polite and courteous. A typical Jack in the Box by all standards."}
{"text":"This place serves some really good menu items, it's just in a bad location. Business has shrunk due to the lightrail construction making it impossible to get in and out of since things are a mess and will be for quite some time until the construction is complete.  Their service is great and that's what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly people, quick service. All the things I like in a fast food place!  Very seldom have they botched my order or forgotten an item. When they do, they are quick to correct the problem.   Looking for guilty pleasures? Look no further than Jack In The Box for their delicious items."}
{"text":"I go to this Jack In The Box on the way to work, usually grabbing breakfast. Their crew is always on the ball, very upbeat and accomodating. They are always quick with my food and always double-checks to make sure everything I ordered is there before I leave the drive-up."}
{"text":"I was running late and hadn't had lunch yet so I swung by Jack in the Box. I didn't even know what they had on the menu. It was my first time since I just moved here from another country. I chose SOURDOUGH JACK and was surprised at how good it was. The sourdough bread was perfectly toasted. It had enough dressing, the tomatoes were juicy (and dripped onto my shirt!) The patty tasted good and not bland like other fast food burgers. A pleasant and delicious surprise for a fast food burger!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location that I've ever been too. You have a gentleman by the name of Antwain who should not be working the drive-thru. We waited in the dribe-thru line for over 35 minutes. This guy is moving so slow while the cook in the back is running around. This employee was so busy scratching his head and dancing not caring about the customer in front of him. Will not be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"This is my go to Jack-in-the-Box I live right down the street always fast always friendly always get my orders right please go here if you're around town! :) ok this Jack has stepped it up !! New staff , new attitude ! My jack in the box is better than before keep it up !!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Asked for a big variety is sauces for the nuggets I got. Specified a lactose condition got every sauce including grape jelly."}
{"text":"So my problem is their is a blonde manager lady that clearly hates her job . I pull up Friday and order a double jack mean with regular fries and a rootbeer . I get to the window , she is scrolling on her phone . Cool idc . But she then grabs curly fries , fingers touching them mind you , after touching a phone she probably takes all over he store and bathroom . So I reminder that bag isn't mine as I was watching her , she seemed confused looked in the bag went and got the right fries . I drive all the way home and the burger is the regular jumbo jack not the double but the regular but I paid for the double which is a couple dollars more .. okay whatever I let it pass ..   THE NEXT DAY!!  Same girl I ordered  -#12 medium with rootbeer  -double jack with sprite and regular fries  -kids meal -2 tacos  -cheesecake   They didn't have the cheesecake so she gave me 2 cakes , kids meal was fine . She didn't give me my sandwich for my #12 , didn't even ring up the tacos . This girl is not paying attention and it's beyond frustrating . Bring the boy manager back more often he gets the orders right ... I rarely go here but I may not even go back it's so frustrating ."}
{"text":"Here's why this place gets 5 stars from me:  CHARLENE!!!!!  She is truly terrific and has an award-winning smile!  Special requests don't \"bother\" her one bit, and she is one of the very few fast-food workers to whom I have given a TIP.  Two other outstanding employees are Pola and Ermisa.  I really enjoy stopping here and almost always use the drive-thru."}
{"text":"They always shut down their system at like 4 am super annoying and incredibly unprofessional. If you're 24 hours you don't get to close for an hour to \"reboot your system\". The other jack in the box at least accepts cash when they do this so they don't drive away all buisness."}
{"text":"Young guy always working weekends around 3 am is amazing. So nice and accommodating I really enjoy this location. Fast fresh food with great service."}
{"text":"The staff treated me okay.  There was a manager that served me breakfast who was WAY chipper for being there so early, but that is kind of a good thing I suppose.  Never been a big fan of JIB's burgers but I like their breakfasts.  Used to be a fan of the Chicken Fajita Pita ... Might I may have to try that again soon when I get a new job....."}
{"text":"We didn't expect a lot given we went to this location at midnight, however we tried getting in to the restaurant and it was closed. This was fine, because we were ordering an Uber anyway. We ordered 20$ worth of food and didn't receive any curly Frys - we had some disappointed people after having ordered an Uber essentially just to get food here. I tried calling but received no response 1/5"}
{"text":"Brenda the cashier is very friendly and speaks Mandarin, Spanish, and English. She is a great asset to this place. My order is always right and get it fast."}
{"text":"Every time I come here past 9 pm, the shake machine is \"out of shakes\" or the machine is \"down for cleaning\". This is a trend I have been seeing with all jack in the boxes.   I came to this location 2 weeks ago at 10...the machine was down and I asked how long to clean it and they said an hour or two to have shakes working again..I came back at 3 am and they said the machine was still down.   This place is supposed to be 24 hours everything on the menu, however the employees seem to decide what is 24 hours.   I will not be returning back to this location again."}
{"text":"Still trying to figure out why it says the hours are 24/7 but after waiting in line was told they stop taking orders at 4am."}
{"text":"Nice location, conveniently connected to a Chevron gas station, service is friendly, food is well prepared, clean restaurant.  Brought a friend from out of town there who had never tried Jack in the Box, he loved it.  Not much more you can ask from Jack, works for me."}
{"text":"Always messing up my order. It's really irritating ! They need to pay attention. It's not the company's fault, grrrrrr employees!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the problem is. I have been through drive through twice since moving here. Both times I ordered a double Jack with just tomatoes, nothing else on it, dry, no ketchup, no mustard, no lettuce, just tomatoes, I made this super clear, both times screwed up by a pretty unfriendly cashier, I went to Dairy Queen to get a pop afterwards, amazing service, friendly, prompt, a world of difference.  This is how you lose customers for life. You don't show concern, people leave and there is solo much competition in Arizona for burgers, get it together or go. I'm done."}
{"text":"America is doomed. Stopped in the drive through tonight to order a strawberry shake. I had ordered one two days ago and I never eat at fast food places, so this was a treat. As I'm sipping on my shake two days ago, I'll admit it was delicious. As I got toward the middle or end of the shake, unnoticed it was very gritty. I though it was odd, but racked it up to it possibly being the flavoring. I assumed it was a powder flavoring. I went back tonight to give it another try. In the drive through, I asked the gal on the mic how they flavored their shakes because my last one was gritty to which she replied, \"pretty?\". I said,  \"No, it was gritty. How do you flavor your shakes?\". She says, \"We use a syrup.\". So I asked, \"What would have caused my shake to be gritty?\". She says, \"Pretty?\" I said, G-R-I-T-T-Y spelling it out for her. She says, I'm sorry, I don't know what that means.\" I said that it was obvious and backed out of the drive through. True story. We are doomed America. Doomed."}
{"text":"I like that they actually store the buttermilk cups (aka ranch) in the cooler, the way it's ment to be.  Fast drive thru service and a semi-friendly employee that was very presentable."}
{"text":"Very good service at this jack. I was real surprised. Drive thru lady which name was perry had a super sweet voice and was very kind at the window. Perry was very nice and didn't hesitate to give me extra sauces. Very good attitude. She's a good employee."}
{"text":"Pretty decent location located at the very end of the strip! You literally pass the Mandalay Bay and on your right hand side ( depending on which way you are coming from) this spot will be located right in the same parking lot as the Chevron gas station! I pulled in a little after midnight and of course there was a line because it's the weekend! I was satisfied with how fast they moved these cars! I'm sure many of these other Jack in the Cracks can take some notes from this location. My order was repeated back to me and when I pulled around even the face to face interaction with the employee was decent! I might have to come to this location more often whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I will go ahead and give this jack n the box a solid 3 stars for the lack of listening skills. I've been to this location multiple times and they get my order right about 70% of the time! This most recent visit was worth talking about because of the situation. No because I'm a loyal customer to the mini churros I know how they should be made and how they should be prepared for the most part! Just the other day I came to the drive thru and ordered my churros and after I left I go to bite one and it's as plain as a white colored wall.. No flavor or sugar.. I get these enough to know they were extremely in a rush and didn't put enough of the sugar. The part that was upsetting was when I went back to exchange them the cashier told me they'd make me a fresh batch and put more sugar. The woman working in the kitchen was bring a smart ass and filled my whole damn box up with sugar. To a point that it was ridiculous. I couldn't believe it but all I would've liked was a generous amount not the whole bottle! Smh won't be back to this location!"}
{"text":"The drive thru was ridiculous on the day I decided to come.. go figure. The fact that I don't eat much fast food and had to be barricaded between cars just to get an order as simple as some fries and a cheeseburger really blows my mind. The only fast food burger joint that deserves my kind of time in the drive thru would be IN-N-OUT burger. Will I return? All depends..."}
{"text":"Jack In the box hands down is the best after the club food lol. I'm so glad they brought back the bacon cheddar potatoe wedges! This location on rainbow isn't quite my favorite location I prefer the one on Flamingo and Durango or even the one up on Ft.Apache and Tropicana! Reason being is the late night crew that works tends to be not only slow but rude! Not a great combo when you are trying to sober up after a hard night of partying! What can I expect though from a fast food place other than the greasy unhealthy food that I will not continue to stop eating lol! Go Jack' N The Box!"}
{"text":"Okay I know it's only Jack In The Box but Damn Man.. Can it get any worse? I pull in the drive thru around 2:15 AM and didn't get to place my order until about 5-7 minutes later, to then sit in the line for another 10-15 minutes. I get to the window and the guy who is working drive thru goes \" I'm sorry sir we didn't get your order, what was it\"? I literally had that face like YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME .... So he then rings my order up right at the window which obviously means I have to wait even more time for my food to cook. If you're following along and math is your best subject you should know that I spent a total of 15-20 minutes just for my food! IN THE DRIVE THRU! WHY? And it didn't help any that I was extremely hungry and my attitude on 10! Do Better MR JACK IN THE CRACK! Thanks! -Management"}
{"text":"Closest location to my house! Have pretty fast service and the food is usually FRESH and that's probably because when I arrive in the drive thru I always disclose that I want my burgers made fresh and nothing that's been sitting in a tray or been sitting all night! Reality is anybody who knows the fast food business knows the procedures and with that being said I was my stuff fresh off the grill and don't care if I have to park and wait additional time! The employees at this location who work either the swing and or grave shifts are all great and have very good customer service that's enough to keep me coming back and oh yeah the great food that I don't need to be eating lol!"}
{"text":"Jack In The Crack! We go waaayy back I mean I practically lived at Jack In The Box during high school days because it was the hang out spot afterschool. This location is pretty far from my house but I have a doctor on this side of town so today I decided to stop by. The drive thru actually was empty and the inside was packed. Because it is a million degrees outside I wanted one of the Oreo Milkshakes! Improved over the years because they use to be too watery. Occasionally Jack In The Box sends out coupons and I happened to snag one of the ones for a $1 off any size shake. Utilized that bad boy today and went on my merry way! Fast service and the employees were nice. It's fast food.. What else can I say?"}
{"text":"They Are Open 24hours  They close dining room @ midnite  U will b refused service to walk thru drive thru  I will b denied bn served   Up yours Truly, Triqxee"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's just a Jack in the Box. Some times referred to as Jack in the Crack. It has the same exact menu and taste as all their other convenient locations. I go to Jack in the Box when I am broke and I usually order the 2 tacos for 99 vents and a jumbo jack. That's a nice meal for under 5 bucks! I love the tacos even after finding out the mysterious meat in the tacos was actually soy. Put some of their strange taco sauce on it and it taste like food to me. This location is strange. There are some hours when the restaraunt is full of tourist getting a bite. Then early mornings and odd hours of the day it becomes a homeless hangout. With a dollar menu anyone can get enough change to get a item and hang out and eat. That is the time I use the drive thru. Be cautious when exiting the drive thru roll up your window. I have been trapped trying to get out to the road with someone begging for the tacos I just ordered.  The service is excellent. Everyone is friendly and they always have at least one person working that speaks good English. They are fast and always have smile. If you happen to be hungry and you are in the area, be assured that you will have the same Experience here that you would have at any other Crap in the Box!"}
{"text":"No stars for this place. Called my wife a fat bitch for ordering $52 worth of food in the drive through for a family of 6 wtf. Manager was to busy to except my calls, contacted their corporate but guess what it cost to much to retrain so let's give you a gift card!!! So much for customer service service."}
{"text":"First timer here ever trying Jack In the Box.. I had heard some mixed reviews. Always either \"I love their burgers, you have to try so and so\" or \"it is awful..\" Never in between.  I was very pleasantly surprised with my drive through experience. I decided to go with the Bacon & Swiss Buttery Jack and curly fries (I didn't know they had curly fries.. Heck yea!!). It was all so good.. You could definitely taste the garlic herb butter and bacon mayo on the burger. It was for sure one of the better fast food burgers I have ever had, and curly fries are always good. They are very similar in taste to Arby's curly fries, golden and crispy.   For some reason there are no Jack In the Box locations remotely close to Raleigh, that I am aware of. This is probably a good thing because I think I will have to go to the gym for a whole week to work this meal off.."}
{"text":"Jack in the crack has gone way down hill... This one is a true example. I used to eat at JIB 20 years ago and think it was a good fast food option... Not any longer the food is gross! Portions small, they over charge for bad food. This location has very poor service. Last visit was 2 years ago... Never again!"}
{"text":"Elijah took our order and was super patient with me debating over curly fries or regular fries. I'm surprised to see that there was an actual water pitcher with ice provided on the cashier counter along with coffee. The soda machine was also a touch screen with so many options to mix your drinks. This place is by far the cleanest jack n the box I have been too!"}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box deserves to finally be commended on being an upstanding business in my community! Ever so conveniently located in the same parking lot as Smiths, I often trick my husband into running in the grocery store while I \"wait\" for him! When in reality he often catches me in the drive thru getting an egg roll and a small fry!   The food is usually fresh, crisp fries, whole curly fries, and not bits! The sourdough bread is a always a great way to improve any value menu sandwich, and the egg rolls are sadly better than any Asian restaurant in the area!   If your into fast food and in the area you definitely can't go wrong at Jacks!"}
{"text":"I like Jack in The Box. Good fast food. This particular location is in a very dicey part of town. Drug dealers, hookers and hoes, and homeless people standing near property. As I was leaving parking lot I was approached by homeless man."}
{"text":"I live very close to this place and when I need a bit to eat late at night I've occasionally been forced to visit here.  This is consistently one of the slowest drive thrus I've ever been to.  Consistent lack luster service.  Be sure to check your bag before you drive away as there's always a 50/50 chance they'll get your order wrong.  My advice is avoid this place if you can. Unfortunately I'll probably eat here again as it's right across the street from me and there's few other choices in the wee hours of the morning."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently for lunch. I ordered a chicken sandwich combo to go.  The two guys working the front counter had the enthusiasm of a couple of rocks. It looked like it was an effort for them to even take a step. I understand it's probably not the best job in the world but there are people like me who recruit our employees from people we run into during our day to day activities. These two have zero chances of being recruited to work somewhere else.  I also had to ask for the fries that went with my combo. I got them, but only after a heavy sigh from one of the two at the counter. You would have thought I'd asked him to come outside and change my tire rather then just asking them for a bag of fries.  The food was mediocre, probably a three. But the lack of enthusiastic service definitely drops it to a two."}
{"text":"The people who work here are extremely rude. They don't say hello, they barely act like they want to take your order. Don't even wait for the thank you at the end of your transaction. I only come here when I need coffee for the drive back to LA.   I'm thinking I'm going to have to find another coffee spot!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. People making food without gloves and working with food right after mopping the floors, again without gloves. Messed up our order and poor customer service. I usually love Jack in the Box but this place is just disgustingly unsanitary."}
{"text":"So the only things I like at Jack in the box is their Munchie meals and Milkshakes.  They are both very good and fill the fast food craving.  The stacked Grilled Cheeseburger is very nice and is a meal in itself.  The included tacos and pretty good but on the greasy side.  That makes them tasty but you can feel your arteries harden with each bite.  The included fries are the mix of standard and curly but you can choose either one if you have a preference.  We also had the Chicken Tater Melt which was surprisingly delicious.      The Munchie Meals are $6 after 9PM which is a great deal for the amount of food you get.  The Milkshakes are creamy and delicious.  With the yummy whipped cream they are a welcome sweet treat.  I don't eat at Jack's often but when I do it is always the fast food I love and expect.  Nothing fancy just quick and good."}
{"text":"Shut this place down. Fire everyone that works here. This is the last time I will ever go here. I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt but they have screwed up my order every time I have come here since I moved to Phoenix 3 months ago. I'm not exaggerating. Every order through the drive thru has been wrong. Whether it is missed tacos or the wrong burger. Either I'm the most unlucky person or this place messes up everyone's order. You ask for no tomato, nope, you get tomatoes. You order 2 tacos, guess what when you get home, no tacos. I would fire every employee for incompetence and either start over or close this location for inability to find employees that can read. Let alone take an order. Pathetic. No stars. Zero. Fire the whole staff."}
{"text":"I arrive and 1:30 am I have to go in twice through the drive  through to get more then 1 order, i order a large fry and it has a reddish hair!? Absurd and then I go through the second time my medium fries turn into a small fry no bang for you buck here:/"}
{"text":"I've always had great customer service from this location no matter what time I go. I've gone from breakfast in the morning to late late night snacks. I usually get potato wedges so I just wish they were a bit more consistent with how much cheese sauce they use. Though, that's just to be expected at drive-thru fast food."}
{"text":"As far as Jack in the Box goes, this place was definitely on top of it. The food is typical with the rest of the chain, but the service here was great. We had 3 separate orders in one car and they got them all correct, even the little things like 'no pickles.' We pulled around to the window and the guy was friendly, made a couple jokes, and gave us tons of ketchup when we said we wanted more. The food was done quickly, came out hot, and seemed fresh.   Here's what moved it up from 4 stars to 5: In each bag (3 separate orders, remember?) there were THREE ranch containers along with the ketchup. 3 ranch dips for every person and we didn't even have to ask for them!! I don't care how trivial that seems, for a fast food chain they're going above and beyond.  And it's in the same parking lot as an Arco/AMPM, so this is the perfect stop to eat and gas up before leaving the Vegas area altogether. It's about 20 minutes away from the strip, right off the 15."}
{"text":"This place is unsanitary! I usually come once in a while but they need to train their workers more and how they serve food is gross. They don't even use gloves and I too work in food and beverage and when handle food we have to always use gloves no matter what! One time I went there through the drive-thru this one girl wasn't wearing glove nor did she have her hair up, this other time this was at 4am one lady was handling the trash can and the she touched my food! I don't know how some people can work like this and they handle food like that? Gross that's how people get sick!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the great service and you are very friendly.  Good hot food. You saved the day."}
{"text":"I don't live that close to this place, and it's a treat to drop by here to grab their delicious burgers and curly fries.  We always go through the drive thru and never had a problem with an order or service.  Their burgers have a perfect combination of juicy and greasy. Churros are awesome also."}
{"text":"I ordered some food a last night and the guy who took our order was rude and had a really bad attitude when he gave us our food. I asked for hot sauce and ranch he said there was some in the bag and there was nothing. And when I got home to eat my food and there was little pieces of plastic in my food."}
{"text":"Do not go here...for the love of baby Jesus avoid this place like the plague, or you might actually get the plague from Baby JeZeus working in the kitchen.  NO joke.   So on my Dine IN receipt I kid you not they don't even list the address of this location, I am assuming to prevent reviews like this one on yelp. I had to get my car worked on and this place was the closet thing in the vicinity that looked like it might be sanitary... I was wrong...it's not sanitary.  So I ate inside...let's talk about fast food. I ordered 4 things, a meal and a meat lovers burrito. Lets talk about the time it took...almost 10 minutes just to get my food, in the meantime I see drive-thru orders whipping out ahead of mine, that came in well after mine did.  The counter girl apologized she could see  I was visibly upset on the delay, at least give me my orange juice dummy.  The place is DIRTY. There were several people just sitting in here, and I noticed that after sitting there for a  moment I realized they were just waiting for the bus stop out front and not actual customers, some of them looked as if they were homeless, also I saw several people just come in off the street and use the bathroom. I can only assume by the filth of this place, all the tables were dirty, that they have probably had a heroin OD in the bathroom here. It is on Van Buren.  The FOOD. Or should I say BARF. My burritos were gross, I have had better burritos from a street vendor, and I am not talking a nice work truck street vendor, I am talking the people at the Walmart parking lot on 44th street and Thomas selling tamales and burritos better...that only happened once but they were still better then the puke they serve here...my hash brown was not a light golden brown but a dark rancid grease soaked brown, only solidifying the fact that this place probably hasn't cleaned the fryer grease in over a week...just Gross.  I am just happy I didn't get food poisoning from this place and no one shanked me at my table as I tried to ingest this horrible food from this poor excuse for a franchise. Don't go here ever."}
{"text":"I don't really know how to write a review on Jack in the Box because it's just your typical fast food restaurant. But what I can say is every time I beat here the food has been consistent. They are very fast. I tend to go through the drive-thru and they are always fast and courteous. If you take the survey on their receipt that they give you you can get some free food the next time you go back. That's a plus."}
{"text":"Well, a churro is deep fried bread usually stuffed and covered with sugar and cinnamon.  We like JIB churros but usually the cinnamon is nowhere to be found.  : (  We used drive thru, service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"We have been here other times and I don't remember ever having an issue. We stopped here for quick breakfast on the way out of town a few days ago. I did not pay attention to the drive-through but I think it was average busy, there were like 0 to 2 other customers inside at the time... We placed our order, and it kind of took a little while, which I am fine with because I understand sometimes the cashier may be new, or in training...  Hubby had gone to Costco to get gas in the mean time... he came back and we sat to wait (4 people)... 5 minutes went by... 10 minutes went by... I asked if it was going to take long and someone told me it was because it was a big order... I do not know what the confusion was... We ran out of patience and went to check again... Finally our order was ready and it took over 15 minutes from the time in my receipt... We usually do fast food breakfast when we go out of town and it may take 15 minutes for us to be in and out, ordering, getting our food, AND eating...  Our daughter thought I was making a big deal out of it, but this is called a **fast food** place, and we were in fact in a hurry...  OK, so we left and I gave everyone their meal... only to find out the last one (mine) was not what I ordered... at this time I was not willing to spend much energy on this, so we didn't go back... later in the day I found out my order along with other sandwich was at the bottom of the bag... so they did mess up the order but my food was in there... I just didn't see it... I only regret that maybe someone else was missing those items in their order : (  But the unthinkable, and the one I cannot wrap my head around, is that we had ordered a box of churros and... They didn't cover them in sugar and cinnamon! that is unforgivable : P It bothers me enough when they don't do it evenly and some of them have sugar/cinnamon, and some have barely any... but skipping it altogether? I would give them zero stars if I could...  I know this is making me sound like I am a very demanding person, but honestly I do not think I am.  Any of these incidents on its own would have been within my tolerance level... but delay, wrong order, no cinnamon/sugar? that was a little too much for a not so much of a morning person like me."}
{"text":"I thought I had already written a review of this place, but I cannot find it... It is usually our fast food breakfast stop when we leave town... We stopped here Sunday prior to heading North for the day.  Our friend had coffee and grilled cheese breakfast (which she loved), her kid had chicken nuggets and milk (which we noticed later was 1%), and hubby and I had the #30 sausage biscuit. Everything was OK, just the biscuit was falling apart so that was a little messy and hard to enjoy. (The same thing happened last time we were there, and I thought I had written a review about it).  The other thing is that it took a while for our food to be ready, either they do not have enough staff or they were short handed that morning. The person taking our order left the register a few times while we decided on what to order, and we ended up having to wait for a few minutes... then it must have taken about 10 minutes to get our order, and my iced coffee was never prepared, I had to go ask for it, and it was not low ice as I had asked.   So, as I said, the whole concept of fast food is just 'food' some times.  The only place that comes to mind that has always been prompt, good, nice and friendly is the McDonald's at Glendale Rd, just West of Highway 51."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of fast food but when I do get the craves this is where I go.  They have it all, good burgers, some on sour dough buns, tacos, egg rolls and a changing menu of  specialty sandwiches.  Plus a great breakfast menu.  Oh, and you can get burgers and breakfast all day long, can't beat that."}
{"text":"This was seriously the worst Jack in the Box I've ever been to. The girl at the drive through window was rude from the moment I drove up. She then proceeded to argue with me about whether they had a regular spicy chicken sandwich She insisted they only make a spicy chicken club. She then dismissed me without giving me the drinks I ordered. When i said I didn't get my drinks, I got an eyeroll as though I was asking her to do something outside her job description. She was nice enough to hand me drinks with the soda dripping all down the side, so that was great for my cup holders.   Then I get home to find out that the curly fries I ordered were actually almost an equal mix of curly fries and regular fries...not a few stragglers, almost 50/50. Not to mention the container was barely full.  I made the mistake of calling to let a manager know. Spoke to the person in charge for the shift and played 20 questions on what the girl looked like. Unfortunately I didn't pay enough attention to what she looked like. The guy I spoke to did say sorry about that, so that call was a success.   Needless to say, despite moving near this Jack in the Box, I will be driving out of my way to another location the next time I have a craving for Jack in the Box. Best 20 bucks I've ever spent."}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast croissant ever!!  Might have had sand in it. Don't wast your money!"}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food as much as it is the service.  Let's be honest, the food is fine,  it's the best unhealthy food you can crave at midnight.  On 10/6/2016 at 12 14am I went through the drive thru and the guy working with dark curly hair was one of the nicest Customer service people I've dealt with in awhile.  Not only was his attitude friendly and cheerful but his great mood was contagious. I wish I knew his name to give him the credit he deserves.  All my check says is jib#7267 emp R."}
{"text":"I bought the Bacon Insider here at nighttime after 10:30 PM 4 weeks ago or so.  The burger tasted like someone spit into it and was pretty gross tasting not to mention passing all those germs to people.  I think the manager was in on it because he was laughing his butt off when he handed me the burger in the drive thru."}
{"text":"I've always had good food and good service at this location.  Friendly, food tastes like it is fresh off the grill, and correct order.  I'm comparing the food here with other jack in the boxes not high end restaurants. :)"}
{"text":"We regret to inform you that the aforementioned is deceased. Gone, south to a warmer place. A new reality, sad to live with. Jack in the Box is gone, and nothing will bring her back.  Is it because I only ordered off Jack's value menu? I couldn't help myself, she gave it up cheap and I was lulled into her comfort.   She's gone. The sign in the window says \"A cottage for sale\".   CLOSED"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Got our order wrong three times. Our food was cold I think it was sitting out for awhile.  I got a Chipotle Chicken Club. It was disgusting.  The chicken was chewy, biting into it was gross and and it was cold. Won't be back. I know it's fast food but it could have been better.. For me Jack is one of the very few fast food chains that I think is good. This time it wasn't.  Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Not a fantastic place to eat.  Bathrooms are disgusting, food ok and the staff not super professional.   Not a restaurant I would stop at again.  Sorry Jack"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Jack in the Box. The guy at the window was hilarious, had all of us crackin' up, he allowed to have a great time at a fast food restaurant. And aside from the great customer service, the fries were perfect and the burger was great as well. I plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"Fast and easy to order whatever you want 24 hours a day.   I like the new coke machine that have now."}
{"text":"I would put no stars at this place if that was an option but its not, the quality of service is getting worse and worse its so sad especially because there is so many chain stores! the employees dont have name tags!! dont great customers especially since we are paying for the g food. This is the second time i come to this place and i order milkshake however they dont have the machine ready like it takes a genius to set it up! if i have to send a review every week to either get the owners attention for better service  or close  down shop. also one more thing i ordered 3 hash browns and they only gave me 2 really!!"}
{"text":"This location is full of crap. I asked for breakfast (which Jack in the Box is known for selling all day) and they said \"they weren't selling breakfast right now.\" So I kept it simple and ordered chicken nuggets and fried jalapeños and they tried to tell me they were out of jalapeños. I am convinced they just did not feel like making the food and lied to me to make their job easier."}
{"text":"Never has shake machine functional at night... \"I don't have enough for even a regular size\" WTH?!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably 10 plus times in the last year. They have always been super nice. This is my favorite go to place when I need something fast and good. The food is always hot and tasty. Think they have bumped up their customer service efforts, as I've noticed over the last couple of years at some in Tucson and this one, that they have gone from nice to super nice."}
{"text":"The food is good at this place, but for drive-through orders, I have been shorted on my order about 30-40% of the time.  If you go there, double-check your order regardless of how long it takes.  It'll be correct on the screen, but wrong in the bag, and usually missing something.  On a positive note, when I indicated I had a problem on their online survey, i got immediate and meaningful response from management.  However, the problem just occurred again today.  Management has more work to do."}
{"text":"Jack in the box will always be a favorite for me. The kewl thing about being an adult is, you can eat anything you want for breakfast!  Today's craving was a Sourdough Jack to kick start my Saturday!  As for this location, the workers are more focused on getting the orders correct so, customer service is just \"OK\".  The manager/shift lead helped me at the register and didn't even look at me to make eye contact or smile.  Hakuna Matata - I was here for a burger.  Mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"So short and sweet, the food is hot and decent, but the customer service is what gets the two stars. One occasion that I came here the workers were literally outside on there nicks laughing and joking with a friend that was outside. Today when I cam here, before I took off, I began to ask the girl handing me my bag for condiments,  but she quickly interjected by saying it's already in the bag, thank you bye...and closed the window! I was just taken back because I thought she was extremely rude. Anyhow I rarely visit this location so coming back isn't very likely."}
{"text":"Not only was the older lady working the drive thru as friendly as a pet rattle snake. Got a medium fry and this is what they gave me. Lol. Good job. Glad your happy with your job!!!"}
{"text":"this place is a complete and utter joke and the service is an atrocity in itself. they always always forget something and make their customers drive all the way back there for their items that they paid for. zero stars!!! hell i would give them negative stars if i could. pretty sure there is poor to zero leadership at that place. save your money and do not go there. so many other places in the area."}
{"text":"One star for fries.  One star for egg and cheese sandwich.  Nother star for being open when it is 3:30 am and that is when I am consuming this greasy carbfest as an organic, foodie vegetarian would normally NEVER eat unless feeling the pink elephant junk food parade...and walking through the driveway.  Minus that star for being open and wondering why I have grease spots on my bedsheets and zits two days later."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Cant complain. Very helpful and clean place. We mostly come in the morning!"}
{"text":"What's going on with the Breakfast Jack here? It used to be excellent. The last 4 times the eggs tasted old and the ham is paper thin with a different flavor. Twice the bun was stale! So much for this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went to Jack In the Box around 1:30 in the morning and they where cleaning there grills , they were happy to serve us but they said it was going to take 10 min so we decided to wait in the parking lot, in 5 min a member of the team at Jack In the Box went to our car and let us know that everything was back up and running, we ordered are food and it was really good ! I was very surprised how real the burger I got was , it looked like they actually cared about the customer so thank you Jack In the box"}
{"text":"Every time I come, their shake machine is down. Wtf this is not McDonald's????? A shame."}
{"text":"Tacos, bacon burger, and curly fries. Late night grub that hits the spot every time. Service was quick, and the employee was nice. There are a couple other Jack in the Boxes in the area and this one is far better. Drive an extra couple miles to go to this one."}
{"text":"NO STARS! This is the second review I have done here because I didn't take my own advise and never come back. This Jack in the Box went from 2 stars to 0. Just don't go here! Drive a mile north and go to the one on Happy Valley."}
{"text":"I really like Jack. I am really don't like this location. While the place the smallest I've ever seen, for any fast food restaurant. There is no parking. There is like 8 spaces and I'm sure the workers use most. There is only one way to get into the place and it's not very safe or easy. Hope Jack is reading this because there are many other places that could use his food."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Just walked out. Could not get anyone to take my order. Everyone just running around complaining. JACK WOULD NOT BE HAPPY."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bacon \"Ultimate\" cheese burger. What a joke. The bacon was see through and the cheese missed the whole experience.  Came out cold and dissapointing. $6 for this fiasco. I know its fast food and one cant expect much.  Garbage. Photo is after I took the bun off. Yuck"}
{"text":"It's Jack in the Box just like any other franchise. The food tastes good just like it should I've heard that some Jack's have changed some of the ways things should be made. I've never had a problem with them or my order. They get you in an out just like it should be not very long wait time."}
{"text":"The girl taking orders right now at 10:05 pm on March 10, 2018 is not very good at taking orders.  I believe her name was Alandra.  We had to repeat our order 3 times for her to get it.  We ordered a number 1 with a lemonade and somehow she understood value lemonade.  When we got to the window, she was a little rude and still not listening.  We asked for honey mustard and she just gave us the food ignoring us.  We asked again and she grabbed sauce putting it in the bag.  Not thinking anything of it, we drove off.  Get home and we have little packets of regular mustard.  So here I am eating food without honey mustard and I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered from doordash and I got a Dr pepper and after I drank all of it I found what looks like booger. Or something. And it's physically iced in the ice."}
{"text":"I will never come here again I had my last 3 orders made wrong or given the wrong food. The last two times they forgot to give me the recite then lied to me about it, even taking my food and not replacing it leaving me with nothing just a bill and no food.... bad management and rude customer service."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed at the service at this particular location as it is across the street from my home. I ordered 10 tacos and  2 cheese cakes. Once in paid I was asked to pull back and forward again. This or course only to help their stats. I replied no, so they asked me to park in the front as they would like to make them fresh. I moved to the front and timed it. It was 49 seconds. There was no customer behind me and no one pulled up in that time. It was only a ploy to save their stats. At the waste of my time and to have good stats they risk to lose a customer or make them extremely upset.   Try it, the same will happen to you.  All this was in an effort for good efficiencies. I get home and they did not give me my cheese cakes and no receipt. I called and asked for the manager, he disagreed with me and felt their actions necessary. I will contact corporate to file a formal complaint."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet and quick for breakfast. Try it! Little silver dollar size pancakes are perfect for toddlers!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE.Do not visit this location  ever. I just left the drive thru on Sunday 5/28/17 at about 4:16 pm  and had such a disrespectful  young  lady named Suri  take my order. I went inside and told the manager about the experience  and while i was speaking to the manager she had the audacity to walk over and  get in the conversation  and over talk me and the manager. Mind you she was loud and still taking orders. The manager  offered me cheesecake ...Really.? I have my own money and left it there. The problem  is disrepectful  employees  you are hiring. Do these establishments understand that we as consumers  choose to spend our money at certain places and are not doing us as consumers  a favor but a service. Do they understand  that if the consumer is treated horribly in front of thier face you address the problem  and not by offering free cheescak..  I will never go to  Jack in the Box again. On top of it the food was disgusting. I am still at a loss for words. Bad food and bad service. Sadly I gave them another chance after a bad experience  from a year ago shame on me for going back."}
{"text":"Oh help this place. I rarely review fast food bc I rarely ever eat it. If you can avoid this location please do. This place made me late for work that's how long the food took. I'm allergic to tomatoes and I said that. The woman replies \"ok so no tomatoes\". Low and behold mine had ketchup on it....glad I let them know my allergy. Thanks for almost having my throats close up.  Ordered one onion ring and one nugget and got two orders of nuggets. The only thing right about our order was my friends drink and she got it herself \"/"}
{"text":"This is a great place..they have excellent sandwiches. Opened late. Very fast drive thru. Upscale sandwiches. Would recommend this location."}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest this fast food place for anybody, I order 8 monsters taco & receives only 6, order a large curly fries I receive a regular fries, didn't find out till I get home wish is 4.5miles make my way back to get it correct they have a attitude then I wait for another 12mins for it by then I already lost my appetite... oh they didn't even offer any compliment for going back not even a drink... I wouldn't recommend to anybody!!!"}
{"text":"They are busy but order right every time. Friendly staff.   It's fast food soooo, but service has been great."}
{"text":"Worse customer service I've ever experienced. It was around 1:00 am on a Saturday and my husband and I were arriving from a long Tripp and decided to go to this location as it is pretty close from home and it's open 24 hours on the weekends. We first arrived at the drive thru and waited for someone to take our order ... after a few minutes of silence I started to ask if they were open... ( we were the only car at that time ) the man in the other side of the speaker seemed bothered and said \" yes\" nothing else ... knowing that it was late I thought maybe the guy was having a bad day or was tired ( not that this should be an excuse ) I proceeded to finish ordering... and again just complete silence ...no acknowledgment of my order, so here I am again \" hello are you there\" he says \" I didn't take your order , I can't hear you !\" At this point I didn't know what to think , if he was perhaps taking a nap or I'm not sure,  but the guy was just not interested in doing his job at all ... once again i repeated my order , he said \" ok \" I then drive to the window and he took a very long time to give me my order , and when he did he had a horrible attitude and he seemed upset I'm guessing at the fact that it was late and how dare a customer go place an order at such time ( even if they are open 24 hours). He finally gave me my food along with his bothered attitude ,and closed the window immediately without saying a thing, I waited and asked for ranch and he said ( from inside the restaurant , without opening the window ) \"what do you want\"  giving me the worse attitude . I couldn't believe this guy! I simply said to him that I had never experienced such horrible customer service in my life and that I would call his corporate to make them aware, he said he didn't care and that the good thing is that I didn't know his name ( and yes , he was not wearing a name tag ) needless to say We didn't end up consuming the food as we were concerned at the fact that he was the one who made it, and to top it off the order was all wrong. I really hope the owner of this branch gets to see this review and addresses the issue, regardless of the time your employees should still be able to provide good  customer service , specially if your establishment is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"The service was great and the man helping us was super friendly! Get the chicken strips, they're made with actual chicken."}
{"text":"Jacks has a variety of burgers and meals. They also offer breakfast. But this is really my go to place for tacos. The shells are perfectly crunchy from being friend and the seasoned meat with cheese is a perfect combination, then add in the lettuce and bam a great taco for an awesome price. Probably not the healthiest but you must have once in awhile.   The mini churros are also great as a dessert. Which we had a Jacks closer to Winston!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! My boyfriend and I simply drove into the drive thru window and could not decide what to order not taking more than 2 minutes with NO ONE behind us the cashier behind the drive thru replied \" Are. you. ready. Yet?\" we replied just one sec. As we began to order after ever word we said she VERY RUDELY responded \"I can't hear you, speak up.\" Over and over, she repeated, until we were finally done with her attitude we told her to cancel the order and we drove away. If you are in customer service do not take out your bad day on the customers who have not done anything but try to purchase from the establishment that you are employed at. YOU ALONE make the entire company look horrible. I will not be returning to this Jack in the Box because of how RUDE this cashier lady was."}
{"text":"EVERY DAMN TIME I come.here they forget something!!!!! I checked my bags and they forgot a breakfast jack... So I called while in the parking lot told them I had a baby in the car can't get out to bring me my missing breakfast jack.... come Home to realize they also forgot my effing hashbrown!!!!! I'm so livid.... I'm never coming here again... peice of crap employees. Keep your damn hashbrown a holes!!!"}
{"text":"great clean new location in surprise. The staff are very friendly and bubbly. cool indoor atmosphere."}
{"text":"These tacos are perfect for drunk hunger! This place is one of my fav fast food places. Eli knows his stuff. It's sad he was the first and only review for this location for over a year! Haha"}
{"text":"Went their tonight they are usually pretty good, but tonight was terrible. I ordered tacos they were ok but the cheddar and potato wedges were just wedges no cheese or bacon but maybe on one wedge. The jack jr I ordered with cheese extra pickles and mayo looked like it had been sitting around for hours the bun was soggy and the whole thing was cold. The only positive was the two free egg rolls cause they didn't have a full order and even they were over cooked!!!"}
{"text":"The girl in the drive thru tonight has to have us repeat ourselves five times when trying to order. She kept repeating it back wrong and then the wait time was ridiculous, we had to pull to the side of the restaurant. And they didn't give me the soy sauce I asked for. Had to go inside the restaurant. Inconvenient, really. I went inside and they told me they don't have it. Well, that's strange since the other jack in the boxes I go to carries it for their egg rolls."}
{"text":"I am not a local. I am from Las Vegas and I like this jack in the box very much. Very quick service and very good food."}
{"text":"We are from the east coast \"N.Y.\" and we came to Vegas for the first time in May of last year and did the typical Tourist thing. We got to Exp Jack in the Box for the first time ever and we really liked it. Its to bad they don't have any of these back home. Reminded me of old school burgers back in jrhs. lol Loved it!"}
{"text":"Ok so this review is pretty much for their new Iced Cinna Coffee, based on Cinnabon.  Oh my it is so good. I am a coffee person. Even if I can make coffee & expresso at home, or Americano's with Coffee Bean Vanilla Powder (which is delicious by the way).... I do enjoy getting coffee out at Starbucks, Coffee Bean, The Human Bean, Dutch Bros, etc, but I've been craving this Cinna Coffee stuff. It is really good, and every time I get it, it's been consistently good.   I hope Jack In the Box makes this drink a permanent fixture on their menu, and not a limited time!!!!  Other than that, I do recommend their breakfast sandwiches, a new one called the Loaded Breakfast sandwich was pretty good, and I consider their fajita pita as a \"healthy\" alternative to \"fast food\" food.   We got a bunch of coupons and recently tried some new things.  Unfortunately I didn't like the Brunch Burger because of the hamburger patty (too dry), but the Bacon and Egg Chicken Sandwich was good!"}
{"text":"Curly fries were not burned, monster tacos perfectly made and super friendly and clean environment makes this Jack in the Box a great one in my book! Stop and see for yourself."}
{"text":"This is the 5th time i have gone and we are never given sauce on our tacos might seem like no big deal but when u call to speak to the management team they ask you to come in or they say come back in but they don't even give receipts for an order for you to refer to this is ridiculous considering this is the only Jack in the box close to me and you guys never get it right I don't get how they mess up all t he time and never are willing to fix the problems I'm sorry but dry tacos are nasty"}
{"text":"Breakfast for Lunch. Repeat after me. Breakfast. For. Lunch. And they're speedy about it too."}
{"text":"I'm so sick of this place screwing up orders! I stopped going there for over 6mo for just this reason...figured if I stopped by now, surely they have new staff, management, etc. and possibly the food and service quality has improved. I was WRONG. C'mon folks, it's fast food, for goodness sakes...   Jack has standard operating procedures; you make the burgers this way, you fry potatoes this way, (and you throw them out if they've been sitting in the warmer for over an hour, for goodness sakes) *face palm*  The buns used in this JIB always seem \"day old\", the fries are NEVER fresh, the letuce sems consistently wilted, and to top it all off - the right food doesn't ever make it into the bag!  I give up, no more for me, store is right around the corner from my home but I will drive 4extra miles to a different JIB."}
{"text":"Worst Drive thru service ever. Not sure if the lady was having a bad day or what but she was so rude. Her name was Lori. I heard her being rude to the people behind me as well while waiting in line."}
{"text":"First time arriving to Scottsdale Arizona after a 4 day road trip husband decided to order from Jack in the box...he ordered 3 burgers and fries.... We all ate the burgers....daughter started complaining 2 hours later of stomach pains and nausea followed by vomiting and diarahha and severe stomach cramps...3 hours later I had all the same symptoms for 2 days we were  both sick. We had food posioning. It was 115 degrees out, I'm sure the burgers were out for a while. I never ate from Jack in the box after this. I don't recommend this place....sorry!"}
{"text":"I will just lay out the differences from the other 3000 Jack in The Boxes around town.  1. Very friendly staff every time I go thru the drive thru 2. Drive thru seems faster than most 3. Restaurant is cleaner than average"}
{"text":"Good food. Fresh. I love the tacos. I only buy the tacos. Linda the manager was friendly and professional. I will return."}
{"text":"Received a manager meal comp because of bad food (chicken tasted rotten).  3/20/2017: I tried to redeem the comp. Anna, a different store manager refused to honor the comp. She said to go to corporate. She gave me Jay, the GM manager's phone. I called him and he refused to honor the comp. He said he's a franchise and so he doesn't have to follow the rules. He said corporate will tell him and he won't return the call.   3/20/2017: Filed complaint with corporate. Nice lady in corporate said the District Manager Dino will return my call, and Jay is not the District Manager and there is somebody above him, the District manager is Dino, and Dino will return my call.  3/28/2017: Nobody returned my call yet. Called corporate again for follow up. They said they left another message for the district manager to return my call. I think Jay the GM is intercepting the calls and concealing a complaint.   I try to be fair and I will remove this review once the complaint has been resolved. Thanks."}
{"text":"I've been waiting in line for 30 min now. They couldn't make a shake and had us wait in the front of the store another 15 min and they never came so we tried to go through the drive thru again. Waited another 15 min. Just gave up eventually and went home."}
{"text":"Visited last night about 1:30am. All I really stopped by for was an Oreo shake and the window lady said they're not doing shakes. Not a very professional explanation or way to word it, perhaps the machine was getting cleaned. I drove to the location on trop and sandhill, didn't even share the experience with the young dude and he gave me the shake for free! Now that's what I'm talking about! I don't normally go to Jack in the Box but if I crave a shake again in the near future I'll be bringing my $3.19 to the Tropicana store"}
{"text":"It's ok ya know fast food. The food is ok but kinda sloppy. The people are nice enough.bits your average fast food joint. We stop here in a pinch it's on the way home and my husband likes it."}
{"text":"I haven't had a problem eating here yet been there several times and I've got what I ordered, its been correct with no issues!"}
{"text":"I love jack in the box, my favorite place to go on the run as they have so much variety. However today was my first time visiting this location and I was very displeased. I'm a patient person and I don't mind a wait because I understand that things can get busy. But I really don't have respect for those who choose to work at a place and don't know how to work under pressure. The employee at the first window was very nice but I was shocked when I got to the second window where the MANAGER literally hands me my bag with no eye contact and her exact words were \"there you go k bye bye\" still \"too busy\" enough to acknowledge me- I think some people just need to be reminded that customers are the reason for there success and good customer service should be of first priority. I never mind a wait when the customer service makes up for it!"}
{"text":"They ended up fixing my order after I came back. They usually have a pretty good attitude this is why I updated the review and added more stars."}
{"text":"Just an average Jack....nothing real special about it. It is in a decent locale if your looking for something fast to eat....otherwise....again...nothing special. Also be advised if you have a Jack card and want you points.....make sure they swipe it BEFORE THEY TAKE YOUR ORDER....or you will not receive any points for your transaction. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a location that I frequent, but Klinton's customer service in the drive-thru deserves a shout out. Very friendly and attentive, which I seem to have a hard time finding at fast food joints these days. The onion rings were so-so, but the customer service made this a good experience for me."}
{"text":"Stopped to grab a quick bite between the man child's lacrosse games. He got the new Blazin' Chicken Sandwich and I opted for the Grande Sausage Burrito with Sriracha. The burrito was awesome and could hold it's own with any local taco shop's breakfast burrito. The Sriracha was a nice touch and added some great flavor. The order was served hot, fast and fresh and my burrito combo was just north of five bucks. Could possibly be the best five bucks I've spent in quite some time. A definite return trip in is order the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"The employee working the counter was having a hard time processing my order in the register and finally stated they were in training before going to find help. I understand there is a learning curve and it takes time to learn new procedures, but having a trainee flying solo at the register during lunch hour was probably not one of Jack's best decisions. This definitely wasn't fast food. The tacos I ordered were not your typical, hot and greasy JITB tacos. They were cold and not very tasty. Iced Tea is not available with all of the other beverages when dining in. You must get it from behind the counter, which only adds to the delay and frustration. I frequent the drive thru at this location and have never really had an issue. This was my first dine-in experience and it may be awhile before I return."}
{"text":"Well, first of the all the view of the STRATOSPHERE from here is fantastic....i got some great shots!!! Secondly the food and service were outstanding so i would come here again if i wanted that for sure. I have been to several of these establishments all of over the western part of this country.....and this is the CLEANEST one i have ever been in....it was totally immaculate....you could eat off the floors if you wanted.   However this establishment didn't receive 5 stars.....because i agree with my fellow yelper Steve F. When you allow panhandlers....drug addicts....drug dealers....pimps....transients....etc....to come onto and into the property that does make for an uncomfortable situation. If they fix this problem this could be one of the best Jack in the box's anywhere. Eat, Drink and Be Careful....but remain Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"My brother got food poisoning from here because the chef wasn't being sanitary here. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"Crap service. Mean accused me of using swear words.  Don't go there.  Drive thru person needs courtesy training"}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve a star dirty bathroom dirty inside and out  The drink dispenser dirty dirty Rude staff manager  Kept rushing everyone  Big guy you can't miss him  Should be maintain better  Start by changing its management"}
{"text":"We heard there's a 15 minute wait for counter service. Yes, it's rush time. It's 6:30pm. The woman in front of us ordered only an iced tea and waited over 11 minutes. The table we selected had a fully empty napkin dispenser, all the tables were dirty. BUT! From order to when the manager brought the food to our table was only 6 minutes. I call that a win. As always quality food, great atmosphere, and good service. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Don't remember the girls name in drive thru but she is the reason I'm writing this review. Soon as I pulled upon drive thru, I was greeted by her and with such energy and enthusiasm, and I had a feeling her being friendly wasn't just her being at the drive thru window, but it just seemed like her natural personality. When I got up to the pick up window, she greeted me with the same energy and a big smile, even had a short conversation with me and complimented my tattoo on my arm.   5 stars for that employee.. friendly and quick drive thru service!"}
{"text":"Last night we picked up dinner when we noticed my order of 10 churros were missing. We swore we had everything checked and left. This was our fault. We got home no desert. I went back after eating told them I didn't get my churros I had my receipt ready to prove my purchase. Charmaine and the night staff were so apologetic already knew my churro story. Had them hot and ready for me. Thanks guys! Keep up the awesome service!"}
{"text":"I would not come to this place again the manager here can't help you with nothing they send there works to come and talk to me they didn't get my Oder right n they still want me to pay for what I had pay ready i rather go to @McDonald's"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a zero star. Worst place I have ever been too. I literally ordered a munchie meal and they gave me the wrong order. There was the buns, cheese, pickles, onions, and NO MEAT OR CHICKEN WHATSOEVER! The fries & tacos were cold, and when I called to make a complaint the manager told me to come back and get the money and a free shake. When I went back they didn't give me my shake :'-("}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning...this location is always quick and on the spot..really like the location because I can fuel my vehicle at the same location"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my choice of the chicken pita. The picture showed a pocket full of meat and cheese but the actual food was super light. I should have bought the chicken sandwich like everyone else that would have been the better choice"}
{"text":"They got my order right but the wait was crazy night time. Also, doesn't feel to safe, fortunately there were cops around."}
{"text":"There real nice in the Drive-Thru and inside the restaurant usual Jack in the Box food no more no less"}
{"text":"Unfortunately there are not many late night fast food places open 24hrs in Surprise.  Avoid this Jack in the Box even though they are 24hrs.  The night employees are rude and slow.  Even had them lie and tell me their system is down.  Even offered to pay cash but they told me they couldn't do anything.  They need a computer to make a burger??"}
{"text":"Jack in the box has always been a go to for me when I'm in a rush or just a quick bite, but I stopped by tonight just because I couldn't sleep, but the drive thru worker Gabby was the nicest most helpful social worker I've care across, I know it might not seem like a lot being a drive thru worker but she went above and beyond in customer service. Keep it up Gabby!"}
{"text":"Good JIB. Fast an friendly."}
{"text":"This location is trash. The manager is in the back laughing and joking, employees walking pass the counter, and another guy filling the drinks while we standing in line just waiting for someone. Then there are so many items not available. Then they can't break a $100? And on top of that all the employees look pissed off to be at work? And these are the kind of employees that cry for $15/hr? I'll never even attempt to come to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"This place has given me 5 days of diarrhea nonstop. On may 7th afternoon i order 4 tacos and their new french fries and came to work with flu like symptoms and stomach pain and explosive diarrhea that was incontinence. I had a coworker who had food poison at jack in a box last week, not sure which location. This experience taught me never to go to jack in a box even if im in a rush or hungry."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but the dude in the drive thru was extremely rude. I didn't think it'd be a problem asking for my receipt but he rolled his eyes at me for it and gave me attitude through my whole experience. That I could have dealt with, but then when I got home and began to eat I saw that the sausage in my breakfast sandwich was very undercooked, it was pink. Sucks I just wasted my money."}
{"text":"I wish I could put no star!! My bf and I were staying the night across the street from this Jack in the Box and noticed it on the way to the gas station we immediately pulled in to order.. the manager told us she was restocking the store and she would need 15 min we understood and said we would come back, 15 min later it was so close we decided to walk, on the way over I needed to use the restroom and decided we would just use it there... this was at 10:40, I went to open the door and the door was locked...the door said they close at 11. So we decided to to walk back and drive over, the Store \"manager\" told us the staff was not in and we wold have to wait 10-15min. So we did.... to come back to the \"manger\" to tell us she wasn't taking any order or cooking any food. She went off on my screaming the GD word and I have her on recording doing the whole thing. She completely wasted our time. I will be calling corporate in the am"}
{"text":"They heard us wrong about our order. They fixed this quickly and efficiently. The food is fresh. My shake is yummy.   For 1 in the morning the man with short black hair was extremely friendly and efficient.   The store looked really, really clean."}
{"text":"Chocolate shake (small) burnt my throat it was so strong with chocolate syrup.  Jalapeno poppers (7) had a bitter taste.  Near my home and I cave and eat here every 4-5 years and am always disappointed.  $7.54  Which someone would open a decent fast food on this corner."}
{"text":"Norma is the best manager. We had a complicated order and she made it extremely easy. Thanks Norma !"}
{"text":"Chicken nuggets were awesome, service, drive through, customer service was bad. No one answered the drive through window, made me park without giving my change back. Went inside to get my food and my change and they had no idea what they were doing. Asked me 3 times if I wanted curly or regular fries. Won't be back here :( 10 out of 10 on the nuggets though!"}
{"text":"I have never had a screwed up order here. The staff is really nice and usually will engage in small talk while you wait.   Get the Chicken Club on Sourdough...."}
{"text":"Holy Hell Mayo Queen....put the mayo gun down and back away from the burgers."}
{"text":"They have great service at this location, and they never complain and give me a hardtime when i ask for 20 hotsauce and 5 buttermilks."}
{"text":"Had a strong pregnancy craving for a egg roll, a chocolate shake and a #23. They only had vanilla shakes, they where out of egg rolls AND where not serving breakfast?!?! WHAT? Everyone knows Jack In the Box is breakfast ALL DAY. SO disappointed!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude employees.  Good luck to anyone that picks this place for service. If your store is closed, lock the doors and put up a sign."}
{"text":"Absolutely ZERO sense of urgency, even with a lobby full of hungry customers and the drive thru backed up all the way to the lot.  One combo and an extra burger took 18 minutes, that is not \"fast\" even by the ready low fast food standards."}
{"text":"Last lunch at jack in box in las vegas heading home best burgers to bad we dont have in Georgia"}
{"text":"Ill be heading to jack in box for brakefast this morning love it"}
{"text":"I can't help it, some fast food is just good sometimes!    I loved the new mini-sirlion burger commercial and we had already tried the Burger King mini burgers so we decided to give these Jack in the Crack burgers a try too.  They smelled and looked really good... but after the second one I was on beefy overload.  I need lots of veggies on my burger, like lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, etc etc... this was just meat and ketchup and a little onion... I guess I don't get the mini thing?    Ne way, I still love Jack's weird but oh sooo good munchie quenching two regular tacos on occasion... on one particular very late night, I ate not 2, not 4, but 6 of those things... yeah... 6!  More recently my wife got the burrito, steak and egg I think... and of course I had a few bites, cuz her food always tastes better, and yeah, that thing was actually good.  I usually hate burritos from fast food places.  Welp... yeah, Jack is good.  I don't care."}
{"text":"Cook went out for smoke came in playing on phone and did not put on gloves before handling food. Spoke to on duty manager who did not seem to care. Had to get refund and go somewhere else. Disgusting. Would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Jack in the Crack. Good lord, seriously? I hate living so close to this place. When I was living on the East Coast, I would go into Double Cheeseburger denial and get the shakes. Now I've moved back here and pretty much always end up in line ordering a meal after a night of drinking. With a Dr. Pepper and curly fries with ranch on the side NOW. I mean PLEASE... please... not NOW, that's just crazy and rude.   I very rarely get a crappy burger. They really do make everything right when you order it. The bun is nice and soft, the cheese is actually all melty and the burger patties are hot and juicy. The fries are crispy, hot and well seasoned. For a fast food place, Jack in the Box totally wins.   I don't even want to think about the amount of fat, sodium, calories and evil I'm ingesting when I eat here because it's just so damn tasty. Oh well."}
{"text":"Went to this location as it is nearby the Las Vegas Premium Outlet.  I like Jack in the Box for their all day breakfast menu, and this place was the closest I could find. I did notice a little bit of an element of drug or prostitution or something was going on. But it did not deter from my experience here; this location was very clean on the outside and inside. My food was good and served at a good temperature; the counter person gave me a refill coffee with a smile. What more can you ask for from a JB?"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst jack ever!! Never will I be coming back not even because I live across the street!   The most miserable workers here, they are so rude! When u pull up to the ordering window they greet you with what can I get you with the laziest voice ever & then they forget to give u ur change!!"}
{"text":"This jack in the box is as good as any other. However, their trainee operating the register was the epitome of customer service. He waa nice and courteous to all of his patrons, and was very efficient. No qualms, just a great experience. I hope every cashier I deal with is as pleasant as Isaic."}
{"text":"They fixed their misinformation of pricing from the order menu drive-up to the pick-up window. Thank you!  Now this is a decent place to go to late at night again when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"This is he closes jack to my house so I've been there a couple times. They have great drive threw employees. The food they serve looks most of the time like in the picture. Pretty amazing! One of he best jacks I've ever been to.!!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience !! We are so disappointed do NOT EVER go to this location!! We are on the keto diet. I've ordered from a few jack in the boxes and never had a problem but my god this location is always messing up. I ordered 4 hamburger patty's 4 cheese and 2 sides of bacon. Asked her to make two \"sandwiches\". I explained in detail we would like a patty, cheese, patty, cheese, then bacon. She said okay. Then I asked for a side of tomatoes and she tells me they are 15 cents a slice, how many would you like. I said 4 please. We get our order and she tells us it's $21 plus dollars!!! Where ? How?! We look at the receipt and she charged us almost $8 dollars for cheese and charged us for 16 slices of tomatoes and double for bacon. We are completely flabbergasted. This isn't the first time they have messed up. Not only that I asked the woman how on earth we spent $8 dollars on cheese but please tell me how cheese costs more than 4 hamburger patties? And she just said that was the price. Someone seriously explain this to me ?"}
{"text":"If no stars was an option, it would happen. I ordered my food, pulled up to the window and before I handed over my payment I saw a roach on the wall. Took a picture(which I will post) and told the cashier. She looked, shrugged her shoulders and said\"not the first person to say something\". I get it, you work minimum wage and flip burgers for a living. But in any restaurant, cleanliness should be priority."}
{"text":"This restaurant in specific is managed by a young man through the mornings I was here yesterday mornings at the drive through and he took my order on the speaker and front the first moment when he spoke I realize my order was going to be done right he also was very friendly and courteous it was a awesome experience at the Jack in the Box Like I've ever got before"}
{"text":"So disappointed the ads made them look like the pinnacle of sandwiches with the gooey cheese nice bread I understand the ads aren't always 100% accurate but still I did not expect the horrible tasting meat to be the only thing I taste no cheese no sauce or buttery bread taste just horrible meat also I order the Swiss bacon buttery jack and received the classic one I've tried cheaper burgers that tasted better"}
{"text":"The customer service was and always has been amazing at this location. The manager is a super cool guy and the staff is really kind. I honestly drive out of my way to go this location versus the one that's a few miles closer just because I know I'm guaranteed great service and fresh food.   The food is always hot and the curly fries are fresh (and you are given a heaping portion even when ordering a small)   Clean store, well stocked with condiments and an awesome touchscreen soda machine."}
{"text":"The staff on drive through tonight was spaced out. I repeated my order I don't know how many times before they got it right. Then I get home & there's no lettuce or hot sauce on the tacos. And they're semi stale. A late night JITB taco craving turned into a disappointment real quick."}
{"text":"Was just at jack in the box 3 minutes ago got home to open my MUNCHIE MEAL to only find 3 regular french fries and the rest curly fries when it's supposed to be half and half but usually something like that wouldn't bother me but I think it's because before I received my meal when I was driving around to the drive thru one of the employees was out front smoking and I wasn't helped until she was finished"}
{"text":"working late hours and to tired for cooking jack and the box has definitely satisfied my hunger for those times you just need a quick bite after hours.  The manager Josh is very friendly, remembers me every time i see him and is always very accommodating. I love the chicken fajita pita, for the illusion of eating healthy because it's grilled chicken ;)  If you are out late and looking for a meal before your last stop Jack in the Box is not a bad choice!"}
{"text":"I wish i could write a better review about Jack in the Box but i really cant. Ive had Jack in the Box before in NC and at other locations around Vegas but this one fell short of my expectations. First off they were severely understaffed and I only saw two employees working in the whole facility. So while one person was cooking the other person was working the drive through and it took quite a while for someone to even notice that I was standing there ready to order. Once I finally got my order they short changed me on the fries and my fry bag was only half full. To their credit once I brought this to their attention, they gave me another bag of fries free of charge. The burger was burnt and just simply lackluster. If I hadn't had better Jack in the Box experiences then this place would have gotten a 1 star but since I know they have better food at other locations I'll give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Oh Yolanda I hope they fire you nasty attitude self. Three times I have placed my order and they send you to the parking lot. Then when they deliver its wrong and you have to go in. Today I just said no thanks I am not going to the parking lot just give me a refund. That's when Yolanda the manager gave me a nasty attitude. Her excuse was the guy behind you just ordered a drink so  move, I spend my good money and its first come first serve at the drive thru. The success rate of filling your order properly is terrible. I will take my money else where."}
{"text":"So you can't take Debit cards at the Drive through but you don't have a notice before getting in line. Fing B."}
{"text":"Very nice staff! Food is mediocre but you have to remember it is fast food. All prepped before hand. But every time I go through the drive through it's been pleasant! Best deal is the 2 tacos for 1 and change :)"}
{"text":"As we walked in, I witnessed an awkward encounter where they had charged  someone for something they didn't pay for and contemplated whether to tell them or not. After five minutes I finally got to order. I'm a simple girl and I only like ketchup mustard and cheese on my burger. Of course there is pickles and no ketchup so I had to go back tell them and  wait another five minutes for a burger. My S.O. had to wait so we can eat together and his burger bun was completely stale ...gross.  Maybe there is some new staff but it's kind of annoying when they ask you the same thing five times."}
{"text":"I got the wrong item. I bought the homestyle chicken sandwich and they gave me the spicy chicken sandwich. Please contact me and give me my money back."}
{"text":"No matter how complicated our orders, they always get the order right. They are so flexible and accommodating. We just say the order once and they got it. This Jack in the Box is out here killing the game!"}
{"text":"Jack in the Box has become my de facto fast food joint due to their no-holds-barred menu attitude.  All meals are available all day, and they range from egg sandwiches to tacos.  I mean, really?  Where else can someone get a pair of tacos and a burger that are decent in one stop?  They offer two types of fries for those that want variety, plus hashbrown sticks.   This place is by no means \"healthy\", and their adds flaunt that!  It's refreshing to see a business let loose and except that they're the glut-vanna!  We the people frequent places like this to serve out craving for fast, fun, fantastic foods!  Why can't Jack cut loose too! This particular location is conveniently located close to home, but otherwise it is rather tricky to navigate in and out of.  Try to avoid on weekends, as the traffic from Concord Mills will no doubt drive you insane! Noosh!"}
{"text":"Cuuuuuuuuz this shit smackkkkkkkk. Ion know if I'm high or just hungry as fuck but this shit hit the spot. And cuz at the window had me rolling!!! Real shit tho good looks on that water cup that shit hit the spot"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Workers are not friendly and seem inpatient. Beware the drink machine. The button got stuck and my drink overflowed and made a huge mess. The fanta, coke, and sprite all tasted dull and flat. We got our food and the bacon was gross and tasteless. The workshers did have a good understanding of the menu, and the inside was super clean. Will probably return in the future."}
{"text":"Very dirty restrooms and all glass surfaces looed like they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time. Server was polite and helpful but we don't recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Food like any other fast food restaurant.  5 customers total.  4 employees.  One sitting drawing picture.  Tables, floor and place a sty.  Why not clean instead of draw?  Won't be back here."}
{"text":"How does a fast food joint get four stars?? This is when I know not to take Yelp seriously. This garbage is the epitome of, well garbage. Gross!"}
{"text":"Horrible service very rude. Took lunch break here and the lady behind the counter said i couldnt even get water in my own cup. Kiss off jerks! Wow What a bunch of rude assholes!"}
{"text":"If I could have rated this facility less than 1 Star that would have been my choice. I've had the worst possible experience I've ever experienced in my entire life after traveling around the world. I went there simply to order a regular burger and fries combo and the attendant (Michael \"assistant manager\") told me that there wasn't any drinks to facilitate the combo. Fair enough....We simply asked if it can compensate for an extra portion of fries or something which he simply responded as though he was annoyed with what we've asked. So just to reiterate I said to him, what do u guys have in place for customers wanting the combo seeing that you can't fulfill what's advertised. At this point, he started shouting at us saying that he has no control over the machine if it doesn't work. We were shocked by his approach and expressed that to him especially with him being the assistant manager there. So I simply said to him that if he was a bit more genuine about the situation I would have understood but shouting at us and getting aggressive for asking a logical question was unacceptable. Basically this got him mad and his surprising response was for us to leave his drive thru. Now where did that come from? No resolution other than EXTREMELY poor customer service!!! How can an assistant manager in an organization tell a customer to leave knowing the matter was unresolved and no efforts was made to remedy the problem???Unbelievable!!! I will NEVER return to any Jack In The box facility. What type of workers are you guys hiring? Are they aware that they are in a customer service position ? I wasn't looking for anything free, I was just saying to him that I understand the machine wasn't working but a more genuine response from him would have worked rather than just pushing me away and worst yet telling me to leave????!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. It took 10 minutes before we were even helped and we were the only ones In the store. In addition, the employees had the decency to tell us that the sauce we asked for doesn't go with our food."}
{"text":"Okay, it's fast food, but it's hard to beat a Jumbo Jack with Cheese, 2 tacos and an order of onion rings for $5. Drive thru is always quick, and I like fact that dine in orders are now served in a basket \"cafe style\""}
{"text":"Unlike my other reviews, this one is gonna be much shorter. Before I start, I just want to say that this is a fast food joint and nothing more than that. If anything is said about this place, it can definitely be described in one word...  consistent. And by consistent, I mean consistently mediocre. I've never been to this location and been surprised either way, it's always just blah. The staff does what they need to do each order, but doesn't make it a personalized experience for the customer. The employees aren't rude, but they don't smile either. The food is exactly what you would expect from a big chain fast food place, greasy, definitely not fresh, will never look like the picture menu and overpriced for what you get.

{"text":"Been heading to this location for a few years now, and have never had an order messed up at the drive through. They are always accurate. Staff at the drive thru are also friendly and responsive. As far as the food - it's fast food, so nothing amazing, but consistent and friendly"}
{"text":"Worst Jack ever. Avoid at all costs. The drive thru is 24/7 yet we went the other night and they had a dining room chair blocking the drive they...really? The food was also terrible."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The first time i was alone and the second time went with friends and ate there. Both times the people who served me were super nice and friendly and my food was ready really quick. The first time I ordered a chicken meal with fries and a honey bbq sauce. The chicken and the fries were tasty and weren't dry like they are in many other places. Compared to some other placec the restroom was unclean. Not dirty but unclean. But what blew me away was actually the sauce. They make their sauces in-house and let me tell you, the taste is heavenly. So after my amazing first expereince here I decided to go there with friends. All of us ordered different things and everyone was happy with their meal. I will definitely grab a bite with the boys at this place again soon."}
{"text":"Been to many Jack in the Box's this week due to their Superbowl free burger coupon.  This was the worst store in the Tempe/Mesa/Higley area by far.  The store was clean and good looking, but the staff was clueless about time management and organization, even with the occasional help of the manager.  Most of their efforts were for the drive thru orders which is good, but after 15 minutes of waiting for an order of a single burger, I had to go outside and walk around for some fresh air.  After twenty minutes it was finally ready, but it was waiting not under a warming lamp, but in the manager's office.  I also saw another customer's burger returned as she wanted no lettuce on it.  This place needs training pronto."}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been too. They have the worst customer service. I have too many bad experiences to list everything. I would stay clear from this place. I will not be surprised if they end up getting shut down for neglect on health and safety laws. None of the workers seem to care about anything or anyone. Eat at your own risk!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten at a Jack in the Box for years but I got a coupon for a combo for $5 so I thought I'd give it a try.   The fries were hot, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The burger was good, not stale like I've had recently at Carl's Junior. And they had cherry diet Dr Pepper so I was pretty happy. The only complaint is that there was more sauce than I would have liked.  I'd rather have Whataburger."}
{"text":"I woke up feeling like having brunch without having to sit in a restaurant, so I decided to give Jack in the Box a try.  I don't eat a lot of fast food because a lot of it just doesn't taste good to me.  I ordered the Southwest scrambler plate, which is scrambled eggs with cheese, breakfast potatoes, onions, bell peppers and bacon (or sausage or both). I had it with the bacon and it was very good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the potatoes, especially.  A lot of places don't cook them well, they're still hard, but these were cooked all of the way with some crispy bits. This was a big portion, more than I could eat at one meal.   I wish they would make a version of this scramble with avocado slices on the side and chipotle sauce drizzled on. I would have ordered an iced tea with it, but they seem to serve Gold Peak and I am not a fan at all.   I ordered and paid with one employee and he was exceptionally polite and efficient, and then the employee who gave me my food was also very nice."}
{"text":"Got the waffle breakfast sandwich, it was ok.  Make sure you get a pack of syrup.  It gets really messy!  DONT EAT AND DRIVE!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to jack n the box in a while.  Bonus jack is on special.  No big deal. It was ok.  But they have my strawberry fanta."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this location. I've been to this location twice and every time the lady on drive thru has been rude. I guess the food is okay for fast food."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a day...  I typically only get drinks for my drive, but I have been known to crush some croissant donuts!   Oops! Lol   The service is typically good and they all seem rather friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible service .. my sister wanted a salad and we waited for someone to come to the drive thru for about 6 minutes .. then we waited about 30 minutes in the line of cars in front of us.. then the guys in the window tells us he doesn't have change!! Are you kidding you want me to go get change and come back?? Horrible costumer service and once we payed because they had to look for change they said.. we still had to wait for our salad! Once we were leaving, we realized her grilled chicken was uncooked and we had to return and go inside to get it changed!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"Tell me why my husband went there this morning to get breakfast before he went into work and there's asshole charged him more because they have know change in the building so they give a receipt and he's like where's my change and there like oh were out of change we have no change in the building! How can you charge someone knowing you don't have change and they hand you a 20 dollar bill and you oh sorry we don't have change to give you the bitch cause you want your money back. Don't Go Here Unless You Want To Be Ripped Off!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby love Jack in the box,he always buy breakfast in the morning and we all love it!!! Hmmmmm....yummy!!!and is close to my house easy to walk!!!"}
{"text":"Fast food so I figure it's simple and hard to mess up but when there is a will there is a way  ordered in Drive thru, receipt fell cuz person handed under food on opposite side of box, she says \" ohh well\" so I can't even officially complain with a number. Drink machine also down. No grape sprite. No Dr Pepper. Asked what they had; answer was \"Pretty much just coke\" Get home and sandwich was wrong. Like; you had one job. Should have just ordered the fake \"tacos\". Can't mess that basic stuff up"}
{"text":"Breakfast is always fast, hot, and fresh. However, lunch/dinner is never the same story. Usually cold frys. Also, staff in early am is excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"Normally, I would state that this chain is just as good, worse or better than the others.   How is it possible to get tacos multiple times and not get taco sauce? I keep forgetting to ask that they include it because I figure it's given that the taco sauce would be included.  Nope, if you're getting tacos, ask for sauce because they never seem to so much as offer any at this location.   I don't frequent the quick food spots often but this has become my least favorite late night stop. The tacos, even though they have a little sauce on them are unpalatable to me without at least one pack per taco. It's also the type of taco that requires the brand of sauce that is made for it, anything else just tastes weird.  My bad, maybe I will remember next time? Maybe they'll offer?"}
{"text":"Absolutely 100% the worst customer service I have ever received at a \"restaurant\". Repeated my order 15 times for a new employee because clearly no other employee there felt the need to help her. Completely not her fault, it was her first day and should have had a trainer helping her with orders. Finally, another girl with a terrible attitude took over and told me to pull to the window. After asking three different times to have chicken instead of beef she finally understood the question, and told me \"we don't have no chicken tacos. Only soy.\" I asked her what soy meat was, and asked specifically if it had cow meat in it. She said it did not, only 'soy protein'. So I took the \"soy tacos\". Parked the car and looked on jack in the box's website, low and behold their \"soy meat\" is made up mostly of BEEF. How can you work at a place and not know what you're selling people? I am allergic to beef. Hence why I attempted to make certain their soy meat contained absolutely no beef. So I go in the store with the food and asked for my money back. I wait 5 minutes for a manager who said nothing other than \"why?\" when I asked for my money. I advised her about her restaurants website, and that her and her employees are telling false information. People ask questions for a reason. Employees should at the very least know what's in the food they're selling to people. The new girl was the only employee with a smile on her face and a good attitude. The rest could learn a thing or two from her! If your job is to deal with customers, you probably shouldn't act like such a miserable asshole! You couldn't pay me to go back there.. Probably the reason the parking lot was empty! One star is being generous"}
{"text":"I apologize for the bad language and my poor English.  tonight at 12:25 24 am (4/12/2015) yolanda gave me the most horrible experience in Jack in the Box location 5 S gibson rd henderson 89012 especially because her name is Kyra ( she gave me a fake name) and she said to me  WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM DUDE? and she's not even wearing a jack in the box shirt or proper clothing.  I am a regular customer and I live literally 2 minutes away, she also said that she does not take attitude frome no one. i have it on video and she admitted her wards. my order # is 182 and the 14 digits # is 522 131 207 768 98. I wish I can give you  -5 stars! I am NOT coming back ever again!!!!  And please if you don't want to be treated like I did tonight don't come to this place I've been reading the reviews and it's a horrible place to eat, who knows what they do to your food!!!!!!!!!!  if you want to see the video please clik on or look for yolanda jack in the box gibson henderson nv: http://youtu.be/HR0lkW1kkQo  Watch \"yolanda jack in the box gibson henderson nv\" on YouTube yolanda jack in the box gibson henderson nv: http://youtu.be/HR0lkW1kkQo"}
{"text":"I had a coupon so I figured why not. I ordered an ultimate cheeseburger and it tasted REALLY good. Just the right amount of condiments.   The rootbeer is just always better at jack in the box for some strange reason. At 1 dollar for any size soft drink...why yes I would like a large, thank you.  The order was completed quickly and accurately despite the fact that they were busy. Its located in a weird spot, but if your on the move you can gas up and get a burger then hit the road."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch and the drive through and parking lot was packed. The car I was in got the last currently available parking spot. The parking lot is incredibly small and if  the drive through backs up there is no where to idle but in the parking lot as well blocking the already small lot. This is obviously nothing they can do to fix so if you are in a super hurry maybe don't plan to sit down here to eat during busy lunch hours.   Other than the parking lot, the food coming out took a little longer than I would think it would take fast food but then again the parking lot was packed so I'm not surprised. Everything else was business as usual and everything I would expect from Jack in the Box fast food. I ordered the sriracha bacon jack with curly fries and that was pretty good. It had sriracha mayo on it with jalapenos, bacon, tomatoes, and lettuce. The tomatoes were surprising really fresh and plentiful."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst locations in the entire valley. Overnight, Tookie staff has a serious attitude. Laughable! Crap Food Quality, Crap Staff!!"}
{"text":"Slowest location Ive ever seen! 3pm and it took 7 minutes for 2 Jr Jumbo Jacks and Im the only one here. Ridiculous?"}
{"text":"Still a Joke of a location. Went inside to order, noticing 5 cars headed toward Drive-Thru. Placed my order and watched these idiots take & fulfill all 5 Drive-Thru orders while I waited 12 minutes for my order."}
{"text":"Filthy! Yuck! Loaded with homeless who also stink of filth, urine and feces who have bedbugs, lice and many diseases and they are smoking cigarettes inside. The employees are pleasant but I wouldn't trust how clean any of this establishment is so I would say don't even use the drive-through."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment, even the bathroom. Pleasant, patient and helpful employees. Prices are a bit steep."}
{"text":"Should give no stars if I can. Drove through the drive through ordered a fish sandwich meal. The sandwich looked like a cooked rat , the fish sandwich was like biting into a piece of rubbers. Went in to complain and the retard behind the counter telling me to chill out!! Fuck you,you serve shit like this , this place should be shut down!! Employees are ghetto kids who gives two shit about customer service or quality control. Do eat here unless u want herpes!!!"}
{"text":"Liars about food being freshly made;Food is nasty; Angelina is R-U-D-E!!!!  Waste of time & energy & money"}
{"text":"Great customer service every time I stop in. Smiling faces from employees eager to help in every way possible!! Very good food for the value.  This place is one of my \"regular\" stops ."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Boulder City.  Nothing great and nothing awful.  If you need a quick bite or are in the neighborhood and don't want anything specific check it out"}
{"text":"Every once in a while I stray from my normal breakfast of a bowl of Cheerios and a glass of orange juice.  Mostly on weekends and usually for something healthy.  But once in a while you just need greasy fast food.  Jack does that about as well as anybody.  And my faith in him was reaffirmed as my favorite breakfast sandwich (sourdough), while no longer on the menu, is still available.    I have been stopping at this location for breakfast on occasion for the last 15 years.  It is starting to show a little wear around the edges and this morning I noticed the whole dining room had been rearranged and sort of looks weird because it no longer matches the footprint of the carpet."}
{"text":"The food is pretty much the same at every location.  When the option is inexpensive fast food Jack in the Box is one of my favorites given the choices I usually have around me.  3 of the 5 early morning visits I have made here I felt me feet sticking to the floor even though it looked like it had dried since it was mopped prior to my arrival. The place looked clean though. The food was prepared fine."}
{"text":"I've actually stopped here a few times when I have had the mid morning munchies on my route.  Service has always been quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I went to check in here and it didn't exist.  So I tried looking through my reviews and the Yelp data base, nothing.  How I didn't review this location where I go to often enough the manager and some of the staff recognize me I have no clue.  Anyway, on to the review.    It's a Jack in the Box.  The place is kept clean.  It has had a major and a couple of minor remodels in the 17 years I have been going here.  I like it when they remodel because I make roughly a buck per location every time they do.  It is my go to location because of the proximity to where I work.  The neighborhood can be a bit rough at times.  Whoever designed the drive through so cars using it block access to the parking lot from the side street was clearly busy eating a Jumbo Jack instead of designing.  I don't happen to be fond of drive thrus so I park and walk in and I can verify the accuracy of my order while still at the counter.  Really have not had many orders messed up over the years.  I think the manager has a lot to do with how well a fast food place is run and the one that has been here the last few years is doing a pretty good job."}
{"text":"I usually go to this jack during the morning before work , always have my order correct , I go tonight order jumbo jack & garlic fries , 5 piece kids chicken nuggets w curly fries , I get home I have one jumbo jack , 2 regular fries and 10 chicken nuggets ,  I call and talk to manger told him I was just there like 5 mins ago said if I had my receipt I said no I had just thrown it away by the drive thru trash , said he couldn't do nothing with out the receipt and was very rude . I hung up and went right back and took them the bag back ... I told \"THE MANAGER A YOUNG KID\" My order 2 times , I get home and this idiot still gave me the wrong order , didn't give me my daughters curly fries . I will NEVER COME HERE AT NIGHT!!!!!  They shouldn't have young dumb kids as managers!!!!!!!  Bad customer service !!!!!"}
{"text":"You guys need more help, i wanted to order some churros but he denied my request cause it was too busy"}
{"text":"I Bought curly fries at Drive through in the morning at this place And They have me over night fries. The fries was Old hard And over cooked"}
{"text":"It used to be that you could count on dependable ol' Jack in the Box to serve up some pretty decent late night snacks.  Now I just don't know what to think.. My recent visit to this location has me thinking I should just go to bed hungry from now on.  Waited in a long line, which moved unusually slow. I can't blame them for the amount of people waiting, but I can't help but think the service had something to do with it.  That's not a big deal though. What bothered me was the food I received.... Or didn't receive.  My order was missing my large curly fries... What's a burger without fries!?!?  I know I should have checked my bag before leaving, but after the wait I just wanted to get home.   If that wasn't bad enough, all the tacos I ordered were mushy, cold, and greasier than usual.  I just wasn't happy at all with this experience.  I'm not saying don't go to jack in the box... I'm just suggesting you should try another location.  This one is playing.."}
{"text":"Just too many homeless folks, its kinda depressing. Hooe they find a warm place to lay they head under. Other than that the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Always getting my greasy taste buds fix here.  I know it is bad, but sometimes I just want a burger and fries and FAST.  Got the ranch homestyle chicken this time.  It was good, fried, and served with ranch.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Poor drive thru service. Younger lady is in a hurry to get you moved on. Don't ask her for anything because she will give you attitude. 2 thumbs down. Want be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"First time coming to this jack in the box in years, every other jack in the box I've been to has never charged me to make my coffee sweet. Ordering my food and the guy says we charge extra to make it sweet I'm like wtf since when. Maybe that's why I don't ever come here."}
{"text":"Why did they make my cheeseburger with no cheese? Also, they forgot my straw.  My boyfriend had to leave the comfort of our home to get an actual cheeseburger.   There's always a 20 min wait at the drive thru as well. The excuse is they're always training someone or under staffed."}
{"text":"Grabbed a late breakfast through the drive-thru today. Service was fast, food was hot and tasted as it should; definitely one of my fast food establishments of choice."}
{"text":"I typically like Jack in the box, however I have been to this location twice and both times give me reason to never go back.  The first time, my jumbo jack had more sauce than anything else.  I couldn't even eat it, the bun was drowning in ketchup and mayo.  Fast forward a few weeks later, I go back and get a salad.  I begin eating it and it is good.  Then I realized that it is clear that the lettuce has not been washed and has super old mushy dark pieces of lettuce in it. The edges of lettuce that were sliced with a knife had dirt or something on them.  Super gross.  I didn't open the croutons.  They expired 5-08-17.  Keep in mind it is December 2017.   Quality control is definitely lacking at this location, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"The only reason i go to Jack in the Box is for there Jalapeno Poppers. Sooooo delicious i crave these things. I've tried these at every other fast food place sooo not the same. There Jalapeno Poppers are always hot and fresh with just the right amount of spiciness.   I like this location because there fast and very generous with the ranch dressing!"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I stopped in to eat breakfast brunch after a morning at my son's doctor's. We were greeted by a friendly young lady at the counter, where we ordered our food.  My son ordered The Chipotle Jalapeño burger, with coke, my husband ordered the brunch burger combo and coffee and I ordered the southwest scrambler with coffee. The breakfast brunch items came with a side; we both ordered orange cranberry muffins, the muffins were moist and delicious. Everything was hot, fresh and delicious. We used a coupon for the Chipotle Jalapeño burger: buy one, get one free-a win win all the way around! The manager as well as the employees are friendly and provide excellent customer service. The restroom is clean and the restaurant is clean. I recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've been to many fast food places, but never one that just could never get an order right. Every time I go my order is always wrong. On top of that, the wait is very long.  Don't waste your time coming here. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Coming from California, Jack in the Box is basically a way of life for me. The tacos dipped in ranch (definitely something everyone should try), seasoned curly fries & chicken sandwiches are normally pretty decent fast food.   Traveling through here to go to Maryland, my boyfriend & I stopped as a rest stop & to grab a bite. This is the best, hands down, Jack in the Box I've been to in my entire life. Everything was fresh & crispy, almost like I was experiencing a brand new fast food restaurant for the first time again. I ordered he spicy chicken sandwich & it was perfect. The fries has just been pulled & freshly seasoned. My boyfriend got 2 tacos (no, he didn't dip them in ranch), a Big Jack with cheese & a side salad. By the time we sat down to eat, the tacos were basically gone. I heard him bite into one & the crunch was just perfect. All Jack in the Boxes need to function like this one. If I ever drive through here again, you will definitely see me here again."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were just sitting down enjoying a meal. The manager rudely came out screaming and cussing because someone had taken her phone. Then she started accusing me and all the other customers. She wouldn't call the police to have our bag search or anything since we had done nothing but just wouldn't stop complaining about it. My girlfriend went to the counter and ask the guy for a receipt so we could get a review as well as the manager's name. He said give him one minute and never came up. We gave him about 5 minutes then I went to the front. The manager came back and asked me what I needed. I told her we just wanted to talk to the other guy and she said she could help me. I said no you can't let me talk to him she said Okay one minute. It's been about 10 more minutes and he still has not showed his face. This is pathetic service! Go figure a lady who works for a company that robs the welfare system by under paying their employees every day calling me a thief!"}
{"text":"probably the worse jack in the box i've ever seen!!!!30 plus minutes to get your order. horrible service !!!!"}
{"text":"Worst fast food place. I went through the drive though and 11:30. I ask for ranch and BBQ sauce and they forget to give me my sauce so I can't walk in because they are closed because it's 1130 at night. So I pull through the drive through again and they refuse to give me some ranch and BBQ sauce. Don't waste your time people."}
{"text":"The cashier was sweating up a storm he wasn't trained at all in cashiering. I ordered a crosonit and got something else it 20 mins to get my order when no one inside was waiting. Awful service they need to either train or fire everyone and start over. I fell for the DM for this location. Such a shame"}
{"text":"Idk why they ask after you order and pay for something do you still want this and I'm like yes that's what I ordered? Why would you ask me that? But overall customer service was ok."}
{"text":"Idk if it's some kind of sick joke all jack in the boxes are in on, but 2 days in a row I've gotten ranch instead of barbecue sauce. I'm disgusted. Good tacos tho."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The teenager working the counter didn't pay attention to the customers. Sadly I didn't look in my bag until I was on the road and about to take a bite when I realized it was covered in bacon. I'm allergic to pork. Had I bitten into it, I would have died."}
{"text":"So I usually never visit fast food stuff unless I am out on the road and I have never at jack in the box before but I would come back to this if I was in a hurry and needed something to eat. I am not saying this is better than in and out though.   The food was fresh and the customer service for a fast food restaurant was outstanding."}
{"text":"The customer service here is terrible! They are all miserable and it shows. It makes me not want to come to this location because of the service. The food is always good but man I feel so unwelcome there. I'd recommend avoiding this location!"}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing! Always in a great mood! The food is always super fresh, and my kids love it after a long day of sports. We mostly go thru the drive thru, and every time we do, it's quick and efficient! Thank you jack in the box"}
{"text":"Walked in took a while for them to get my order they didn't greet me. They took forever to get the order ready. And when they repeated the order back they got it wrong. Would not come back here again. Everyone spoke Spanish no one spoke English really sucks."}
{"text":"This location is slow, not very clean, and the staff is not friendly. The reasons for a second star instead of just one is because the food is usually correct (I mean, they certainly take their time), and there's not much other late night food around."}
{"text":"Always fast friendly service.  Fresh hot fries. Great food. I highly recommend it for breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is normally good here but....   What kinda of Jalapeño Popper is this!? I ordered a 7-piece and got 5 + 2 sorry excuses for Jalapeño poppers...  You guys could have at least thrown in an extra one to account for the lame pieces you put in there."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever on multiple occasions. Even at the speaker they ask you to wait. Nice staff though."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews it's not surprising nobody takes care of this location. The girl on the speaker was laughing the whole time she took my order and when I pulled up to the window she was still laughing... I said....\"is something funny?\" ...and she said ....\"\"yeah\",.....she than threw me my bag , without a thank you or have a good day,.....nothing."}
{"text":"Beware - SCAM alert...my car was towed.   I purchased breakfast here and walked down the street and came back 10 minutes later and my car was gone.   Spent a total of $200 between the towing and the taxi to the yard."}
{"text":"12pm.. didn't have to wait long... ordered chicken sammich meal.. it was good. Lunch for under $ 8... These other $10-13 dollar fast food guys better pay attention cause I can go here twice as many times as anyone else. Good job Jack"}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box really sucks! The worst one I've ever eaten at. The staff sucked, the food sucked, the restaurant sucked. The restaurant was not clean and the tables are so close together that you're bumping the person at the next table."}
{"text":"Blaque- a douche that did not want to take my order at 1:10 am I asked for 6 tacos and he was disrespectful. If manager is seeing this please address this."}
{"text":"As a Native Texan, I grew up with Jack in the Box.  When I moved to DC 15 years ago, I was dismayed to learn that Jack isn't in the East Coast.    That was...until I came to Charlotte for a conference.  You should have seen my eyes widened when I recognized Jack!  In the midst of the conference, I told my friends, I'm going to Jack in the Box even if I have to walk there.  We all got in the car and drove happily to Jack and ordered ourselves some happiness!  Oh, Jack!  You haven't changed a bit!  Thanks for staying true!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming her for a while they never give you a receipt in the drive through I mean NEVER. I've noticed 3 times already that I've been charged on days that I haven't even gone and the charge is always a dollar or so from what I actually got charged when I actually went. I will be contacting my bank about this!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love, LOVE Jack In The Box!! Sourdough Jack's are the best sandwich on the menu. Employees are always polite, no matter which franchise I go to."}
{"text":"Holy crap can you guys please turn the AC on in the dining room? It was hot as hell I was sweating balls trying to eat had to step outside where it was waaaaay cooler you guys do that in the summer too this has happened a few times!"}
{"text":"This location sucks! Seriously don't go here. The food is whack. Onion rings were old, stale and burnt to a crisp! The butter burger was just typical, no frills here! I want my back dammit!"}
{"text":"I got through Jack in the Box every once in awhile to get  plain egg and cheese only croissants. I haven't ever been to this location before and went through minutes ago to get my regular 2 egg and cheese only croissants and a large rootbeer. Usually my breakfast is around $8. However this morning coming to this location I was charged $11.97. When I got to the window I asked if there had been a price increase (as almost $4 more is significant) the employee said no. So when I got the receipt I looked at it and he had rang me up for two supreme croissants  (They come with egg, cheese, ham and sausage) and cost $8.58, and apparently don't get cheaper when you take the meat off of them. So I ran back through the drive through and asked to speak to a manager. The manager (female with no name tag I could see) came to the window and I pointed out I had been charged for two supreme croissants when I get mine with egg and cheese only and could have been charged for two sausage egg and cheese croissants (minus the meat) for the listed menu price of $5.39. She looked at me blankley and unresponsive for a good few seconds before not apologizing or anything to me. She went into the system and gave me a few dollars back and shut the window. Beyond rude. Clearly lacking in managerial/communication skills. I will not be patronizing this location again. The least she could have done was apologize. I hope corporate sees this review and reviews her position. This is not the type of person you want as a manager."}
{"text":"Horrrrrible. I just went through the drive through and the \"lady\" there was yelling in a ghetto manner to whoever else inside the store. Then, she rudely told me the amount which I handed her, some was coins and she's like \"this is the correct amount?\" In a rude tone once again, and although my husband told her yes, my opinion was COUNT. Do your job. Learn some customer service. I didn't even get my receipt. It's such a shame how so many places now hire just about anyone without any prerequisite of some people skills and customer service. Gross. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Management should hire and train staff better. Shame."}
{"text":"I was standing in line being ignored by everyone working. Then they helped someone who just came by after me so I let that go stood behind the person they were helping and when I step up to order they ignored me and yelled at someone behind me to ask what they needed. Worst service I've ever experienced at Jack in the box!"}
{"text":"Been 3 cars back for 15 minutes. Nothing about this is fast food. Customers are pissed.  I'd leave if I could get over the curb. Management should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"Very convenient location south of the strip. It's your typical Jack in the box with the added bonus of the pricing not being inflated simply because of the proximity of where you are.   I came here and ordered a side salad and a hamburger. Decided to go through the drive thru because I was in a rush and I was helped by a young lady called Katrina. She correctly took my order and was very courteous even though Mccarran's flight path made me say my order a few times. No biggie. Planes are loud.   Even then I was in and out within minutes. Trying to eat healthier but in a pinch? Why not, right?"}
{"text":"Love the buttery jack.  Needs less sauce and more compound butter, but still great.  This is the best burger i have had here (we love jack in the box). Do wish i could get all my burgers on this new bun.  I cant have sesame seeds so this would be awesome, on all the big burgers."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could, waited 14 minutes for my order. When I said something to clerk she started yelling at me in a loud voice that it wasn't her fault my order got bumped from the line. When I got my food it was cold though my husbands was warm."}
{"text":"Sad,sad,sad! I've been going here for about 8 yrs. Until today! Ordered a southwest chicken salad waited 22 minutes to get my order and yes it was wrong! I asked for the chicken on the side so my salad would not get soggy. They literally placed the hot chicken on the salad they Removed the chicken so when I got home the lettuce was warm and soggy!They forgot my dressing and forgot to give me my sons chicken sandwich! 2 items easy huh! HOW CAN IT GO WRONG! There was 1 customer in the drive thru and me inside no excuses. The employee was a jerk whom knew very little English and had a full mouth of tarter on her teeth and dirty uniform . Sorry but hygiene is a plus! Gross dirty place I don't know what happened it smelled like old grease please bring back the clean employees."}
{"text":"I have a low opinion of fast food places. So when I was hungry as hell at 11:30 pm, and the local all might jack in the box was my only option, I went there with low expectations, dreading the standard teenager-ran, horrible service, and bad food triad of disappointment. I was wrong. This place is very well run, clean, with fresh, delicious food. I got some sort of \"buttery jack\" burger & onion rings. The 2 person staff were two grown men who clearly take their job seriously. Fresh & tasty burger & onion rings. I was shocked how good it was. Next time I'm awake in the middle of the night I'm going back. Props to the night shift manager & cook, for actually caring."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the employee David for his fantastic customer service. He messed up on my hubbys order but right away he apologized and we got what we ordered right away. Employees make mistakes all the time but David approached it in such a great matter. The food was great and hot too! We will be coming here again and hope we get David again."}
{"text":"This is really a zero star post. When we pulled up the guy said it would be a 5-10 minute wait to even talk to him. As we were talking to each other about maybe just ordering milk shakes he interrupts and says in a really rude tone to tell us the milkshake machine was down. Then when I ask for coffee he gives some obnoxious remark about how the pot was an hour and a half old. (Um make a new one? While we are waiting 5-10 mins in line) I turn to my friend and say \"It seems like he just wants us to leave?\" He then comes over the intercom and says again very rude \"I don't want you to leave but obviously you can do whatever you want!\" I reply that of course I can do what I want, except get what I wanted to order. He then tells me he still reserves the right to ask me to leave. Okay this is when I lost it and told the little shit to F off. I then got out of my car and told the cars behind me they were pretty much out of everything and there was a 10 min wait for what they did have. Everyone backed up and we also backed out and left. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I went to Carl's Jr once and the grill had broken. They did everything they could to get me to still order. Considering they could not make burgers it was a very impressive experience. But this one at Jack In the Box was crazy!"}
{"text":"So here we are again and the people are more dryer then the last people. I was hoping we would have a better experience since it's not the weekend but it's clear to say everyone there has an attitude. I couldn't even get a thank you. Then she was handed back my card and I wasn't looking so she just stood there staring at me. Smh just sad! You can't speak!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Jacks over the years. Some, repeatedly. And, as seems to be the norm with them, the same meal does not always taste as good as it should (beef dried out, or barely warm (due to the cook pre-cooking the patty, soggy veggies, etc.).  But, today I went through the Drive-Thru and ordered a Jr Jack with Cheese, and all I can say is WOW!!! 5 Stars x 5!  While the service was okay (3 Stars, clerk was talking and laughing with another employee), the burger was the BEST of this kind that I have ever tasted at any Jack.! The patty was hot (almost too hot to hold at first), the lettuce and pickles cool and crisp! The tomato was cool and firm! And, the cheese tasted fresh!  Great work Jack! And, I hope ya keep it to this level in the future (I had actually quit going to the old location on Glendale Ave & Litchfield Rd because of the problems listed above).  Now, for a word of Warning! Be careful coming out of the Drive-Thru, and wanting to exit onto N Litchfield Rd. The traffic turning in is partially blocked by a brick wall. And, they usually turn in quite fast. A accident waiting to happen. So, it's best to circle around to the left."}
{"text":"If I recall correctly, this place did undergo remodeling within the past couple of years, or so. But, like others have said, the parking here leaves a lot to be desired. But, since I walked there from my hotel, I didn't have to worry about it. :)  Upon walking in, the place was empty, but clean. And, I found the staff to be friendly, and the food was delivered hot and was pretty good (I had the Chicken Ranch sandwich and curly fries with a soda. Then, I went back for desert, the Chocolate cake).  The place is trying to go upscale, as napkins and condiments are on the table in the same type of basket that they serve the \"Eat In\" meals in.  Well, both of my orders were designated as Eat In. But, both orders were delivered in a paper bag. So, I grabbed a \"tray\", which was actually a 8 x 11 basket. Nowhere near large enough to keep everything in it."}
{"text":"Good service all around clean safe place,good good breakfast fresh made to order and fast ..."}
{"text":"Second time here in two weeks. You would think that for a \"fast food restaurant \" the food would be fast. 30 minutes for jr bacon cheese burgers. Wow! Management and the staff move like turtles.  Service standards has really been going down hill. Fix it! Fast!"}
{"text":"So our first family trip to jack in box off Yuma was a disappointment. Go to order fish sandwich and Nuggets. Sorry no ice tea needs to be made. Ok will take water. Ohhh and sorry no fries will u take curly fries. Sure I guess we will. Get up to pay after around 10 min wait two cars ahead of us and young lady comes to window sorry no nuggets. So after another disappointment we decided to leave for home empty handed and hungry."}
{"text":"The inside was clean and service was fast. Luis took our order and he was very polite and efficient. We ordered extra cheese on our potato wedges and there wasn't extra cheese on them so I went to ask for more cheese and the manager (short dark haired woman) She will be the reason we don't go back. Giving 4 stars because Luis was so polite and friendly when he took our order"}
{"text":"Went and ate two jumbo jacks tonight. Not bad. But was slow as heck! Remember guys McDonald's isn't that far from here!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, hot food, food was OK, they forgot my coffee. Will be back for a second try."}
{"text":"Went here cause it was close to where I live and wanted some food really quick, and went through the drive-through and was greeted by a friendly voice! Ordered quickly and painlessly. Went to window and the lady was very nice, asked how my day was, quickly did payment and got food and drink! No complaints there. Got home, and food was good, there curly fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing management amazing employees everybody is so happy and genuine. Definitely will be returning to this restaurant. Food was great and could tell it was freshly cooked. Everyone should go there."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken teriyaki rice bowl and the rice was not cooked, it was still hard. The cheese in the jalapeño poppers was dried out. This place needs a lot of improvement on cooking the food they serve."}
{"text":"Went here late night just to grab a burger. When I pulled up to the ordering mic, I literally waiting about 8 minutes of sitting there before someone came in the mic to take my order. I went with the ribeye burger and curly fries. The price was reasonable but the burger was not good. It was cold and so were the fries. It tasted just like a thin frozen patty they forgot to season. That was my first and last time getting a burger from this chain. I may revisit for other items."}
{"text":"Family of 5 and first time ever at a Jack in the Box.  We were here very late on a sunday night so imagine our surprise when we noticed breakfast and dinner options available.  Breakfast food for dinner?  Yes please!  most of us had a breakfast item but one had a burger.  We each tasted a bit of others and I have to say everything was delish.  I was shocked at the size of the menu but so glad to have all those options."}
{"text":"Absolutely not fast food, I have been literally sitting in my car for the last 15 minutes and I still have two cars in front of me and all I ordered was a drink I am slightly pissed off. It would be appreciated if the people who work in the drive thru would have asked the people with longer orders to pull to the side 15 minutes is absolutely not acceptable."}
{"text":"Leave it at the curb, Bro!  So, normally when I pay this fine establishment a visit things are fine. Service is prompt and food is hot. Tonight I used the drive through and it was kind of uncomfortable.  The voice at the other end was noticeably agitated and really quite rude.  I really felt bad for even pulling into the place.  Cutting me off while completing my order with statements like \"that it?\"  \"Yeah, is that all?\"  \"I'll just get your total at the window\". I ordered 3 items. Sorry, Bro... didn't mean to put you out. At the pick up window \"here\" \"there's your change\".  I understand that we all have bad days... take 5 minutes and take a breather before you get back in front of a customer rather than just being a jerk. After being killed with kindness, he got it.  Should have paid me to come patronize your store.  Leave your problems and your shit attitude at the curb or forfeit your position to a young person that would appreciate the opportunity."}
{"text":"Stopped by early at 6:30 this morning and went in for the first time great service the cashier was friendly and sweet and I was impressed with her handling of service and she got our order completely correct even though it was a little complex."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very clean and the service was friendly and considerate. Restrooms were clean too. My food was hot, fresh and tasted great!"}
{"text":"So I drive a hot car and I didn't want to go home to an empty house...I got lost of course...and saw a Taco Bell about a half hour before but couldn't find it again...so I drove WAY WAY WAY out of my way to where I am familiar with...my old neighborhood.   Today wasn't the best day...I was feeling really lonely and down and SINGLE. I went to Taco Bell, but I didn't get a drink because I wanted an iced caramel coffee from Jack in the Box. It's not the closest to where I live...but familiar.  After tonight I will continue to drive out of my way.   I pulled up at 12:27 am and the employee working informed me the fryer was out. I told him all I wanted was a drink and not to worry about the fryer.  When I pulled up to the window he told me, I was so nice.  You never know what kind of day someone is having and just a few simple words can make someone's whole day.  We had a little conversation and his disposition about a busted fryer was still sunny and cheerful and he kept his sense of humor about the situation.  He didn't seem inconvenienced or irritated.  I wish I had tipped him or asked him his name so I could give him a shout out.  The drink was great, but the service is why I am giving five stars.    My last experience here was pretty poor.  I waited over five minutes for a single sandwich inside at the counter and left without my sandwich because I needed to go to work.  I thought it's just a biscuit sandwich with at least five people working how long can it take...but this experience tonight restored my faith in this location and I will drive here...WAY WAY out of my way from now on."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Jack In the Box fan, but I have no idea what the heck happened at this store!  So I was driving up from Atlanta, and stopped here at 10:45pm as I was hungry after the long drive and wanted a quick bite to eat to snatch and take to where I was going. Little did I know that between sitting in line and getting the food it would take 35 minutes. Now you can say hey why didn't you just drive off well, they were kinda busy so I was sandwiched in between two cars and couldn't move.  I finally got to the window to get ready to order the food and I am told to wait, I waited over 5 minutes before someone finally came back on. I order the late night munchies meal, and my wife got a burger.  After waiting for forever we get up to the window and they tell us they are doing a shift change and we have to wait. I mean what the heck is that? I get everyone does a shift change but when it's fast food come on. Funny part is within the 35 minutes no one left nor did any new employees come in at all. So I have no idea what the real problem was.  So we pay for the food, and the food wasn't ready. I can see her putting stuff into the bag and she grabs the curly fries with her hand sitting on top of the fries. (As if you'd grab it from the top) No gloves on same hand she had the money in as well. At this time I'm grossed out, she slides the window open and I told her I wanted a new fry because I thought it was nasty that she'd even reach onto it like that and she should have grabbed it from the side. She laughs tells me it's not happening and slams the window shut.  By this time I've waited long enough and I'm irritate so I figured \"forget it\" so I get home which is across the street. First thing I do is grab the fries and I throw them away. I look at the rest of my order to see everything else was messed up.  An entire bag of food all wrong, how in the heck does that even happen? The staff could care less about their job, everyone has an attitude problem, and the food here is just gross and not even worth spending money on. This Jack in the Box will be a spot that I never stop back at when I am heading this way on the long drives. What a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"The BEST biscuits of any fast food restaurant :D That's not an easy feat, you know? They are just the perfect consistency, just a little flaky, not too sweet (it's not supposed to taste like a cupcake, lol) & it doesn't turn into a rock if you don't eat it right away. I likee!    I also like that there are 2 exits from this restaurant. The one on Grand is easy to come in through, but not easy to exit from, lol. So on the way out I go out the back exit, which seems to lead into a paved alley and then exits onto the other side road. Easy peezy lemon squeezy :)"}
{"text":"Really not the first Jack in the Box we should have tried. On the upside the food was good and that really made us want to try out a different location so that we have a better experience on the whole.  The real drawbacks for this particular location were the staff and the dining room area.  The cashier wasn't rude, but definitely wasn't friendly.  We walked up and her first words were \"What do you want?\" which is getting to the point of ordering, but maybe not the best way to start an order off.   Once our food came up we didn't get any napkins on our tray and there weren't any out, so we had to go back up to ask - which is odd at a fast food place with mostly all of the food requiring you to use your hands. We also noticed that the people before us and after us had to ask for napkins also, so this wasn't a one time thing. They also didn't have any condiments out so we ended up going back up for that as well (but not sure if this is normal protocol for Jack in the Box?).   As for the dining room there were maybe ten tables (guesstimating) and only two were sorta clean, the rest were obviously a mess with trays and food on some and crumbs and used napkins on others - they also stayed that way throughout our meal (about 20 minutes) despite there not being a line for a lot of that time and a fair amount of staff on hand.  Overall: C- The food was good, but we will definitely be trying out other locations and not going back to this one."}
{"text":"I came in the drive thru one night and there was a cone placed in the driveway...thinking it was an accident because it wasn't even midnight yet, I drove around it.  I drove to the window and honked my horn and one of the employees came to the window and let me know they were temporarily closed because the people suppose to be helping on his shift had not gotten there yet.  Now I understand things happen however when I drove back around to the driveway I saw the employee I had just spoken with standing outside talking to 2 other employees that appeared to have just gotten off duty.   Now I know if there shift was over they are not required to stay, however if they were just going to be standing around in the parking lot talking and making jokes they could have easily stayed in the kitchen until someone released them.  Other than this trip I would rate the customer service to be about 4 out of 5 and the food to be about 4 out of 5 as well for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"i want to give them 0 stars. this is the second time ive gone there and got cold fries. im sick and tired of wasting my money on nasty food like this. i rather have fresh food and wait longer in line for it to be cooked right. i will never come to a jack again."}
{"text":"Everytime i try to go to this jack in the box.. they forget something, or cant get my order right. EVERYTIME!!! I always order the two tacos.. but tonight i only got one of my tacos. HOW do you forget that? Its unfortunate that this is the closest one to my house. STOP TAKING MY MONEY ASS IN THE BOX!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this a negative star, I would. I stopped by Jack In The Box pretty to get an order of curly fries and a drink. Why did it take 25 minutes? There was only one car ahead of me and one car behind me. When I finally pulled up to the window I thought the person at the window would say something along the lines of \"I apologize for the wait\". --but no. She was totally aloof. Very unprofessional. The staff moves slow and are too busy socializing, leaving very little time for work. I will NEVER go there again. You would think it's called fast food for a reason."}
{"text":"I can see the gum hanging out the corner of the boy's mouth at Drive Thru window - yuck!"}
{"text":"Think they got in trouble with their time. Cause they're rushing you through drivethru with fast asking, \"anything else.\" Than at the window. Wheres the boy who always has hiccies? Atleast he was nice and made you feel welcome.  Breakfast Jack was delicious. French toast and bacon looked unappealing. For the amount of time I was in line think the french toast was premade."}

The perfect Jack in the Box taco is order with and HAS extra lettuce. The perfect Jack in the Box taco has one full taco sauce package distributed throughout its scrumptious innards.  The Baseline & Greenfield location has low taco game. You can expect your taco to have been deep-fried twice because they precooked too many and didn't sell them. And you arrived at the drivethru 15 minutes later. So you get the extra oily tasting double-dipped \"warmed up\" taco.   The other variant of the precooked situation is that your tacos come to you dead cold. Grrrr.  Extra lettuce? Fuggedaboutit! They seem to take some sort of unclean joy in being extra stingy when you ask for extra lettuce. I actually tested this. My son went through the drive-thru before me for 2 tacos. I went through immediately after him and requested \"extra lettuce please, feel free to charge me for the extra lettuce if you need to... thank you.\" My tacos had less lettuce than my son's. For a full test we came back a week later and reversed roles... my son's tacos, requested with extra lettuce, had less lettuce than mine. .... Mean. Spiteful. Annoying!  So, here's the deal. Something is amiss at this location. And it's amiss in an institutionalize sort of way that has spanned years. DON'T GO HERE.  Best alternate location in order of preference are:   Southern and Val Vista, Northeast corner - This loc will do you right any time of day.   Warner and Val Vista, Southwest corner - Consistent over the years as well."}

That's not smart, especially if you're going to do some drinking....so, I stopped by this place to grab a quick bite to prepare my stomach for some alcohol.  I ordered 2 Big Cheeseburgers and a bottle of water in the Drive Thru.  It was fast and the burgers were hot.  They tasted ok.....they served their purpose well.  Will I return?

This Jack In The Box location is most convenient because it's a few blocks away from my house.  I like coming here because it's at the gas station I use the most and the drive thru is usually pretty fast.  The food is always hot and fresh and I've never had any issues with taste.  My most recent visit, I ordered a Big Cheeseburger and a Bottle of Water.  Simple order, but one of my fav's.  It was as tasty as a JITB Burger can be.  It did the job.....filled my tummy.  Will I return?  Unfortunately, yes."}
{"text":"Because it wouldn't be a complete trip out west without going to jack in the box. Always pleasant like any other location I've been too. They serve breakfast all day but lunch/dinner too which is a great contrast when you're not a big breakfast eater and my boyfriend is. Definitely a crowd pleaser."}

Come on! At least have them on the other side of the counter running all over the restaurant! However mom continued to work hard and do a great job with getting our food right out with a smile!"}
{"text":"I order the same order every morning and Monday - Wednesday it's correct, but on Thursday it's incorrect. I called and the cook in the back ground said \"really\", the girl on the phone called me hun. Just want to remind them that I'm the customer."}

The staff has always been friendly to me, the service fast compared to some \"fast\" food places I have been, and the food always good for what it is.  As to another review here I always get butt-loads of condiments where i actually have a little horde of sweet n sour sauce's banked up in my fridge lol."}

(\"Lo\" by the way is short for \"look\" as in look and behold - yes I looked it up to make sure ;p)  So I went overboard as I just left my local PT's favorite spot and ended up with 2 teriyaki bowls (not so hot tonight the rice was all mealy mashed up), an order of tacos, some jalapeno poppers, 3 egg rolls and an iced caramel coffee. Yea I went way over board lol and did not even eat it all, but hey it was late and I was mega hungry!  This spot I have only been to a few times and its \"a-ok\" for what it is.. and that's Jack in the Box.  Best Regards, James \"Culinary Schmooze\" Williams"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast. I got the meat lover's breakfast burrito and was impressed. It took a while to get our food but we had 6 people and I know Jack in the Box makes stuff fresh.  Tip - get pepper jack cheese on any breakfast item! Delicious...  Definitely a good place to fuel up for our long day of driving out to the Grand Canyon."}
{"text":"I like this location because it's close to the office and the food is fairly consistent. However I only gave it 4 stars because their drive through is always sooo slow and they are very cheap about ketchup. Almost every time I ask for ketchup they try to give me just 1 or two packets even though I usually buy 4 or more items for my office managers."}

{"text":"The meat of any of the burgers don't even look like meat anymore. Marginal service everything they show on commercials are just not true."}
{"text":"I do not recommend eating that food last time I did I had to poop very very bad please stay away from the breakfast burritos they will ruin the rest your day right after breakfast. I don't recommend eating fast food it all and if you're fat you need to stop eating fast food."}
{"text":"Guess it's time to train me a new Jack in the Box crew.  On relocating from San Diego, corporate headquarters of Jack in the Box, to Tempe, I finally had the urge to try the neighborhood Jack.  I order the same thing every time I go to Jack in the Box...big cheeseburger, add pickles, add onions, add tomato, extra pickle, extra onion, extra tomato.  If I order at the drive-thru, I am asked if the order on the screen is correct...and I drive forward.    Because the company does not start cooking until an order is made, I am OK with a bit longer wait for delivery.  The strange thing here is that the base price of a big cheeseburger is 40 cents more than in California.  Additionally, I was charged 30 cents (15 cents to add and 15 cents for extra) for tomato.    I get that some produce is a bit more expensive and I am OK with paying an upcharge...but if you are going to charge me, make sure I receive what I paid for.  On being delivered my sandwich, I unwrapped and lifted the top bun.  Plenty of pickle and onion and a burger that is seriously hot.  In asking the drive-thru person where the tomato is, she told me it was under the burger.  Putting the top bun back on and flipping it over, there is no tomato under the meat.  She apologized and walked to the grill area.  Once there, she picked up 2 slices of tomato and brought them to the window.  She had not put on gloves, she had not washed her hands and she offered me the tomato slices.  \"Honey, your hands have been on the register and taking money from people.  I'm not going to take any unwrapped food item from you.\"  I asked for a refund of the 30 cents.  While she processed the refund, I wrapped the burger up.  She handed me change and I headed home.  On arriving home, I ate and called the Jack line, I was advised this location is a franchise-owned store.  The Customer Relations person advised they would let the franchisee know of my concerns.  Oh, regrets...Oh, I have many regrets..."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came to this jack and in the box when we visited Charlotte. We were waiting to order our food. The cashier had her screaming kids in the restaurant and she also had the worst attitude. Next thing we knew she locked the restaurants doors !! We were completely shocked at this horrible customer service. Needless to say we did not give this business our money because of the rude employee! I hope anyone else who visits this place does not have the same shitty experience that we did."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern,   I was at this establishment between the time of 5:10 - 5:25A.M. I had to repeat my order to the order taker 3 times. Got to the window to pay and was NOT given a receipt for my order or given my drink which I asked for easy ice and was given extra. And the regular coke tastes like vanilla coke instead of regular. I received my breakfast jack and 2 tacos before getting my drink. While I had time to look around I noticed something that should be cleaned more often.  Once I was given my food it was more rushed out the window and I had to ask for my drink with some rolling of the eyes. I'm normally at this location at 730am, but the experience should be universal which apparently it isn't.   Concerned Customer"}
{"text":"The employees at this jack n the box are amazing... they are always cheerful and they ask how you are doing and are always super nice. You can tell they are trying to make people feel good while they wait for their food. The prices are decent and the food is always yummy for fast food. I don't think I have ever gotten a wrong order from them and I go here often for lunch on the weekdays. the jr bacon cheese burger on the dollar menu is sooooooo good and just a dollar :)"}
{"text":"But - look at my small curly fry that alone was 2.99 so as expensive as they are , you should get the amount of food pay for. Thank goodness I use the coupon"}
{"text":"This location has to be the worst! I couldn't believe how dirty the restaurant was! Dirty tables, floors and a mop and bucket right next to the dining tables! Yuck! There were four employees who were all goofing around, talking loudly about personal conversations and acting obnoxious! I should have trusted my gut and left. However, I proceeded to order and ended up with soggy, cold fries, a flavorless burger and one side of the bun was hard, almost stale. I will never return to this location! I've never seen such a poorly or more unprofessionally run restaurant!"}
{"text":"Took 27 minutes for our food and we were the only customers and no one in the drive thru,  one hamburger one Chicken Strips, and a chicken fajita.  The fajita looks like crap, and taste chewy and not like chicken and fatty.  The tortilla is dry and stale.  The soda machine is flat and no one would change it"}
{"text":"One of the drive thru supervisors here is super nice and  great at what he does.  Definitely knows how to value a customer.#LJ"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was fresh and hot. Location on Bruton Smith Blvd by CLT Speedway"}
{"text":"Went thru the drive-thru with my wife and daughter. Had to repeat back every item that we ordered. I guess they were done taking my order because they gave me my total before I was done telling them what I wanted. Oh well. Then got my drink wrong even after I had to repeat it 3x. I'm not even gonna go thru my disappointment with the ketchup."}
{"text":"Wow. What a beautiful jack in the box.  Pulled up thru the drive thru and order taker was very nice and helpful. I was expecting people in training but totally not the case. I immediately noticed the big window that allows you to see inside the restaurant prep area from the drive thru. It really makes me feel good to know nothing shady is happening with my food.  The interior looked great and had a modern feel to it however I didn't get a chance to go inside as I was in a hurry and I just wanted something to drink. I hope they maintain this place clean and in shape as new. We definitely don't need another crappy fast food place."}
{"text":"Well the quality of food has diminished since the last time I was there in 2008 I was not impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant or the quality of the food. The french fries were  undercooked and the burger was overcooked overall definitely not what I was looking forward to. Next time I visit Vegas I definitely will not stop by there to eat"}
{"text":"Hungry, haven't been to jack in the box in awhile, wanted to try their late night munchiez combo... So drove here at 1am... A homeless guy is sitting at the drive thru area where you order..... What..... I got creeped out! And very upset cause I drove here late at night to run in a homeless guy waiting at the order sign sitting there in the way. Also... By the garbage area I see people hanging out around there at 1am... i was way too scared to pull in the drive thru... So I did a u turn and drove the hell out of there."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for fast food restaurants, but this location makes the best Classic Buttery Jack!  The sandwich features a seasoned 1/4-lb. beef patty topped with melted garlic herb butter, a slice of provolone cheese, creamy tomato sauce, green leaf lettuce, tomato, and a new \"signature\" bun. Other places make it mediocre but this location always give me a steaming warm bun, juicy hot patty, and just put everything together so well (unlike some places who just slap it together and make it not snapchat/Instagram worthy).   Seriously, this new bun is OUT OF THIS WORLD! It's similar to a brioche bun or Bachi Burger Buns."}
{"text":"It's happened to everyone.  You pull away from the drive-through confident the Man in the Window filled your order successfully.  You plop down on the couch, unpack your booty, and alas and alack , twas not meant to be.  For me, this recent experience involved an uninvited switcheroo - seasoned curly fries were ordered, regular fries were delivered (at least I still got some type of fry, right?).  But despite this accident, I'm prepared to give Jack in the Box the benefit of the doubt, as their all-day breakfast options trump the occasional drive-through error seemingly unavoidable in the world of fast food.  In the realm of Vegas fast food, Sonic and Jack in the Box are the only two options for 24-hour drive-through breakfast.  Sonic never leaves me feeling all too great afterward, as their options seem greasier and less satisfying.  Jack in the Box barely beats Sonic on the grease factor, but their collection of egg sandwiches & bowls available anytime and their scores of local locations win out in my book in the battle of the bagged breakfasts.    If the options are driving out of my way for Sonic, or the Jack in the Box around the corner, Jack has my mind made up.  Specifically since I don't order fast food drinks (the food is bad enough, do I really need a sugar-ade to wash it down?) JitB is more convenient and tastier than Sonic, and I'll continue to support them as necessary to satisfy my junk food cravings, despite the occasional miscue."}
{"text":"I give this Jack in the Box -5 stars if I could. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION!!   I gave them 3 chances. They must be doing the same thing to other customers unless it's a crazy conquincidence that is happened to me 3 times.   I stop by here late at night to order the grilled stack munchkie meal.   1st time: My order was done wrong, it had mustard, onions & ketchup. I called and was told, that's how they make it now. Smh. To find out, there excuse was, we have a new cook.   2nd time: They put regular cheese instead of nacho cheese. They took forever for my order and I called the 800 number to share with them my experience & Rickie White the district manager said he will make sure this doesn't happen again since the excuse was \"we are short staffed\"   3rd time: they didn't add nacho cheese and instead melted regular cheese. I emailed a video to Rickie again and he hasn't replied in 4 weeks.    3 times with the same mistake. Don't take the chance everyone. Go to another location.   Management here are rude & employees have no customer services."}
{"text":"This is one of the more conveniently located Jack in the Box restaurants in my neck of the woods. I usually only come here when there is a coupon or discount of some sort available since I rarely like paying full price for fast-food items especially here in the land of endless two-for-one offers (a.k.a. Las Vegas, Nevada).  A CVS Pharmacy is located right on the corner for your medicinal needs and a Smith's supermarket is right across the street. If you want to shop more efficiently and combine several stops on one trip, then this location is a good spot for doing so.  As far as the burgers and other sandwiches served here are concerned, I have never been disappointed with any of my to-go orders so far. Service is invariably very quick and I am usually out the door posthaste with all my expertly prepared and delectable goodies safely in hand."}
{"text":"A convenient location near the intersection of Rancho Drive and Cheyenne Road whenever Jack has come out with a new burger creation that you might be tempted to try.  If it's not a burger day for you, then temptingly tasteful alternatives such as a Taco Bell, Wienerschnitzel and others can be found nearby."}
{"text":"The computer is always resetting between the times of 1am and 6am it's worst then McDonald's ice cream machine. Longest reboot in history. Time to buy a new computer Jack"}
{"text":"As a former late night employee, I thought I would have received excellent service, the way I served my guests.   I knew they weren't  so happy to serve me because I could hear the cook yell profanity in the background, I did not feel appreciated and comfortable.  So displeased I vowed not to order at my former job anymore."}
{"text":"Very bad services everyone had attitude and was very rude and disrespectful bathroom smells like garbage I almost passed out and they missed up my order"}

{"text":"Thanks Jack! The food was good, service was fast. It was Jack In The Box. We do not have this in Florida, so it was a nice treat on this trip. Jack In The Box tacos and curly fries are still my favorite.  This place was particularly clean."}
{"text":"I found this to be the best...absolutely incredible...salad ever (for fast food)!  I've gone nearly 75% no meat and the salads that this place have are perfect for on the fly...yeah you're going to have a slab o'chicken or something on it but just put it to the side because the dressing packet is great and really, REALLY, REALLY GOOD!    Cucumbers???? really amazing.  I've had salad at $$$$ restaurants and no cucumbers so KUDOS  to that!   Bacon bits are put in a side place within the salad so you can avoid them, super perk for those trying to avoid meat!  Service:  Absolutely fabulous  I've been many times and tonight was by far the best, really beyond expected.  I know, I'm not eating the meat!!!!!  Ya all hate me...but for me to be able to obtain a really awesome salad without having to hit a las vegas buffet...really great!  Thanks from Me...you have it right  ...and screw the crap reviewers...they have no clue what you go through to make something for someone else!  ya all rock!  tim"}
{"text":"What a joke I ordered chicken nuggets and got shorted one, yes only one. So I tell the lady who was working and she laughs and says \"do you want me to give you one chicken nugget?\" It may only be short one but the fact of the matter is I payed for it so I should get what I payed for. I don't care how minimal it is, and way to provide good customer service by laughing about it. Seriously unprofessional and rude. You know what is actually funny? The thought that fast food workers deserve a raise."}
{"text":"Cockroaches crawling up the wall.  Employee out front smoking a joint.  EVERY surface is crazy sticky.  My order is NEVER right.   Am I coming back?  Oh HELLLLLLLLLS no."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if I could.  Have gone here about 3 times since moving to this part of town.  The first time was a standard fast food visit.  Nothing special, nothing awful.  The second time my fries were so flippin' cold you could have put them in a drink as ice.  I reached out to their customer service and they tried to make up for it with coupons. Then, last night, my husband was starving around midnight and decided to run across the street and get Jack-in-the-Box. He did a drive-thru order, and the entire time the employee was RUDELY saying he couldn't understand my husband and was giving a ton of attitude back as he took the order. My husband was told it was $15 and change; however, when he got up to the window, the cashier (whom seemed to be the only employee working - only one car in the parking lot, too), said it was $19 and change.  My husband questioned the price, but the cashier insisted it was $19 and change, so my husband gave him the cash to pay and asked for a receipt.  The cashier said he couldn't provide a receipt.  He said he \"already threw it [the receipt] away\" EXCUSE ME?! So no proof of what we owed or what we paid or change given? Yeah cause that's how ALL business operate right? So pretty sure the guy stole money from us and the company. To make matters worse, the damn guy was wearing flip flops.  YES FLIP FLOPS! In a kitchen! Preparing food in FLIP FLOPS! Last time I checked, those weren't kitchen safe slip-resistant shoes.  Oh and don't get me started on the \"food.\" Sure it's fast food, not a 5-star restaurant, but it still shouldn't look like someone sat on my sandwich.  I don't trust this place.  Next time we'll just go to taco bell for a late night craving. It was so bad, my husband - whom is the nicest, most patient guy I know - told the guy he should turn in his notice, clearly he'd rather steal money than put in honest work! BEYOND PISSED!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well up until this point the food for me has always been good. But towards the end of eating my supreme croissant sandwich I find a hair in my food. OMG nothing like feeling sick to your stomach now from eating.  Then well my brothers finishing his sandwich he finds an eggshell in his. WTHeck..Even though the service was great in the drive-through and everything was fine and it always has been up until this point. Who's not wearing their hair net and being careful when they're making your food. Well I guess it will be a while before I go back to this Jack-in-the-Box. Bummed because it's so close to the house and the food has always been great. I know things happen and everyone deserves a break but I just can't imagine going back for a while. Not sure who they have cooking back there and putting sandwiches together but hopefully they start wearing a hairnet an is being more careful when making your food looking for eggshells and hair.. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the service was fast today an good. BUT Guess it's back to McDonald's breakfast sandwiches for a while when it's not a cooking breakfast day."}
{"text":"I come here often in the evening/night. The customer service is always top notch. The staff are super courteous and they get the orders correct all of the time. It's always timely as well. I have only come through here once and had a bit of a wait time. At that time they apologized and offered a free drink. This is my favorite Jack in the Box by far."}
{"text":"They forgot my fricken tacos and I asked for them! rude!"}
{"text":"Worst Jack n the Box around. They can't get an order right. I could understand if you special ordered your items, but when you order an item right off the menu, you would think they would know what's supposed to (and not supposed to) go on it. Half the time they don't even give you your full order. Once they even let me order, and pay for, sour cream, only to let me know after I finished in the drive thru and went in, that they don't even have sour cream anymore. Complete imbeciles every time. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Ou Em Gee. I drove up to this location at about 10:00pm, with no other customers behind or in front of me. I told told the girl I wanted curly fries with the order TWICE!! Took my order and told me to drive up to the parking spot. I was waiting at least for 10 minutes. Don't know why. There was one customer that drove up while I was parked and still managed to get her food first and fast. I'm still waiting and they give me the order with two regular fries. I had drive around to change the order.This whole process took at least 15 minutes. I drive off and find out that she did not put ketchup in the bag even after I asked. The food was good, but the service was horrible. Given the fact that there was no customers inside the restaurant and 2-3 staff members, why just why ?? Never coming back"}
{"text":"1/2/2017, 4:10 PM - posted to the register, \"Sorry we are short on staff. We will open back at 5:10\" - see pictures!   Limited menu nothing from grill.  2 employees one of which was sick and neither NC ServSafe certified.  6 month old health inspection of 92, yep that means FILTHY DIRTY. Not the employees fault but points to HORRIBLE management."}
{"text":"Ugh, so bummed when Yelp told me I was a regular after only checking in here twice.  Got some coupons in the mail, so got a 1/2 off Oreo Cookie Shake for under $2 and then went back the next night for a free Hot Mess burger with the purchase of a gigantic $2 beverage.  The Oreo shake is standard, doesn't disappoint.  The Hot Mess burger wasn't that great.  Good bread, but even with all of the ingredients, I was disappointed.  Props to the guy who helped me for being so excited about this new burger, though.  Not sure I can get excited about any fast food, but I guess some people can.  That's rad."}
{"text":"From reading these reviews it appears the night shift is horrible, but I wouldn't know because I only go to this location around noon.  Whenever I've gone here, the lobby is clean, the orders are right, and the food has actually been nearly perfect as far as JitB goes.  I always notice an older gentleman there who is either the GM or owner because he's always there, he knows what he's doing, and if he's running things most likely once he leaves the place falls apart.  Also night shift employees usually aren't at the top of their game anyways considering the fact that's likely their 2nd job.  Bottom line is, this location is great during the day from my experience and the manager is very friendly"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate it better, and almost rated it worse - as I tend to lean towards Jack in the Box for fast food more than other places. This is close to my home. I have lived in the neighborhood for 8 yrs - they have always done well. I have noticed this past year or so that they would constantly be out of cherries for the shakes or whip cream all the time! I \"many\" times leave the drive through to grab a fry or two and a majority of the time they are luke warm. One time they were less than that. Really ticks me off! Their burgers are always fresh and good. Yesterday I went and noticed they had a whole menu change and got rid of my favorite burger. So I order a shake (sorry we are all out of shakes) - are you kidding me!!!! First it was the cherries and whip cream, now it's the shakes too! If I didn't know better this place may be closing down. Ok, then I ordered a Bacon/Swiss burger for $6.99. The guy asks if I want bacon on that. LMAO! I said well it says Bacon/Swiss and he says I know but it is $ .25 for bacon! I said that is not what the menu says - I will go elsewhere, so I left. I love Jack in the Box. But this is ridiculous!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could leave negative stars, I would. This experience starts a couple days ago when I ended up waiting quite a few minutes to even be acknowledged. Not a big deal, but I'm the only one in line and it's 12:30 at night, so what else would be going on at this time? But I digress. In addition to that, \"Roggie\" was the most apathetic service individual I've ever met (and I've met my fair share). Not even the slightest bit interested in my order paired with a magnanimous amount of attitude. I ended up waiting an additional 6 minutes for a munchie meal. I left with a bad taste in my mouth as he said \"bye\" without saying thank you or have a great night. So I left an internal (Jack Listens) review to see what kind of response I'd get. The manager, \"Roland\", assured me that he would speak to the individual I had mentioned in my review and that my next combo was on him. All I had to do was mention that he was covering my meal the next time I came in. Now that brings me to tonight. I thought what the hell, I'll go back. I did and was met with even more snide speech. I ordered the new breakfast burrito combo. I asked for egg white,  and (I wish I could type it the way it sounded), he repeats it back in the most stereotypical gay way. There is no other way of saying it. I asked for a Dr Pepper as my drink and he repeated it back to me the exact way I said it. I was shocked. He said to go to the first window to which I did. He said the total and I mentioned what I was told to. He looked at me and said in a snotty form that he knew nothing about that and that he would've written it down. \"Sorry bout that\"  I said not a problem since it would be pointless to argue with such a dense an idiotic person. He then disappeared to get my food. After 4 minutes, a lady came to bring bring me my drink. I thought that was interesting. Another two minutes minutes and she came back. I asked her if she may have known about about the conversation with Roland, to which she replied the same thing said before, but even more attitude! I I then said that thanks to him, I would now take my review public. And with the most fake smile she could muster, replied,  \"Ya. You do that!\" I drove away to see \"Rodrigo\" (according to the receipt on this occasion) cowering in the corner which makes me think he knew exactly who I was and the conversation he just denied earlier. And before anyone thinks I am just doing this for free food, I will never be going back to to this establishment even if they PAID me. Yeah, it's it's that bad. Don't go here ever! As for me? Burger King sounds better. Better yet, I get better customer service at the 24 hour gas station nearby nearby then here. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Whoever was working the drive through at 3:00am needs to take their time .... no one was in the drive through but me and lady couldn't even take the time to properly put cinnamon on churros.....they barely had any on them.... if I wanted just plain churros I would have said so."}
{"text":"We used to go to this restaurant because is closer to our house but after a lot of bad experiences, we just scratched out and drive to the one on bell. The top of it on this restaurant on waddell was that we order 2 hamburgers with no onions after waiting for 30 mins. We got the hamburgers soo cold that the bread broke into chuncks. It felt as if they took it out of the refrigerator. We returned them and wait another 10 mins. We got our hamburgers and came with onions!. We returned and they told us to wait AGAIN so they can make them again. At that point we just ask for the money back and went to the one on Bell. In less than 3 minutes we got our hamburgers with no onions :). The tacos on waddell are never right. The tacos on Bell are soo delicious and crunchy everytime!. I wish they (people on waddell) would really, really take care of business. It would be a lot better for us because is closer to our house."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Jack in the Box I've ever been too. I feel like every time I've gone something is wrong. The grill wasn't working once, they were out of Coke products the next time, etc. another time I went I ordered a raspberry lemonade and was given a raspberry tea instead. I asked for a replacement and the employee looked at me weird as if I'd inconvenienced her even though she got the order wrong. Long story short, avoid this location."}
{"text":"I am from New York, and can only get this when travel to Charlotte.  Came to this location for the first time a couple of years ago and fell in love with sliders lol.  They season the freaking meat!!!  Added onions that were cooked and nothing like the wet weirdness that is White Castles.  We actually ordered and packed these little suckers to take back to NY.  Yes, gross but they are that good.  I think I like this fast food place because it tastes nothing like anything I am used to and everything does not taste the same---I am looking at you Mc D, Wendy and the King.  The variety is cool.    Last night arriving at our destination after road tripping we went straight to our dream spot and were disappointed sliders slid off the menu.  We were not left disappointed for long as we had a huge variety to choose from.  My daughter ordered breakfast at 11pm.  How awesome was that?!?! Steak fries with chili and jalapeño for moi.  Yes gross and I will have heartburn in a day and giant monstrous thighs in a week, but I loved every minute."}
{"text":"According to this Jack in the Box, this is a box of 20 chicken nuggets. It looks like 18 chicken nuggets and a burned French fry. The employees who work there actually bag each and every nugget. How sad that they can't count to twenty. Maybe I'll have better luck ordering two 10 piece nuggets! I am a regular at this particular store and I'm ready to drive 2 miles further to a different Jack in the Box. This has been an ongoing problem for the past few months."}
{"text":"The food and service is good. My issue is with the wifi. Why is it every time I visit any Jack in the Box location my Kaspersky virus scanner software bombards me with popups to block certain domains? While I thank Jack in the Box for providing wifi its not a good service if your computer downloads spyware, adware, and installs a bunch of cookies. Jack in the Box needs to get their act together with the intrusive wifi they use."}
{"text":"So I'm on my way out of town to visit family in california and I am a little low of gas and figure I better fill up before heading out. At the M casino near the edge of Vegas I see they have a gas station pretty much connected to the place. Noticing the Jack connected to the place I figure what the hell and decide to grab an early lunch.   The place is obviously brand new, the whole building is sparkling clean and everything is shiny. Nice photos all over the place from what I can only assume are old Jack commercials, very tasteful. They even have something that I have never seen at any other Jack, a cool new kiosk where you can order food without having to actually talk to anyone. Cool little device, but not all the necessary given how friendly the staff were.   Food was pretty good, got a sirloin burger with a side of egg rolls (god I love those egg rolls). The egg rolls were a little over done but piping hot and I got everything extremely fast. All in all a good meal and good service with an excellent location just as you are entering or leaving Vegas. Gas was fairly cheap, food service was quick, and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"On two occasions I've been, dining area was clean and counter and drive-through help was courteous.    Don't care much for JIB food in general - I like Jack's advertisements more than the food, but my iced coffees were good and not nauseatingly sweet.  I'm not set against fast food or chain restaurants but the more I thought about Jack's basic food offerings that I've tried, I couldn't quite keep up that 3rd Star, though I'll grant honorary one for the iced coffees and the courtesy at the counter and window on my two visits to this location, which I believe has a 24 hour drive through service."}
{"text":"Does jack in the box really need a review? You don't come here for impeccable service or order accuracy. You come here because the tacos are LIT and they're 2 for 99 cents and I live across the street. And sometimes you just need a jumbo jack. Or curly fries. Or a bombass shake. Jack in the box is underrated for their shakes as a fast food joint for sure. I love jack more than Burger King or McDonald's for sure. I feel like their menu has more to offer"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! The manager/shift manager Cecy was rude. Accused us of lying that we didn't find hair in our burger and gave us a hard time. Refused to refund our money back and insisted they make the burger again. On the other hand the cashier \"who only works here\" Abe was great! I only have a one star because of him!"}
{"text":"Got a free shake coz the next day they were closing... It's gone, folks. Nothing but boards and emptiness."}
{"text":"Came here to visit some friends with my girl. After going to an amusement park we were starving so we drove around until we saw... JACK IN THE BOX! I've only heard about this place since there is none in florida. I've always wanted to try it and I'm really really glad I did. Checkers used to be my favorite fast food place but I think Jack In The box just beat it completely. The variaty is insane!! They have burgers,  egg rolls, churos, salads, everything! If I ever come back here I will definitely eat here way more often!!"}
{"text":"I came to eat with my kids and this establishment only has 1 single high chair !!! Wtf!!! I had to sit my 8 month old in a regular chair risking he could fall because the single high chair they had was being used .this jack is not baby friendly !"}
{"text":"Just another case of driving all the way home, ready to chow and unpacking the wrong 'expletive' order. Now my girl had to go back and make it right. I should know to double check my order."}
{"text":"For my experience you must know that this was a drive thru order.  There was no car line at 5 o'clock which is cool and weird considering that's when people are getting out of school and work, but I can't complain.  I am vegetarian so I only eat the curly fries and I knew that this was what I was going to order, but that didn't mean I didn't want to check out their menu to see if they had any other goodies. In this case, they didn't. What's even worse is they didn't have on the menu the sizes or prices of french fries which bothers me because I hate paying for things I don't know the price of, but I knew it was the only thing I could eat.  I ordered a large curly fry and it was $3.05! I thought that was pretty expensive considering the amount of fries I got was about a medium. I will say though, if I had eaten more than what I had gotten, I would have felt much more sick to my stomach then I was already starting to feel.  I will give the girl at the window who took my cash and handed me my food was very friendly and asked if I wanted any sauces and wasn't stingy when I asked her for ketchup (however I did ask for a good amount)."}
{"text":"Fry's were cold and the Jumbo Jack with cheese was watery and dripped of too much ketchup and mayonnaise. It's hard to believe that this restaurant had good reviews on its food...it was the worst burger I have eaten in a long time...this is the reason why I stay away from Jack N the Box"}
{"text":"I love the 1$ drink promotion, though I am sad their tea is now concentrate not fresh brewed..but they are always SO nice every time I went through the drive through for a tea and brownies at 7am, yes pregnancy does weird things to people:)"}
{"text":"My food was cold and my cheese was not melted on my burger but that won't stop me from going to a jack in the box."}
{"text":"The service here at this location was great!!!  They were friendly, nice people and easy to order with.  I love Jack in the Box it is my new favorite fast food place.  Too bad they aren't on the East Coast.  The selections seem endless and my friend says they change stuff a lot.  Restaurant was pretty clean, too."}
{"text":"Service was good, but this was my first--and probably last--time eating at a Jack in the Box.  I had the spicy chicken and biscuit with hash brown for breakfast.  ALL grease, NO flavor.  Spicy chicken had heat, but didn't actually taste like anything at all.  If you have a hangover, this is the perfect place to find your bland, greasy food.  I'd even heard they were great for breakfast, which is why I'd tried it then, so this was surprisingly disappointing."}
{"text":"This guy name rafael which is a cashier... won't let us do a seperate order.. he said we can only do 1 order per car. And I was like why? There is no car behind us. Do you want us to drive around and order again even tho is a same thing. And he said they been doing it since the jack in the box on lake mead first open. RUDE COSTUMER SERVICE.. AND the guy who worked there name rafael is stupid."}
{"text":"Not very pleased with this location. I ordered a simple Jr. Bacon cheeseburger and it came with no cheese. It wasn't busy at all.. How could you forgot to add cheese to my burger. I will not be coming back to this location.."}
{"text":"I give this location 3 stars because I like their burgers. The only problem with this location is those homeless bums and crackheads hanging around the drive thru begging and asking for change. I just don't pay them no attention. The last time I was nice enough to give one a couple of dollars so he can eat. I don't do it anymore though. However this location is pretty good."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved back to this side of town I've been having moments of \"I forgot this was even here!\" Enter: Jack In The Box.   For some of us, dinnertime is at like 10:30. And then Second Dinner at like 3 am. There are a couple of other 24-hour or late night fast food places around, but Jack is just so good and diverse. I mean, where else can you get a double cheeseburger, tacos, egg rolls, and a lava cake all at the same place? And dirt cheap AND 24 hours? Don't even get me started on the milkshakes. Sigh. I knew this would be dangerous.   One great thing is that you can read your order the way they ring it in on the screen, so you can make sure it's right. So all you people who like to leave off the tomatoes and get crushed ice instead of cubed and 3 Honey Mustards instead of 2 can be sure they heard you.  Noms At Night grade: A+."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE !!!!  I went through the drive thru and got my order.  I usually check it before I leave to make sure I got everything I paid for.  This time I didn't and of course, they forgot two of my items I ordered.  And they didn't even give me my receipt so I couldn't prove to them what I ordered and paid for !!!"}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience here. I tried the bacon ultimate cheeseburger combo and it was delicious! As you would expect with most burger combo meals, it came with fries and a drink. The price wasn't bad either. My meal cost roughly $6 to $7. The restaurant itself was very clean and the employees were courteous. I definitely plan to return to this place."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. The guy who took our order was very polite. Our food came out fast (even by fast food standards!) and nothing was screwed up. Another thing to point out is that there was a group of people in the parking lot who appeared to have car trouble. I overheard the same gentleman who took our order ask them if they were ok. I thought that was really cool."}
{"text":"I can count with one hand the number of times I have been to a Jack in the Box. Wasn't impressed with the food and service and I wondered why the line at this location's drive thru is always long.  Dropped by this afternoon for a quick after school snack and I am impressed. The place was spotless. The service was awesome from the nice bemustached gentleman who looked like the manager. He was patient and helpful. The food was surprisingly good too. My spicy chicken sandwich had a little kick to it and I loved that it had a lot of fresh veggies in it. The kids gobbled up their cheese burgers and fries. We all preferred the regular fries compared to the curly fries by the way.  I think I have found my new place for when the urge for fast food gets too hard to resist.   Oh and I overheard them say they give military discount as well."}
{"text":"This jack in the box is the worst I've ever seen. Every employee in there is clueless and after leaving you need and shower.... throw the whole Jack in the box away!"}
{"text":"My first job in high school was working the cash register at Jack in the Box.  My girlfriend Diane worked there too so imagine Lucy and Ethel at the chocolate factory. I can say that Diane did get a burger thrown at her only once because it had sauce on it and they asked for NO SAUCE.  Glad I wasn't working the window that night!  Despite my fond memories and many funny stories about working the drive-thru window I can say after all these years I still keep coming back and the memories continue.  I know it sounds crazy but when I first met my husband we joked about how we both love Jack in the Box tacos. I was like \"really\"?  Not too many people want to admit that, most guys are too busy trying to impress their dates with gourmet finds or that perfect Fois Gras they found in Paris. But I was impressed with his honesty and his love of JITB tacos... so a fabulous \"foodie\" I found:)    BTW he has impressed me with a his Fois Gras findings in Paris!  At this location, I love that they give out coupons to get two tacos for free!  How do you beat that?  Well, if you don't have a coupon you can get them for .99 cents.  Oh, and when I don't get the greasy yummy tacos I get the Grilled Chicken Pita it only has 350 calories:)  Mehhh-mories...la la la la la la la (me singing Barbra Streisand)"}
{"text":"It's my fault. I knew going to jack in the box after midnight meant the milkshake machine would be cleaning and the made to order burgers would be warmed up and made to be reheated. My ultimate cheeseburger had fresh sauce but it was not able to cover the old burger patty lukewarm taste."}
{"text":"Love me some Jack in the Box! Another one of those West Coast chains that of course ends up in Charlotte, and I'm failing to see the bad reviews! Yes it's a burger chain, but if you know what to get you'll be like wowed! It's the quirky things like the French Toast sticks that are incredible and light! The crunchy tacos that are simple, small, but addictive! The egg rolls which again are simple, not large, but very tasty! The chicken tenders are excellent, as well as the fries! The sourdough sandwiches for breakfast are some of my favorites, and can be ordered 24 hours a day! Don't over complicate things, and just order the quirky items! You'll find yourself doing the random 2am drive thru!"}
{"text":"We don't have In-n-Out, or Whataburger, but this is pretty damn good for not having either!  Having stopped here multiple times over the years, I can attest to the fact that both breakfast and lunch are fabulous!  This morning it was the classic Sourdough Jack!  Bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiched between two grilled pieces of Sourdough!  Some oddities that will surprise you-Grilled French Toast Sticks, Egg Rolls, and Tacos!   I know, these seem odd for a burger joint, but well worth your taking the risk!"}
{"text":"The line was empty at the drive thru, yet the cashier had this pushy, rushed tone to her voice. I asked for an order of fries and a sprite. Once I got to the window, she took extra long to get to me even though there were no cars in front or behind me. I'll assume it was because she was taking great care with my order. Once I gave her my card she gave me my food, I collected my card, and I left. When I exited I looked to see if perhaps there was a car who was giving a long order and no no one was there. Oh well. It's fast food after all."}
{"text":"I like reading other's  reviews on their opinions.....And how some can be so critical on a fast food restaurant knowing its not some 5 star restaurant you get what you pay for....It's not terribly awful I found the customer service to be very polite and Ceasar was awesome \" Thanks Ceasar\"...I'm not a big fast food person but will be back"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in last night to get some food after a girls night on Mill and our night ended in the cop's being called. Really... two small ass girls need to be escorted by cops? My friend went up to the manager to ask for a receipt she never got and was literally denied her receipt and they called the cops. Does that make any sense? And he refused to tell l us his name. All I can say is this poor establishment messed with the wrong people..."}
{"text":"This place is filthy and so are the employees clothes.  We went yesterday and ordered the Jumbo Jacks.  They were overcooked and tasted terrible. The fries were burnt and tasteless. One of the employees was wearing gloves but kept touching her hair. One of the men had on a tee shirt with food stains all over it and it looked like it hadn't been washed in sometime.  The place was empty but all the tables and floor were dirty.  They threw our burgers on a tray without proper wrapping.  Later that night we both felt nauseated and during the night we got diarrhea and continued into the next day. The employees are not friendly, except to their relatives who drop by.  They stop everything to talk to their relatives in Spanish. This place needs to be closed down. They are never busy and we now know why.  Most of their items are overpriced and we could get better quality and service at In and Out for the same price and they have good help, quality meat and the place is always clean. The Jack in the Box  Bathrooms stink and are not supplied with everything.  Never going there again."}
{"text":"Went here late last night to get some milkshakes for the family. THEY WERE TERRIBLE! The guy working there at the time told us that he thought he had enough ice cream but wasn't sure?? So we pulled up to the window the total was 14 dollars for 4 milkshakes!!!!! he started handing us the milkshakes and they were only half full! I would of him just say he only has enough for three. What a joke we will not be going back here ever again!"}
{"text":"This is the first time coming to this place. It will be my last. We stood in line for about 7 to 10 min before they even asked for our order. We placed an order we don't have any more of those. Then the employee was very rude. She acts as tho she didn't want to take our order. Then it took 10 minutes to get the food. It was very nasty and cold. The employee didn't greet anyone. Put drive thru before us. People walked out. They didn't get all there food. Then when they did order we out and customer asked about the taco and Emily said they are froze... Just very rude. Nasty inside. If you don't want to be at work stay home.. makes no sense that people at drive thru could order the tacos and we inside couldn't. SMH. Gotta do better or shut the doors.... I don't live here I'm 2 hours away and it's a shame. Better luck for those who keep going back..."}
{"text":"Went on my break to grab a quick bite, the food is just not good in my opinion. I ordered two chicken sandwiches and it was lathered in mayonnaise, way too much for my tastebuds to handle. I understand it's fast food but won't be visiting any jack in the boxes to satisfy my needs."}
{"text":"After my experience at Del Taco next door (see Del Taco review) this place was very nice. Everything was the way you would expect it to be."}
{"text":"Was seeking a strawberry shake on the way home and remembered Jack N Box does that at this time of night, and it's still good. I love this location since the lobby and the drive thru is open 24/7. The manager tonight took my order and was very attentive and professional. He seemed a bit rigid, but he is running the show with a really busy drive thru too.   Aside from the strawberry shakes that bought the twins reminded me that we should just eat here and then no cooking yeah, I concur. I ended up ordering a couple of their larger burgers in the Buttery Jack flavors they were so good. I applaud Jack for making sure a great line of burgers that are high end without the higher price tags. We had curly fries with the house ranch is always a must.   The twins wanted Jack tacos which are always great so inexpensive and really tasty. I ordered them jumbo jacks too since they need a well rounded balance of all the food groups. You know those food groups being: ice cream, tacos, burgers, and pizza. So now off to enjoy jack with the family and the rest of the flick."}
{"text":"Ended up ordering take out for the twins here and since brought the motorcycle went in and ordered take out. My cashier was Joaquin, whom was very nice and friendly. I ended up looking at his name batch he is the manager too. The lobby was not full when we came in but started to fill up. The service was really fast while we were here and the reason for one less star is there were two guests that decided to have a music war and the music that Jack in the Box plays is overwhelming anyways, imagine that with a different type of music going and then another customer wanting to here there tunes over it. I was glad that we took take out.  The food that we ordered was absolutely amazing and was made to the way that everyone likes. The ten tacos that we ordered were no lettuce and they were all made fresh too. Our whole order did not even take that long, by the time we sat down got comfortable our name was called. I noticed as well that they ask now for your name and it makes it seem more personalized. Maybe now we are less than a number."}
{"text":"The twins being hungry for lunch decided that Jack in the Box has something they both will enjoy. This is the first visit to this store and upon entering was highly impressed since the store while only moderately busy with customers was very clean. The cashier was very friendly too. The order process was smooth and uneventful. After I placed the order verbally the cashier even shocked me. He stated, now I'm going to read the order back to you. Then he did just that. When I did finally receive the order it was all correct too.   I ordered 6 of their Jack taco pairs without the hot sauce and lettuce. When they put lettuce on their tacos it just does not taste properly. Probably since their tacos take a bath in the grease for awhile. This grease bath although bad for one tastes good with their house ranch. I have one twin that likes chicken and she ended up with the chicken sandwich. I ordered this plain too since the sauce does not do any justice to the chicken. My son wanted cow so he had the junior jumbo jack plain too. The cheese and other toppings he does not like. Besides I like mine like this too . I did have to sample the jumbo jack to ensure that it would not poison my son. Mission accomplished it was super good. For the value of the food,quality, and service this Jack in the Box would have Jacks seal of approval too."}
{"text":"Stopped here since the variety of food they serve is something that I can enjoy and the twins too. Usually, in my past visits I avoid this local due to the homeless element here and the awful service in the past. I was pleasantly surprised this time when I believe all deserve a second look. One must never judge a restaurant by its cover.  The lobby was a little untidy but with a crew of only three they were doing a heck of a job. There was a cashier in the front, one for drive thru, and a cook! They showed so much love and teamwork that it was intoxicating. The cashier for the lobby was so busy they she was making out taco order even. They had such a command performance. And when the drive thru was not busy that cashier would assist in making their famous jack tacos for the lobby customers.  My twins and even I occasionally love the jack tacos and the lobby cashier rang up our order of 20 jack tacos with no lettuce and no sauce. This is one of the rare locations that still has these amazing tacos 2 for $1.00. The drive thru cashier made the jack tacos just the way they come. They changed the order of course but they did it in unison and with no attitude. We also ordered the Jumbo Jacks which were cooked really well. We took a chance and tried the loaded fries with steak and cheese. These fries were a steal for only $3.00. The cheese on the fries was a real American cheese not liquid cheese, so worth the$3.00 price they were charging. The speed that we received our order was in record time too.  It must be something they can maintain too since the first order of jack tacos was a mistake they remade them and it seemed it took less time! I will frequent this location more now that I know change is afoot!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out with them and this is the first for me, but overall it was great. Once in a while you get a craving for something well they created delivery on even the greatest places too. I ordered a strawberry and chocolate shake which was awesome. The curly fries were cold but one cannot get perfection unless you go get it yourself."}
{"text":"Food is usually always good, however the past 2 times my boyfriend and I have went I've been disappointed, 1st disappointment was because I ordered a big cheeseburger and when I got home I noticed they had forgotten the cheese, 2nd disappointment was tonight when we both ordered Munchie meals and we both got very stale fries. Hoping for no more disappointments because we really do like jack in the box and this one is so close to home."}
{"text":"This is one of the only 24/7 resturaunts in Boulder, I and many others tend to visit it often. The service is great. The food, compared to other Jack in the Boxes is great. For a fast food restaurant, this venue is definitely 5 stars. The coke freestyle machine is great as well.   I haven't been on the inside for a while, so I am not sure how clean the seating area is; however, there is a lot of room and restrooms inside."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box location is very convenient if you're on your way out to visit Hoover Dam passing through Boulder City, NV. They are very speedy and the customer service here is excellent. Even when you see the drive-thru packed with cars believe me they will get that line moving as quick as possible. I've never had an issue at the location and the food is prepped made and ready to eat."}
{"text":"I just ordered a combo number 1, no tomatoes, med with a curly fry and a Pepsi. And 2 of the 2 for $1 tacos. After I was done ordering I asked for two ranches and she said she'll have them for me at the window, when I paid and got my food I had asked for hot sauce and I didn't mention the ranch because I was just told she would have them. I was the only one in the drive thru at the time. I get my food and come home, started taking the food and handing it out and I noticed there were no ranches. I said that's fine, and opened up my food and there were freaking tomatoes! Now most people will think that this is stupid to get mad and write a bad review about, but I work fast food and it irritates me when I come across people who don't care about their job or their customers enough to get the smallest parts of orders right. Anyone who works fast food isn't going to absolutely love their job, but that doesn't mean that you have to be lazy and not do your job right!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Jack in the Box. They always get my order right the food is decent for fast food and the service is always nice and polite. I always have a pleasant experience and it's always fast. Their fries are always good never soggy."}
{"text":"I ordered a brunch burger MOTHERFUCKER WHERES MY GOD DAMN EGG??! So pissed dude no damn flavor you put that shit in the microwave for sure. Probably was from yesterday and frozen!"}
{"text":"To who ever cares and sees this plz do something I cant stand this jack in the box nasty disgusting little punk kids running the place never do I ever get what I ask for and spend my money on workers laughing at u in the drive thru while you try to order your food I spend so much of my hard earned money to try to get a quick meal as I head home from a long day and it's right next door all I want is a damn burger and some how they manage to fuck that up to giving me a hash brown like is this a joke am I being punked? This is not a 1 time thing it's all the damn time it's getting real old real fast  Someone needs to do something about that shit hole! Worst service in history! Every other jack I been to great this one garbage!"}
{"text":"It's Jack in the Box, so expect Jack in the Box.  Never had them mess up my order and I've been several times. Not stingy with sauces, which is good. never had stale fries or cold burgers or anything. Drive-thru is always good paced,. No complaints; which is about as good a complement you can get from a chain fast food joint."}
{"text":"I love Jack in the Box, but this location is pretty spotty on service and food quality.  I've eaten at at least a dozen Las Vegas locations and often order the new breakfast sandwich which has waffles for rolls and it is awesome.  At my last visit to this location they served it on tasted really hard crusty waffles instead of the usual moist soft waffles.  It was almost like they toasted them."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Employee was too busy talking to the manager about the upcoming weekend to even acknowledge that I was standing at the counter less than 3 feet away. After being ignored I decided to leave and eat breakfast at Carl's Jr down the street. Added bonus at Carl's Jr is a 10% Veterans discount. I'm sure I will not return to this Jack In The Box on the corner of Power Rd and Ray Rd!!! Don't waste your time. Many other choices close by with better service. Not saying much as any service would have been better than just being ignored completely!"}
{"text":"Damnit In-N-Out, why the hell did you have to be a madhouse? Then Lisa informs me I went to the busiest In-N-Out in the company. Well shoot. Jack in the Box here we come.   Chicken Fajita Pita  Chocolate Shake. Bathroom that was actually clean (but I caught the guy in the middle of cleaning it)  Next to the gas station.  Damnit.I said I would pay. For Nikki's food and the gas. Why do I turn into Mrs. Money Bags Mcgee when I go to Vegas? *grumble, grumble, grumble*"}
{"text":"I just got home after driving over to my once upon a time favorite Jack in the Box.  I ordered 2 sausage croissants and a large Raspberry ice tea.  I got home settle in and ta da 2 ham sandwiches of some kind and plain tea.  I called and spoke to the shift supervisior and found out they no longer have flavored tea, yet I ordered it and it was read back to me twice. I feel like they pulled a bait and switch on me.   I used to frequent this J in the B but now I say steer clear."}
{"text":"In the last 20 plus years, I've probably tried everything on Jack's menu.  Having said that..I got my favorites.  -Breakfast Supreme Croissant -Grilled Chicken Strips -Stuffed Jalapeno's.  The rest of the items on their menu is priced just about right, especially for fast food.  Most items on this menu is fried, high fat, and basically not good for you.  My stops are usually on the way out or on the way home.  Not my first choice for food, but sometimes you just want something quick.   As for their restuarant, it's clean and the service is pretty good.  Drive thru is fairly quick, which is the main reason you find me stopping here."}
{"text":"I always come here and it's always the same lady at the drive threw with the pretty nails. But this time I got the manager she was rude from the speaker. She rudly denied me from making two orders on the drive threw and said she wasn't allowed when that's a lie because I do it all the time. She was rude her name was virdiana your rude !"}
{"text":"Food was good but customer service was not the best specially if the girl that was at the window was the manager 11:30 am 06/16/18. I just asked if she could make sure if the fries were not so hard and more of on the fresh side  since the fries where for my kids and it's not the first time I have asked but other times I have received better costumer service then I did today."}
{"text":"This is by the far worst fast food restaurant I have ever been at in my entire life. The worst Jack in the Box you could ever go to. My husband and I ordered and out of our entire order only the curly fries were good. The tacos were drenched in sauce and they were soggy. My burger was drenched in ketchup and mayo and it was falling apart, it also had a hole in the bun. It looked like someone stuck their finger in it. My chicken fajita didn't look like food at all. (Looked nothing like the picture it was unrecognizable) At first I thought they forgot about my chicken fajita but no there it was burnt to a crisp. Two thumbs down  and one star for the good curly fries."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I understand completely that businesses have \"policy's\" and mistakes are made. We are all human. However, when someone makes a mistake, it should not be my responsibility to fix it. With that said, I just experienced a drive thru nightmare.  I just got off work and was hoping for a quick drive thru experience. What I got was 2 $5.00 burgers not fully cooked. The bread wasn't toasted on our Sourdough Jacks, neither was the cheese melted. Unfortunately I didn't notice this before leaving otherwise the outcome would be different and this review wouldn't have been posted. But I was informed when I called that not only am I inconvenienced by having to cook my own food, but I would have to store it until I could bring it back with receipt if I wanted a remake. This was due to high amount of incorrect food refunds and remakes. Now again, I fully understand company policy but an employees mistake should not cost me anything.  Alina also said that if I wanted to speak to the manager about this, I would have to call back in the morning.  The level of customer service was so poor and this situation was poorly handled."}
{"text":"So I though of jack in the box tonight. While I was in area why not. Went to the drive thru got the 4 for 4 deal and an egg roll. I get home. No egg roll and they charge me for it. Wow this place like to change you for stuff and not give them to you."}
{"text":"MORTIFIED!!!   I generally have a good experience here, food as I ordered, drive thru employees are friendly and it's the closest place to my house.   It only takes one bad experience and this one is just more than I can ever forgive! Too bad too, cause I loved me some JITB.   It's 2am and just picked up my out of town friends from airport who are starving after a long flight. Drive thru guy was nice and even gave us a free dessert. We get home and as we are eating, we notice a FRIED CRICKET in our curly fries!! Disgusting!! Needless to say, we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs.   I will update once I get a response from management!"}
{"text":"Walked in waiting for someone to acknowledge me. After 3 min I look at the fry guy and asked if anyone is working up front. Hey spoke no English at all and pulled the lady from the drive thru to help me. After I ordered asked for no tomato but, of course they added tomatoes.  No customer service today.."}
{"text":"Zoe was so friendly.  She was Greg. Came in late night  on a Saturday and she was so happy to be at work.  Nah.  Love her.   I will be back.  Great food and service"}
{"text":"I just experienced a super rude employee late night at Jack-in-the-Box right now his name was Jonathan I asked him why it was 499 on the sign for this new combo but the receipt said 550 I told him no biggie just wanted to know why and he rolled his eyes and talk to me like I was some piece of garbage.  .  Jack-in-the-Box you need to fire this guy immediately he has a horrible attitude"}
{"text":"So....We were some of the many people that needed/wanted food the night of Christmas Eve (12/24/15)...and saw that JitB was open so we excitedly zoomed into the parking lot. While deciding on take out or drive-thru, we noticed that there appeared to be a large group of teenagers laughing and joking with the staff (unprofessional as well as inefficient use of time) we opted for the drive-thru hoping that service would be as fast/efficient and courteous as we're used to from other locations of the chain.   Let me just tell you... This was the WORST experience we've EVER had at ANY fast food place...and that says A LOT!...We wait in line and finally get to the speaker only to sit there in silence with no greeting whatsoever for almost 10 minutes....We only sat there that long because it's one of those drive-thrus that \"lock\" you in and you can't drive out because of the way they've constructed it... When someone FINALLY acknowledged our existence, we heard, \"Uh...yeah?\"...We were completely confused and asked, \"Are you ready to take our order?\"...The employee responded, \"Well, bro, we're like really busy and like it's gonna take at least 30 minutes before we can get you any food.\".... Wait. What?...We asked for clarification...The male employee then told us that the cars ahead of us had made large orders so we would be waiting for 30 or more minutes because they're busy....The most IGNORANT and INCONSIDERATE thing I've ever heard.  Keep in mind, we COULDN'T easily leave the drive-thru because of cars both in front and behind us... I suggested to the young and foolish employee that he direct the people in front of us with large orders to drive up to wait so that we could either get our food OR allow us to EXIT since they were \"so busy and it would take so long.\"  A female employee then comes on and tells us, \"Well, I can't tell them that. And if I take another order before their food is done then we'll just get more backed up.\" The most ILLOGICAL and unrealistic thing I've EVER heard from a fast food restaurant in my entire life! It is common practice to ask longer orders to pull forward to allow for other customers to get their orders in a timely and orderly fashion.   The employees AND the managers should be reprimanded and re-trained as I'm SURE the Jack in the Box franchise owners/leadership would be thoroughly outraged to know that any of their locations were allowing such horrible practices and services!  I understand it was Christmas Eve...BUT...If they were not going to appropriately accomodate paying customers, they should have made the decision to CLOSE for the holiday. Mistreating customers on Christmas Eve is much WORSE than just not being open for business IMO. This experience had the potential to ruin our night.   This location will not get another penny from us until we know that something has been done to correct such awful customer service, and to be frank, pure and blatant LAZINESS from their employees.   I highly recommend that everyone should avoid this location because your money should be spent where employees understand that customers should NEVER be treated so poorly and with such utter disregard. smh."}
{"text":"They have 6 people at the minimum working and still can't manage to get the food out in a timely manner.  I was decided I was done waiting, guy that came in after me was served his food before me...don't mind, he was deserving. But then the manager (?) yells to me from behind some huge kitchen thing \"what do you want\" she was yelling at me in an angry way just in a harried, overwhelmed way. I won't stop here again and don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"They messed up my order not once but twice, the place was dirty...the manager was rude & needs a new job preferably not in customer service. Overpriced, food never is never hot. Machine for ice cream always down."}
{"text":"We frequent this JIB location as it is super close to our office. I think it is kind of scary when the JIB associates start to recognize you at the drive-thru, but that is us and the associates are always great! Their service may be slow at times, because they do make everything [or as many items as possible] fresh."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The lady that works drive thru is a fucking horrible employee. What a rude bitch."}
{"text":"Having lived nearby for nearly 15 years - I have obviously been to this location numerous times. In the past, sure there has been the occasional error on an order or whatever but i have never felt the inspiration to review this place as it was as expected.    However, current events cause for a current review.  I'm a drive-thru person when it comes to my dynamic of patronage here. Lately, I have discovered smoothies and last week, I order a smoothie and after waiting three cars for my turn to the window they tell me the smoothie machine is down.  Man, that sucks.  Tell me when I'm ordering and not after waiting 10 minutes and then informing me and sending me on my way empty stomached. Ok, so I try again Monday and viola, scored one it was good and left me feeling positive about my smoothie groove.  Tried again today, trying to squeeze it in but running late for work and what happens?  I place my order and wait in the line for ten minutes and when I get to the window, I am informed the machine is not ready for smoothies and again am sent on my way. I'm late for work with no smoothie to comfort me!    Now, I would have been late due to my stopping in had the smoothie transaction been successful - but I would have a smoothie to counterbalance the effect.  All we need here is a little training at order taking to know smoothie status. If you don't have smoothies available, then say sonar time of order so I can back out before I am trapped and spend ten minutes waiting in the drive thru and nothing to profit from it.  For this, You gotta get two stars jack in the box.  You are sucking right now"}
{"text":"Bathrooms were filthy, cheeseburger had no cheese, and we were charged $3 upcharge for changing fried chicken on sandwich to grilled. Girl taking orders was also making food, very slow service and bad attitude. Our food took more than  10 minutes after we ordered to be ready and was placed on prep counter to wait while the employee went to make another customer's tacos rather than give us our competed order. Needs better management."}
{"text":"Hire more staff. I've been waiting to order for 20 minutes and I'm inside. Hire one more person for night shift, don't be cheap."}
{"text":"Stop jacking around & come here.   I have come here often & seen improvement over the year that I have been around this particular location.   This particular Jack in the Box is new, and still clean. Very casual ambience with cool songs playing in the background. They have great cleaning pracyives, when not taking orders you will notice everyone finding something to do. Lobby is constantly monitored when slow. My favorite part about this location. Many options for seating, bar stools booth & handicap location. Free wifi is available.   The food here is always fresh, the produce is always fresh and by visual representation they are organized. The food is always the same, which is great!  I have not had any issues with this location, I believe this location is run by great management.  The small issue is the team leaders, I feel they need more training because they lack the energy & service the managers present. Speaking of training my other issue are the service reps, it seems as though they had been recently rushed onto the counter & lack readiness. I'm sure that all takes time but I wouldn't leave them out to dry the result is a customer with something they didn't order or something that wasn't placed correctly.   I truly believe this location will constantly improve whenever I decide to come back. You won't be disappointed for what you're coming here for, food. Good luck getting to your car!"}
{"text":"Got order and onion rings were ordered were not n bag and reciept was not in bag.  Called location and they had horrible customer se vice and didnt resolve issue.     Too many burger chains to trea customers bad."}
{"text":"They couldn't handle a prepaid credit card. And instead of asking for help processing, they just became rude. So I asked if they wanted me to leave, and she said yes. So I left, went across the street to McDonald's. She processed everything with no problems."}
{"text":"It has been so long since I did a review, I feel badly that I am doing this for Jack In The Box. Especially since I had done one a year ago for this same location... But my experience today was so bad I feel it needed to be documented. I arrived at 5:05pm. There were two people in front of me at the register. When the man who was ordering was finished the cashier/manager walked away without saying anything. A few minutes had passed and she was still gone. I was 2nd in line and stepped to the Kiosk to place my order. Smart thinking on my part, not waiting till the cashier was back from break (or maternity leave).  My order was placed and I waited, and waited and waited. Being tall made it easy to look at the display monitor and see that my order had been in for a little over 10 minutes. But I kept waiting, and waiting.  At 15 minutes I flagged down the Drive Thru cashier. I told her it was obvious I was not getting my food, so could I get my money back? She called to the manager in the back that she needed a refund, then looked back at me and said \"your food is ready. Do you want it\"? I told her I would take the food.  She scrambled for a moment, then told the manager she better give me the refund.  After a couple minutes of pushing buttons I was given my money back without an apology or even an explanation as to why I wasn't getting my food instead. I did get a snotty comment from her about them being short of help and how she needed to give the cook a break. (Seemed odd that the cook gets his break at 5pm dinner hour and the dining room closes, but like my brother says, \"you can't argue with minimum wage\").  I went home and began cooking dinner. As it cooked I took the online survey at \"talktojackinthebox[dot]com\" and gave a pretty bad review. Oddly enough, I had little problem with the slow service time. My gripe was the poor way my complaint was handled.   Now, for the total shocker. In under 5 hours from submitting the online form I received a call from the store's General Manager. At first thought you would be impressed at just how important that feedback is to them. You might assume that someone in the corporate office saw that and called the GM at home to deal with it. As for me, I was thinking \"Who the #@&# is calling me at 9:48pm\"?  Being in that restaurant for more than 20 minutes without a single employee acknowledging I was there has me suspect they are out of touch with the customers. Calling me at 12 minutes to ten to talk about it just proves it.  So Jack, here is my summary: I love you commercials, but the customer service is worse than deplorable. If being short of help is the problem I will do everything in my power to assist you. By NEVER returning to one of your restaurants you will need less staff, therefore, you are no longer short of help. Problem solved!"}
{"text":"Last week, Jack in the Box had a free chicken nuggets promo around here. Since I'm a fan of free food, I went to many locations. This one in particular doesn't seem to have good service, but they were the only one that asked me what kind of dipping sauce I wanted. Even though the honey mustard ended up being awful, I appreciate the service. By the way, the drive-thru was a lot faster than the inside for some reason."}
{"text":"Although I am going to swear off fast food I stop in to see Jack for lunch. Got my normal Burger, Seasoned fries, motts sticks, and the Death by Chocolate treat. The girl on the Speaker was clear and got my order right, it was out the window and in my hands under 3 minutes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Expect major delays and expect to get your food given to you incorrectly. Man at window does not have it together and is very rude."}
{"text":"Crappy cashier stood and stared at me instead of greeting me. Place was full of redneck-types and whatnot too. I only went here because we needed to stop by the post office before getting some food in the morning, and now I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to eat at. Yes, really. Everything looks really new, the dine-in number signs are clean, and the menu even looks different than the one back at home.  Couple issues with them not getting the drinks right in our order... didn't take down the request for \"an additional coffee\" on top of the one in the value meal, and didn't give me the orange juice that was in the order until I reminded them later. Also, it seemed a little slow even compared to normal..."}
{"text":"1 star because I ordered tacos and I found a long black hair in the taco, gross!!! It's not the 1st time this has happened here. They have no regards to health regulations. When you ask for condiments, they give attitude. When asked if they have a discount for military, she rolled her eyes at me. They completely messed up my husbands order and we called them about it and they wouldn't even apologize. They didn't even offer to fix it. That's ok because I will be in touch with corporate about everything."}
{"text":"The only reason it's getting a 1 star is because husband like this place, but other than that it sucks. We usually stop here if we are leaving town late at night, but not anymore. On Friday August 1 2014 at about 11pm we stopped here and I guess he was the night shift supervisor, but being that he should have been courteous to customers. We ordered and drove up to the window, well a few people came inside and he decided to ignore drive thru all together and take their order and serve them first. We waited in drive thru for almost 20 minutes from start to finish. Once he came to the window he was rude and he spilled our drink and didn't even apologize or clean it up, I ordered cheesy bacon potato wedges and wow. It had maybe a teaspoon of cheese with 5 little tiny bacon bits on it, yes only 5 and you pay $2.50 for this trash. Next I asked for ranch because hubby got a meal and he gave us 1. I asked for 1 more and he rolled his eyes and said that he has to charge $.50 for it. I said fuck it and this damn place never charged for it before and left. Absolutely horrible experience and the quality of food has gone down considerably. I will never ever return to this location because a I can get better customer service from McDonalds which in just down the street."}
{"text":"Usually I don't have a problem but we ordered 2 munchies meals, the chicken one. Keep in mind that it was midnight right after work. when we got home 30 minutes later we noticed that we received the wrong order. We called and the person over the phone was very rude and refused to do anything about it.  Is customer service so hard to ask for!  Also in addition, this location always gives out a military discount with ID, but when I asked for it one morning Veronica said they never had it. She wanted to sit there and argue about it. I told her I can show her all my receipts that say military discount on them at this location. I told her that I wanted corporate number and she then told me that she will give me the discount. She wouldn't give me the number."}
{"text":"I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster."}
{"text":"Reliable late night or lunch spot the past few times I've been here or had food that my friends picked up. Didn't run out of rice for the chicken teriyaki bowl, unlike some crappy spot on Sunset at Arroyo Grande. Check it out, service was pretty fast even at around 4:30 in the morning."}
{"text":"Second time here for drive-thru. Short on time and this is the only place that seemed decent enough for the amount of time we had. It took about 10 minutes each time with 2 cars ahead. It's really not that bad considering they are helping 2 other customers, and the food you get is hot and the fries are crispy. However, I don't go to the drive thru all that often so I really don't know if 10 minutes is too long or not...Service was great and greeted with a smile. I also check the bag to make sure I have everything and napkins too! There is nothing worse than having to go back when you are pressed for time!  The pricing is a little tricky depending on what you order. The last time I came here my daughter and I ordered food and we were hangry and just ordered combos and medium sizes...I ended up paying $16-$18. That's almost what I pay at some restaurants!Since we were in a rush we had no choice but we decided to play it safe and not do the combo meals :) and went with smalls and we just drank our waters. Cut my total in half that way lol. But still....I was bummed thinking I paid that much for 1 and half people for fast food when I pay about $24 (including tip) for sushi for us sometimes!"}
{"text":"I was craving a hamburger...the largest was cheaper than the small one...who cares! I got the small one, after all I can't eat 2 patties in one. For my surprise the beverage included was the 1 liter cup :o!! My measure is 250ml if I'm lucky. This teaches me to just keep ordering the sandwich alone and no combos!"}
{"text":"Very friendly employees!! This was also the cleanest jack in the box I have ever been to! I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"BEWARE DANGER DANGER EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!  Great Cheryl really??!? You must work at this one. I am a fan of Jack don't get me wrong but this location is JACKED UP! Service sucks, food sucks, management sucks, cleanliness sucks. Wow this place really sucks!   1. They are always out of everything ranch, onions, ketchup, curly fries, coke. WTF Jack. Seriously when I was in high school and worked fast food when you ran out of something you ran to another location and got it!   2. Don't order the taco's! We all know that Jack makes deliciously greasy cheapo taco's. These at this location are always nasty soaked in grease. When you pick them up grease pours off. Yuck! Also sometimes you get lettuce sometimes you don't. Sometimes you get cheese sometimes you don't. I have even gotten one with cheese and lettuce the other with sauce only.   3. The workers are always dirty like they have been working all week in the same uniform without cleaning it.   4. Don't try to special order anything they will mess it up every time.   I am all for second chances and I have given this location about 22 chances since they are close to my office. But no more I will never go back to this one! Today was the topper, I ordered food and as I was ready to hand over my credit card I see a condom, it appeared to be used, laying on the side of the drive thru window. I pulled my credit card back and drove off!"}
{"text":"Just the nicest group of people each time I visit. Always working hard, always very friendly and always clean."}
{"text":"Delicious, but slow! Got fumigated while waiting and now I am nauseated! Food is always good though!"}
{"text":"Despite the other reviews, I had a great experience with the customers service from Steven. Prompt, patient, and correct.  Great first impression from this chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"For a Jack in the Box, this place is dirty. Yes that is saying a lot. It seems to be a hang out for downtown Tempe's transient population but I guess they cannot kick out the paying customers.   The service seemed a little slower than most locations but that could have been the decorum in the building that made me feel that way. The food is standard Jack in the Box fare, so at least you know what you are getting into. I just wouldn't step into the bathroom there if I were you."}
{"text":"So I went to this place very late night and they said they had no drinks at the moment and offered a medium fry... Got home to only get my original combo with no extra fry that they had promised... Went back to this location and this VERY rude drive threw lady named SAMANTHA pretty much called me a begger for French frys... Don't ever go here... If they mess up, it's on you... Worst costumer service ever. Watch out for SAMANTHA! She will make you feel like a homeless person. She gets a negative 5 star from me personally."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is ok, more times it's very bad. Buns were crunchier then the chicken inside them, fries were a soggy mess. But hey at least the drink was cold and they served it with a smile that almost reads sucker. On a serious note, just pass this one by."}
{"text":"Went in and got the spicy chicken club combo.  Seems their machine is always out if diet Coke.  My sourdough had some weird gray spot on it.  Possibly was mold..."}
{"text":"Oh, Jack - we've been through so much together: bad days at work, GREAT days at work, drunk muchies/hangovers, pig-out days...  I especially love your cheeseburgers and 2:1 tacos. The season curly fries always win my heart - especially when dipped in ranch.   Milkshakes aint too shabby either but I don't crave them so much anymore.   Anyone else recall in the mid-80s when they tried to do a marketing/branding revamp and change their name to Monterey Jack's? I do! Can't remember how long it stayed that way and switched back. Sort of similar to epic fail by Coke launching \"New Coke\". ;)"}
{"text":"I haven't known Jack in a while. I don't eat his food all that often, preferring Dave Thomas most of the time. So when I stopped in here for the first time in over a decade, I was surprised to see how many different things that they have on their menu - chicken, tacos, burgers, all sorts of stuff. And so I ended up choosing the \"Bonus Jack\" which is a whole lot like the Big Mac except the sesame seeds on the bun. With a small side of curly fries (they don't have those at McDonald's!), I decided to sit inside and people watch for a bit.  So how was it? Looking little like the picture on the menu board, but still a decent fast food sandwich. The cheese wasn't melted. The fries weren't hot. The soda fountain area was untidy. One of the napkin dispensers was empty. But the staff was nice enough when she brought my tray to my table. So that saves Jack from a one star.  About ten minutes after I'd gotten my food, there was another shout for a Bonus Jack and curly fries. Yep, they'd made my order twice. Dumb."}
{"text":"\"Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\"  Has a nice ring to it, right?    Too bad that is for McDonalds Big Mac and not Jack In The Box's Bonus Jack.  The Bonus Jack just falls short, in my opinion.  I'm not sure if there were onions on it or not.  Shredded lettuce for sure.  But what looked like possible onions may have been,  in fact, tiny bits of lettuce.  And there was no sesame seed bun.  The sauce is different too.  More red than the secret sauce on the Big Mac and a bit sweeter.  The burgers are very similar to each other.  Call me a traditionalist but I prefer the Big Mac hands down.  From the onions to the sauce, the Big Mac is a superior classic."}
{"text":"Had a major late night craving. Since Jack in the Box has late hours I went through the drive thru. I was immediately greeted and my order was placed on the screen right. As I drove up to the window the cashier was friendly and took my money. Given a receipt along with my change my food was quickly prepared. This late night snack was the Chicken Fajita Pita. Mighty tasty I have to say. My food was hot and fresh. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Something is seriously wrong with this location. It is busy however it is trashy. They do not have anyone regularly monitoring the venue. Trash every thrown every where. Not a Jack in the Box location you want to come in to eat. The drive thru always has long line during lunch but it moves pretty fast. My orders have always been made hot, fresh to order however after seeing how nasty the place is kept both inside and outside I can only imagine where my food is sitting."}
{"text":"Pros: My best friend was here for a visit from VA, where they don't have this fast food restaurant. She has actual cravings for their tacos. She loved them. I haven't eaten here in over 5 years. Ordered the sourdough jack and split it with my sister. Decent. Fast service.   Cons: Greasy fast food. I prefer McDonald's fries."}

Greasy fast food. I prefer McDonald's fries."}
{"text":"Sons of fucking bitches.   Three orders of food and when we pulled up to the drive-thru window and asked to add a taco to the order, we were told by the young man working the drive-thru window that NO, there are no \"extra\" tacos, they are made to order. \"Yeah, we want to order one.\" He then responded by saying we cannot add any food to our already existing order, and that if we wanted to add any food to the order that we would have to exit the drive-thru and drive back around and get back in line again. No joke, he said \"no seriously, you can't order a taco. It's business, you understand.\" No, I don't understand. Your business is to sell me artery-clogging food, and you are refusing to do so? To top it off, when I called later to talk to the manager, a co-worker answered the phone giggling and then finally said \"uhhh. EHH ... HELLO?\"  \"Hi. Is this Jack in the Box?\" \"Uhhh. YEAH.\"  Looks like JITB needs to step it up on the employee training manual."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot! The food is as good as Jack in the Box gets, but sometimes the girl at the window yells at us. I like it!"}
{"text":"Just ordered ten tacos and they were greasy as hell! Even the taco bag was all greasy, worst tacos ever!"}
{"text":"Ya know, I like jack's food; the sirachi burger is delicious!  Drunken tacos at 3am, but jack-in-the-box's in general, and this location specifically, The speaker system sucks. SUCKS!    You can yell your lungs and they never hear you. (I don't know if the kid didn't hear or didn't understand or he didn't know but I ordered the sirachiburger \"with extra peppers\" meaning the jalapeno peppers, and he stuffed the bottom of the paper to-go bag with black pepper packets.)  I sent an email complaining about this. I got a response: well tend to it!  I went back a week or two later: nothing's changed.   In this day and age of wireless, it's an improved wireless headset and board. there's no need to rip up the pavement to lay in a solid communication system. But the fact that they haven't fixed it means they're just cheap. $500 or $5000 what difference does it make?  That drive-thru makes up 30-40% of their total business.   Do not make me scream for my supper go I won't come back."}
{"text":"The service here sucks the girl working the window had no personality and when she took my order she didn't even know what special drinks they were offering on their board out front"}
{"text":"We have been here twice. It was the first time my husband tried Jack in the Box. We had a coupon for the BLT burger, and then I got the Jr Jack. (I get extra onion-mayo sauce) My husband was amazed at how good his burger was. The bacon was really crispy, and the vegetables were nice and cold.  I should have paid more attention to the names of the young men who took our orders. I believe that on both visits the shift manager/supervisor took our order. One man had dark hair, and the second was Justin(Dustin?...sorry). Both men were extremely polite and genuinely happy people. The food was presented nicely, and tasted great.  For anyone who has never tried a burger here, the meat reminds me of a cross between Wendy's and Burger King. Yum!"}
{"text":"Meh. Kind do disappointed. Burgers and curly fries tasted good, but everything was just warm. If I could have microwaved everything to heat it up, I would probably give two more stars."}
{"text":"Ok, we came here just because we had a 2 for $5 coupon for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. It looked tempting.   We picked it up in the drive-thru along with some curly fries. Cannot pass up curly fries since they are hard to come by. Jesus took our order and helped us at the window. Very professional and polite.   Got home and the food was super hot, and looked great. So many times you order fast food, only to bring it home and it looks nothing like the photos they advertise. Not this time. Lettuce and tomatoes looked great. Big piece of breaded, spicy chicken. As for spicy, it was fairly mild. I added their buttermilk ranch dressing, and it was great. Curly fries were hot, crunchy and wonderful.   Awesome!"}
{"text":"I hate to give my only fast food place in north Scottsdale a poor review... it is the only place i can go. The customer service was great about three months ago (I visit at least once a week) but recently I have been very disappointed. From not being acknowledged as a customer to not even being treated as a person, this place is greatly disappointing. I will continue to give this location a chance, as it has not always been terrible, but my last three visits have been horribly embarrassing for the staff. If a place says they're open 24hours, please make sure your employees are aware they are staffed those hours for a reason.  Thank you for listening, I will return with high hopes."}
{"text":"ONE STAR. One job. Make a sandwich your customers will enjoy. I ordered a #10 (which consists of buns, lettuce, tomatoes, chicken, mayo, and cheese). I go home and it's only the buns and chicken. No tomatoes, no lettuce, no cheese, and not even mayo. Why would I pay just to have someone put a piece of chicken in between two buns? Don't come here."}
{"text":"Never had any issues here been coming here for a year food is good and warm like it should be and the people are friendly and efficient. I have no complaints here they are all doing a marvelous job!"}
{"text":"Never Again!  Not one clean table in the place. The floor was dirty. Had I seen the condition of the dinning are, I would have never ordered food. Keep in mind: only 1 other customer was there. VERY DIRTY, will never go here again. Wish I could give - stars !"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer experience I ever had. The guy who took my order didn't ask me how I was doing. Didn't make eye contact with me didn't ask if I wanted any sauce and didn't even ask what size I wanted my drink to me. No bag no nothing just gave me the food and shut that window, some training you guys have going smh. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Usually easy going staff, but check your bag before you drive away because if you specified \"curly fries\" then you better make sure that you got what you asked for. It's the little things that they mess up on, but I'm sure ANYONE would like to get exactly what they order, otherwise why bother?   I love JnB food, but I would like to get what I paid for.  Be sure to repeat your order when you get to the window. Have them repeat it back to you, and check your bag after that before you drive away.  Sounds like some dumb McDonald's BS, but you gotta be sure with these stoners for sure.   They also like to pull a \"prank\" on drive thru customers where they ask you to reverse back through their \"censors\" and pull forward again repeatedly so they can \"trigger the censor\"... Some childish shit of 30 something year olds blasting rap music and reeeeeaking of weed. I smoke weed but holy shit come on guys......"}
{"text":"Gross! Gross! Gross!  I haven't eaten Jack in the Box in years and now I remember why. The food is SO greasy and a mess. Nasty."}
{"text":"In BAD need of a remodel. This location is very dark, rather worn, and noisy. Food is fine, but the ambiance lacks it big time."}
{"text":"Very nice customer service , drive thru or dinning in. Everybody who works there are very polite and  presentable. The food its always at perfect temperature and tastes fresh ."}
{"text":"I just experienced the worst drive thru service in my entire life! I can see why the have 2 stars. The young man at the window had an attitude problem not only with me but the person ahead of me . He never apologized. I will make sure everyone knows about this   I will not be going ever back. Keep the food along with your nasty attitude Manny ."}
{"text":"This restaurant thinks that charging $3.12 for a small order of French fries is ok!!!!  Are you kidding me???  It wasn't even a full \"small\" bag!  What a freaking rip off!  DO NOT order fries from this wannabe place!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it's not hard. It really isnt. If you aren't competent enough to listen to someone place their order,  enter it into the register,  and then make sure all the items are in the bag, you might as well give up on life. I ordered 2 things. A jumbo Jack with cheese and a chicken sandwich. Ended up with a jumbo Jack with no cheese and that's it. I was the only person in the drive thru. I mean, honest to God, if you can't handle simple tasks like that, go ahead and play frogger on the freeway. Morons."}
{"text":"Not the first time this location has messed up my order. I paid extra for curly fries in all meals purchased. Open the bag and there are regular. I am glad I hadn't driven away yet. I also did not get a receipt."}
{"text":"Worst Jack-in-the-Box ever. I'm a California native where Jack's are on every corner. I now live in Raleigh, so Jack in the Box is a special treat I only get when we travel to Charlotte. I lived off of JITB tacos in college and they were always tasty and fast. This particular location is slow and the food is sub-par. It took us over 20 minutes to get our food tonight. Seriously?! I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life. There were no napkins out, no paper towels in the restrooms. Avoid."}
{"text":"I am SO sick of this location! The morning manager is so lazy and incompetent! Almost Every time I go there for breakfast, they Never have salsa or mayo for the BREAKFAST BURRITOS or sandwiches...  How frikking hard is it to make salsa and have it ready for breakfast?? Its not like flying the space shuttle, come on!  I'm done with this location!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite location  staff is rude, they will talk about you in Spanish assuming you don't understand them.  First time at a jack in the box I didn't get my receipt, but no way so I want to go inside or talk to them further.... Not sure if I will visit this location again."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through in order to sourdough Jack with no tomatoes no  ketchup. The first sandwich they gave me had tomatoes on it with no mayonnaise or ketchup. Second time they made the sandwich they made it with no mayonnaise tomato or ketchup. They just can't seem to get it right."}
{"text":"This your typical Jack in the Box fast food joint with their regular brand menu and special offerings. As an occasional junk food eater I've tried many on their menu at least once. Somehow I don't think this location as good as it should be - in general.  At last visit, we had their Bacon Swiss Buttery Jack; Jumbo Cheese Jack and Fries -  nothing to write home about!  So as to make it easy to gauge each of these eateries, when I do try them, I've devised a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being outright down and dirty nasty, and 5 being the best a fast food joint can be! I gage: cleanliness; service; product quality and consistency; convenience; accessibility; taste and the personnel's attitude and customer service level. This place scores 2.5 of 5. I may not come back here and don't highly recommend it!  One last thing, their décor and ambience is drab, food fair, cleanliness questionable and service needs improvement!"}
{"text":"This will be our \"Go to Place if we can't find a IN & Out\", That's how good the burgers and fries are. Little more than $3 higher than our #1 choice (see above). Service was fast, friendly and professional. Location was clean and bathroom was spotless. Going to try a breakfast on our next early morning outing."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Jacks to eat at.  It is generally fast and pretty good.  Love the specials and especially since you can add flavors to the drinks.  I have only used the drive-thru and cannot comment on the inside.  The people that take the order are good and make sure it is correct.  It is fast, convenient, and somewhat affordable.  While there are other fast food nearby, I like a good burger once in a while."}
{"text":"Super rude staff.  Asked if they have any carb free options or substitutes and cashier gives me a dirty look rolls her eyes and says no.   Ice tea is super cloudy and food was cold even though they said they just cooked it.  My son then asked for ranch and the same lady that waited on me, looked at him and walked away.  He had to ask someone else for ranch and she helped him.   My son ended up throwing away half his food because his fries were cold and rubbery, i had a spit of eggs and a half a slice of bacon since they have no carb free options, and his burger was pathetic."}
{"text":"So TOTALLY didn't realize these existed on this side of the country! Stumbled across Jack in the Box while looking for a Starbucks and had to at least try it once!....It was....Meh.   The menu was surprisingly big for a fast food place, featuring everything from breakfast items to burgers to tacos to...Chinese food? Yeah...The menu here is a bit random. Perhaps that's the draw?   We decided to keep it simple and try a burger and fries. The burger was of the  unimpressive fast food variety but the curly fries were pretty good! Sorta like Arby's.   Service was very slow, and kinda lackadaisical. No one greeted us and we waited about five minutes to order despite there being no line. For a few moments there was no one behind the counter at all.   I probably won't be back any time soon, especially not this location."}
{"text":"They took the guy off the drive thru who was so hard to understand.  Last couple trips have been much better.  Still no smoothies :("}
{"text":"For the second time in a week and a half my order was wrong!!! Shame on me for thinking it would be right the second time. I can't see how this place has three stars.. and I'm only giving one because it won't let me give any less. Whoever is in the kitchen should know what Swiss cheese is and put it on as requested by the paying customer."}
{"text":"They never can get the orders in drive thru right.  Today we walked over from firestone for lunch. We waited 25 minutes for our food while sitting in the lobby, but drive thru was moving very quick. Once we did get our food 2 kids meals and a chicken pita I asked for 4 salsa one sweet and sour sauce. The girl gave me 2 of each I asked can I please have 2 more salsa, she threw them on the tray and walked off. I really don't understand what the issue is with giving out salsa. I came a couple weeks ago and getting salsa was an issue as well. I wanted to order some mini churros but when I went to order I was told I need to wait they where trying to let the kitchen catch up. Really !!!!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the service was good. Restaurant was clean. Had the big chicken sandwich combo for $3.99. Great deal. Love the Carmel iced coffee too."}
{"text":"Typical jack in the box.  Clean.  Staff is friendly.  Drive thru open 24 hours.  They have the self-serve kiosk, which means you can get free tacos from time to time.  Personal favorites include: egg nog shake during the holiday season tacos ultimate cheeseburger"}
{"text":"Horrible place the dude was on drugs or something asked for American cheese i got Swiss asked for churros and he forgot i asked for crispy chicken and gave me grilled one of my burgers was missing the bacon i paid extra for !! Then crammed everything into a small bag the immediately ripped when i grabbed it spilling my fries everywhere and they want the minimum wage to go up please !!"}
{"text":"Great Service ! Went in on July 29 around 430 am ish almost 5 and the hispanic guy whos always on graveyard is very nice!!he always remembers me because i always have a issue with my debit card  hes always in a great mood and always offers the condiments! Love this location , im a forever customer!"}
{"text":"As young as the kid is behind the counter, he is so damn polite!  Its the JITB that has the typical Vegas neon (or these day LeD) lights to add to that Vegas feel."}
{"text":"I was having a bad day and needed some french fries to make me feel better.  I'm sure everyone can agree that the drive through window at 11:30PM on a Friday night won't give you the most stellar customer service BUT tonight changed my opinion of that.  The guy working at 11:30PM on 8/13 (friday) was working alone and had a huge line of cars. It took 15 minutes and he went out of his way to apologize about how long it took and went out of his way to try to make it better. I wasn't upset at all, but I'm sure that if anyone was, there was no way they could stay upset with how apologetic he was.  I'm sure working a drive through alone can't be the most fun and it definitely has to be stressful. Thanks for helping a girl out tonight and getting me those much needed fries! :)"}
{"text":"Always good customer service. They're usually not super busy around 8pm-12am, that's when I usually go. Only thing I wish they would do, is keep the ranch sauce cold. Also their munchie meals went up a dollar so it's $6 dollars now. Other than that it's your typical fast food, I'll keep going here. :)"}
{"text":"Juicy Portobello Burger!!! Ialways loved the variety on this fast food menu but. I don't get fast food often and am usually not very thrilled about it when I do, I have pretty high food standards so fast food only happens as means to an end when it actually happens. Well now I'll make a point to go to Jack in the Box.....the juicy portobello burger...heaven on earth! I've never had such a yummy fast food burger. Prob more fattening it who cares! They mastered burger deliciousness!!! It tasted the I am was want them to taste in my mind, which burgers mostly do not and I thought I just wasn't into them much especially at fast food restaurants. TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"Worst jack in the box ever!!  I swear every time I give jack in the box a chance they let me down. Either they short you or the food is cold.   I don't understand how these workers can be OK with giving someone some stale and old fucking tacos.... I'm never eating at Jack's again !!!"}
{"text":"AVOID: Jack in the box doesn't care about customers not even a little bit I came in early in the AM first of all this is your job not your house hang with your boys when your done work finally after the cashier and his boys leave  the cashier slid my card 2 times then asked for manager or something the guy says your card doesn't work sorry.....i know my card works I just used it and this is the first time my card didn't work I asked him if he could type it I have my ID and will sign for it I am just hungry he tells me he can't i asked for Corp number he gives me the store phone number lol don't even have a Corp dude I posted a complaint nothing for my troubles for waiting that long and when the GM calls he also just apologizes and that's all I get and it's against policy to type in cards if your card reader doesn't work you just give up and turn away paying customers? Then tells me he would have his district manager call me no one from Jack in the Box has reached out to me I want an explanation as to who made this silly policy when your stores don't even have a chip reader you should just type them in I'm so pissed I haven't been to a Jack in the Box since and I eat after everything closes just go to anything else but here I'll go to QT if I have to make it right and I'll return!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just waited 15 min and had to back out of drive through. Horrible drive through but its on way home and open or never would come here.  BTW prices are higher here , no 2 tacos for .99 cents like rest of the state !  Went there again after work. 3 cars in drive took 30 min then a car went behind me. It apears only 1 worker and 1 mgr who is cashier too, try to run a store.  Impossible with the diverse menu. !"}
{"text":"This place has so many sketchy people just hanging around the drive thru. I was so uncomfortable there. The manager does nothing when you tell him whats going on outside. I believe this is going ruin their business."}
{"text":"I wanted food on my way to work. I looked it up these guys advertise being open 24 hours. The sign outside states the same. I got there just before 4 a.m.  and they won't be serving until 4:40. So really they're open to play board games and whatever else one can do that early except what family feud would have as the top answer: eating. Considering the prices and my belly they missed out on $12."}
{"text":"Visited this location on 8-22. It was a great way to end a drunken night. And at this location the food was extra hot"}
{"text":"Sooo I really am not a huge fan of the food here, maybe their breakfast sandwich on sourdough is ok, but other than that its whatevs. What I come here for is their ICED COFFEE!!! It is seriously some of the best iced coffee I have ever had! I'm a frequent Starbucks, Mcd's, and even BK iced coffee drinker, but the one here is seriously the tits!  The Original flavor of coffee is vanilla they also have Mocha, but I've only have orig. They have a sweetened cream, which hands down blows this coffee out the park. Starbucks adds cream, but its super lacking. I like my coffee to be super light and creamy looking at boy they do it here.  They have your typical fast food, but here they pepper their meat a little too much imo. I like my meat juicy and thick sans pepper!  Their curly fries are decent, and regular fries arent hella greasy.  If I was only rating the iced coffee that would hands down get 5 stars. The price is a little steep, well, for IC. 1.99 for a 16oz and 2.89 for 24oz.  Yay!"}
{"text":"You had one job... okay maybe two.  3 Sourdough breakfast sandwich and a packet of mustard.  Can't get that cooked fast enough... I'll bring it to you out front.  Good so far... right?   Brings it out after a short wait and runs back in.  No mustard.  None.  Still have to get out of the car and go get some.   Drive thru experience kind of wasted at that point.  Drive away... open the wrapper and here's a sourdough sandwich (1 point there) with not very toasted but plenty greasy bread, cold crumbled up cheese like food product, limp day old cold bacon hanging out the side, cold fried egg and straight out of the package ham lunch meat.   And the bread was probably microwaved at some point cause it had that rubber thing going on.  So okay... maybe this should be a 1 star.  She did get the sandwich right, charged correctly, gave the right change & kept the line moving....so 2 stars.  Come on JIB... too much competition out there to pass out cold, poorly prepared food.  Fix your kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Hello, you were smart enough to read the reviews on this place and I applaud you. I was a Team Leader at this Jack in the Box between September 2016 and April of 2017 so you can take my word for it when I tell you why you should not eat at this Jack in the Box.  Where do I start? A LOT of health code is being broken here.   The fryers here are not filtered every day (which is health code) in fact they are probably filtered once a week because there is one guy here that knows how to do it and hes very lazy.  The machine that makes your Shakes is cleaned maybe every 3 days (Health code is every day)  They DONT put ice under the cheese that is used on your Burgers and Tacos. (Health code once again.) In fact youll be happy to hear that none of the vegetable ingredients including the mayonnaise is refrigerated. its just sitting in a tub if you will. Seriously, the top of the mayo gets all crystalized and yellow around edges and they just use on your sandwhich anyways.   When you work in a kitchen youre supposed to change out all of your utensils and bins EVERY 4 HOURS. It gets changed maybe every 12 hours at this Jack.  BUT the best of all is that the temperature in the big refridgerator is ALWAYS 10 degrees too high. That means food poisoning.  among A LOT of other things I think you get the picture   DONT EAT HERE YOU WILL GET SICK."}
{"text":"We love this jack in the box! The lady at the drive thru window was so nice and got us what we needed - yay jack in the box!"}
{"text":"Went to Jack in Box at El Capitan Way, LV NV ( with Lowes & Del Taco as their \"neighbors\") to get my usual regular tacos. I decided not to do drive thru as most of the time drive thrus take forever. Going in, a couple was ahead of me. While waiting, my eyes roamed around, observing how the crew was working, the cleanliness of the place, etc. Inside the kitchen area there is a counter (near the cashier where they get drive thru payments), where they bag the food items. On it were 4 regular tacos, just sitting there. Didn't mind it much. My order was taken. Knowing orders take a little while, I sat. Then I saw this lady who maybe the manager or supervisor  (wearing gray shirt, black pants & what looks like a headphone) grab those tacos in the counter, bagged them, then gave it to me! Who knows how long they were sitting there?! Didn't say anything; I thought this one is more suitable as a complaint given directly to the company. Didn't eat the tacos; threw them away. Disappointing, dangerous, very scary! And to think I did so many drive thrus ordering the same item!! I don't think I'll go back anymore; that's it for me with that place. I'll switch to their \"neighbor\" Del Taco & see how they do. Jack in the Box customers beware!"}
{"text":"We usually use the drive-thru but when we are on foot we go inside. It is the cleanest Jack in the area! But it is fast food so keep you expectation low and you will normally be happy."}
{"text":"One major complaint would be consistency of cold coffee on every visit. I watched the person pour the coffee straight from the pot from the warmer and it was cold!  We don't go there much and when we do it's generally in the morning during the work week for the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich which has shown improvement.  Workers are young and you have to repeat our order several times and remind them to give you your drink. But with some proper mature leadership it really wouldn't be a bad place.  Now if I could actually get a hot cup of coffee."}
{"text":"The workers here often like to decide that they \"don't take card payments\" so that they can turn people away when they're feeling lazy (which apparently is pretty often). Super unprofessional."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast thru the drive-thru for the 5 of us as we headed back home to cali and they forget a breakfast jack and also screwed up on one of the meals. It was just a breakfast jack that i really didnt need though"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!! I waited in the damn drive thru line for 10 mins without the a-hole even saying just a moment or anything, there was a whole line of cars behind and in from of me. Very slow service....I have yet to get my food, but I will update with the quality of food, AVOID IF POSSIBLE. The Jack In The Box on Fort Apache and Tropicana has excellent quick drive thru service, go there..."}
{"text":"Just got told my order couldn't be taken at at 24hr jack in the box because she was going home for the night and there is no one else to take over...............who ever owns this store is a moron. Sorry to the girl who was running the drive thru that was probably busting her butt."}
{"text":"Good food, low prices, and a clean restaurant with friendly service! On a side note, there was a customer in front of us that was...well, not sober. She was complaining about her order that made no sense and wanted money back that was more than her order. The manager was far more polite than I would have been. The manager was courteous and professional from beginning to end. Now that is EXCELLENT SERVICE! Oh the food was made fresh to order (Sourdough Jack Combo) and was good to the last bite! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Out of the bread for the sandwich, out of Diet Coke, this place is in need of a real manager, good luck."}
{"text":"Live down the street and I love jack in the box but it's so unfortunate that every single time i come here through drive thru the wait is always way to long and the staff is ever friendly. Food is still good but might drive a little further to get better service."}
{"text":"Nobody greets you till about five minutes after standing at the register. They don't even acknowledge your existence until they are ready to take your order instead of saying we'll be right with you they ignore you. Poor customer service and wrong orders :/ this is a reoccurring experience so i don't think this deserves the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Rudest drive thru person by the name of Shauntreya. Not sure why she felt the need to stare at me meanly and be rude but her behavior will have me going to one of the many other fast food restaurants in the area. If she worked for me I'd fire her for such a bad attitude. The other ladies that have waited on me in the past have been so pleasant. The guy that took my order was pleasant but not Shauntreya. She has a huge chip on her shoulder about something.   The food was disappointing too. Come on Jack In the Box buy large tomatoes instead of giving me three Roma tomato slices on my spicy chicken sandwich. Why bother asking for a side of Ranch if they are not going to give it to me. She literally just glared at me. What a waste of money.   Entire visit from food to the horrible drive thru lady was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst fast food experience I've ever had - my entire life! I pulled up to the drive thru, and all the person said is \"hello\" - I said \"hello? How are you?\" I got a \"what do you want?\"  - ok for starters, that is not exactly how things should go. I got my order placed and pulled up to the window. I gave her my card, she ran it then instead of handing it back she put it somewhere where I couldn't see, and started handing out my order. When I asked for my card back she got very PISSED at me and went to fling it at me. I grabbed it and gave it to my husband. She then said \"you don't need to snatch\". I said \"excuse me? Oh can you please wipe off that drink? \" she closed the window right in my face when I asked for a manager. I finally got one to come to the window, she apparently was a shift leader, this girl was right behind her and started talking over me then started yelling at me. Wow! I asked for the managers name, Tom. And her name , Quiche. I did the online survey, sorry I gave you a low score there as well. My husband, my daughter and I got just simply BLOWN AWAY. How on earth this Quiche girl is a shift leader is a miracle- yelling at customers ? Just plain being extremely RUDE?? I thought she was going to come out the window! This Jack in the Box crew is the worst!! I arrived in a great mood, left furious."}
{"text":"They have military discount.  Anelisa was our server (drive thru) and she was bright friendly and made our day. I haven't had good service from here in a while but glad I went today.  We definitely need more people like her!"}
{"text":"This Jack's is not on the glitzy Las Vegas Strip.  No. It is on the more grittier, east side of The Strip. Where illegal immigrants meet broke drunkards between UNLV struggling students.   However, despite this gritty urban image hidden a couple of blocks from the fabled Strip, this Jack in the Box is Hi-Tech!   Yup! It has a self-ordering touch screen kiosk at the counter! There are only 3 guys working behind the counter, so why not let the little LCD R2D2 take your order? As it says on it's LCD screen,  it is easier to order than you think!  Just select what type of meal (breakfast, served all day in my case). Then select from the offerings (there is something new here at Jack's!) Then select if you want it part of a combo meal (I did!) Then select what type of drink (OJ for me, got to be healthy!)  The new menu item at Jack's?   Chorizo Sausage Breakfast Burrito!   Si senor!   A breakfast burrito of fluffy scrambed eggs, accented with Chorizo, a spicy sauce and grilled onions! It wasn't half bad! The combo meal with hash browns and OJ totalled $4.49!   That's less than two full spins of the 1 cent slot machine played 30 ways, at 10 times value!   And R2D2 got it all right! I didn't have to talk to a gritty human here on the grittier side of town, away from all the lights and neon signs.   Just LCD Kiosks here.   And for $4.49 a spin, you come up a winner!"}
{"text":"It was okay. A lot of variety though but I can't tell the difference because it's ANOTHER CHAIN fast food joint like McDonalds... Burger NOT bad but nothing too OUT THERE memorable either."}
{"text":"The floors were very slick and we almost fell the second we walked in to the store. The bathrooms are nasty and not kept well. Safety and health hazards completely."}
{"text":"This is the worst jack ever & the only location near me. FML right. My picture says it all."}
{"text":"Jack in the Box is one of my favorite fast foods, it's burgers are juicy and delicious. They have bacon burgers which are the best. And they even have breakfast. There breakfast foods are amazing and the croissant sandwiches are to die for. All of there food is great and they tend to never disappoint. Recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Victor was amazing he put up with our after club antics and made us laugh great employee to come back and see. Really proud to see that good customer service can be found even if the restaurant is not 5star he gave 5 star service"}
{"text":"Can't get basic orders correct. Asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage. They charged me extra for bacon then didn't give me bacon. Two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too. Awful."}
{"text":"Worst service In the entire world. Everyone that works here as a terrible attitude and should honestly not be working in a place that involves talking to people. I pulled up to the drive through where the lady asked me to wait forever. And then comes back and says \"pull to the window\" so I pull up and she asks me to go back around through the drive thru so she can help the lady behind me. Pretty sure it was her friend or something but completely ridiculous. Seriously, if jack n the box is too hard of a job for you to handle then what else can you do ?"}
{"text":"What can I tell you, it's a Jack In The Box. You know what you are getting into. And that's not a bad thing. You need fast food, you crave fast food. Well guess what kiddies, you have hot the mother load! Keep a look out for coupons, oh and sign up for their text program, offers aplenty. Look Le Cirque it aint! But then again what is? Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Ok I am not ashamed to admit that on occasion I like to slum it with some fast food. Jack In The Box has a great hook. When you get your receipt there is a stamp on it that entitles you to TWO FREE TACOS on your next visit after 2 PM! I also want to recognize the staff at this particular Jack In The Box, they are always very nice. The restaurant is always clean. If you are not in the mood for tablecloths and fine dining stop by, don't be such a  snob. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"The map is off. Its in the Lowes parking lot on Farm and Durango adjacent a Del Taco.  Its Jack in the box so you get what you get at Jack in the Box. This is a relatively new location and at first they were pretty choppy on their orders but now they are very accurate fast friendly.  The inside is very nice with a gas fire place for ambiance.  Got their new Jack. Jr. combo today and it was pretty decent for $3.50."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Had an email coupon. Upon showing the online coupon to the staff. They refused to honor it. Said the coupon need to be a printed copy. The coupon was not expired. The staff spoke to be in a demeaning tone."}
{"text":"Always good service and gets my orders just right. I always get my spicy chicken sandwich and it's amazing"}
{"text":"Don't get down here all that often, but when I do (a few times each year), I am always impressed how well this Jack in the Box is managed. Well-prepared food and super-friendly employees. Great job everyone!"}
{"text":"What the hell did I just eat? There is literally freaking hair all over my burger!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, even at 5am. I like the fact that I can get anything on the menu, even a taco."}
{"text":"How can a Jack-In-The-Box be 3 stars you ask? Well... Leaving Las Vegas, Being Hungover, Hungry, & Having to drive 3 or 4 hours to get home. This place is awesome!! The food was better than your average \"jack-in-the-crack\". I felt like there must have been some magical chef who was waiting in the back, just for me, to make the food extra fresh and extra yummy. I went through the drive-thru and there were some pretty cute pigeons chillin' in the parking lot. I wanted to throw some french fries at them, but at the time I felt like a greedy little starving Ethiopian child and kept all the fries for myself. Sorry pigeons, maybe next time... Muahahaha!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service and staff are not properly trained. They heard what they wanted to hear and placed my order according to themselves. Their receipt machine along with the drive thru screen were not working properly. Conveniently. They were non sociable and were completely out of it. Zombies basically. Charged more than what menu screen stated. Had no explanation other than blank stares... weird. And annoying."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is pretty bad.  I get that nobody wants to work on Christmas day.  As someone who has worked retail and odd jobs before and plenty of holidays I understand.  However, when someone walks in the door with a good attitude and asks you \"how are you doing\" and you reply with a pissed off look on your face and say in blunt tone \"really?\" and just stand there with your arms folded: you look like a douche.  That's exactly what the gentleman behind the counter last night on Christmas Day did as we walked in.  There were two guys working..one had dreads and seemed to hate his job and didn't want anybody coming in..the other was a taller guy, no hair, and tried to do his best to help the customers.  He even finished taking my order since dread-douche walked off before he even finished asking what I wanted.  Oh, to top it off when my husband inquired about the Munchie Meal thing it had just turned 9PM, a few minutes after and he seemed irritated that we would make such a bold request.  The food was good, the manager who had common sense was helpful, the dread-douche needs to go.  There are plenty of minimum wage jobs that don't ask you to work the holidays.  Maybe he should find one of those instead."}
{"text":"Update:  Quality of food is always good. Service is good 98% of the time.  The only reason I don't give 4 stars is the continuous, homeless issue that drags down the area."}
{"text":"Wow this jack in the box is the best . We couldn't ask for better customer service.  I wanted to give a shout out to The graveyard shift I see often late nigbts, Julian always makes sure he has our order right, he is fast and listens to us. He works really hard and is a necessity to the staff here, a great worker."}
{"text":"Worst Jack in the Box ever. The chicken tenders were pure fat, most of the drinks were out, & it was super trashy. Never again."}
{"text":"WORST FAST FOOD EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD . Ive gone to this location during the day and night , let me tell you the people here dont give a shit about there food quality. Come to this jack if you want food that tastes 10 years old. Shit food , shit service , shit people and to top it off the store looks filthy asf when you pull up through the drive through. Wish they zero stars ..."}
{"text":"Just East of the Convention Center & Strip  I love the NEW pomegranate smoothie & I tried the new fish fillet but it just reminded me of that dreaded school lunch every friday.  Not a big fan of the food here but love the smoothies."}
{"text":"back in 1990 this was a great fast food place-i mean the sourdough jack was something i literally wrote home about, in the 18 years since this place blows-nobody working there cares or has the ability to. this establishment has to be the leader in ada hires. the food is just wrong!! tacos are good if you need a colon cleansing, and the shakes are ok too. strangely enough the best thing on the menu is the egg rolls!!"}
{"text":"Nothing has changed. Still sucks! I should have read my own review before going back."}
{"text":"Employees are decently friendly for fast food, the food was not good for a Jack In the Box. The place was mess employees don't clean the place. All the tables are messy the Coke machine is a joke how gross is it. The bathrooms are disgusting and the floor is sticky. The kitchen employees also don't seem to know how to work the machines as they yelled at each other how to fix it and they also seem to joke around loudly. Gets 1 star cause it's a Jack In the Box and most are really good."}
{"text":"Local favorite due to location and price.  Highly recommend the Southwest Chicken Salad, zesty and good portion size.  Their (normal) fries are great."}
{"text":"I stood in front of the register for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take my order as I look around I notice 2 angry customers waiting on their food.I saw that the employees were ONLY  focused on the drive thru.So I go hop I'm my truck and get in the drive thru line.There was me and 1 other car and I swear on everything I sat there for 10 minutes while the lady in front of me waited for someone to take her order.So I back up and go back inside and say \"are you guys still serving food here today or what\"? That's when a lady looks at me with an attitude and says \"yeah\".So I order my food and it was cold and nasty.HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE....HORRIBLE FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Go thru here a lot. Always friendly employees who remember what we want. They give us as much sauce as we need without charging us (like McDonalds) will always choose this locatin"}
{"text":"Got my order wrong two times in a row.. Still had good customer service but lousy attention to detail"}
{"text":"This place is alright... pretty convenient to I-85 and Concord Mills.  Nothing really special to report here... just fast, efficient, friendly service... with a very clean dining room."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes on a Monday at 1am because there's cars in front of me and behind me so I couldn't get out of line-get up to the window to order a shake and the guy working has no teeth and doesn't understand the word shake! then proceeded to start swearing at me telling me to F off! soon as he took his headset off to throw it at me I bolted never again"}
{"text":"deff try the Egg whites, so good with the tomatos"}
{"text":"Every effing time I visit this place they have the worst fries. They always taste like they've been fried in week old oil and every time my drunk ass falls for their delicious ploy and I always instantly regret it. Especially when I have to jump out of the car to fart in the drive through while I wait for round two of my bowels punishment."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for late night food when I was working strange hours.  I think I stopped coming here when they never got my order right.  Tonight, I waited forever in the Wendy's drive-thru and decided to go elsewhere so I ended up here.    I forgot about the diverse menu that Jack in the Box has.  Sure they have the typical burgers and chicken but they also have tacos, and now deli sandwiches.  Tonight I ventured out of my comfort zone and went with one of the Deli sandwiches.  And I also ordered an unsweet tea.  Extra points to the gentleman who took my order for confirming through the microphone that I wanted unsweet tea and for again confirming it at the window.   That alone added the 4th star.  Normally, I'd probably end up with the sweet stuff, no matter what I ordered.  As for the food, It was pretty good.  Normally I don't like pickles on my sandwiches but this sandwich tasted great with the pickle.  And I missed the curly fries here.     I'll have to remember to come back here.  It's not someplace I'd normally go for lunch but for those late night cravings, it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"The bathroom has no toilet paper so I was stuck lol. Besides that I got no napkins or straws with my meal. Their cleanliness wasn't the greatest either since there was clearly food all over the floor in the back. Another thing is look at my tray lol. Says a lot about their cleanliness."}
{"text":"Horrible service. There was a hair in my food and all the manager said was it was probably from people at my table cause of the wind. Right cause there is wind inside.  Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice in the past week and was not pleased either time. Service is unpleasant and employees were snippy. The first time they didn't get all of the food I ordered into the bag. Then, on my second visit, I asked for a peach tea with extra peach syrup. I took one sip and there was hardly any peach flavoring so I asked for a little extra. The girl in drive thru has me pull around to the front saying she'd fix it and bring it out right away. Couldn't you just take the 2 seconds to add a little flavor so I could be on my way? 5 minutes later, I had to go inside to get my drink. My food was cold and I felt like more of an annoyance for being there at all. I still managed to thank them because I know first hand how hard working fast food can be. It's not as easy as you'd think, but can be done by treating your customers with kindness and respect."}
{"text":"If i could leave less than 1 star i would. Horrible.., Horrible!! Order making. 3 times in a row that they repeat the order correctly but cannot make it right. Missing items, raw egg yolk in breakfast jack. Large fries that have small portions. Please avoid this location. They will fail you. Its comical at this point. I gave up."}
{"text":"I know, it's Jack in the Box. But, I do, on occasion stop by this particular Jack in the Box on my way home from work. Sure, it's fast food, but when I need a meal and I'm feeling particularly mayonnaise-y Jack in the Box is the answer. I've never been in the actual dining area. I have only ever been through the drive-thru.  The reason for 4 stars is because of the quickness and ALWAYS happy drive-thru order takers. I am not sure what this Jack in the Box is doing that is making their employees so happy, but they're doing something right.  Overall - food, is fast food. You know, it's okay and it's there and it's cheap. But service is fantastic."}
{"text":"JITB, is pretty much a poor mans Mcdonalds,not necessarily a bad thing,,the jumbo jack is simiar to a whopper and half the price,,the teryikaki bowls are quite good!"}
{"text":"These dumb motherfuckers can't do one thing at a time let alone the three or four things they are attempting at once. Take one order at a time and maybe you'd get things done faster then trying to take two orders at once and then micromanage the cooks and other register all at the same time, you can't even get my order right so let's start with that dummies!!!"}
{"text":"Not a frequent Jack's eater but stopped here to try the loaded breakfast sandwich. Sourdough bread was not toasted. Not even a little. It was just soft bread with hot breakfast meats. Now I know why I don't eat here. Total fail, Jack in the Box..."}
{"text":"Food was prepared good.   Tasted good.  Well maintained.   Friendly cashier.   Good menu.   What else do you need from a fast food place?"}
{"text":"I came in and ordered some food along with my cousin and asked for a water cup. I was refused a cup, then given a regular cup, then staff took it back saying we only paid for one cup then gave me a lil cup that looks like a cup you would pee in for a parole agent, lol. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Was going to eat at a McD's across the street while waiting on my car at Meineke's.  They closed breakfast down at 10:30am at McDumbos.    I walked across the street to the Jack in the box.  got the cheapest breakfast sandwich on the menu.  They gave me good service with a smile and a free water.  Clean place.  Lots of breakfast items.  Will return and skip the McDumbo garbage."}
{"text":"Once again, I ordered the ultimate sausage burrito, and it didn't have sausage on it.  Should have learned my lesson last time."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a huge shout out to the girl that took my order in the drive thru. I wish I got her name, but it was at about 10:30am today April 25th. She was quick , friendly and we even chatted a few minutes. Great service doesn't come often from here, but the last two visits I've had really made a difference. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was delish! Veggies tastes fresh as well."}
{"text":"The manager, Susana, refused to provide basic condiments because she did not want other customers to run out. These are condiments. I asked for an extra buttermilk sauce and she refused to give me one and would not let me purchase it. Unbelievable. I cannot believe her rationale."}
{"text":"Growing up, Jack in the Box was a favorite stop.  The tacos! What can I say? They're greasy, crunchy and so addicting we usually order at least 8 when we stop in.  Today, Along with our tacos, my family ordered a chicken fajita pita, an ultimate cheeseburger, an order of egg rolls and a ham and cheese melt. The only thing that went unfinished was the ham and cheese melt.  Honestly, we seriously go here just for the tacos anyway.  We got friendly service and it was clean and our food came quickly.  Current health rating was 100 the day we went in.  Fast food, yes.  Not the highest quality I'm sure but, sometimes it's ok to indulge once in a while.  Next time we are down this way, we'll probably stop in again.  A little taco nostalgia is nice every so often."}
{"text":"3 people in the store, counting me. The other 2 had already ordered and were waiting for their food.  NO ONE at the counter, no one acknowledged my presence for about 5 mins.  I commented to the man next to me that with this few customers, no one should be waiting - for anything.   After ANOTHER 5 mins., I get disgusted and leave.  F*@k. That."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is absurd. I've given this location many chances, considering it is close to home, and works with the hours I work, but time after time I leave disappointed. The employees at this location never seem to care, and are always yelling and joking with each other, never really focusing on the customer, or if they are, they are rude."}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast, I had never tried JITB before.  I figured I would try it since I was feeling super lazy after work and just wasn't feeling cooking.  I ordered the bacon and swiss butter burger with curly fries combo.  Service through the drive through was quick and efficient and I drove home munching on the freshly made curly fries (which were delicious by the way...the same exact thing as Arby's).  When I got home, I ripped into the burger and can only say it was \"meh.\" The meat ruined it.  It tasted funny...like some no-frills supermarket pre-frozen burger.  The toppings were good though and would have earned this place a solid 4 stars for fast food quality.   I hear the tacos here are really good, so if I do come back, I'll probably try those.  I'll definitely skip the burger though,"}
{"text":"Mess. Not that you should expect much from a 24hr fast food place that has more fried food options than even the staff can keep up with. We come bc it's quick and convenient to a theme park but don't go out of our way."}
{"text":"This place would be better off as a nightclub rather than a fast food joint. We got here at 6:00 in the morning and they were BLASTING rock music from their PA system. It was so loud, no one could hear that their orders were ready. Many people complained and the staff did nothing about it. Many customers just left rather than try to order."}
{"text":"I went in because I already know you can't trust a big order at the drive through. I have my order and she read it back to me and I verified she entered it correctly. Once I got my food which was taking a while since they seemed to be understaffed for the traffic they had, I checked my order and found something missing.   I told the clerk there who proceeded to stare at the computer screen and ask repeatedly if I was missing something. I finally had to explain to him, despite having just done it in front of him, that I had checked my receipt and pulled everything from my bag and was missing something.   Explain to me again why these folks deserve $15 an hour?"}
{"text":"No milk shakes on two different occasions of course I still had to wait in line 10 minutes so the cars in front of me could get their orders before I could leave thanks for wasting my time Jack."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost !!! Another Fast food joint that employees could care less, and cant even speak English enough to get your order right. They burn everything...sandwich, fries, your money...yes you'd get more satisfaction from burning you dough then wasting it here."}
{"text":"I don't go to jack in the box often. However I've never really had a bad experience with one.   The service here sucks. I've come here twice with this last instance being the last time I bother.  I've walked in both times.  It took about 15 minutes to get a single jumbo jack last time. It wasn't busy.   Today it took 3 minutes with me being the only person in line and two people looking right at me and not taking my order before I left.   Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. 5 guys will continue to get my business over you. They seem to take less time than you do and they're a walk in burger place."}
{"text":"Don't eat here all ways burns there food. Horrible customer services they are rude they food is always bad. Just go somewhere else even a different Jack just not here"}
{"text":"I was on my way home and I was thinking, \"Where can I get a meal for $5.00 or less?\" ..that I would actually eat. Jack in the Box came through for me ! I had 3 egg rolls for $3.29 and a mini funnel cake for $1.00. The egg rolls are my favorite on the menu they remind me of the egg rolls at P.T's. I also like the sweet and sour sauce at Jack in the box. The funnel cake was yummy but I thought funnel cake came with raspberry sauce? (I'm not too sure) It was still tasty and just as good as the ones I used to get at the Del Mar Fair."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work wanted to try the new hot sauce burger. The staff was very nice and quick but the food... the burger was way over done, the bun was stale, not even half a leaf of lettuce and I got a completely frozen shake and fries so greasy that were barely edible. What a let done.."}
{"text":"Jack in the Box food is great...Don't eat or order your food during 2pm - 10pm shift on this location (Crews that work on \"SWING SHiFT are GROSS HELL). Don't believe me? Well, I've seen hell like you've never imagine. I've worked with these crews for a  short period of time...  Overload Dishes in the back...not washing it properly (containers still have soap) Ice berg lettuce - not washing the lettuce appropriately.                                           (Keep in mind that produce is a raw product, grown in dirt) small pieces of dirt and grit fall. Not washing their hand... A bunch of (swing shift) stubborn kids... More on playing than working...  Crews and Team Leaders that used to work there were gone. Handling the food strictly and know who their Boss is .....Afraid to get fired and so doing their job professionally and appropriatly.  These fuckers are not afraid to get their ass fired and so not giving a fuck handling the food that you put it in to your mouth...   EAT HERE if YOU DARE..."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru ever! It takes forever and the overall customer service is terrible! I just ordered an egg roll and three stuffed jalapeños. Get home, NO EGG ROLL, got the pepp"}
{"text":"Ribeye burger has gone down hill. Stale bun ,hardly any toppings when ordered extra. Burger way over cooked"}
{"text":"Scene: drive-thru last night, about 1:30AM.  After nearly getting accosted at a nearby bar, I decided to \"take the edge off\" by drowning myself in greasy fast food. There was one car ahead of me in the drive thru and they had a fairly large order, very specific requests. When I pulled up to place my order five minutes later, I was politely asked to wait, which I didn't mind. I needed a few minutes to unwind anyways. Two cars pulled in behind me. One honks, and the lady asks me to please wait a little longer. Almost ten minutes later and I still hadn't ordered. The drunks two cars back started honking their horn again and yelling out \"What, are you ordering the whole menu, lady?\" I got out of my car, slammed the door and explained the situation to both cars.   Finally was able to order my standard Deli Trio sandwich (~$5). Got to the drive thru window, the female working said it was just her and one other person working the entire restaurant. I told her about the rude-@$$ car two back. I hope they got a \"surprise\" with their order.   Waiting 15+ minutes just to even order (when there's only one car ahead) is really uncalled for. I hope they can speed up their drive-thru so they don't have to deal with heated drunks looking to sop up their suds with a Munchie Meal."}
{"text":"It's a dump, trashy, there's nobody inside and it has taken 10 minutes for ONE BURGER!  Also, the transient in the bathroom picking at her face for a few minutes was a nice touch.  Gross"}
{"text":"Its 2am and you are hungry, you are way the hell out in the NW valley.  Guess what?  You are eating here because nothing else is open.  We even had breakfast here Thanksgiving morning on my way to the AZ Auto Show and guess what....they were the only place open.  Its simple, food is decent fast food and its always open.  At 2am I recommend 10 tacos, for breakfast I recommend the sausage, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich.  Service is fast food they are always nice here, the place is clean inside and you really cant ask for much else, if you do you suck."}
{"text":"Jack in the box serves a purpose at 1 am when you are starving, I give it a 3 star A-OK review. Not sure what's in the tacos but at that hour they are the best ever. This location is new & clean & service in drive through is always good. Good selection of different food options & breakfast is pretty good here. This maybe the best fast food out of the old school places. In & Out or Chick-fil-a blow this place away but they aren't 2 minutes from my house either."}
{"text":"I swear, the idiots that work this location have hit an all time low. Asked for lettuce on my burger. I guess they took it literally."}
{"text":"Im a late night customer i only come here after midnight Jeff is fun and always a positive person to come to after a hard days work he carries a very positive attitude and has a way of making people smile"}
{"text":"This is really not good. This franchise is usually very good all the time. The turn over lately has me kind of upset the people that show great customer service are no longer there. Aside from the manager and other lady there and maybe one cook and morning people, everyone is new and learning.   But after hours Saturday's and weekends is downright scary. Especially on Christmas Eve when we stopped in to the drive they just for 2 drinks and maybe some fries(were our thoughts)   Our answer after the pleasant recorded message was simply (what my wife referred to as ) extremely rude and to quote \"we're closed\" this was at 9:20pm. Rode around a person sleeping against the wall by the front door in the chair and the person who answered hiding after what they just said.   Last time this happened the night crew went bye bye.   As I next call the corporate number hopefully a restructure will happen on the weekend nights."}
{"text":"The first place I ate upon arriving in Phoenix was Jack in the Box. This was not planned, but yet simply a happy accident. Happy may be a bit of a stretch... an accident none the less.  We were driving to meet someone and were in a bit of a hurry, but also needed to grab something quick to eat. When I glanced this famed eatery, I knew we had to stop here. I've met people from the West who rave about JITB so I was super excited.   My excitement didn't last long. We pulled in the parking lot, walked in and all I could think was... this is it? The famed Jack in the Box? There was nothing wrong with it so to speak, but... it's really just another fast food restaurant. I was expecting a \"gourmet burger\" joint or something. I don't really know what I was expecting come to think of it. I was definitely underwhelmed though.   I got a burger and fries combo. The burger was okay for a fast food burger. It looked better than it tasted. It had a different flavor. The meat is seasoned but I couldn't break down the specific seasoning flavor that was throwing me off. The fries... were fast food fries.   The staff was very friendly which is untypical of some other fast food places. That was pleasing.   Then there's the mascot..... Am I the only one terrified by the clown-thing art on the walls? I felt like it was going to step out of the wall and get me. I tried to maintain constant eye contact the entire time because I was totally ready to make a break for the door if that thing came to life.   Clown-thing aside, Jack in the box was not a bad experience by any means. I don't, however, know what all the rage is about. I would absolutely try it again, but next time I may just eat outside... away from clown-thing."}
{"text":"The only thing i like are the Ice cream shakes and the breakfast jack combo with Orange  juice"}
{"text":"Well what can you really expect from jack in the box? The only this I like about this place is how it looks on the inside other than that my food was poorly prepared with the exception of the my churro bites that are very good and keeps me coming back. The lady at the front was very nice and probably because I'm usually there pretty late."}
{"text":"Horrible, just horrible. Could not hear the kid taking the order. Got no thank you for visiting and to top it off no napkins w/drive thru visit! Will never return to any \"gag in the bag\" sorry jack In the box locations again! Horrible just horrible!"}
{"text":"I can only be mad at myself that I disregarded my better judgment. I was the fourth car in line at the drive-through and I opted to wait in line even after I saw the line did not move for over five minutes. Seven or so minutes in, I could not back out because a car pulled in behind me therefore I was trapped. When my turn finally came, the guy taking my order allowed me to please part of my order and then he asked me to hold on. He disappeared for a few minutes. I don't know, maybe he had to go to the bathroom. I really wanted to say something however I did not want my food to be spent in so I waited beyond patiently. The car behind me blew their horn and then finally the guy returned. By the time my turn came to pick up my food at the window, at least 15 minutes had elapsed. Of course with all of the weight, something told me to check my bags for the items I ordered. Of course to no surprise, the first two items I ordered prior to The guy disappearing were not there. I pointed this out and they asked me to swing back through (the drive-thru and they would have it ready for me. Excuse me... Absolutely not. I told him I would not be swinging back around. I would rather just go home. The good news is, he said it would be just one minute, and that was actually true"}
{"text":"I just literally threw my sandwich away. So I was in the drive thru for 10 mins, no biggie I guess it was a rush? Anyways, I get my food and the fries are lukewarm/ cold... I'm still like no big deal. Then, I get home and pick off the lettuce with brown spots and while doing that, there's a hair in the sandwich... Cold fries are one thing, but waiting for a while to get food to find out that there's some others persons hair that you don't know what area it fell off from. Dude, I'll probably find another location to eat at tbh. I'm just really grossed out!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of a Jack in the Box. Always have, always will, but this location...meh.  Okay, so in terms of food, it's legit. My order was made fresh and fast and took no time at all. Fries were hot, which is usually my gripe at any fast food establishment, but not the case here.  The real issue is the homeless people coming in and out of the store. The manager yelling at said homeless people really puts a buzzkill on your meal. My suggestion would be to either over at the drive-thru or take your food to go. You definitely don't want to sit inside and be in the middle of the match of employee vs homeless. Not fun at all."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for awhile now cause i work down the street and its okay service their this manager who seems rude to her employees other then that not bad the employees are nice and havent had a bad experince with their food"}
{"text":"Super friendly general manager.  Place is clean for a Jack In The Box.  Good buns on the burger.  I recomend the double jack.  They now have the customizable drink station, many choices, albeit slower than the conventional.  Any food any time of day.  Jbox!"}
{"text":"The breakfast at this place is super cheap and you get a lot of bang for your buck. Every time I have gone the staff has been really nice although I can't say I have ever been late at night as I usually get breakfast here. It's not the fanciest breakfast in the world but it actually taste good and is cooked fresh. I work near this JITB and understand that due to the nature of people who slum around downtown Tempe on Mill it's not their fault that they get some less then desirable groups hanging out in front of their establishment. It's a fast food joint, you get what you pay for and honestly I don't see the point in over criticizing about a full breakfast for $3.50."}
{"text":"On 9/17/7 around 3:40am. micheal at drive thru was clearly on something. As we approached drive thru he took my debit card for payment and then threw us off by talking gibberish anout his ex wife and then telling me to reverse-- which confused my friend and I at the time, a car then pulled behind me at drive thru.... he gave me my drink, but food was not ready and told me to pull to the front. When I got to the front I started searching for my debit card because I couldn't find it.... finally our food came out and I asked Michael if he gave my debit card back? and VERY quickly said \"yep\".... a normal person would say \"pretty sure but I can double check\"... I told him I wasn't leaving until I found it and he just said \"ok\" and rushed inside... 5+ minutes Later, I still couldn't find it and went back to drive thru to find the car that was originally behind me, at the drive thru window with micheal leaning out the window talking to him--- that whole time??... they then \"fist bumped\" --the car drove off and then micheal points to the floor right away... as if my debit card was dropped...when I picked it up it was hot to the touch -- I'm not an idiot. Clearly micheal and his friend were trying to STEAL & they were doing it as a team. drug test your employees so they're not desperate for quick cash.... Michael 0. Me- 1 .... idiot!"}
{"text":"The food you receive never looks like the picture on the menu board. When will Jack in a Box get its shit together. It's really pitiful."}
{"text":"Out of egg rolls, low enthusiasm, had to repeat order multiple times in drive through BUT they let us order the late night meals early."}
{"text":"They are getting pretty high priced and honestly that's not a huge deal.  What is a huge deal is to order over priced Ice Tea and have it take like moldy water.  I asked if was fresh and they said yes.  My question should have been --when is the last time you clean the ice tea container.  GROSS!!"}
{"text":"Wow jack in the box not only did your window guy not understand I wanted the sourdough grilled chicken sandwich , after saying it clearly....  I had to then specifically say number 11! I got this dry ass beef jerky piece of chicken patty in my sandwich....  which I got the Combo that was $7.28 and got charged $9 something....   Amazing all these \"kids\"/ lazy ass adults want 15$ an hour but can't even understand a simple order unless it's numbered and or even cook it right.    Will not be going to this location again.  Maybe start drug testing your stoner employees...."}
{"text":"The girl i  the drive through cussed at me and dropped our food on the ground. Customer service was very poor. We wont be goimg back to this jack in the box."}
{"text":"Every place that sells food needs to be rated against peers -- so you don't compare a Jack to a Stratta or anything. So this place really needs to be pitted against other places, and in particular those in the immediate neighborhood, I think.   This place is great, and probably the best food choice when you're in that area. In the immediate area, there this, a Taco Bell (or Del Taco, I forget), McDonald's, and Wienerschnitzel. This place is always the fastest, provides the best food, and generally has the coolest people working there in that they're polite.  One time I went down here and I was starving after having worked a double shift. I rolled through the drive through and thought I should get enough food for then, plus some snacks for later. I ordered four tacos, curly fries, and jalapeno poppers AND IMMEDIATELY ATE THEM ALL. And all of the food was good and hot. Can't mess with that."}
{"text":"Complete jerks. I was behind three other paying customers in the drive thru. I was the last in a line. Three friends ordered and got food , and they turned me away. They told me they can't take any orders and to go away. I asked why because my friends had just placed orders and they abruptly shut me don't. Don't go here. The staff has no manners. There's no point."}
{"text":"Ok, it's Jack In The Box.  Guess what people.. it's fast food, so if you go here, expect yummy greasy oily food.  I love the jumbo jacks and the breakfast burritos.   I havent been sick from eating here, so (knocks on wood) I hope that doesnt happen.  Of course if you eat their tacos at 3AM.. you might get sick.  but damn those are so good. I dont know what's in them, but it's ok.. it still tastes like some form of meat paste.   Not a fan of their fries too much.  Im still a McDees fry eater.  This place is place is pretty decent. Some of the staff seems like they've worked there for ages.  Very friendly people."}
{"text":"Went to just get a quick snack and the lady on the headset in the drive thru could not understand 1 word I was saying. I was speaking so clear but I am happy a team lead was able to help me at the drive thru window."}
{"text":"The other day I went for the spicy Jack chicken sandwich the woman at the drive-through was very pleasant and very sweet but when I got home my sandwich was missing the tomatoes also didn't look like the picture was very thin so if you want to say it has a new looks now or it's bigger Its not!:(  disappointed  :("}
{"text":"So had the new truck series 2 of the sandwiches the pork pulled pork and the other was the roast prime rib horrible the Prime rib was all chopped up into little tiny pieces!!! On the pork sandwich there was one little tiny slab of pork !,,, that was it what a joke!!!! And poor service on top of that one of the sandwiches were not in the bag, Had to drive back to get it Unbelievable....."}
{"text":"Very poor service, attitude sucks with team leader who was obnoxious and in one's face...no more JITB's for this family.  This was the 2nd bad incident at this store.  Guess Jack doesn't need to please paying customers. Staff doesn't want to be at work is putting it mildly.  Not going back to any JIB..."}
{"text":"So have not been here since I was like 10 and they messed up my order like crazy. Gave me nothing that I ordered and even had to find another employee just to take my order because they couldn't speek english well enough."}
{"text":"I've been to this jack in the box many times and never had problems before. The inside was closed even thought the times said it was open. I went through the drive through and ordered a kids chicken strips meal and 5 piece churros. My friends got meals without problems. I paid for my meal and only got two churros and they did not give me my chicken strips or fries. I am very disappointed in this Jack in the Box. Will probably not be here again."}
{"text":"It's a Jack-In-The Box.   I don't eat here very often for myself, but my dad likes it and I go through the drive-thru quite a bit to get him breakfast since he's handicapped and doesn't drive.   What I like:   1) It's never crowded. There's never a line. They don't make mistakes.   2) They actually have good customer service. There's a woman who's often at the drive-thru in the mornings that's particularly pleasant, and I've been known to laugh at her jokes occasionally.   And hey, I've been known to get a breakfast croissant occasionally (I'm only human), and although they're greasy, I can't deny they're tasty..."}
{"text":"This is the best Jack-in-the-Box around. How does one make franchise food better than others? Don't know but it is better here. Service is great. Never crowded. Super clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"We frequently visit this Jacks on way home. This time after I hard days work, they seemed a bit busy and took longer than normal. The car in front of me, placed an order and I guess couldn't wait and decided to leave. This jacks had a way out before you get to window. When I pull up to window, she gives me a total which wasn't mine. I tell her that wasn't my order and I wasn't sure if she swiped my card yet. So I tell her my order was 28 dollars and not 7! I get home with dinner and we all eat. My wife decides to check our account and asked me what else did I order? I had my receipt of 28.80. I been back here twice to get a refund of 7.56! And manager wasn't there. I'm getting the run around, and we probably will not be visiting this jacks anymore."}
{"text":"Once you park you are instantly greeted by the homeless people begging for money and junkies nodding off in the parking lot and to top it off you get your car towed not even five minutes into being parked! Way to create a stellar experience Jack in the Box!! Parking is for customers only...... the only customers that come here don't have cars and smell like shit because they sleep at the bus stop outside. Maybe clean up the demographic of people you let loiter and piss all over the parking lot and the shitty food you serve instead of towing cars."}
{"text":"Yeah, Jack in the Box, 4 stars...So, where is my Assclown tiara? I intend on wearing it all day for reviewing a corporate giant like Jack in the Box. However, where does one get a real ice cream shake from an independent in less than 5 minutes? Maybe not the best testing criteria, but I intend on winning the argument because it is my review!    Seriously, Jack in the Box has maraschino cherries and real whip cream on their luscious chocolate milkshakes. I can't speak for anything else on the menu but if you are craving a chocolate milkshake with real ice cream- hey, they came through with the cherry and whip cream, I have no reason to believe its not real ice cream and not some strange milk solids and it taste like bliss. So, blow through drive thru, treat yourself to some real whip cream and a cherry!    Truth in advertising alone is well worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"Service is awesome! They always let me order extra tacos when I forget at the second window Lol. Sweet tea is the bees knees and I love that they are open late and the food is never yesterday tasting."}
{"text":"Easily accessible. Drive thru employee very courteous, fast, and my order was correct which is most important. Will definitely stop by more when in the area."}
{"text":"Yup, it's a Jack in the Box. This location is well maintained with speedy, efficient service. We end up going here quite a lot after having dessert at Glacier Snow. I guess you could call it our after-dessert snack haha."}
{"text":"They were swamped with drive-through orders on Saturday night, so there was a little bit of a wait to get a cashier at the stand to take our order. The cashier though was engaging, friendly, and on top of things. I wish I had gotten his name so I can commend him for his great customer service. This location has a Coca Cola Freestyle so you can have a custom soda with your order.  While the drive through is open 24 hours, the eat-in restaurant is open until midnight on Saturday. Definitely a good place for your late night eats.  P.S. Their seasonal peppermint oreo shake is amazing!"}
{"text":"Pretty good late night.  Nice to have a place open all. Ought that you know what to expect in food."}
{"text":"The most incompetent human beings to ever walk the planet. Multiple times they have been too lazy to get certain items for me so they substitute it with something without my approval because god forbid you have to actually work and get it right the first time.   For example:   They gave me a spoon to eat my teriyaki bowl.  A spoon... A SPOON.  In the car ride back I said to my girlfriend \"I guarantee they are so lazy they gave me a spoon because they didn't want to walk to the back to restock the forks.\" When I get there and ask for a fork, WHAT DO YOU KNOW. she walks to the back and comes back with a box of forks that she was too lazy to get the first time.   Another time I order a chicken sandwich, rather than do their job and cook a chicken patty, they throw on an old  beef patty they already had made. I wasn't aware that cows produced chicken. Has science gone too far?  This most recent time, their friend comes up behind me in the drive through. They ask me to pull to the window and then ask me to loop around so their friend can go first, claiming \"she got here first\". Its a drive through, unless her car defies the laws of physics and magically went through my car, thats impossible. I know they knew each other because of the loud obnoxious conversation they had for 10 minutes while I wait behind them.   If you want mediocre food made by incompetent and mediocre staff then this is the location for you. You can see the resentment in their eyes when you ask them to do more than just stand around. I voted yes for the minimum wage increase and by god these people make me regret it."}
{"text":"Had a coupon that I printed online and the manager wouldn't accept it. not sure why it matters where I got it, it brought me to that dump. I work in area and this Jack in the Box is a shit hole. they won't take an internet coupon but the manager will allow vagrants and bums to hang out front all day. I get back and the Frys are cold and one of the burgers had a piece of the patty missing. So I pay full amount and get 80% of a burger. The girl at window was nice and I feel sorry she works for an asshole like this manager. How about instead of sitting on ur ass in the back office you grab a trash bag and clean your property, it's nasty... I will never go back nor will my employees... Shame on Jack in the Box for having a shortsided moron as mamager..."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. It's too damned bad people who matter don't use Yelp more often! I see the exact same reviews on here for years now At this same location! Ignorant rude people and they are demanding $15 an hour? What a joke! Get a damned education and then go ask for $15 an hour lazy idiot! And that's exactly what it is! LAZY!   Literally sat at the order board for 5 mins and 40 seconds before she even took my order. 1 car in front of me at the window... So of course the shake machine is not working. It has not worked here for 3 months now and no I'm not exaggerating. So I order a chicken sandwich with no lettuce and 2 tacos. Tacos were stale. I could hardly bite into them and I had to yank the taco back and forth like a rabid dog to tear the piece off. I spit it out! Chicken sandwich was all white like it was freezer burnt before they through it in the week old greasy fryer! I also got a Sprite. There was maybe 2-3 mouthfuls of Sprite in the cup. They fill the medium cup all the way to the top with ice so they dnt have to give u much soda or whatever u order to drink. The girl was overall just pissy and didn't want to be at work. I don't eat fast food very much but I will never go to this location again. Bunch of lazy morons! And maybe someone can get the stupid shake machine to work for them cause no one there can seem to figure out how to turn the damned thing on and put a cup under the spout!"}
{"text":"Take Three on the breakfast prego craving.    Since I was already on McDowell and work in Old Town Scottsdale...I decided to drive over the hill and hit up this Jack In The Box.    I order at the drive-thru this morning a small Strawberry Banana Smoothie.  \"That will be $3.xx, please pull up to the window.\"   SWEET!!!  I'm getting my breakfast smoothie!!     I get to the window and am told.  Its not ready.  It will be in 15 minutes.  I say thanks and drive off .  SERIOUSLY!??!  Again, you'd think that with a 24hr drive-thru operation that they'd have an item ready that would more likely than not, be consumed during breakfast hours!!  Must be a company policy or something to not have the smoothie machines up, running, and ready to go before 6am.   Jack - You SUCK!"}
{"text":"The magical meat tacos were good, place looked clean forbthe most part. Nothing super special"}
{"text":"I discovered this location has the best sweet tea  :-)  I also like the ladies that work the early morning drive through, they're so friendly and efficient  :-)"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru with my hubby for lunch today.  Their speaker wasn't working well, but the lady taking our order got everything right.  When we pulled up, it didn't take long for our order to come.  The lady greeted us with a smile and made sure we had everything.  Her manager was kinda huddled over her, which I thought was odd.  Not sure if this was her first day, but she was awesome.  To bad we didn't get her name.  She was an older lady with glasses, and super nice.  This place has great service."}
{"text":"Your basic burger joint. Had some cool sides that aren't usually available in fast food restaurants so that was a plus. Nacho cheese for fries makes me nostalgic for Philly. That did set it a step above many ff restaurants. Overall, better than many but I'm still looking for the Magic ff restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Employees all standing around chasing while leaving customers standing in line."}
{"text":"Wow!  I expected the normal from Jack in the Box, but this location is much cleaner and the food actually is served in a way that it looks like the pictures... seriously."}
{"text":"Blazing Chicken Sandwich is pretty good!  But for the price stick with Chic Fil A.  It's about 10x better for the same price!  This store pretty much delivers what you expect for a Jack in the Box.  Nothing worse, nothing better.  Tough to access this location with a big truck and trailer though.  Pretty small parking area."}
{"text":"Visited this Jack in the Box tonight for a quick family drive thru dinner. It is your typical location, there isn't really anything too special about it. The customer service was instant and friendly. However, at times it was hard to understand the cashier's responses, but the order was taken correctly. One of the best things about this place is that the food is always made as you order, rather than having it sit out for who knows how long.  When it comes down to grabbing a quick meal, this place isn't exactly ideal. If you are planning on having a burger of any kind, it is a bit pricey compared to other fast food places. On the other hand, their value menu has some pretty good options. Also, their tacos are a favorite and you can get two for about a $1.20, which has recently gone up from their $0.99 price."}
{"text":"I love this jack in the box!  They are always friendly and helpful! Don't get irritated when I can't decide on what I want....conviently located near my house...what's not to love!?!"}
{"text":"I love jack in the box and the sourdough jack which has been my meal for the past 13 years. I know what it tastes and and what it consists of. There have been a few times where the ingredients were not true. Once I had 3 tiny patties instead of one, I don't mind it but it wasn't as juicy and too thick and dry. The other time they put lettuce with way too much mayonnaise and a pickle! What in the world?! I always ask for buttermilk ranch and usually never get it. Once i asked for a breakfast croissant and got tacos and an actual meal. A few times the sandwich wasn't even heated up and the cheese was still cold. Please get your shit together! I only go here because it's so close to home but on my way home from being out I will definitely go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Slowest service in the world took 20mins for some tacos only. It should not be taking this long for the simplest food on the menu. Ruining peoples lunch time"}
{"text":"I love jack in the box but I hate this location! They always forgot something ! And they are always rude, I went the other day and they took 20 mins for 1 thing  , so i asked for a refund b/c i was on my way to work ! & they man looks at me at say's \"im sorrry i forgot your food is done and hands me my bag ?\"  I was angry and walked out!"}
{"text":"Going thru the drive thru...it's the most disgusting drive thru ever...it makes a person think if it looks that bad outside then what's going on in side.."}
{"text":"I went there to Eat the door hrs was from 5am to 1am I got there exact 12:40am the door was open I walked in and the lady said sorry we are closed I told her to look at the time its 12:40 and your door is open she said sorry no open she didn't even speak English  it was horrible customer service and Im never going there again"}
{"text":"This jack has always been great! Great customer service, fast and fresh food. Tacos are crispy!"}
{"text":"Come in the afternoon or at dinner. I don't know why every time I come in the morning they mess up my order. N u don't even wanna take it back ,cause it takes u like ten minutes for the cook to make a new one. I don't get anything special I just wanted a number 25 n why do I get a bisquit makes no sence."}
{"text":"What a concept! Offer reasonable price specials such as 3 tacos and a regular Coke for $3 and people might walk inside. I was one of them. It was my second time to a Jack in the Box in at least 7 years. Both visits were at this very location.  It wasn't just the reasonable special that led me into this very Jack In the Box that sits off St. Rose Parkway and is attached to an Arco in the shadow of the M Hotel & Casino near Interstate 15. What brought me into Jack in the Box is a hiking tradition. And so, I am writing this review from the unique perspective of a hike-thru instead of a drive-thru customer. From this unique hiker perspective, there were two occasions where I partook in a 6 mile round trip hike on the St. Rose Parkway Trail from the Seven Hills Starbuck's to the Mirage Hotel. By the half way point of the hike by the Magic Hotel is Jack In the Box. After 3 miles of walking on a paved trail without shade, I develop the mood for a snack. It just so happens that the westernmost point of the St. Rose Parkway Trail is by a Jack In the Box.  On my two hiking stops at this fast food restaurant that is truly a car stop serving the southernmost exit in the Las Vegas valley, I have dealt with good employees. The kid that took my order was pleasant where the kitchen employees were relatively quick to make my three tacos.  Of course 3 tacos and a regular Coke for $3 isn't going to be off the charts yummy. However, they were solid. A couple envelopes of the hot sauce made them half a star above solid. Additionally they successfully served their role of a snack to fill me up while I took a break in a restaurant that had the ambiance of a gas station and highway stop.   I didn't walk into Jack In the Box expecting a great dining experience. The restaurant could use some improvement on cleanliness. I sat at a bar seat overlooking the Arco because the available booth was dirty.     My bar seat also overlooked the Coke Freestyle machine. After recently discovering how delicious the Coke Zero drinks are, I appreciate sipping a Coke Vanilla Zero knowing I am not consuming all these calories and sugar.   Jack In the Box is a brand that I have for the most part passed over. Judging by the number of store closings in Henderson and the number of bad ratings corresponding to this location, my avoidance of the Jack in the Box brand is understandable. However, when the Jack in the Box brand offers reasonable deals such as the one that I discussed and a location practically off the trailhead of a hiking trail I was on, I will pass into a Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"My bad, I gave them a second chance. They need a manager to step in or something. Same experience as the first time. Long wait... 20 minutes plus, rude service, cold food and wrong order given. I know it's food from a fast food place in but come on.  Jack in the box  at other locations has their sh*t together. This location never will"}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes in the drive thru to get home and realize two of our jr bacon burgers were missing and had to drive twenty minutes back to not get them because we didn't have the receipt when in drive thru the lady remembers taking our order. rude and a waste of time"}
{"text":"Probably the best jack location I've been in. I always come late at night for a little snack. Service is fast and orders always come out hot and fresh. The asian manager is very nice and always generous with giving out sauces."}
{"text":"NOT a fan of this Jack in the box at all! I went through the drive through and all i wanted was a milkshake. I was clear with my words and she had no idea what i wanted. She took forever to respond too. After she found out what i wanted, they werent serving it. This has happened a couple times now and its really annoying that their employees cant understand whats on the menu that i am ordering."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast sandwich ate most of it then noticed the egg had green/blue hue. Not sure if it was bad or just gross looking. Ether way it's Jack In the Box they should up the standards at this location."}
{"text":"Forgot the fry. Yes, I'm going back for it. Mostly to see if they'll be willing to \"make it right\" I usually don't have this issue at this location, but when I do they'll usually make up for it. As long as you have your receipt of course, fair enough.   [Reader: Please add me as a friend!]"}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I definitely would the 5 stars just doesn't give this place justice......I'm VERY embarrassed to say but I came here ordering food and when I handed the gentleman Jon my card he told me it was declined. Me thinking how can it possibly have been declined I checked and unfortunately a recent reoccurring payment that wasn't suppose to go through when it did was showing up. They thankfully didn't start my whole order but only some of it. It wasn't for much and I left every other card at home because I didn't think anything of it. Well this gentleman took the change I had and gladly gave me what they already had prepared....again embarrassed because I had the money to pay but just didn't have it on me. I grabbed a credit card that I probably shouldn't have. Well he was AMAZING to cover what I was missing I insisted he didn't but he had no problem doing it....he even offered my whinning kids a drink. I'm not the type to take advantage of good people so I will be back to pay for the food I couldn't cover. This just couldn't go unoticed and I appreciate him very much!!!! Good people are still out there just don't forget them when they do a good deed ;)"}
{"text":"Quick service. Never had a messed up order. The big fella who is the manager is very kind and prompted us to return if our order is ever incorrect and they'll hook us up. All employees have been kind and courteous... until this morning. As I waited for my food at the drive thru, one woman took my card who was kind. But the lady who brought my bag of food was rushing me and brushing me off, she seemed offended when I asked for ranch. Would've understood if there was a rush but no cars behind me? Come on now, I don't need to deal with that early in the morning."}
{"text":"Just came by for a lazy lunch and had the best customer service hands down I've ever had in a fast food restaurant from their cashier Teresa she greeted me very sincerely and personally when I walked in the door and was very engaging and personable through my order and has been with all the customers as I've sat here and ate. She deserves a raise or promotion I'll come back just for her."}
{"text":"I DONT recommend the The New loaded fries.  The container it comes and will zap any crispness out of the french fries within seconds. And if you go through the drive-thru... you're for sure to get a box of soggy mess. I dined in. They were we're all right, but I would recommend if you get them, tell them NOT to close the box. I think I'll leave The Carney Asada fries to Roberto's in future. Next time... yes, I'll be back...addicted to the tacos and I'll stick to the bacon cheddar wedges. 2 stars today. But The cashier was was friendly(4)stars"}
{"text":"5am and the doors are open.  Girls in the overnight are happy and nice.  Location is kinda clean.  But most important staff works hard and made the food fairly quick."}
{"text":"Now I like McDonald's, I really do.  But since I was but a wee lad, I have always had this soft spot for Jack In the Box.  Sure, there was that whole kangaroo meat thing years (and years and years ago), but I don't know that there's really a problem with it.  I've certain eaten worse that kangaroo in my life, and their tacos sure are good, so who am I to complain?  In any case, I also love a Breakfast Jack, and they have a great selection - much wider variety than just about any other fast food, which is awesome.  Sure, those tacos are deep-fried (not just the shells, the entire taco), but man they are good.  For whatever reason, the Concord location is always a lot friendlier than most other locations, or maybe we just happen to hit them at the right times.  I don't know what it is, but they always have service with a smile.  The one downside to Jack is that they can be slow - even though most fast food places make your food to order, if the cooks at Jack are running behind, it can be a really long wait.  Just get your drink and kick back at the table, because standing at the counter is not going to make you feel good about anything."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. Are you kidding me? There was no one in line at the drive thru and i waited 15 minutes for my meal of a small curly fry. When I finally received my curly fries, they were oily, cold and soggy. The only reason why I came here was because it is on the way to my workplace and I thought it would be convenient. I thought wrong. Never again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Never felt so ignored at a counter. Stood there for 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging so I left.   Way to knock it out of the park.   Went through the drive through and that was a mistake as well. Placed the order- no total or confirmation they had everything correct. Should I wait my total or pull up? Lmfao.   Stellar."}
{"text":"After working an 8 hr shift this was my first meal of the day. Jumbo Jack was actually good, seemed freshly made. Curly fries seemed  petrified, had to go back through drive to get my tacos that weren't put into my bag. So by that time they were cold. So disappointed! When you go all day working with no breaks and you're craving something, so dissappointing to waste $13 on a very sub par meal. I love Jack in the Box but now I'm  rethinking ever going back there."}
{"text":"We needed a place to get  a bite of lunch after viewing the Hoover Dam. I looked up a McDonald's and found one on the way back to Vegas BUT spotted this Jack in the Box on the way. I know it's weird but I wanted to go to one ever since I spotted a sign on the first day of our vacation.  There are no more of these in Florida that I am aware of nor any when we travel up the coast. We used to go frequently when I was a child and I have vivid memories of a \"clown\" taking your order when going through the drive-thru...my little brother would throw a conniption and demand to talk to the clown...annoying at the time but so cute in retrospect. :)  So yes, this visit was all about nostalgia and I wanted a chili dog as that is what I remember having but apparently my memory is faulty or they no longer have them. I chose a sourdough jack and it was quite tasty.   I think the good service we received and the nostalgia made me bump this up to 4 stars. That and the fact that the food at the Hoover Dam is way overpriced so this is a much better bet!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the staff is always friendly. I usually have a huge order, but they smile and joke around with me about it. My last order was 22 tacos and a shake. The food is always hot and never stale.   Thanks to the staff here!  They also have a military discount, so thank you to Jack for supporting the armed services. Active and retired."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food ! I understand that it's fast food, but even you expect a certain level of quality. This place had nothing going for it at all."}
{"text":"Just got off from a LONG day at work, I was hesitant to  come here and order but it was down the street from my house and I just wanted  to get something fast as i had not eaten all day...and i was ready to crawl into my bed.  When I pulled up to the drive through speaker,(11:42pm) there were probably a total of 4 cars in line. I ordered the new featured item (sourdough bacon ranch combo, small with a raspberry iced tea). When I was finished ordering, the lady working the drive-thru asked me to pull up to the first window, so I did, and I waited there for about 10 minutes for her to appear. She then repeated my order (which was correct ) and took my card. She then asked me to \"pull up to the pole with the red tape\",  but not pull up to the second window until she told me to do so.. which I thought was weird, but whatever. I then noticed, while I waited another 10 minutes, that she was having a difficult time with the car behind me in line. I figured I'd blow it off, we all have bad days..  When she finally appeared and asked me to pull forward, she asked me for sauces, handed me my order, and told me to have a good night.  Fast forward 10 minutes,  I get home to a cold sandwich, with jalapeños and some sort of spicy mayonnaise on it. I take medicine for severe acid reflux.  I am now more tierd, more irritated and STILL hungry because if I eat this sandwhich, I will be up all night with severe heartburn, so it's going in the trash.  Not happy with my experience at all..."}
{"text":"Garbage garbage garbage!!!!  Do not go here at all!  This place needs to fire and find new employees that want to work here.  They screwed up my order completely and had under cooked burgers. Health department should pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"I have a Jack in the Box walking distance from my house however I'd rather drive to the Jack on Estrella for better quality and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I had to wait over 20 minutes for my food their was only 3 other customers inside for dine in they messed up my order and would i asked claudia if she can fix it she didnt say anything she just grabbed the bag from hand and turned around and told the guy to make fries bcuz i didnt want curly fries which took another 6 minutes i will never come back here for her rude customer service if she hates her job so much she should quit i didnt like the fact that when i was also in there she was to busy talking bad about the customers"}
{"text":"We live around the corner and used to frequent this location since they are 24 hrs and 2 minutes away.  We gave them so many chances from missing items, incorrect orders, cold food and UNDERCOOKED food not to mention the staff is rude. STAY AWAY! Not worth the food poisoning."}
{"text":"I ordered my meal with no TOMATOES, got home and guess what....TOMATOES! The fries were old and cold too. Decided I was frustrated enough to go back and have the meal fixed.  Call the Health Department! The employee that assisted us when we returned has no business being in the food industry. He proceeded to touch prepped food in our bag without a glove. He acted as if he didn't believe us when we said the existing fries are old and cold. We asked for fresh fries, and we noticed he added brand new fries to a batch of noticeably old cold fry bin. He was called out on his shenanigans and proceeded to touch the new and o ld fries (that were being served to customers) with his ungloved hand stating look these are hot! I am completely disgusted and plan to follow up the review with a call to the store manager AND higher tomorrow! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I try not to eat fast food too often, but JiTB is on the way home so it often sneaks into my life.   Have always had good (drive-thru) service here. Stephanie is my girl! Always super nice."}
{"text":"I waited in line at the drive thru for 15 minutes. They gave me my messy shake with no straw, I asked for my sauce and they never gave it to me. By the time I got home my burger was cold."}
{"text":"Came here at midnight on a Monday. Wanted to grab some food before catching my flight back home. This place looks extremely sketchy on the outside. It is a far distance from the strip and looks like illegal transactions happen in the vicinity all the time. The inside was decent. I ordered the BBQ burger with two tacos. Everything was made fresh to order. It took a while to get my order but everything was hot when I received it."}
{"text":"Worst jack in he box ever. All my food was cold as well as I was given the wrong size drinks and no straws. Never going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Best egg rollls! The people who work here are really nice."}
{"text":"Go to the other Jack in the Box on Central Ave and Southern. Avoid this establishment like the plague.   I'm always burdened with cold fries (every time), usually the sandwiches are okay. But after they screwed me today, I will never return.   I simply ordered: 1 Sausage, egg & cheese on croissant,  1 Bacon, egg & cheese on biscuit, and 2 Hash Browns. (all on the menu).  When I got home I was infuriated. The sandwiches we're both missing cheese, but worse than that - the bacon was missing on that sandwich and the egg was missing on the sausage sandwich.   I mean come on WTF? Just a sausage patty in a croissant? Just an egg on a biscuit?   Thats the last time you screw me."}
{"text":"I ordered a plain chicken sandwich in drive thru and was told to pull forward.  I get to the window and the young girl in the window says \"uhhh, what do you mean by plain grilled chicken sandwich?\"   I should have known right at that moment to just drive away.  I should have continued on to my appointment, hungry and merely annoyed at the stupidity.  Instead, I explained, with hand gestures. Grilled chicken, between two slices of bread.  How can this be complicated!?  But it gets worse!   The poor girl had no idea how to ring this in.  She called over another young lady, who also could not figure out such a strange request.  Then a young man came over.  Finally, after another 5 minutes, the manager came over and pressed some buttons.  With triumph in her eyes, the first girl proudly told me a total of close to $8.  Huh? I added a drink, at the ridiculous price of around $2.50, Ok, got that.  Where's the rest coming from?  OH! I was charged for a chicken club, even though I wasn't getting bacon on it!  YAY me! Fine, I say.  I pay, more annoyed at myself than how I was overcharged and it took FOUR people to figure out the register and I drive away. But it gets WORSE! I pull out my grilled chicken between to grease covered slices of what can only be their sourdough bread and the \"chicken\" is black.  Not only is it an unnatural color for ANY cooked chicken, it's small.  Smaller than any fast food chicken I have ever seen.  I risked a bite.  I should have probably known just by the look - shoe leather! It could not have been any drier had it been the actual desert we live in! At this point, I would say that it gets worse, but it stays about the same.  I didnt eat the shoe leather they overcharged me for and did not have an opportunity to return it or call the store until the next morning.  When I called to speak to a manager, I was told there was none until 8 am.  From personal experience in fast food, I don't know when it is ever allowed to not have a person in charge on any shift.  I called another nearby location.  I wanted to know if my complaint would be even close to valid.  To verify:  There is ALWAYS supposed to be management at JITB, a club means with bacon, and hold times do exist on food they serve, as well as after 4pm, all grilled chicken is supposed to be cooked to order.  The wonderful lady that I spoke with at the other location was full of useful information and even offered to buy me breakfast to make up for the location on 59th ave.  I declined.  I think I am done with JITB for awhile.  I haven't had great experiences there lately.  But this happened to be absolutely crazy bad and I needed to share. I did do the survey that is on their receipts and I was contacted by their district manager.  I gave credit to the lady on Thunderbird, and they were friendly on 59th ave, but I was so done.   They offered my money back and coupons to go back to any JITB in the valley.  Like I said, I think after this, I am off JITB for awhile.  At least I am getting my money back."}
{"text":"Came here on sept 1st-2nd at midnight and I swear I've waiting about 5-7 minutes in the drive thru. Got up to the ordering screen and I waiting another maybe 5-6 minutes , the customer service here sucks ! The girl in the drive they cash just sucks . ANYWAYS got up to the window only to see these idiots PLAYING , I wonder why the fcking drive thru line was backed up! So I get to the window and the chick sees me pulling up and turn her back towards me while I wait for her to take my payment . Uhhh , dummy ! Learn how to do your job and stop playing ! Dumb kids ."}
{"text":"Today, my mother took my children to eat breakfast at this location. My 3 year old isn't feeling well & acted like a complete brat when she realized she wasn't getting a platter with 'waffles'. Had the nerve to have a real tantrum. The wonderful Edna took a moment to acknowledge my daughter & made her happy.  She didn't have to take that moment, but she did & I appreciate that. Great job Edna!"}
{"text":"Poor service... I ordered bacon and cheddar wedges and got some BS! And the manager said what you see is what you get..... Jerk!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh  I don't even know where to start.  My husband and I were driving home from CA and we decided to stop at Jack in the Box.  I love their tacos and have for years.  When we walked in we noticed a bicycle leaning against a table with shoe's on the floor and a shirt on the table.  The place also had a rancid smell but again I love their tacos so I was willing to over look these things.  I ordered my 2 tacos, fries and a drink.  My husband ordered a chicken sandwich, curly fries and a drink.  As we were heading to the drink dispenser we noticed a young man sleeping at one of the high top tables.  I went to get ice for my drink only to have no ice come out.  I asked the staff about the ice and they said \"oh we don't have any ice our machine is broken\".  They did not offer us our money back so no drinks with our meals.  We got our food and the young man was still sleeping at the table.  Not one of the 3 Jack in the Box employees said anything to him.  By this point my husband and I are starting to get a little freaked out.  Then someone walked in and started pushing in all of the chairs and cleaning the messes off of the table.  I just assumed he worked there but he didn't.  As soon as my husband saw that behavior he said let's just go.  As we were leaving some Jack in the Box employee tried waking up the kid next to the beverage area and after a few minutes he woke up.  I was getting ready to call 911 because I thought he might be dead.  We didn't finish our meals just left.  My husband told me that the customers were tweeking (on drugs).  It was the worst experience I have ever had a Jack in the Box and I have been a fan since 1975.  I will never walk into or eat at a Jack in the Box again and I strongly everyone to avoid this Jack in the Box in participial."}
{"text":"I always come to Jack in the Box for their relatively low prices and wide variety on their menu (plus the fact that they serve breakfast all day)! My experience today was pretty standard: I waited only a short time in the drive-thru (about 3 minutes) but right before I pulled out of the parking lot, I noticed that they had forgotten part of my order. I had to run back in to retrieve my hash browns, which they handed to me without apologizing. However, my food was warm and fresh (I'll definitely be ordering the mini pancakes again). Be mindful of your surroundings when visiting this location--lots of homeless people who look like they are cranked up on drugs, plus the parking lot feels a little cramped."}
{"text":"Ugh, i have had good experiences here, but just went had to repeat my order 4 times, everything was on the receipt, but they forgot my fries, tacos were messy, cheesburger suppose to be plain loaded up with mustard, the only reason i give this a star was the girl in the drive thru was hot, wont come back here unless im starving, sorry jack this location not living up to par"}
{"text":"Weekend/weekday late night! Don't usually write reviews for fast food places but these two ladies who run the place at night never disappoint! Speedy service with a smile! Compared to other locations i feel they do an amazing job dealing with the late night crowd!  If you live in the area, DO NOT GO TO 83 AVE AND DEER VALLEY LOCATION... \"systems are down\" \"fryers are down\"  good luck getting what you want in the a.m. just pulling up you see the staff out for a \"smoke break\""}
{"text":"I live a mile away. I work a busy late schedule. I have been here numerous times to be refused service...  Their computer systems seem to be down nearly every time I come to the drive-thru. If it's not the system then it's their fryers.  Pulling up to the location you can see 2-3 employees outside on a \"break\". And of course they have all these \"issues\". They say it will be an hour for the systems to be up...its OK I'll pay cash, No can do! Can I get some fries? No, we are servicing the fryers.  I'm pretty sure whether you are servicing/cleaning/changing the oil, you do 1 at a time and leave the other 3-4 fryers fuctional???  It's not everytime, I know when I see a guy with a beard working its 5 stars...the others...well the others I guess need to do their job...I end up driving to 59th Ave and 101 location to get my food fast with no problem!  I hope the owners can take a look into this to keep their business going most nights, multiple cars going through the drive thru just to be told they can't get food."}
{"text":"Wow!! I've been to this Jack-in-the-Box so many times because I go there for my break. And every time I go there the food is so fresh and so delicious. And also the staff is very friendly and pictures to ask if I need condiments every time. I love this place I'm actually surprised at the reviews."}
{"text":"This might be a tad embarrassing, but I visit this Jack in the Box almost religiously. It's right on the south side of the bar district in Tempe and nothing sounds better at three in the morning on a Saturday than 50 Jack in the Box tacos, right?   Cheers to the workers here who deal with the stumbling horde of Sun Devils that must wreak havoc on this establishment weekly. Y'all are the real MVPs."}
{"text":"Their oil for deep frying is incredibly dirty. Everything tastes horrible. Also, don't you think napkins would be nice in the drive-through bag that they give you?"}
{"text":"Just got home and while in drive through, person taking order was polite.she dropped some of my change,but never acknowledged it.i asked for catsup and ranch, I got one ranch and no catsup!food was of normal quality."}
{"text":"I had such a long terrible day and my husband and I went to the frys right next to it to get groceries for the weekend and it was 8:30 at night and had no patience to cook so we swung by the jack in the box for a late night dinner, got my order, and went home. I didn't eat until an hour after we ordered because I had to put the groceries away and put my son to bed. By the time I finally got around to eating, I noticed that my whole order was wrong. I tried calling them but no answer. There are few things more aggravating than getting home and finding out that your order is wrong and inedible."}
{"text":"See photo of supposed \"half-sy fries\". I mean, c'mon JITB. Even I could guess-timate what 50/50 looks like."}
{"text":"So the sign on the door says it opens at 5 a.m. At 5;05, the door is locked and the one visible employee looks at me, waiting outside, and scurries in back. Bear in mind that I'm dressed for my white-collar job, so I don't look like I'm going to rob the place or like I've been up all night to get lucky.  I call and ask whether the sign is wrong. Gal doesn't know: they'll open in 10 or 15 minutes, maybe. No guarantees. She refuses to give a reason why they can't open on time or why the sign would be wrong.  So the serious plan was to leave a customer standing outside the restaurant for half an hour past the posted opening. Because when you want fast food, an extra 30 minutes is nothing."}
{"text":"First review of 2015! The following review is what happens when you say you're gonna wait and not eat any junk until Super Bowl Sunday, and then you...don't. So out of total boredom, on my iPad I play this game called Jelly Splash. Now to get extra coins you have to sit through come type of Ad for like 30 seconds. One day, up pops a Jack in the Box commercial on there advertising that $4.99 Chipotle Chicken Club Combo.  Heading home on a Saturday I say \"Hey, let me try that new Chipotle Chicken Club.\" Pull up to place my order and the $4.99 CCC combo is displayed right above the speaker.  I tell the girl what i wanted and proceeded to the window. Now I knew it was going to be a mess when it took a while for someone to come to the window. Saw some guy fooling around with the soda machine. I pay for my stuff, and then the drive-thru girl waits a good 3 minutes for the guy to finish messing with the machine.  After the 3 minutes, she's like \"Well, our machine is broken would you like some orange juice or apple juice?\" I'm thinking who in the hell-o, is going to drink some dang apple or orange juice with a chicken sandwich? I kindly just say \"No\".  She sits there a sec like she's stunned that I declined the orange juice. She says \"Ok, one second.\"  Another girl comes to the window and says, \"Our soda machine isn't working at the moment, would you like an orange juice or apple juice?\" I say \"Nooooo\" all the while thinking, if I didn't want any juice when the 1st girl asked me, why would I want it from you? She then says, \"Or you can just get a refund.\" *sigh* I say \"I'll just take the refund.\" Right after I said that, the machine starts working. While one girl gets my soda, I look at my receipt and ask the other girl, \"Why does your ad say $4.99 for the CCC combo, but I got charged $5.29?\" The girl says \"You were charged $5.29.\" I'm thinking, WELL DUH DUMMY! Anyway, I just take my stuff and drive off b/c I'm not about to get mad over that extra bit of change, but when you advertise something and then there's a picture stating the price, you'd think they'd charge you, I don't know, the PRICE ADVERTISED.  Get home to eat my food. I'll never understand why people put warm food on a cold bun. The sandwhich was blah and had to warm it up in the microwave when i got to my apt (which is 2mins away), the fries were borderline cool.  That JITB doesn't have to worrying going there again.  Moral of the story, I should've just waited til SuperBowl Sunday."}
{"text":"This location was small and not busy at all. The staff was friendly and helpful. Food was good and fresh, only issue was the restroom was kind of scary."}
{"text":"My friend and I went through the Drive-Thur for a quick breakfast this morning. We were both hungry, but we didn't feel like going to sit down at a fancy restaurant. We definitely didn't want any McDonald's, so we decided to grab a couple meals from this place. I guess bad decisions can happen early in the morning.  When we pulled up, we were promptly greeted and then asked to order. I inquired about the difference between a few breakfast sandwiches. The person that was taking my order, kindly gave me a brief description of each I had inquired about.  I decided to order the Ultimate breakfast MEAL because it was only slightly higher in price but I got twice the meat, eggs and cheese. I also ordered the Breakfast Platter with Bacon.  Once I finished ordering, I noticed that she had only rung up the platter, so I mentioned the breakfast sandwich combo. The lady quickly cut me off and confirmed that she heard my order correctly, although it wasn't listed on the monitor correctly. She told me to pull around for the total.  When I pulled around to the window, the lady didn't repeat my order, I just handed her my debit card, under the impression that everything was correct. That was probably my biggest mistake. When she passed out my card and receipt, I looked at it and I was charged for an Orange Juice and the Breakfast Platter, no Ultimate Combo.  The lady at the window, came back and passed me my bag of food and yep, no Combo. She then actually asked me if I wanted the Ultimate combo or not. I told her that yes, I wanted the Combo and not just an O.J.  She apologized for the mistake and yelled to the back, I guess to the manager, that she was just going to charge me for the Breakfast Sandwich because I had already paid for the O.J. She then relayed the message to me. I passed her my card and she charged me the price of the sandwich. I believe the price was around the same, maybe slightly higher, so I didn't complain.  I thought everything was ok, but I check my bag and I didn't have the Hash Brown, which happens to be my favorite part of breakfast. I quickly brought it to her attention and she told me that I didn't pay for a Hash Brown because I didn't get the meal. She said, \"I charged you for the O.J and the sandwich, not the Hash Brown.\"  I educated her one the fact that the meal is actually what I ordered and that I had technically paid the price of the meal or maybe more. She then closed the window and then came back after a few seconds with an O.J and Hash Brown. She said that it will be another $2 for the O.J. I was like, \"I already paid for my O.J.\" She then said, \"I'm going to give you the Hash Brown, but you have to pay for the O.J.\"  I once again told her that I didn't want another O.J and she just awkwardly smiled and yelled to the back once again, that I didn't want the O.J. She gave me the Hash Brown and apologized again for the confusion. I then pulled off.  Stupid me got half way down the street and realized, although the lady and someone else that came to the window, asked me if I wanted Ketchup, they didn't put any in the bag. They didn't put Ketchup, Jelly, or Salt and Pepper for the nasty eggs, in the bag.  I didn't even worry about going back, because I knew it would have probably taken just as long to get the condiment order right. I still cant get over how she cut me off to confirm that she had heard me but then she screwed it all up. Not to mention, the food was horrible and the sandwich didn't have everything all that she had originally told me it did.  I wont be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Just downgraded it to one star. There is always some kind of issue I have with this location. I ask for ketchup but don't get any or I ask for two sweet and sour sauce and get only one. Today the diet coke tastes like they dumped cheap cologne into it. Gross! I need to stop coming here just because it's close to work. Stay away."}
{"text":"Service is always horrible around 3am but this last time I went and opend my jumbo jack there was a penny inside the box and it's not like if I can just take my food back and complain since it's always the same guy there I've never gone to a jack in the box where I already expected the service to be lousy I really want to speak to someone about that penny in the box that's unsanitary and really uncalled for I wish there was a negative stars on here"}
{"text":"If only there was a ZERO stars....I paid $3.24 for this crap that THEY call onion rings?! Are you freaking serious!!? I should've went to Sonic, I know better than this..."}
{"text":"This jack in the box always messes up a simple order of putting cheese on sandwiches that you ask for no cheese.. A few times I have ordered a breakfast platter and they ask just sausage or bacon or both? I simple say both.. And they don't put any bacon in the platter.. The food is great the service is horrible .. It was funny I called it out to myself that my order was going to be messed up because the person taking my order was laughing before she said welcome to jack in the box would you like to try the breakfast burrito.. This store gets 2 stars for service and 10 for good food! Just make sure you check what's in your bag before you go home !!!!!"}
{"text":"I love jack in the box and I can't really think if a bad experience except for tonight. Waited for 15 mins to get our food through the drive through and no one was in front or behind us. I asked what was on the buttery jack burger and he took about 5 mins to answer and then said tomato and lettuce. When we got home my burger had some weird sauce on the it that smelled weird. The lettuce was gross and there wasn't very much of it. The burger it's self was just gross. The frys weren't salted. And over all it was the worst fast food I have had in a while. I'll go back but not to this Jack in the box."}
{"text":"this place puts the dick in ridiculous. has to be managed and owned by some buffoon as this place has been consistently horrible for 10 years. on Friday 3.18.16 at 6 pm they were out of rice. then took them 15 min to make one salad and then they asked me to pull up front to wait for the other salad. no apologies. disrespectful, rude, mentally questionable, slow, etc. list goes on. the only reason the place makes any money is the location. and people support increase in minimum wage for fast food service? haaa how about performance based increase and we reduce wages for jack in the box employees?  I beg you corporate jack in the box shut this place down!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Clean restaurant. My husband and I went here at 930pm (they close at 11) and it was naturally dead. Being from Chicago and not frequenting the West very often, this was a treat. As good as I remember. The closest Jack In the Box location to us is 4 hrs south :(. Great food."}
{"text":"I am giving this place high marks for the staff, everything else is on par for a fast food buger joint but guy who always works the window when i get off work (I think his name is Nicholas...cause that is what is on my receipt) is always fast, friendly and clean"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, cold food and a crappy manger!!! Waited over 20 minutes for 2 burgers and then watched them go out to a car in drive thru.. manger told us we need to understand !!! No you need to get your stuff together!!!"}
{"text":"Only got peppermint shakes. If you got past the whipped cream you where in for a surprise. The flavoring tastes like chemicals. Never go to jack in the box for peppermint shakes. Just drive your self to chik-fil-a."}
{"text":"Super Service!! Sebastian  greeted us immediately :). FAST, FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT Customer Service. Sweeeeeeeeet!!    Just when you think most fast food places could care less about their customers or their jobs for that matter, you have a hands on manager like Mason running a GREAT crew. He was hands on completing orders also. :)  Our drink choice- The fruity excellence of Jumping Jack Flash (don't  even wanna know the sugars on this one) was unavailable  out in the lobby area so it cost em a star. :(  The guys did fill it behind the counter for us which was much appreciated. Overall 5 star service.  Great location if you are looking for a good Jack in the Box!! :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"On almost every other visit you play the lottery with this location. Today it especially was one of the worst. Ordered hamburger got a breakfast sandwich. Asked if I wanted curly fries got hash browns. Tried to call restaurant to exchange order. Phone not working. Corporate should take  this franchise away. More mistakes than orders correct. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"So much for fast food. This place is usually fast in getting the food out, but lately the service has slowed. Not sure what is going on. Quality is right where it should be for a Jack in the Box except for the times when they screw up an order which does not happen too often."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times and each time my order has not only been incorrect but it has also been poorly cooked. Today will be my last and final time visiting this location. My fries today were so over fried, stale and cold.  A big no no"}
{"text":"Every time we go through the drive through they ask us to drive back a couple feet so we can't see the window until they have our order ready. That's insanely sketchy to me."}
{"text":"Rude service. 1230a saturday 10.24.15. Didn't say \"hi\" at drive thru...said \"what do you want?\"...seriously, thats the first thing she said when we pulled up.  So I ordered - politely- and when we pulled up to the window she didn't say a word..just took my card then gave my food...no \"hello\"..no \"your total is $xxxx\"...no \"thank you\"...no \"have a good night\"...nothing...just handed over the bag and turned around and went about her business. I never complain, but this was ridiculous. Who owns this joint? If you are the owner, get your butt out of bed and go thru the drive thru and see what kind of service we really get."}
{"text":"This place is the best place to eat If u like fast food and u get it really fast they make everything fast and furious and good."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place we don't have any in Florida. My thoughts is jack can stay I the box. It only got a star cause you have to do something. The food was awful, nasty just no!!"}
{"text":"I work nights and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat so I headed to the Durango/flamingo location. I pulled through the drive thru and was told that their system was down and they could not do ANY transactions. I decided that I could try another location slightly further from my location and I ended up at the tropicana location. I again tried the drive thru. I placed my order and right before I was given my total the cashier told me that the soda machine was down and I would be unable to get the drink I ordered. My options were tea, water, or orange juice. Not what a night shift worker is looking for. I chose orange juice and was told it would be an additional charge for the upgrade but they would be kind and drop that charge. Kind? It wasn't my choice to upgrade my drink! You guys didn't have the drink I wanted and gave me three pitiful options, I shouldn't be charged!  Overall it was a horrible experience at both locations and jack in the box has really got a lot to do to get my business back."}
{"text":"I work nights and got off work late. I was tired and physically exhausted. All I wanted was a hot meal and my bed. I had never had Jack in the Box before and given it's the only fast food place really open on my drive home I decided it was time to give it a try.   I used the drive thru which had about three other cars in it. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich meal and substituted curly fries. I was pleasantly surprised with the quickness of the drive thru as I was to the window in no time. I quickly received my food and was back on the road in no time.  When I got home I dove into my meal. The sandwich was made fresh so the chicken was still steaming hot but extremely tasty. I was excited for the curly fries as I have always been a fan of Arby's curly fries. Well to my surprise these were the same if not better (recommended). After finishing my meal I was pleased with the amount and the price as well as the taste of the products. I wish I had tried it sooner. Really a good place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"The food's not bad...typical Jack in the Box, but the drive thru service at this location is HORRIBLE, and the employees are the rudest I've met at any fast food joint. 9 out of 10 times you'll be asked to \"pull up front so they can bring it out to you\", even if there's no cars behind you. Then you get to sit and wait until one of them feels like walking out to your car. Maybe I'm getting old, but isn't a \"Drive Thru\" supposed to prevent  finding a parking spot and sitting and waiting idea? DON'T go here if you're in a hurry, or looking for friendly service."}
{"text":"It's a Jack in the Box. You know what you're getting here.   I end up at this one when I need something quick and the drive thru line at the Chick Fil A is too long.   When you pull up, you'll see two menu boards. You'll order at the second. Don't be the guy who is shouting at the first one (actually do, because I always take videos of these people).   Service doesn't take too long (even when there's a line), workers are usually nice. I don't do fast food often, but this is an option that's easy to get in and back on your way pretty quickly.   Oh, and I always get a burger of some sort and tacos. Go ahead and judge away."}
{"text":"11/20/16 @3:17am - just went through the drive thru, 3rd car in the line. Apparently \"the system is down\" so we cannot order any food. We continue through and lo and behold, two employees sitting at a table eating, one of them being the one with the drive thru mic on his head.   I was tempted to take a picture of them but to the peruse of my wife, did not.  What good is 24-hour fast food when it's not really 24-hour? We ended up going to the gas station next door. During this 15 minute time period, we observed 6 cars going straight through the drive thru as well... Turn your lights off or something, geez."}
{"text":"Will not come here at midnight. Not the best customer service. Drive thru guy said thank you for choosing jack can you hold and left not giving us a chance to say yes or no problem. Choose jack over in & out i regreat my choose as i still had to wait in line for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"No terrayaki bowl because they are out of rice.  I order tacos.  Bite into taco and choke because plastic shreds are in it.  Called to.speak to manager but of course not in til morning. Complaint board on website of course is not functional. Last trip to Jacks."}
{"text":"Prompt, efficient and friendly service. Much better than average JIB. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Guy in drive thru has Indian accent from hell and they don't carry ranch. This Jack sucks."}
{"text":"How come management isn't going anything to improve the horrible customer service at this place?"}
{"text":"Sitting at this jack in the box drive thru as I write this review and seriously has to be the worst one! I love jack so I go to different locations but I have a 30 minute lunch and the sense of urgency to help customers is horrific! Last time going to this location because it has not been my first time having to wait this unexplained amount of time, I don't know who is the manager or running this place but clearly needs to be taken down and build another franchise"}
{"text":"Got the breakfast burrito it was good made fresh and I mean it's Jack in the Box what do you want? Fast food that is pretty good for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is such a cool design/location... It is under a huge building and has a drive thru... I don't think there are any other Jack's that are like it...  It has all the same food as all the other locations but I just love the layout  Service is good here"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. I went in on my lunch break, which I had 30 minutes which I thought would be enough time to order and eat FAST FOOD! But as me and my co workers got there we waited 10 minutes to order so once my two co workers ordered it was my turn and the cashier just walks away. 15 minutes later I finally order my food. Then I realize I have 5 more minutes to get back to work so I ask for my money back and they have the audacity to ask for my drink back. They were super rude and spoke to eachother in Spanish about me WHICH I UNDERSTOOD! If I didn't have to rush back to work I would have created chaos. But instead I left hungry and unhappy. FUCK THIS PLACE NO WONDER YOU HAVE 2 stars. Smh."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here. Even if it down the street where I work. Every time I go in I get treated like I'm not even there. Personal conversations and people in plain clothes walking around where the food food is being prepared just doesn't seem right."}
{"text":"Manager needs to care more or fired. This place is disgusting and dirty. No Air condition inside. Place is filthy. I will be avoiding this place for now on."}
{"text":"We went late at night and went through the drive thru. We kept saying we wanted 2 regular fries and 1 curly fries. The girl kept getting our order wrong after repeating it for 3 times. She was giving attitude to top it off so My boyfriend repeated his order ONE MORE time and said, \"6 tacos 2 French fries and 1 curly bro.\" The employee said,\" I'm not a bro.\" He repeated his order one more time and she told us,\" I'm not a bro. How about you just don't get your order. You can leave.\" She declined taking our order once more. It was impossible for us to leave when there was several cars in front of us and 2 more behind us. My boyfriend got off and asked the car behind him if he can reverse for him to leave. As we were reversing the guy honked at us and got mad and left as well. This was the worse experience ever. Never going back again. I get that you hate your job but you don't need to show it to customers. If I could give this place no stars, I wouldn't give any. I was going to call customer service but refused to. Just know that girl treated us like shit."}
{"text":"I go to this location when I don't want to wait in line, however, it's a rarity when they actually get my order right. They NEVER answer the phone AT ALL 24/7. They DO NOT GIVE OUT HAPPY MEAL TOYS and if you question them on it they get petty and pissy about it.   They need to change out the soda more often because it often tastes terrible and if you had one back and say fix it, I'm sure it causes some sort of PMS trigger because they bitch.   They made me late for work more than once when I was the only car at the drive thru. Lazy and apathetic."}
{"text":"it's been almost 6mo since i visited this location, and it may be another 6mo before i visit again. i understand that using the drive-thru can be convenient sometimes, but i advise NOT to do so at this location. 6mo ago i'll take the blame for not checking my order thoroughly (as they had given the bag w/6 tacos to another car), but this time it was their fault, completely. i ordered two 'sourdough jacks' no mayo, add lettuce AND extra lettuce! what i unwrapped at home; both 'sourdough jacks' had EXTRA MAYO, NO lettuce (that they had charged me extra for btw), and NO tomato! what a joke! and then when i called them to complain, they didn't answer their phone until two hours later. and the woman whom i finally talked with told me to bring back the two burgers and she would replace them w/the correct order. (too late, my two dogs had already eaten them, and i had a healthier dinner, cold cereal... *i hate mayo) btw: my receipt stated my correct order, why the person preparing the food decided to create his/her own order is beyond me...  Jack, you stink!!!"}
{"text":"Late night run... Service was good, wait time was good.   Food was as expected for Jack.  Here is the thing that bothers me.  Eating the sourdough jack that is not cheap, I bite into a hard piece.  I can't chew it and I look at it to see this nasty green tomato.  I took it off my burger.  The tomato is the thing that ties all the ingredients together on this burger.    This really annoys me because the employee who made this clearly sees the nasty green and continues to give it to me just to give the dog her food and get her gone. Very offensive!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the prices are cheap. Just make sure you check your bag before you leave the store or the drive thru. I go here all the time and about half of the time they don't give me everything I ordered.   They're normally happy to get you everything once you point it out to them though. If you order one combo meal and don't ask for anything special like no ice in your drink or no pickles on your burger or an extra hash brown you'll probably get everything. But ordering it your way most likely will lead to it being done the wrong way until you ask to have it fixed.   The 2 tacos for a buck is always good and they always have a promo menu item that is normally very good as well."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat Jack in the box but I decided to get some since it was on my way home. I made sure they had my order right. But some how when I got home I notice they some how mange to get it wrong. It was pretty upsetting and to add to it all the curly fries they gave us look old and it seem like they where just crumbs. I don't think I will be going back to Jack in the box."}
{"text":"OK this is strictly on the eggrolls....I am a chinese food connoisseur and ill be damned if this place doesn't have egg rolls that are better then 75% of chinese restaurants out there. I mean who wouldn't be down for some late night munching at JITB for some awesome egg rolls?  Nice job jack ! :)"}
{"text":"Usually the burgers are pretty good. Today just want that day. I always get a jumbo jack and tonight it mediocre. I always open up the burgers to fix them only because they always put them together sloppy (and this is everywhere not just jack). I was surprised when I opened it, there was a very ugly looking piece of tomato, cheese hanging off of the burger and only 1 pickle. Before I put it in my mouth I knew it wasn't going to be that great. But a burgers a burger. I only ate until I got to the 1 pickle in the middle and threw the rest away. I had also ordered some tacos. 1 was good and the other had no cheese, which I have no idea why. The cheese takes away the taco meat taste and that second taco didnt even make it half way. I won't be having jack in the box for a while."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I honestly wanted some in&out, but for some reason it was closed. So I got me jack in the box instead and I really like Jack in the box. I should have just got home hungry. I always get a jumbo jack, but this jumbo jack was like no other. The burger was soggy and I could not finish it. I had to throw it away. Not even my tacos felt like they were cooked right. I was over it once I pulled out the burger out of the bag, as soon as I felt like it was squished and soggy."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  No other way to say it. Even for fast food it's appalling. Nobody ever seems to actually be working the front register they float between the drive thru and dining room. Which means I wait twice as long when I eat in."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Orders always correct. Best JITB I have visited"}
{"text":"I came in around 235am and ordered a grilled cheese stacked burger munchie meal. When I pulled up to the window I heard them laughing and making fun of me because they had messed up my order. I questioned the guy at the window about it and he claimed they were just laughing about something else. When i got home I started to eat the sandwich and instead of it being a grilled cheeseburger they ended up loading it up with a bunch of eggs. I called them back and let them know they messed up the order and the guy told me that the chart they go by looks like it had eggs... in a grilled cheeseburger and then told me I had to drive all the way back to get my refund and gave me attitude and said he was going to hang up the phone with me and that i could get a refund tomorrow from someone else. So I drove back to talk to them and he asked me for my receipt. The one they never gave me. And then asked for my card. They swiped it on the terminal and then he handed me the card and closed the window without saying anything. So I waited and waited.. and then he comes back to the window and rudely says is there anything else I can help you with. So I said to him.. You took my card and gave it back. Didn't say anything to me so this whole time I've been waiting to find out what's going on and if you processed the refund. He rudely said back to me.. I gave you your card back now didn't i?? And so after that I asked him for a copy of my receipt to ensure I got my refund back and he rudely said no that's our copy you can just check your bank statement if you want a receipt and then threatened to call the cops because the fact i had asked for a reciept??? This is the most horrible customer service I've ever been provided. I'm contacting corporate when they open in the am. I can't believe this. They messed up my order. Made fun of me while I was in the drive through and could hear everything they were saying and then had the audacity to threaten to call the cops on me because I asked for a reciept for proof that they had returned my transaction?? Worst jack in the box ever. If you dont want your order to get messed up and for the employees to be rude and harass you.. then don't come here. I'm filing a complaint with the the better business bureau tomorrow and to their corporate office."}
{"text":"I don't want to talk about the food today but more so what food-service workers have to deal with on a daily basis. If you have never worked in the food industry you should not be allowed to make comments from an area of ignorance. Jen and I had ordered and while waiting for our food an older guy was ordering. He had his order written down and was rattling it off like he was an auctioneer.  The young man taking the order was patient, professional, and kept his composure all the while taking condescending chastising remarks from a total jerking a customer. I don't care who you are or what you have been through in life it doesn't give you the right to belittle people. The worst part being the employee did everything right.   When the old guy finished ordering he looked at us and said ,\"good luck\".  I told him we had no issues. When our food came up I handed the kid two VIP movie passes and Jen told him, \"that's for having to deal with that asshole\".  I also called a few minutes later and advised the shift leader of how awesome the kid was who handled that very difficult and rude customer. I hope after being talked to so rudely the employee will at least have a smile on his face and a good story to tell.   I encourage everyone to speak up or stand up for those who cannot in every situation where there is someone who cannot defend themselves. I for one vowed to never hold my tongue again and surely will not be as nice about someone being a jerk. And everything we ordered was great."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru. the lady on the mic was either washing dishes or standing by the dish washing sink.  I could hear the sink and running water in the background.  I could also hear several employees talking about this and that in the background.  I could hear them joking and the lady I was talking with joking and laughing with.  I had to give my order FOUR times and they still did not have it correct.  I finally got fed up and decided the order was close enough and I was sick of repeating myself.  It was so bad that at one point I said \"I do not not know what you are doing in there but it would be nice if you were paying attention to me.\"  All this did was make her put me on mute.  I still had to repeat my order after this."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location several times before with nothing to write about. Just the usual poor attitude and lack of enthusiasm (kinda get the feeling that I'm burdening them for making them uhh..... work). This visit I was shocked at the service today, there was none. Both doors were locked. When someone finally saw me standing out in the cold, the waved their hand across their neck saying \"drive thru only.\"  I'm a medic and work on an ambulance. I can't take that in the drive thru. Now why was your dining room and doors closed on a Saturday evening? No signs or explanation given. Poor service. I would not give any stars if I had the option. Great job Jack in the Crack, You lost a customer. I'm never giving money to this location again."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!! Sat in the drive thru for 10 mins and I got no greet or hello yes the mic is working I just don't give a shit.... when I pulled up to the window the female that was taking orders had earbuds in her ears was not taking orders... obviously no good management for that establishment."}
{"text":"Wow really that's a medium garlic Chiluba French fry! Thanks ! Looks like someone ate the other half!"}
{"text":"So this is a chain in a gas station location.  Taking that into consideration the service was decent and the place smelled freshly mopped, with bleach.  Got the sausage breakfast burrito and it left me sad and wantingso much more in the flavour department.  They need to bring back the bacon jalapeño burrito.  Very clean for a Jack in the Box though and the counter person was nice and actually didn't cut me off to take the drive through order, which really ticks me off. they deserve half a star more for that :)"}
{"text":"It's 106 degrees outside and 90 plus inside the restaurant !!! Asked if the AC was on. Oh yes she would check??  It's 90 plus. AC is not working!!! Daaahh"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm actually a fan of Jack's. I had never been to this location before a couple months ago but I usually get good food and service at the other Jack's I have been to.  My mother is in a rehab center near this Jack-in-the-Box so I have stopped in about six times in the last two months.  Of the six recent visits, there was a problem on three of visits. Twice I ordered curly fries and received cold fries that had been sitting around. Once I ordered a sausage Breakfast Jack and they gave me a ham Breakfast Jack. If you're gonna charge $3.19 for a medium curly fries, they better be hot!   The worst thing about this location is they always have a group of folks loitering in and around the store."}
{"text":"Good food, fast and pretty decent price."}
{"text":"I went to Jack In The Box today and got a Chicken Pita at around 4:30. First off, the young man taking the order was acting like an idiot with a stupid accent. When I got to the window, he and another male worker were acting so immature that I wondered if a manger was even there. I got my food, drove to a shady spot to eat. Got my pita out and the pita was completely ripped in numerous places, the lettuce was so soggy, I had to take it out and they did not put any salsa in. I was going to go in and complain, however, I was afraid too because with the behavior of the teen boys working, I felt a manger was not there and I didn't want them to do something to my food. So I threw it away and just decided to never go back. Sad! This Jack In The Box use to be really nice! No more! Pic of receipt."}
{"text":"Jack in the Box like most fast food restaurant seem to be hit or miss. All while being completely random when that is.   Some days, very same jack in the box food can be good. With great service.  On other dayss, at the very same jack in the box the food can be nasty and service down right horrible.  Simply put it's a gamble whenever you go.   This one is no different.  On some days my order is perfect.  Other days, I cant help but wonder if the food I was given had been sitting in the trash bin and it was served up to me.  Service years actually mostly good. That is always a plus. Getting in and out of the drive through is painless and they always have great shakes.   Seen that things are always random,  you're pretty much going to be gambling when food and service is good and when it not. So you are on your own."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times. Pn a few occasions the forget to put something that I ordered into the bag. So I've learned to check my bag before I leave. Over that's really only a minor inconvenience most days that it happens.   However, they will ask you to donate money two different causes. Don't get me wrong, the causes they're asking for money for art good causes. However,  asking for me to donate money while I'm at the window trying to get my order is just like a panhandler who has approach me and asking me for spare change. It's ais annoying as hell and extremely rude.   If I wanted to donate money, I will seek out the people I want to donate money to. I don't need the store employees begging me for money. So I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's jack in the box but those shakes 10/10! We come here pretty much just for the shakes."}
{"text":"I asked for 3 ranch and the worker gave me 4. Extremely happy. Very happy. I mean 4 ranch. Cmon now. I'm So happy"}
{"text":"I should go through a psychological evaluation because I keep going back, while expecting a different result. The last three times, my order has been incorrect. I knew it would be wrong this time because the guy repeated the order wrong twice. I corrected him, still screwed. I dont have time to rifle through the whole order while sitting in the drive through. I pay for it to be right, so I expect some freakin quality control. You want $15 an hour? Learn to differentiate between chicken and beef. Start small."}
{"text":"Hit or miss with customer service... but they always seem to be open when I need them and that makes my heart happy (and coming back for more)"}
{"text":"Was in a hurry, so decided drive-through breakfast was better than none. Well, they taught me something! There is something worse than not having breakfast at all. It's paying for breakfast then finding so many egg shells in it that it's inedible. Of course, since I was driving from one gig to another, I was clear across town and couldn't exactly turn back. I figured the manager should know that her or his cook stinks and needs to learn how to crack an egg. I called the restaurant and told the manager that I had to throw away my breakfast because there were so many egg shells in it. Her reply was, \"Thanks for letting me know.\" End of conversation. No I'm sorry, no hey let's send you a coupon or rectify this in some way. Nope. So now I'm doing the 30 question survey in hopes that corporate will reply."}
{"text":"Normally I roll by here late night for a quick bite and have no issues.  This morning at about 4:45 am I rolled by the drive through and they were closed.  The sign on the window says they are open 24 hours, but from what i experienced today, I guess not.  The female on the drive through intercom said they were closed.  I've never had issues like this here before.    Maybe I should call the 1-800-955-JACK number to confirm the hours of operation?"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I have been to some pretty seedy fast food joints in my day... but I think this JITB takes the cake..  Yeah, I get that you are busy because all of the drunken ASU students romp through here each night... but how hard is it to sweep the floor, wipe the tables or clean the bathroom? Ewwwwwww!!!!  Next... you were not busy, at all,  yet it took five minutes for someone to come take my order... and I was not so nicely informed that for some ungodly known reason you were no longer serving milkshakes at 855pm at night.. but you could serve me a smoothie. Ummmmm... does this make sense? Noooo.... and to add insult to injury, it took seven minutes to make the damn thing. (I know because I timed it)  BTW... don't waste your $2.79 on the pomegranate smoothie. It SUCKS.   And the worst part of all? It is impossible to go to this JITB without being accosted by the homeless hippies.   Unfortunately this filth infested, artery-clogging, non-milkshake-serving-after-some-undisclosed-time establishment will continue to flourish because it is in a good location and drunk people need their tacos."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered one #11. Ordered another #11 and she replied with \"Yeah, I know\" with an attitude not knowing I'm trying to order TWO #11's. Got my food and the buns were stale, burnt, and cold. Chicken patty felt as if it was sitting there for hours. They forgot to add bacon to one sandwich. Must of been that it was a holiday but don't take your frustration of working a holiday on the customers."}
{"text":"Now it probably seems strange to be giving a fast food joint a 4 star review.. and I'll admit they aren't my first choice other than on special occasions... but that being said, this particular Jack in the Box has ALWAYS been spotlessly clean when I've visited it, the various staff members polite, courteous and efficient and the food cooked to fast food perfection - so if you need a drive through / something fast, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This jack in the box is garbage. I have been here three times and they have never gotten my order correct. Tonight I ordered 4 tacos with my order and they charged me for them but forgot to put them in the bag. It's my fault for not double checking clearly. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"12/22/2017 6:15:41 AM  Drive Thru #131 JIB# 7201 Emp Jorge  I ordered a Country Scrambler Breakfast. My food was cold. My eggs were raw, not fully cooked. I was given a sausage patty, instead of sausage link, and was not informed of the substitute. The potatoes were wet and mushy. I was very dissatisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"Wow... I love jack in the box, but my mom and I went through the drive through this morning and we had a pretty short and simple order... When we drove up to the window, no one was there. And not only that, but there was a girl towards the back who was on her phone. She didn't tell us our total, just took our card and didn't even give us our receipt. Again, its a relatively simple order and yet they took a solid fifteen minutes to complete it. They had us pull up around the corner to give us our order. The same girl came up WITH her phone in hand not to mention there weren't even napkins in the bag. It did not look good for the place. This is not the first time we've had such bad service here. If it weren't my love for the tacos and the convenience of the location I wouldn't come back. Please, Jack In The Box, work on your customer service and your workers' phones being out. Much thanks from a loyal customer."}
{"text":"The manager is always in a great mood, food is good and place is ok, what makes a great visit is people and Kai and his employees always make me feel welcome and appreciated"}
{"text":"This place is the worst Jack-in-the-Box in the city. Staff is both rude and hardly speak English. Food quality horrendous. Asked for fresh hamburgers when we ordered. Counter person said got you covered, will get it fresh. Food was delivered in two minutes, no way that's fresh. Staff person want to argue with me about whether was fresh or not. Would not give me a refund on my order, nor did I take my food with me. Will be calling Better Business Bureau and will be calling corporate headquarters."}
{"text":"Food is ok but they never get an order right and I mean never. And tonite they messed it up again like usual. So since the lobby was closed I walked back to the window to ask for what else I ordered and she said I didn't order it even though she repeated it back to me.  Then said if I want it I need go through the line again and walked away.. Ya good customer service ..not even close won't be back..."}
{"text":"The ultimate cheeseburger is really good! The fries don't compare to McDonald's fries (I think only in-n-out's really do), but they do have good burgers. I've also really enjoyed the chicken teriyaki bowl. It seems kind of random to be on the menu, but I like it."}
{"text":"The tacos they served me was either rotten or poisoned. I threw up everything after I ate the food. Felt very sick and bad stomach ache. They must not be sanitary"}
{"text":"I ordered, at 11pm, their Loaded Chicken Nuggets. Which suppose to consist of Chicken nuggets, smothered in melted cheese, bacon bits and drizzled with ranch. I got it, came home, and found naked chicken nuggets. It barely had any cheese, it was pushed to the side.. No bacon bits. And no ranch. It gave off a pungent smell and the taste was like throw up. I have uploaded a picture."}
{"text":"Didn't give me my full order, was no one else in line!! Guess 3 things are to much for there lead!! And phone doesn't work so you can get it fixed!! Worthless  Guess she needed some food and had to steal mine!! And could not figure out onion and cheese only, just cheese  WoW"}

{"text":"DO YOU EVER MAKE A DECISION AND INSTANTLY REGRET IT?  Yea, that's how this turned out. Running around doing errands. Busy morning. Needed breakfast. Ok, Jack in the Box. Never had breakfast here before but here goes.  Order a breakfast sandwich, hash brown and coffee.   Sandwich forgettable.  Hash brown overcooked, greasy and gross.  Coffee, whatever.  Place dirty.  And I don't like that they hide where your food is being prepared. It just magically appears through a side window. Like, what are they doing back there?  I'll go hungry next time."}
{"text":"Don't go as often but the employees have always been very nice and thoughtful and food good."}
{"text":"Clean, quick service, good fast food.   Manger, I believe his name was Kevin (?) was great at multitasking! Professional & friendly too!  Like the breakfast food options for quick on the go. Check out the midnight specials and the new sub style sandwiches they're offering!   I wish they would bring back the two tacos for .99 Cents, but the Monster Taco is currently on special for $1. LOL Gotta love that greasy goodness!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on 11/18/15 about 11:15 AM. Got 2 tacos & a Nacho Monster taco. A little busy. Brenda employee assisting me was pleasant. FYI to the staff* Some tables in dinning room had trashed left behind : needed to be cleared & wiped down. The drink station could have used some attention too! Tacos were okay. The Monster taco on the greasy side & wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"\"What, no more .99 cent Taco's?\", \"No Bueno\" They're now $1.29 for two! I use to love that forever offer!  When DINNING IN they have changed that system to plastic black baskets. That's fine- if they insure the baskets are cleaned after each use & that this is a more sanitary process?! Portion size may very with this approach. Prime example: the customer after us was upset at his portion size. After he was served, he asked the cashier twice \"is this the medium size, it this a medium fry?\". When the server said \"Yes\" He mumbled under this breath that \"these portion sizes have really changed\". As far as I'm concerned, it's still a value meal and \"it is what it is\".. with that said, bring back the .99 cent taco deal; don't mess with years of tradition! LOL"}
{"text":"Samantha, the drive thru worker, is amazing! She smiles and looks like she loves her job. Nice to encounter such an extraordinary individual at a busy fast food establishment.   My order was correct and the line moved quickly in the drive thru, especially for lunchtime rush.   I won't ding the review for my dissatisfaction with the brunch scramble. I should have known better."}
{"text":"They're pretty much exactly what you would expect from fast food. Large selection of fried food, burgers and soda. They do OK at delivering on what you'd expect, but you can't get too excited about Jack in the box. One big plus, they're open 24 hours, so if you ever get a craving for them, they're always available."}
{"text":"I'm getting sick of this bitter old lady that works nights there. I don't get off until 12am and she's usually there. I order a 3$ special that has 3tacos and a drink, and a jumbo jack(2.99). 6$ + tax. Should be less than .60 cents. Total she gives me is 8.11$. I explain that it's not 2$ in tax. She won't even look at me and says, computer says 8.11$ After explaining it again to her she says it's 8.11$. Jack and the Wacko needs to put employees that can handle customers right. All she did was give me an angry look as I asked for my money back and told me to go. . Not my first bad experience with this lady and her bad attitude as she limps around this place. Get rid of her, please!"}
{"text":"What is the point of giving me a number if you don't call it? I'm not listening for what I ordered. I'm listening for the number you told me three times when I ordered.   If I order a Jumbo Jack with cheese and you ask me if I want cheese. I assume your not listening. Especially when I get home with my order and there's no cheese on my burger.   When did Jack in the Box become the worst restaurant in town?   I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I have been to Jack's 5 times and at different times.  The fries are always cold even if ask them  may I please have  \"Hot Fries\"  they are still medium warm.  The burgers. ... well over cooked and smashed.  I will never EVER go there again."}
{"text":"Staff was polite, service was quick;  service was fast.  The jalapeño poppers and fries were good. Everything else is standard tasting fast food. Smoothie must be made from powder, No bueno."}
{"text":"This Jack-in-the-Box is close to where I work, so I thought I would give it a whirl. Some Yelpers swear by this restaurant. How could I go wrong ?  Firstly, I have to say that the restaurant was very clean, and orderly, including the parking lot. The staff was friendly and seemed to want to help. I am not a huge fan of fast food burgers so I decided to try the \"Monster Tacos\", and an order of regular fries. They gave me a number, and a cup and I was on my way. They have the fancy Coke Machine with a million possible combinations. I chose a regular Coke.   Within a short time my tray was brought my table and I was ready to eat. This is where the story changes. I have been eating Tacos my whole life, since I was a kid. My Mom used to make them, I made them, my Wife makes them, and I even ate them in the Army. I have eaten Taco's at different restaurants in different parts of the County. So, I would consider myself a fair judge of Taco's. In my opinion this wasn't a Taco. It was more like a Crime Against Humanity.   The meat looked and tasted more like a greasy meat paste, like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube in a nightmare. The the shell was very hard and had a nice hint of stale. The lettuce looked and tasted pretty sad too. My worst Taco expeience EVER.   Now, I don't have an axe to grind with this store. I think the problem is the corporate wonks that actual put this on the menu. In my opinion, the Jack in the Box Taco is garbage. They should be feeding these to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.   PS - The Fries were dry and did seem like they were sitting around for a while."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful service at this location. I'm surprised for the low score. I found my trip to be with a friendly cashier who tried to make my experience great. Good was served quickly and was good. What more could you ask for? I will return."}
{"text":"Manager is a smart ass. He came to the drive through window this morning with some cheesy grin on his face just to tell me that the \"drivers discount\" is going away. I have never once asked for a discount nor do I need one. Im actually a little offended over it and probably am not going back. Just cause I drive a Taxi doesn't mean im pinching for a whole dollar that you save me."}
{"text":"Jack-In-The-Box is the best fast food place. I made a trip from the raleigh area to charlotte  just for jack in the box and Ikea. Their food is always tasty and there is so much to choose from.   They must have the biggest fast food menu ever. when i was in HS this is where we went when everyone wanted something different. they have all kinds of burgers from the 1.29 jumbo jack(1/4 pound burger with lettuce and tomato) to the sourdough jack(grilled sourdough with bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato) and ultimate bacon cheese burger, chicken sandwiches(i like the spicy one), tacos(2 for 99 cents. really good stuff), tariyaki bowls with egg rolls, salads, and great sides like jalopeno poppers and bacon cheddar potato wedges. breakfast is mostly served all day and is great too. just try the ultimate breakfast sandwhich!   I'm just excited because im from CA where we have tons of these but now have moved to nc where the closest one with 2.5 hours away. I wish they would build some up here in cary/raleigh because there are a lot of cali transplants that would mob this place. I think people(locals) are looking for something different than wendy's and mc donalds too."}

{"text":"This jack In the box doesn't even deserve the one star I HAVE to do in order to write this. I just went on my lunch break and the employees are so slow. People in the back just standing around knowing there's people waiting to order. Stood there for 10 min before a girl decided it was time for her to come to the front. Took her another 5 minutes to take my order. Let me remind you, I'm on my lunch. 30 MIN LUNCH. had 5 minutes to eat my food. Horrible service. The owner needs NEW employees at this location. This isn't the first time I spent 25 min at this jack in the box waiting for someone to take my order. If you're craving jack in the box I do not encourage people to go to this location. You will be waiting for a long time. I recommend people to go to a DIFFERENT LOCATION!"}

{"text":"I used the drive through but I have to say it was 5Star from the moment I pulled in.  Outside area tidy and clean. The voice box was clear, no communication problems..... Then- I pulled up to the window.  I wS greeted by a beautiful lady with a FANTASTIC smile, she repeated my special order back to me, offered taco sauce, made sure my shake was covered in whipped cream, with a cherry.  As I got ready to pull out she said \"See you tomorrow!\", I know it's just a pleasant way to send me off but it made me smile! If I'm back in this area, who am I kidding its surrounded by Drs offices.  @__@, WHEN I'm back in the area, I will go by and order something. Hope her manager is a Yelper, she's a Superstar!"}
{"text":"About average. Its a 50/50 shot at getting everything correct.  The younger guy at night is very happy and bouncy, the rest seem to be putting in hours. Food usually good, shakes always great."}

Not a boy did they make them fresh, hot and crispy with salt melting, she upgraded me to a small for free! Said thank you for waiting and I looked like I needed to smile.  I did, I am again now just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast all day. Get xtra mayo on the Supreme!"}
{"text":"This review is about drive thru only.  It's right by my daughters college, and we had several reasons to celebrate her classes! Luckily there were Peppermint Oreo Cookie Shakes!   Now the Peppermint is gone, but deliciousness lives on.  They usually have cherries, unlike the other one nearby.   I'm assuming I don't look my best picking up my kid so late, as I always get the Senior Discount.    :/  not my proudest moment. LOL But it's the same as Katie's student discount, so it feels fair."}
{"text":"Worst jack in the box I have ever been too. 1st there are a couple of transients that like to hang out at this location. The good all tasted nasty like they hadn't changed the oil in years. Also our order took about 15 minutes to get when inside and we only ordered about $12 bucks worth of food. I won't be going back to this location. Yuck"}
{"text":"This jack in the crack is pretty descent. I haven't been inside but frequent the drive through often. They are located In between kfc and chevron. They always get my order right and are quick which is important for a fast food place. I stay away from the burgers and tend to always order the appetizer type meals such as egg rolls, 99 cent tacos, bacon and cheddar potato wedges. They have really good dollar chicken sandwiches which I add cheese on as well."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Jack In The Box whenever we come to Vegas. We always stop here before we check in to our hotel. It's clean and we always get good service. Our favorite is the 2 for .99 cent tacos, how do they make money on those? I remember the tacos from when I was a kid and Jack In The Box was in Michigan. We'll be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I come to this J in B on a regular basis, and don't usual yelp fast food, cause you shouldn't expect much.   but there manager named Jackie is absolutely useless, I just don't get why they have such incompetent manager.  I had a problem with my order and asked for a manager, Jackie came out, I told her my problem and all I got was a dumb stare from her.   I really don't know why i said any thing it just frustrated me even more.     I will just have to come back when Darlene is on she is absolutely wonderful"}
{"text":"This is the worst jack in the box. They are slow and it take you about 30 minutes to get your order. You're better off going to a real restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the stop to get something to eat before I get home every time is no good very disappointed for service  I order #3 and they give me something I don't order  curly fries very bad   Everything very bad and disgusting please Avoid this location"}
{"text":"honestly yesterday Martínez gave me good service but today she gave me a different attitude i don't know why. I told her I got a coupon for a free medium fry and she responded with a ok... I ordered 2 tacos and as I pulled up she wanted the coupon and she said to me \" you said regular fries\" and went to the back and told the guy it's a coupon for regular fries and it's a attitude and she sighed and I could tell she was upset over a mistake she thought I made? I told her exactly what coupon I got and I honestly didn't want to argue or correct her cause was on the go to work. I ain't coming back thanks this location didn't give me good customer service"}
{"text":"Brand new and they have a quick order kiosk for times when the wait is ridiculous. I wish In and Out had one of these. Food was hot and tasted like JIB should."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this jitb several times a month.  I made an order today and attempted to pay with exact change.  The \"shift leader\" says to me do u have another $10 I can't take this it doesn't has a security strip in it.  The bill was made in 1988, older than the shift leader kinda ironic.  I said no I don't have another $10,  he handed my change and said sorry about that and was going let me leave.  I said ru freaking serious he said yup.  I paid with a $20 and told him we would never come back. Thanks Jack in  the box for adding to my frustration today."}
{"text":"Order a Large curly fries got like a small! Just small broken down pieces and regular fries at the bottom so disappointed"}
{"text":"Not much to say about a fast food joint that's conveniently located all around town. This one in particular gave me food poisoning. I had the sourdough jack once and sadly I was throwing up all night long. Yup, that's about all I have to say for this one."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst jack in the box in AZ it just keeps declining long wait times wrong orders soggy food cold food I am done with this location  Update 8/23 raised stars as they must have new management and staff. The last three times i ate here have been amazing perfect fries and perfectly cooked burger of they keep this up it may very well be the best location keep it up great job!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS come to Jack In The Box after a long night of partying.  Their greasy food is the perfect remedy to soak up the alcohol in your system and super convenient that their drive thru is open 24 hours a day.   What really ticked me off about this place last night was the fact that I arrived there to find out that their cash register was updating and would take up to 10 minutes.  They told me to pull around the other side and they would let me know when it's done.  During this time, a bunch of car came by and was waiting as well.  No one came out to signal that they were up and running again.  I started out as the first car in line and ended up being the very last car in the drive thru that night.  It took almost 20 minutes to finally get my meal.  Boy was I ticked off!    Honestly, it probably won't stop me from continuing to get my fast food fix, but I just wanted to take the opportunity to rant about the overall experience."}
{"text":"Customer service sucks her I lnoiw it's fast food but it is really bad I can't believe how rude the cashiers were... and to top it off my order was messed up."}
{"text":"To the girl who's going to ignore us & run away: what horrible customer service! OK you made a mistake so own up to it. Things happen. Don't even acknowledge us & then take off. That is absurd."}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure-their churros.  It has like a cinammon cream inside. Nothing like biting on a warm churro...thing though it has a tendency to squirt out the cream! Just a warning. I got it on a light colored shirt and stained it.   Now the big complaint is that if you do late night drive thru- check your bags before driving away.   We've gone only a few times and they forgot things 3 times maybe out of 5 visits....and somehow it's always what the BF ordered since he orders a few smaller things and I just usually want just a salad and churros.  Also don't assume they put the proper sauces in your bag- he got a appetizer trio and didnt get marinara, ranch or sweet and sour.   Nothing makes me more irritated than going home and things are missing that you paid for and now theres not enough food. So don't do it to yourself...check it because they're not paying attention at this location.  I should add that they just opened, so hopefully it's just a learning curve and not the usual disposition of the staff here."}
{"text":"My five stars are for the big smile I got this morning from the drive thru employee. He was so friendly. Made my day and surprised me because the usual drive thru faces I see are grumpy and impatient. It was refreshing to see someone so happy."}
{"text":"Came at 9:45am on March 22nd and the drive thru attendant was super friendly and had a great attitude."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast, Food was hot and fresh, window attendant Jauny was super friendly and on top of her game, they didn't mess up my order. This place gets an A in my book."}
{"text":"Didn't have a few things I tried to order. We had an order of pancakes and French toast, gave me one syrup. A poor experience overall."}
{"text":"I pass by 3 Jack in the boxes on my way home I used to stop at this location every night after work. ...lately I have stopped basically because the food used to be on point and made correctly not so much anymore tacos so saturated with sauce they are stuck to the paper GROSS and in what world does HOT TACO SAUCE PACKETS  translate to a bunch of RANCH????? BS DONT VISIT THIS PLACE IT SUCKS and I like Jack"}
{"text":"There were five cars in front of me in the drive-thru, and I hesitated to stop because I thought that line was doomed to be a dreadful 10-20 minute wait. But the line made space for me seconds later, as if it read my mind. I was handed my food three minutes later (if even), greeted with apologies for what only a total arsehole would call an unreasonable delay, AND my order of fries was upgraded to the next size up as an olive branch. My order was filled perfectly, and, having finished my entire meal comfortably at home 20 minutes later, I feel like I should have generously tipped.  My point is that I get the feeling the employees are being worked like race horses which is not healthy. There's no reason why people should feel the need to apologize for doing their jobs really quickly and without mistakes. I can't imagine they're getting paid enough for that.  Thanks, Jack-In-The-Box crew around the time I wrote this! You're doing more than well and can totally afford to relax just a bit."}
{"text":"Their churros and shakes are delicious but the drive-thru employees 9 out 10 times they get my order wrong when I get home."}
{"text":"Today my mom decided to grab a quick breakfast. We were appalled to see worker outside cleaning windows with another young man smoking a cigarette just 10 feet from the drive-thru window. That's disgusting. Smoke was blowing into our car and into the drive-thru window. The man was around his late 20's training a younger man. He had a cigarette in his mouth and didn't care who saw. What does that show about their food preparation, which we don't see? That's absolutely disgusting, even for Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Third time in a row coming late at night at the \"grill isn't working\"  amazing how it worked fine all day but suddenly stops at a certain time"}
{"text":"Almost 5 stars on this run. The bag or our food smelled like chemicals. It was concerning. I'm almost ready to give birth and I woke up with a hunger. I'm hoping the smell was only the bag. I ordered breakfast this time, which I've never tried before, and it hit the spot! In comparison to McDonald's breakfast, I would say this is a more filling combo meal. I didn't like that I got charged for extra bacon when I was subbing it out for sausage. That was annoying. Anyway, it hit the spot, but beware of those chemical smells!"}
{"text":"This jack in the box is far above the others in the area.  Food is always fresh.  Staff is helpful and polite and they do a very good job."}
{"text":"Wish I could use a negative rating based on how rude the manager Asia treated me. I called in a compaint after the third time I was handed a bag that tore and spilled all over the ground. Never once was I offered replacement food for what spilled and hit the ground and all three times was treated as though it was my fault. When I called and spoke to the manager Asia, she was disrespectful and rude and showed no interest in my complaint. I'm baffled as to how she was even considered management material after my interaction with her."}
{"text":"Omg freaking terrible!!!! Don't ever eat here EVER!!! pulled up asked for the 1st thing I wanted .....they were out..... 2nd backup..... they were out..... and finally the third thing as a double backup they had it but not the sauce I goes with..... didn't have my side item jap poppers.... didn't have my drink..... dr. Pepper.... wtf do you have?!?!?!?!?! Your a chain restaurant u should have everything all the time..... that means 1 thing.... The MANAGER IS AN IDIOT AND DOESNT KNOW HOW TO ORDER!!!!  Go to another jack in the box. This one is terrible. Crappy customer service too"}
{"text":"How can no one have written a review yet about this place. I guess I'll be the first.  I LOVE jack in the box.  It is so clear lately that they have gotten much better then McDonalds.  Their prices are very good, I've never had a mistake on my order. The food is ALWAYS made to order and it's hot too. I've never had anything bad here or at any location for that matter.  Some of my favorite items are the meaty burrito (I LOVE the salsa they serve with it. It's soooo yummy). The burrito is loaded and hot and yummy every time. The sirloin burger is very good, I love their shakes (made with real ice cream). Their fish sandwich is SO much better then McDonalds (only thing is it's not always permanent on the menu unfortunately)   I'll goto Jack in the box anytime. It's a good place and have never had any complaints at any location."}
{"text":"I like Jack in the box.  I occasionally buy an order of tacos and share 1 with my dog (he loves them LOL)  I love their fish sandwich but it never seems to stay on their menu (it's only a promotional type item for some reason)    I just tried their new waffle breakfast sandwich and it was very yummy.  Their food is always made fresh to order, ALWAYS hot.  I've never had a problem at this location or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Evedently the entire breakfast crew is seriously drugged out. 17 minutes & 3 tries later still no food. Even the local cop getting coffee told me good luck on eating here"}
{"text":"I enjoy Jack in the Box. Probably too much for my own good. However, I will not be stopping at this location again, which is unfortunate as its the only one along my commute. I put my order in via the self ordering machine (love them!) And the gentleman before me ordered pretty much the same thing I did and had his food in hand within about 4 minutes. However, I got the wildcard of some guy walking in and ordering the same thing as me (the tacos are quite popular). Because he was 'in a rush' he got MY tacos and I got to wait a total of 11 minutes to receive my order. In no business is this okay. I guess if I do come back it'll be when I am 'in a rush' so I, too, can steal someone else'a food. The order was right and the place was clean. That's what the second star is about. The fact that I had to finish the rest of my bus/walk commute smelling of tacos and potato wedges was not the business."}
{"text":"Reading reviews and a little shocked that anyone has never been to jack in box. Have been going to this location since opening. Surprising fact is even though they seem to have a big turnover in employees the service and food maintain a high quality. Good job management."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but when your store says open 24 hours a day you should commit to that, I went there around 3am and they said they would be closed for 30 minutes, I then went back at 5am and they were still closed!!! Don't have a 24 hour store if you aren't going to follow through"}
{"text":"Went in on two different occasions. Both times, the restaurant was clean.Had no problem getting my food. The staff was prompt and ready to take my order. I just ordered 4 tacos (now $1.29) but to be expected with inflation in this country. Got the tacos fast and walked out. Staff was friendly the whole time."}
{"text":"I go to this jack in the box quite often, usually in the later hours. The service is always great and quick. I've never had one complaint and the employees are always nice. I stopped going to the one on Spring Mountain because the 24 hour drive thru seemed to be closed multiple times. I'll never know why and no longer care. I will continue to go to this location and I plan on it as we speak : )"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Jack in the box in general but when you're hungry and on a budget well you gotta eat what's available . I've come here twice and both times they've messed up my order . Can't complain much , it's fast food . The workers are super nice though :)"}
{"text":"After working a long shift at work I stopped by this location on my way home. Was craving curly fries and had to pay extra for them. Got home and there were no curly fries. Also requested lol get ice in my drink and it was filled over half with ice."}
{"text":"The guys here are pretty awesome. We came in one day, and unfortunately we had forgotten to check the allergy info on line before we came in. The cashier was very helpful, had a pamphlet ready, and actually looked at another one as we checked ours as well, just to make sure there wasn't anything we missed. Thanks for caring!"}
{"text":"The food tasted okay...but it stained my car seat due to improper packaging...since oil from the breakfast burrito and hash browns leaked through the bag onto my passenger seat."}
{"text":"My basis for fast food reviews:  Every restaurant starts at 3 stars since, theoretically, they should be the same whichever location you go to.  Plus or minus stars for cleanliness, speed of service, and the quality of the food I'm eating that day.  Usually will order something new to the menu.  Reviews are only in comparison to other locations of the same chain.  This is a sad location off of McDowell.  Went drive through and picked up a Sourdough Jack, 2 tacos, and tried their new garlic herb fries.  Drive through took a lot longer than expected with only 2 cars in front of me.  The Sourdough Jack was fine, normal.  Edges of the bun still crisp.  The two tacos were also as usual - a guilty pleasure purchase, smothered in hot sauce.  New menu item:  garlic herb fries.  These were sad.  A box of fries with a smidgen of garlic plopped down on top.  Not mixed in at all with the rest of the fries, and not nealy enough garlic or herbs.  Coating of oil or butter along the bottom of the box.  Never a good sign when your fries stick to a layer of grease at the bottom.  So minus one star for slow service and terrible garlic herb fries."}
{"text":"This is the closest JIB to my home and I frequent it quite a bit because it was inexpensive and being pregnant for 9 months, you need cheap with all the food consumption.   I've had issues with my food in the past from fast food joints but instead of getting mad or posting a review right away, I address it. Most of the time I use the drive-thru so I call it in if I can't go back right away. At the end of the day, if the business is willing to listen, I will let them fix it first. After all, it's an individual who owns this franchise, not a corporation. I couldn't live with dragging their name in the mud without contacting them first.   During my pregnancy, I ordered half the value menu. When I got to work, I noticed my eggroll, Cheddar bacon Wedges and tacos were burnt. I was not a happy preggie and called in. The manager asked me to bring the food back but I was clear across town at work. I couldn't go back. He asked me to bring it back whenever I was in the area. So I did. I saved it and brought it in that night. Seeing my \"Condition\" he replaced the entire order and even gave me a strawberry milk shake for my troubles. I was very happy with the result. I wasn't trying to get anything for free. I just wanted to show that my food was actually burnt. He was very apologetic and turned a bad situation into a good review for them.   Kuddos to the manager at this location."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but when I got my drink in the drive through the lid was not on securely and immediately spilled all over my pants. I asked for napkins and explained why. The woman didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"Completely incompetent dark hair girl with glasses can't handle an order for two chocolate shakes. \"Can I have a reg chocolate shake no toppings.\" -'ok'.  \"And can I also have a regular chocolate shake with Oreo cookie\". 'Yea, will that be all?'  \"Yes\".  First she completely left out one shake.  Then she hands me two shakes both with Oreo and one is vanilla.  I was completely dumbfounded by how terrible at her job she was."}
{"text":"It's Jacks, what did ya expect haha."}
{"text":"Very friendly lady at the front who took my order, accepted my birthday coupon and was very sincere in wishing me a happy birthday.  Thanks so much for making me smile!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on break from work. Needed to use restroom before eating. Asked for they key, employee refused to let me use it because \"we only allow customers to use restroom.\"  Well I will not give this location my business because I was going to order and eat in, but not when they treat guests like this!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They don't know how to calm down when rushed. We ordered a supreme croissant and they gave us a bun with ham and cheese. On top of that they forgot to give us our coffee and their drink machine is only serving diet. I would not suggest go to this jack in the box, it is also messy"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to Flagstaff from Las Vegas. Honestly wasn't expecting much. The place was a little dingy, but not bad - just a small town fast food place. Also, we don't have Jack In The Box back in Nebraska, so I wasn't sure what it was all about.  HOWEVER... when we opened up our bag in the car (we got the meal to-go), it was the most beautiful sandwich I'd ever seen. Seriously. It wasn't sloppily put together. It was like, right-out-of-a-commercial good. I got the Homestyle Ranch Chicken Club and it tasted delicious. The fries were hot, too.   The staff was extremely friendly and our food was steamy. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Poor attitude towards customers also poor management skills  Rude  Didnt want to tend to my order problem"}
{"text":"By far the worst Jack in the Box I have ever been to. I ordered 2 kids meals with fries. When I get to the window after a 10 minute wait (only 2 cars ahead of me) the worker tells me \"we are out of fries\" it's lunch time by the way. He then tells me that they are going to substitute curly fries and I tell him that is not ok my kids don't like curly fries. He then rudely says \"for real?\" Yeah buddy for real, they don't like them. I then asked him if Jack in the Box was a burger and fries restaurant and he gave me attitude. I will never visit this location again nor any other Jack in the Box. I don't appreciate the attitude and will spend my money somewhere that cares about the customer."}
{"text":"Bumping the review from a 1 to a 3 star. A total retro/mod interior redo and not a bum, tweeker, or hooker on site, inside or out. WOW! I had not been there for months and was pleasntly suprised that every person in the dining area and parking lot looked pretty normal. I may have just lucked out with this visit, but I will now at drop in a little more often and keep you updated. If this continues, this place gets 4 star from me. Jack always has a diverse menu for a fast food place. The food quality has always been good, and service has always been friendly here. Could this Jack in the Box be turning into yet another downtown business that is being a part of the solution (and not the problem) to Downtown Las Vegas redevelopment? I hope so...time will tell.   Jack, just keep away the addicts of crack, and I'll keep coming back. Tell the ho' she gotta go. Don't let the tweeker be a keeper. Kick the pimp to the Goodyear blimp. Help keep our hood mo' good."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service. They pretended to swipe my card then said it was declined. Hahaha so I went next door to the 7/11 and pulled out cash and they checked my $20 bill. I've never had that happen to me, very odd."}
{"text":"Apparently we have eaten here before, and don't remember. But this time, I really enjoyed it! I had the new bacon ranch burger & onion rings. It was super amazing! The sourdough bread is so buttery and delish! The onion rings are real onion, crispy and perfect!   My kids had the Oreo & chocolate shakes, very rich but yummy!   They ran out of onion rings over the weekend but I think that was singlehanded my fault...  I wish they were closer, but waist is glad they aren't!"}
{"text":"On Sept 17, 2014 I parked at the Jack-in-the-box at Mill Ave and Seventh and entered as customer buying a soda.  I was suppose to meet up with a woman that day, but it was going to be across the street, so I left the parking lot on foot.  I left my soda clearly visible in the cab of my truck.  I knew I wasn't going to be gone that long, so I wasn't too worried.  I did notice there was a sign that said you have to be a jack-in-the-box customer to park there, which I was.  Unbeknownst to me, there was a different sign on the complete opposite side of where I parked that said you could not leave the property.  This sign was nowhere near where I parked.  When I returned to my truck, about 60 minutes later, my truck was gone.  There was a cabbie there that explained to me what happened.  The cabbie was clearly just preying on people that fell victim to the trap, in order to get his cut.    Since my vehicle was being held hostage, and I was dealing with criminals that use color of law as a cover, I had no choice but to pay the $155 ransom they demanded to get my vehicle back in a reasonable time frame. Incidentally, under state law, if you don't have the money when you pick up your car, then they can't hold your vehicle.  If they insist on holding your vehicle, you'll want to call the police to mitigate for you.   As is, I will never go into Mill Ave again, it's not safe.  I will never visit this particular Jack-in-the-box again.  That area has completely lost all my business.  Nevertheless, the Jack-in-the-box manager and employees were fairly sympathetic, and even gave me a free drink while I waited. But clearly, they should own their own parking lot and not be contracted with a criminal towing company.    It's common for most people to park somewhere once, and enter multiple establishments in the same area, and then return to where they parked.  This is just natural human behavior. It saves you from having to constantly move your vehicle.  This experience now makes me wonder whether it's safe to park anywhere.  If you are the owner of this Jack-in-the-Box you should contact me through Yelp.  I recommend you do this before I start contacting politicians or filing any law suits. But keep in mind, visiting your restaurant, cost me $155 out of pocket, not to mention the expenses going to and from the towing yard.  Update:  As of 9/27/2014 the owner of this jack-in-the-box still has not contacted me.  Why? That's simple. He doesn't care about me as customer, and he doesn't care about you either."}
{"text":"Why is it at 5:45 pm you have no rice for your Chicken Teriyaki  bowl? This happens way too often , we have been there at 11 am , no rice, 10:30 pm , no rice, and now 5:45 pm , again no rice... how hard is it to fix rice when you see it's getting low? My husband loves these bowls when he can get them , the problem is getting them . Either fix this problem or take it off the menu ...simple!!!"}
{"text":"Drive trough takes so long! They do not know how to park people with extra custom orders. Had drive trough employee give me attitude..Francis... Well you obviously dont value your customers. Yes i was upset waiting 30 min in a drive trough! Then the c##t hands me a drink spilling everywhere..really..made her give me a new one. She then started making fun of me with her co worker. She tought id left. Spoke to manager..didnt serm to care..lack of management for sure. Got made fun of, got attitude, food was cold, all because YOU guys took soooo long to hand out food. Poor service, rude employees, rude management"}
{"text":"We all know what Jack in the Crack food is all about so this review is for the Employees. Every time I come here the drive thru employees are upbeat, friendly, and smile when I pull up to the window to pay.  I understand it sucks working in fast food and dealing with people in general but these girls n guys are keeping it classy and doing it with a smile. Thank you Jack in the Box employees. I wish I could remember the young African American girl's name who assisted me today, super nice and should be promoted.  Whoever the manager and supervisors are, good job on training your staff!"}
{"text":"one of the worst jack in the box experience i have ever had  i have been here several time and i dont expect much normally bums hanging out in the lobby store is always dirty employess always smell like pot  but yesterday i went in and order 6 tacos no sauce and a chicken sandwich and not one employee was wearing gloves not one washed their hands cashier moving from cash register to fry station lifting up the handles fry guy then grabs handles take the chiken bare handed to grill side so on and so forth   so i asked the shift lead to speak with a manager and of course i come to find out all three upper managers are only shift leads which i find hard to believe someone is bullshitting me that on your second busiest day niether the assisant or gm are working?!?!?!?  so i tell her what my concerns are and she refuses to even acknowldge me about them so i said seriously your not even washing hands and of course she tells me no gloves are ok and they only have to wash thier hands every once an hour and then continues to try to get me out of the store so i told her the sad part is if you know your doing this and yet you still dont care to fix it!!!! seriously dont fuck with me when it comes to safety of food i will be calling headquaters, i will call state, and i will get my refund on the contaminated food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have special thank you Samira was very personable and she also did a really great job job on her customer services, because I was making a wrong order with the coupon I had, but she was happy to adjusted with smile and no question ask, I definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Instead of In and Out we came here... horrible decision! Everything was gross...the only reason I gave it one start was because the curly fries saved the day."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and got the chicken strips combo. It was probably 9 and i was the only one in the lobby and a young man was cleaning the lobby but he stopped what he was doing and immediately came up front to help me. My food was taking a while to come out and without hesitation he asked the people making the food where it was at and apologized to me about it. Kudos to him. The only thing concerning was it looked like he had a bunch of mustard over his forearm and hand or maybe it was yellow paint but it looked weird."}
{"text":"Crapy service took about 40 min. to get my order. I WAS THE THIRD PERSON IN LINE. Then i got home and found out the cook mest up my order. Didnt feel like going back and waiting for several hours to get my order fixed so i just lost some $$ on this place. Food was bla bread dried out in some places and soft from mayo in others. Horrable service for crapy food. The guy at the window was cool thats about it."}
{"text":"This place is dirty inside & out,no one cleans, too many transients inside hanging around &bathing  in restrooms & drugs. Awful & dirty."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Jack in the box I am always pleasantly surprised! my food is always hot and fresh! I didn't even like Jack-in-the-Box before because of bad experiences!!! Jack-in-the-Box is now my go to late night fast food joint! I have been here 6x so far since moving to Mesa and they are grey here! I love The spicy chicken sandwich the onion rings the birthday cake milkshake! everything is always great! Definitely worth the money spent!! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Anyone else? Nope? Okay, then I guess I'll do it. I'll review Jack in the Box.  When I lived out east, I'd only heard the jokes and rumors about Jack in the Box. That being said, when I saw them sprinkled about out here in the West, I ... well, first I laughed and said, \"Wow, those really do exist.\" And then I thought, \"I will never eat there.\" Of course, I was wrong, as I made that decree before I learned you could get 3 eggrolls for a buck. And they serve breakfast 24 hours a day. And cheesecake shakes. Oh, Jack, you cater to my deepest, darkest indulgences.  I will say I have learned a very valuable lesson when purchasing sandwiches from Jack in the Box -- request them with NO MAYO. If you must have it, put it on yourself. Unless, of course, you're a fan of having an entire jar of Hellmenn's dripping down your arm. In which case, you will be in mayo heaven.  I have a secret I will share with you. Jack is my friend on MySpace.  http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=75304378&MyToken=111eb25b-d65e-4546-8f39-6fede72fcf3c"}
{"text":"Bad quality food. Food taste very old. The girl forgot my fries so i had to go inside"}
{"text":"There is a young lady that works at this Jack in the box who is a complete IDIOT!!! Her name is Lily. She was not paying attention to anything that was said and kept hearing things. on top of that she was laughing and giggling so much on the intercomthat she didnt hear what we were saying. dont they do drug tests to become employeed?"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 tacos.  Pretty simple. I asked for taco sauce.  They forgot.  And I'm sure this lady thinks she deserves $15 an hour.  Lame. You know what though, anytime I go to a low level fast food chain, it's my fault for not checking.  Chik fil a and in&out have never messed up an order.  Not one time."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Jack In The Box I get approached by a homeless person, either inside or outside.  I will stop going to this location. Nothing wrong with the food or service.    Save for people begging for money."}
{"text":"Went by this location last night and it was closed! The drive thru is supposed to be open 24 hours,  but apparently that didn't apply last night. The out front sign was lit and all of the outside lights were on, but the kitchen lights were out. The lobby lights were on too. I just thought it was weird that there were no signs or anything to let people know what was going on. There were other cars in the drive thru as well. Loss my business last night!"}
{"text":"I had never been to jack in the box but today I went because I got a super cool free 2 borrito coupon for cinco de mayo. The food is whatever but I really did get great service. I changed my mind a few times in the drive thru but the lady didn't lose her patience w me so that was great! Tacos are sub par but solid for drunchies. Burger was super fresh! And always go curly fries!"}
{"text":"The drive through person tried to be nice and patient.  I got a little upset at the fact they wouldn't take two separate orders and pay for the two separate orders.  So, I just ended up getting one order.  Food was just slapped on, not very well made.  It kinda looked like a two year old created my food.  Won't go back!"}
{"text":"They always have really fast  service always have smiles on there faces they don't look mad at the fact they have to work.   They always don't rush me to order the food and if I make a mistake they don't get mad.  Bathrooms are always clean"}
{"text":"I went to this location to order lunch for my office.. I went in and ordered 50 tacos, because it was a last minute decision we did not call in the order.  I apologized in advance and let them know I was not in a hurry and to take their time making my very large, last minute order.  That being said, after I ordered, the manager on duty proceeded to call me rude for not calling in my order during their lunch rush. (I was the only person in the lobby and they had one car in their drive thru.) I again apologized and she just walked away without acknowledging me further.. Once my order was ready she kind of tossed the bags onto the counter and walked away. I feel that I was treated very unprofessionally when spending money they otherwise would not have gotten during their 'rush'. I will not be returning to this location & will also be filing a complaint with the company itself."}
{"text":"Excellent! Best Jack in Box we have been to in a long time! We special ordered all 3 sandwiches and they were all 100% made right and FRESH! Carlos was very helpful and polite and easy to understand in the drive through. I did NOT have to repeat my order at all he got it all correct the 1st time!"}
{"text":"This is the first Jack in the Box in history that has been able to give me my food hot and fresh after midnight and the shake machine was available after midnight.Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I am the first one to advertise a Jack in the Box taco and thank goodness they're good because nothing else about this location is. I ordered two tacos and fries and there was nobody else in the drive thru line. I had to wait 5 minutes at the window and then they had me pull around to the front where I had to wait another 12 minutes. I could have made tacos myself quicker than they did. When I said something about it they were not apologetic about it at all. I would have filled out the survey but was not given a receipt for my order. The sign on the door said to call the district manager Peter if you weren't satisfied. I called Peter a few times and he never answered my phone. I will go back for the tacos but this has got to be the slowest fast food I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is the worst jack in the box ever. There are sketchy people everywhere while you wait at the drive though. Some will even try to walk up to your car and ask for cash for the bus. Nah dude. Go away.   Not only that but one visit was so bad on the service. The employee told me to reverse my car a bit and go forward just to reset the drive thu timer. Like dude, it does not take this long for this shit to be made."}
{"text":"They asked me if I wanted to replace my coffee with another coffe when I said if i could get a milk shake and when I told her she gave me a dirty looks and started talking crap about us to the other employees and they all gave me ugly looks I wish there was a no star horrible service overall"}
{"text":"Jack in the box is NOT known for its cuisine or world renowned chefs. However, there are one or two items I have a strange liking for.  I walked in and was greeted by a young Latino kid working the counter.   After I placed my order I decided to use the bathroom and as I walked through the dining area I noticed several filthy tables and the area was in dire need of a good cleaning.  I walk into the bathroom and stepped in a large amount of water and the floor was covered with several mounds of soggy toilet paper."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this location and it won't be my last. I can't find my receipt to tell you who the person who helped me was, but she was a total rock star! I have some picky kids and so half the burgers I ordered needed some special attention. When the food came out, she carefully inspected each item, and discovered that one of the Boger's was not how I ordered it. She actually had a conversation with the cook, and made sure they made it right!! I didn't have to check anything in my order because she did it all. It was quite refreshing to see this as many of you know, going to most fast food places these days is like playing Russian roulette. This is not one of those places. I will be back and hope that future visits are just as good as this first one!"}
{"text":"As Jack and the Box's go, this one is good. It's attached to a gas station, which usually cries out \"BEWARE\", but I come here often enough to be The Duke. Why, do you ask? Two things actually: 1. The egg roles. I absolutely love the egg roles here. They are amazeballs!! 2. Two tacos for a dollar. When you only have a little scratch in your pocket, you can get two orders of them and a small drink for under $5.00. Cheap and easy (Like Mike's Mom). Never mind which Mike I'm talking about.  If you are ordering either of those two items, you have to expect a wait. They are made to order.  Need ideas for other tasty treats? The Sourdough Burger, the Chicken Fajita Pita, Curly Fries, and the Jalapeño Poppers are all good choices as well."}
{"text":"Been to this location a time or two. When I order tacos no sauce I always get extra sauce instead. When I ask for shakes no topping I tend to get extra whipped cream e as well. I've learned to just not request the omission. Today was the have all be all. I ordered a #3 and two chicken strip kids meals. Some with curly fired. When I got my order there was NO sauce and when I asked if I could have S&S for both my kids chicken strips and buttermilk sauce for our curly fries, I was given one of each to spread between 2 chicken meals and 2 orders of curly fries AFTER I never received the fries in the first place. When they finally gave me the missed fries they were just as burnt and dry as the chicken strips my girls refused to eat.  If that wasn't the kicker, when paying I handed over my credit card and was asked to see ID. It sounded good because when I told the cashier I've never been asked for ID before she explained everyone should be carding. Asking isn't as important as REALLY CHECKING! Just to test the theory I handed over my sisters ID with a totally different last name and picture. The cashier puts the card up aside the ID hands the ID back, then swipes the card. Perfect, now I know they accept credit cards without ID and if they ask for it, they don't confirm the name."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and we love Jack in the Box. However, this isn't the first time I go here after work to get something quick for the cravings. Rolled up to the window and first thing I noticed was how tired and sleepy the person taking my order. Paid my order and got my food. Everything looks good until I got a bite of my food. Dry scrambled and pancakes looks like it was thrown around for a min. The burger looks like it was old and dry as hell. the fries was just too damn salty old. I prefer jack's fries over McDonald's but after that night, it tasted like old fries."}
{"text":"The location itself is a little hard to get to (why is Charlotte so full of medians?).  The staff is generally pretty inattentive.  Often, I have to go in and stand around for a while before anyone offers to get my order.  Several times, I have asked for my order \"for here\" and received it \"to go.\"  They also run out of sweet tea a lot.  Pros:  At the end of the day, the food is tasty.  And for some reason, this location is cheaper than the 10525 Mallard Creek Rd one.  (The combo I usually get is 25 cents less here.)"}
{"text":"This place does not deserve a star at all!!! At 12:19Am July 25th, 2016: I pulled up to drive thru woman just asked what I wanted to order? I asked for a number one and was about to explain how I wanted my burger and then she cuts me of asking me small medium or large???? She then proceeded to stop talking and help the customers in front of me, I'm guessing since it was silent. She comes back and I think maybe she doesn't understand me: So I start speaking Spanish she starts speaking to me in Spanish so I'm like great maybe will get somewhere!! Nope She does the same crap as I start telling her how I want the burger she doesn't even listen!! Then she leaves without saying anything and didn't even say hold on or anything!!! She gets back to speaker and tells me have you decided what you wanted?? Like really I've know what I wanted since I drove up!! She then ask me to speak harder! I responded like you mean louder!!! I told her if she was ready to listen to me and if she is going to be allow me express what I want on my hamburger then I could go on with the size of drink and fries!!! Of course No response just horrible poor service!!! Attention manager train you drive thru night shift customer service is horrible and not good for business!!! I drove off!! CUSTOMER SERVICE ZERO!!!!"}
{"text":"Classic jack in the box.. had the buttery jack... all I need to say. The drive through was quick and they got my order correct which was nice."}
{"text":"Typical jack in the box. At a fast food place typical is good. Food came out fresh the drive through was quick and friendly. They passed the bag test!!! That's right nothing missing... Which is amazing nothing worst than driving away and noticing they forgot half your order!!"}
{"text":"I'm not huge in to fast food, and usually if I get a burger it will be from in n out, however, hubby talked me into going in to this particular jack in the box one day and it was clean, the employees were VERY friendly, and the food tasted really good! The employee, I don't know his name, smiled and thanked us, he brought our food to our table, held the door open for customers, and cleaned the lobby. I've never been more impressed by a fast food environment!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place ZERO stars? Tonight they had the WORST drive thur person. We sat at the menu to order for over ten mins while she kept saying \"give me a min\" by there were NO other cars in front! When we eventually got to the window to pick up our food we sat there for another 5 mins and when she came to the window she was extremely rude. They need to find more customer friendly people if they want to stay in business! Horrible! Disgraceful!"}
{"text":"I went here on Christmas Day and one of my hamburgers had no meat on it. This is the second time this has happened to me at this particular Jack in the Box. First time I thought it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Never ceases to fill my tummy. Freshly made fast food. Courteous service and very prompt. Very clean restaurant inside and out. Safe area to eat t versus other locations in and around Las Vegas. English speaking employees!"}
{"text":"Why is it so difficult to get an order correct.  I mean ya, people make mistakes but when your only job is to take my order and verify that what I ordered is in fact correct, why did I end up with something other than what I ordered?  Why in God's name do these people feel they deserve $15 an hour? It's up to me to support you and your family because of the career path you have chosen?   My order was really simple.  One sausage croissant.  That's easy, or so I thought.  I ended up with a croissant with nasty bacon and a slimy slice of ham. YUCK!"}
{"text":"I usually have no problems with this establishment but everything was burnt on our order today.  We ordered over 30 dollars in breakfast for our family and everything was burnt; the croissants, the eggs, and the meat(bacon and ham) had chard pieces from the grill on them.  What upset me the most is that the cook thought that it was ok to serve that as an exceptional product to their customers.  I tried to call them but there was no answer.  Will not be back for breakfast.  Made a complaint on the website.  We will see how their customer service for their corporation is."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went inside for lunch as the drive thru line was long. There was a line inside too with a wait but seeing how Mike handled the customers inside and the drive through with a smile when they were super busy still it was hard to be upset with the wait. Thank you Mike!"}
{"text":"My dad and I had a $4 for 2 Chipotle Jalapeno burgers coupon. The meat had a gnarly taste, I'm surprised I managed to eat it. The french fries were hot and fresh tasting, otherwise I would have given this place a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"I used to come here late at night to order a munchie meal and to my surprise this Jack in the Box location has never messed up my order. I guess I would just arrive at the right time. Lol Other than that the reason why I give this place two stars is for their location, there's so much sketchy things going on in the parking lot and in the drive-thru lane. It's not the employee's fault but it's a warning to those who are night foodies looking for a fast food restaurant, this location is not entirely safe for you. If you do visit this location go during the day, you'll still see sketchy people but the area is more publicly busy.  Their food is bomb, even though I know it's totally bad for you. However, I always order their tacos or their jalapeño burger munchie meal. Employee's are chill, they aren't rude but they aren't go happy."}
{"text":"The mushroom burger my Dad ordered was pathetic and dry with no mushrooms at all.How can you advertise something you cannot bother to make correctly at your establishment My son ordered seasoned curly fries and that was what broke the Camels back.Completely unacceptable food.Even the dog wouldn't eat the bits and pieces.Where were the curly fries for this order.There was nothing but hard ends and over greased fried pieces, There wasn't 1 CURLY fry there and they were cold as well,What happened to the days of caring about what you served. Jack can Jump Up My ***"}
{"text":". Worst service ever woman at drive-thru messed up my order had to turn around go back for her not to apologize and then hand me my bag outside the window and close the door horrible horrible horrible horrible"}
{"text":"This morning I ordered in the drive-thru; a croissant sandwich and an order of fries.  The fries weren't in my bag. When I noticed, I immediately began calling.  I have been calling and no one answers.  It makes no sense that a place of business doesn't answer their phone at all during normal business hours."}
{"text":"This was one the best Jack in the Box's that we had ever been to.  The staff was very friendly and it was always very clean.  Sadly it closed today."}
{"text":"Great service there manager was awesome and accommodating . When my son's friend felt ill and had to take his food to go he wrapped it up for us and was caring and considerate. He went above and beyond with customer service."}
{"text":"\"Uuhh. . . . eight . . . no . . . . uhhhh . . . . ten . . . make it ten  . . . ten tacos . . . \"  \"Sir. . . how many tacos?\"   (rustling sound with a selection of masculine guffaws and feminine giggling)  \"Ok, we've had a recount . . .  uhh. . . . . twelve. . . . twelve tacos. . . \"  \"Twelve tacos?\"  \"Yes, twelve . . . twelve tacos. . . \"  \"Ok your total is $6.78 at the window please pull forward.\"  \"What?\"  \"Please pull forward.\"  \"Ok.\"  \"Welcome to Jack in the Box, can I take your order please?\"  \"You just did.\"   (Long silence)   \"So can you pull forward?\"   \"Oh, I guess.\"   \"Thank you!\"  \"Hey . . . you still there?\"  \"Sir, yes. . .  what can I get for you?\"   \"What time is it?\"  (long silence)   \"It's 2:40 AM\"   \"2:40 AM?\"   \"Yes. Please pull forward.   \"Ok.. . . can I get napkins with that?\"   \"Yes. Please pull forward.\"   \"Ok.\""}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Walked in stood there for 10 minutes didn't even get acknowledgment from any of the employees so I just left."}
{"text":"It is a fast food joint so you either like the chain or you don't. The difference from store to store is the service.  This location has provided great service to me for the 14 months I have been going here.  As a chain I think they have a good variety of tastiness. The only downside I have encountered is the frequency of wrong orders which I would guess has been once every 15 or 20 trips (yes, I am in their drive thru a lot)."}
{"text":"I've never been to a jack in the box before. I had heard all the rave about tacos and such. Unfortunately the overall experience was not on par.   First, the place could use a good cleaning. My table was dirty from not being wiped down. The place had no customers. The trash can was filled to the limit. Staff didn't seem concerned about cleanliness or appearance of the store.   Next, waited a very long time for food. The curly fries were hot but not plentiful. The tacos temperature was cool. Not hot.   The drink machine needed a change to add soda. Staff again didn't seem concerned when approached.   I left feeling that perhaps this location failed to deliver an experience of the famed jack in the box. Hopefully this is an isolated incident.  But not a good start."}
{"text":"I ordered food at 3:07 to go. The 5 employees continued to stand around and talk as I waited 10 minutes for my food... this is so rude. I am a general  manager and would be embarrassed if these were my employees... this is just plain rude... just got my food 13 minutes later and it was wrong... we ordered a home style chicken club and got chicken strips??? And completely forgot one of my Jack's spicy chicken.  Then she said well if you want the right food I'm gonna have to charge you extra... seriously. Because you messed up you want to charge me extra?!?! This whole experience was a giant fail..."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru at this location on 01-26-18 at 5:57pm and I did not receive one of the sandwiches I paid for with my order. When I called the store, the lady that answered said \"ohh that sucks. I guess you can come back\" - I asked for them to just remove the charge for the food that I did not receive and she told me they can't do that.  Do not go here."}
{"text":"Jack in my crack, my long lost friend.  Finding you was like seeing an oasis in the desert.  We got off the plane, and while i picked up the rental car, we also used the free wi-fi at the rental car terminal to find the nearest JITB.  This was it.  1 ultimate breakfast sandwich, 1 99 cent chicken sandwich and a shared order of egg rolls later, we were ready to take on the world!  We actually hit 4 different JITB's over the course of 4 days.  Service was fine at all, food outstanding.  Jack, If only you would open one in Nebraska, please!!!"}
{"text":"I usually Like this jack n the box,  the employee's are usually nice and the food for being fast food is usually decent.  Tonight though,  they had one of the rudest ladies at the drive thru ever,  and my tacos were so soggy it was disgusting. I'll give it a while before I come back to this place"}
{"text":"This Jack in The Box employs the rudest employees I have ever come across. To start, as I pulled through the drive-thru I was able to hear the employees swearing to each other and joking through the loud speaker. As I tried to gain their attention I was greeted with a rude \"one minute, I'm busy\" by a young man! Once I was able to place my order the horrific customer service continued! The young man at the drive-thru window was not wearing a name tag but somehow remembered to keep his headphones on with music blasting as I paid! I was not addressed once other than the quick verbal exchange of the employee yelling \"$14.38\" while reaching for my card. To top it off, as I pulled away I could hear the young blond employee swearing while taking a smoke break with another guy employee. I understand that this is a fast food establishment and exceptional customer service is not a priority however, this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"i asked for a number 6!!! and got a number  #11 how do you confuse beef with chicken really like wow"}
{"text":"Can't beat the service. Clean and very nice Associates here. Service with a smile and good folks. Dining area is small and kinda cold but done very well with expensive fixtures but doesn't fit a Jack in th Box. Who cares. Good food and good service."}
{"text":"This was a decent restaurant but if you are going off the pictures on their menu, you're going to be HIGHLY disappointed. The service was ok but I waited a bit longer than I'd like, which would have been acceptable if my food didn't start getting cold. It tasted fine... I've had worse but I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Really slow and they serve stale food. Bought the pork belly sandwich got 2 pieces of bacon. Then bought the fried chicken sandwich got 2 pieces of nuggets. What a joke."}
{"text":"Service could be better but food is good. I like the location, too. The drive through line moves slower than other Jack In Box locations I have visited."}
{"text":"Fast, accommodating, affordable and food taste pretty good. Service could be better. Favorites are the ultimate cheeseburger with bacon, curly fries and tacos."}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill. Nothing but a bunch of Teenage F ups working there tonight. No etiquette or protocol. The food was horrible quality! It's fast food, but there should be some good quality to what you're paying for. I am not eating at Jack in the box after this experience. This Jack in the Box is going back in the box!"}
{"text":"This crew is getting it done. Tremendous teamwork and work ethic here. This crew of 3 is doing the work of 6. Hopefully they are recognized or compensated for such stallwart efforts."}
{"text":"Every single time! They get my order wrong. I am not kidding or exaggerating. Every single time. Unfortunately it's the closest one to our house. The other one is off 91st Ave and Thomas. Much better service. And man have prices gone up. Might as well to Denny's!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this location but today the (manager )working the cashier was a complete snob. Not only was I exstremly dissatisfied with the lack of mutual respect from the manager taking my order but they got my order wrong as well."}
{"text":"It happened to be busier than it normally is when we come, so it took a little longer to order and get our food. The guy in front of us left his dog in the car for like 20 minutes which bothered me. Not sure why he didn't just go through the drive thru... I ordered the Crispy Chicken Strips combo with regular fries. Their new Coca Cola Freestyle Machine was out of many drink options. I wanted Peach Sprite but it was one of the numerous choices that was greyed out. My b/f informed the workers of the drink situation since they were oblivious. But we did not see anyone replace the flavor cartridges while we were there. The tables and floors were filthy. Don't know that I've seen the dining area so dirty before. We wiped one off with some napkins. When we got our food, mine tasted pretty good, but my b/f's fries were so oversalted they were glistening. It was bad enough that they had to be taken back. The good part was that he got fresh fries which were really hot and good. But they should have done it right the first time. A poor JIB visit overall."}
{"text":"I tend to frequent other JIB locations as this one has disappointed me in the past, but it was Christmas morning and I wanted to eat before going to see my family, so I went through the drive thru. I got the Supreme Croissant with the hash brown and orange juice. It was ready quickly, the guy at the window wished me a Merry Christmas, and I was on my way. I was pleasantly surprised to find a couple of curly fries in with my hash brown too. Score! I think this JIB has redeemed itself."}
{"text":"Wanted a breakfast sandwich from Jack this evening and the other JIB locations in the area haven't had the best track record with me, so we decided to try this one. I didn't even know it was there! Doesn't look like much on the outside and the parking lot is kind of awkward. But we had a good meal and the girl at the counter was nice. I had the supreme croissant with curly fries. Also had some of my boyfriend's regular fries and they were really good too. This JIB location didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for a Sourdough Jack combo (no mayo or tomato). My dogs were in the car with me and the ladies working were pretty excited about them. My meal was just fine, no complaints."}
{"text":"Really upsetting, is what I would say my experience was here. Generally, I love Jack in The Box as it is one of my favorite fast food chains and I decided to give myself a cheat day. I got myself 2 tacos, which is what I wanted. Aside from that my brother, sister-in-law and I were wanting some chicken sandwiches and chicken fajita pitas, but 2/3 of us had to resort to getting burgers since they ran out of all chicken products. With the one chicken order, we used it for my brothers chicken fajita pita, and we love the salsa that USUALLY comes with it, I asked for it and when I went to go look for it in the bag and it wasn't there, I asked for it again, a SECOND time. and they told me they were out. While waiting for our food, the people in the car behind us were ordering food, and again, I heard that they were out of rice. In my opinion, I can understand that things happen, but when you're out of this much product, I don't think your business is up and ready to run, especially if your location is open 24/7, 365/year."}
{"text":"I was pleased to discover that Jack in the Box has a 10% military discount! I stopped by after running a 5k run with a case of the late night munchies with some friends.  I ordered a vanilla iced coffee but was told they were out of vanilla syrup. I ordered a caramel iced coffee instead. The coffee was super sweet, just like I like it. For $1.99, the coffee is on the expensive side because it's small in size and filled to the brim with ice. For that price I could go to Starbucks for the same thing! Just saying.  As a vegetarian,  Jack in the Box isn't exactly my first choice for fast food.  That doesn't stop my husband,  however,  from dragging me along whenever he gets a craving for Jack in the Box. This location is closest to home and is a quick and easy option for a late night snack or lazy breakfast.   What I like about this Jack in the Box is that it's clean and riff-raff is in general kept to a minimum. The employees are always polite and our orders are placed correctly. The drive-thru always seems to take forever though...  As for food, c'mon, it's Jack in the Box!"}
{"text":"bathroom was disgusting. looked like someone puked in the sink, urinal and on the floor. seat covers all over the floor and toilet paper ass well. restaurant need to be cleaned up a little. floors were kind of dirty. service wasn't all that. customer in front of me and myself stood at the counter and waited and watched employee after employee just walk by as if we weren't even standing there. the girl working the counter was handing orders out to go that were dine in and dine that were for to go. service and cleanliness really need to be worked on. food was hot though which is why I gave a two star."}
{"text":"This is the best Jack in the Box in town. The level of customer service here is superb! It does not matter if you come in for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The management team has done an exceptional job training their staff. Although I'm not a fast food lover, I really appreciate the professionalism at this location."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service from the \"MANAGER\".  Gave us the wrong order than she flips it on me like I gave her the wrong order. Ordered TWO orders of tacos, got to the drive thru window and she tells me \"here's your two tacos\", I told her \"I ordered TWO orders of tacos two orders meaning THERE SHOULD BE 4 TOTAL\". If I wanted TWO tacos I would have said just ONE ORDER of taco. Than she rolls her eyes at us and I asked for 4 butter milk and she hands over ONE without even saying \"I'll be back with the rest\".  So of course I'm already pissed at how she gave us attitude, she comes back and I tell her \"I said 4 not one\". Than she tells me (with an attitude) \"yeah I said I was coming back for the rest\". BUT SHE DID NOT SAY THAT. She just walked away. I asked for a manager and she says \"I AM THE MANAGER\" (again with an attitude). I said are you sure you're the manager? And she says \"yes just cause I'm not wearing a polo doesn't mean, I can use whatever I want\". Like first of all you don't speak to a customer like that period. She could have said things differently. She could have apologized about having the wrong order instead of giving attitude. And everything would've been just fine. She acted as if it was hard to make two more tacos. Oh and she ended up speaking in SPANISH to her coworker, YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO SPEAK IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE WHILE WORKING! Especially during those kinds of situations. Asked for her name and she mumbled it twice cause she knows what's going to happen. Asked for my receipt and she said \"idk\" than reprinted one. Ahaha seriously."}
{"text":"Worst jack in the box ever! We order in the drive thru, and as we drive up to the window the lady starts waving us to back up. Weird we thought. Then we pay, after that she asks us to back up then pull forward. We asked why, the response we got was \" i didn't park ya\". Once again f*#+ing weird. After waiting 10 minutes for our food we get home (we only leave 2 minutes from this place) and the food tastes like it had been sitting for 2 hours and just got heated up in a microwave. Food was prepare sloppy, too much sauce, and horrible serve. The jack is not my fave and i will definitely not ever eat at this one ever again."}
{"text":"I infrequently go to Jack in the Box.   Don't get me wrong; Jack in the Box makes great burgers, sandwiches and sides.  But the only time I'll go to Jack's is in the wintertime, in which they featured the Pumpkin Pie Milkshake and Eggnog Milkshake. And I was craving for the Eggnog Milkshake after my dinner.   Another piece of technology I don't see back home is the kiosk booth to place your order for your food. As a substitute of seeing the cashier, you input what you want and how you want your food(s) and/or drink(s) customized. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=MkeNe_5lsNK9CkM4mqZMKg  And the large $2.99 seasonal milkshake is programmed in the machine. You can even request for extra whipped cream and extra maraschino cherry as one many options. I slide my Visa to pay for my treat and I get my receipt with the order number.   My milkshake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=ymC0PFMYFXXeOjZgd5QH9w  After a few minutes, the clerk yelled out my number and I finally got my milkshake.   One sip of the thick seasonal milkshake, I was instantly in the holiday spirit.  Ladies and Gentlemen: that is technology in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fast food, is what it is. As for this Jack in the Box it's all about location, location, location.  Adjacent to the gas station, which is closet to where I live. Enough said- correct lol.   I will be honest, I've only had a sandwich here, a dessert and about twice a month a will grab an iced coffee. Can't rave about the food, but the coffee is spot on! Yes, believe it.  I've wrote it here, the coffee is very good!"}
{"text":"McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King don't have nothing on Jack In The Box. The food is always fresh and they always give extra fries if you order a large. If you are having late night munchies then head over here and give them a try."}
{"text":"The girl who took my order sacia was very sweet. She is very personable. I'm very picky when it comes to food. She made my order special, witch some places say they can't do that."}
{"text":"No napkins, no bacon on my bacon ultimate cheeseburger, ordered a spicy jack and it came with no lettuce, no tomato, no swiss chesse. The curly fries were remnants of once great fries, just the hard ends and pieces. They gave us the wrong order but figured it out before we left the drive thru.   Jack, I'm not happy. I want to be happy Jack. You used to make me happy but I'm not happy now. I need to find my happiness tonight, I hope that it's possible after this disaster of a meal.   Let's make Jack in the Box great again. Please. You're all I got.   Signed, Bob"}
{"text":"Been coming to this Jack in the Box since it opened. Today was a disaster, once I got to the drive thru window it took them 7 minutes to have someone collect my money. My Ultimate Cheeseburger was way overcooked and tough. I ordered my chocolate shake with no whip, it had whip and a ton of it running down the sides of the cup. There wasn't a napkin to be found in the bag. Not good. The employees were too consumed with goofing off and talking to be bothered with the customers.  The owner needs to clean house. We as a nation voted to Make America Great Again....and so it can be with this Jack."}
{"text":"This visit here has been the worse Jack-in-the-Box visit EVER!!! I waited in line for 10 minutes before anyone ever took my order. No one was in front of me. Then they have no coke! Only Diet Coke!!!!  Then they took FOREVER to give make my order and made my order wrong. I ordered the buttery bacon and Swiss burger and it's dry. The fries are over cooked and cold. Their service was a sassy lady.   The worse thing about this whole visit is that they weren't even busy. I was the only one waiting that long to order. They people kept looking at me and ignored me. They finally took my order after 3 other people waited after me. 10 MINUTES!!! THE DRIVE THRU ONLY HAD 2 CARS!!!"}
{"text":"Same as every other jack in the box but the problem I always have with this particular place is their fries are always undercooked. I understand they're always packed but even McDonald's makes you wait for fries. Their fries are so undercooked that sometimes they're still hard. They need to thoroughly cook their fries. That's is all"}
{"text":"Someone once said that once you've been in the kitchen of a fast food restaurant you'll never eat there again. Let's just say I haven't eaten at Jack in the Box for a while. But they enticed me with their new Prime Rib burger so we happened to be nearby and decided to try it. Honestly it's not bad. They make a big point of saying that it has seasoning added, and that's most likely what gives it a taste that reminds you of prime rib. I was also reminded once again how much I prefer Jack in the Box fries over McDonalds and Burger King.  One thing that seems to set Jack in the Box apart is they always seem to be just a little less corporate feeling, maybe that's because they're a fraction of the size of the other two I mentioned. This location is clean and reasonably friendly and from what I could see they don't seem to hire any slackers."}
{"text":"How they got to 2 1/2 starts will remain a puzzle to us we are from California and grew up eating the sourdough jack so when passing through and saw this jack in the box we decided to get a little taste of home well they didn't put bacon they put American cheese and they put lettuce when I pointed out the picture to ask for my bacon she looked at it like if it was the first time she had seen it don't stop here just don't the sofa matching is disgusting too"}
{"text":"All the previous reviews dont matter. This is the best Jack in the Box I've ever been to. I always get a specialty order because I hate cheese. I always get the chicken munchie meal and turn it into a buffalo chicken sandwich. Its lit. Whenever I visit the drive through at 1 am the guy working Is precise and cares that your order is correct. For late night, this Jack in the box keeps it lit."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the quality of service here.  I can sum it up with one story.  Bringing hubby home after a grave shift, he ordered a bacon double cheeseburger, only mustard, pickles, cheese, bacon.  We get through the line, check it, there's ketchup instead of mustard.  Back through the line, get it replaced, check it, no bacon.  This is NOT rocket science.  It was correctly entered on the ticket.  A brief double check would have caught these mistakes.  When we went back through, we were handed the missing bacon in a box to place ourselves.  No apologies, no offers for anything for our inconvenience, even a drink.  Breakfast is usually accurate but abysmally slow.  Lunch is okay usually.  Dinner is both slow, inaccurate, and service is less than what I expect.  On another occasion I ordered two sourdough chicken sandwiches, and got home to have two of the country fried ones that aren't even on the MENU (they were replaced on the menu with the spicy)."}
{"text":"I have always seen the commercials and had to try it while we were in the area. I was disappointed by the burger. It ranks with McDonalds to me. The fries were the only good part of the meal. They have a lot of variety on their menu. I may try again one day."}
{"text":"Very dry food, almost like it has been sitting somewhere for hours if not days. Terrible service"}
{"text":"Worst service ever waited for 20mins to order and almost another 20mins to get my food. I payed my food and was almost given something I didnt order after cashier (Jessie) wanted to charge me again I told her I had payed already and she called me a LIER. When I was given my food I moved my car to the side to check I had everything in my bag and everything I order right when I see I get a Jr bacon cheeseburger with no cheese and noo bacon. What type of Jr bacon cheeseburger is that??. Waitting 40mins to get my order wrong and then I knocked on the door because for some reason the door was closed at 11pm when usually I would go there at 11 and the walk in was still open, the cahier would ignore me and didnt open the door so I had to go to the drive thru windown for her to pay attention to me. I wasnt given my recept I asked for it and I just got a papper saying what I order not that I had payed."}
{"text":"I get that many Yelpers do not write reviews on fast food. I am not one of them. I worked in fast food for many years, and I know that feedback is many times looked and and implemented, even by larger food chains. With that being said I have visited this Jack in the Box location quite a few times over the years and I wanted to say that I appreciate this locations hard work. This Jack in the Box has the friendliest, quickest, and professional workers out of every location I have visited. I went today through drive through, and there was a man working who asked me how my day was briefly, made sure my order was correct on the screen, offered me an up-sell (which I took, lol), and was friendly. I just wanted to say keep up the great work! This location beats the rest."}
{"text":"Woah! Jack in the box tacos are none other than the best! Love these. Had a great quick time through the drive thru! Kudos to Jack! Date night taco night!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worse jack in the box in the valley I been living here in this area for over 3 years now and who ever does the hiring there?? Sure don't know to pick them cause I swear my order is never right! Horrible service all around!!! Even neighbors talk about how horrible they are there!! They either need to close that location or fire everyone and start with new management!!"}
{"text":"This is the closest hamburger place to where I work within walking distance, so I've made a few visits to this location. I have to say that each one was suprised me with how unpleasant their customer service is. The prices at this location seem a lot higher then other jack in the box locations in the vicinity.   One Time I went in I needed to transfer some money into my bank account to buy some lunch and I had to ask what there freakin network key for their freww wi-fi was since I could not connect without it. it took somewhere around five minutes for me to be able figure it out by asking multiple employees becasue none of them bothered to stand still or tell me to wait for few minutes they just ignored me.  My last visit was this last week when I tried to get some sauce for some curley fries which are alot more expensive at this location and i found out that they charge extra for ranch if you want more then two little packets. I already paid for the fries i wasnt going to pay for individual packets of sauce. I tried to express my frustration with the manager and this was the final straw. I told him all the details of my frustration and he made no effort whatsover to try and reslove my frustration I informed him I felt close to not ever coming to this location again and here was his reply.  \"well that's your choice\"  Note: Yeah it is my choice but the guy did not try to resolve anything to keep me as a customer. There is no customer service here its all about ripping people of. I feel bad for anyone who come to this location it's horrible."}
{"text":"this place is a total waste of time I go to the drive-thru and just to take the order o most 10 minutes plus 4 wait. When is only 1 car in front of me"}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is in a good location, bathrooms were clean and food was pretty good. However, we were the only people in the building and drive thru was slow but it took a bit longer than expected to get our food out and every single table in the restaurant was dirty. They may have been understaffed but it was super slow and I feel a clean restaurant is a necessity."}
{"text":"This is a fairly typical yet rather small Jack in the Box. It has a good location and probably has enough parking most of the time.  The menu is the standard JITB menu and the tables and floor were clean when we arrived  The most redeeming feature of the Jack in the Box franchise in the Phoenix area is its inclusion in the Alaska Airlines idine program. If you use your Alaska Visa card you get airline miles for eating here. This is a definite plus if you are just looking for a quick snack and you are not overly concerned about the quality of the food.  Jack in the Box always has good curly fries and the ones here were excellent."}
{"text":"This is the only Jack in the Box that has been able to lower my opinion so many times. The service is mediocre at best, but flat horrible most of the time. I sat at the drive up box for 5 minutes only to be told they would be with me in 10 minutes. How does this place stay in business, 15 minutes for service. This will be my last visit, I have finally learned my lesson and realize that it will never change."}
{"text":"One of the workers was very impatient and rude.  When I asked for a second at the drive-thru she breathed hard and said \"oh my God\" under her breath and it was very clear through speaker.   I will say that there was an African-American man that works in the morning and he was very polite."}
{"text":"Food was up to par but an employee in the dining room ruined our experience.  She was on her cell phone during her break being so ridiculously loud. We could barely hear our own conversations.  Completely unprofessional and probably an indication of managements policies. Won't come again."}
{"text":"This is always me when eating Jack in the Box: \"ugh, why do I eat this sh... oh, this is pretty gooood.\"  lol  I try not to make fast food a habit but, when you're really in the mood for a quick breakfast or lunch, this place does the trick.  It's the closest fast food joint to my house, which is why I guess I've gone there as much as I have (3 or 4 times) versus going somewhere else like In N Out.  The place always seems clean.  The service is fine.  The food is always piping hot.  I do notice longer waits here than in other fast food chains but I think that's because they make every single thing fresh when you order (instead of having burgers stacked up ready to be handed out)."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, no matter the time of day or night, I receive one or all of 3 things:  1) Someone who DOES NOT know how to work in the Drive-Thru 2) A rude or unprofessional person at the Drive-Thru window 3) My order is screwed up or \"questionable\".  I wish there was another location nearer to me so I could avoid this one but it's down the street from my house so I'm stuck with this location.  This time was 2-fer combo of #'s 2 and 3. I drive up to the speaker and the person behind the mic sounded as if she was hurried and/or English was her second or third language. Now when you order a breakfast combo, they always ask you \"What do you want to drink\" which naturally a person will ask for a soda choice. What they don't say UNLESS YOU ASK is that getting a soda is an up-charge because the drink it comes with is coffee. COFFEE? With hashbrowns or a buttery sandwich? THAT'S DISGUSTING! It should clearly show something either on the menu or they should say it to you. I was headed home so I cold get soda from home so I ordered the coffee anyway for my food order (YUCK!) and drove up to the window.   When I got there, I thought to add a Jumbo Jack to my order so I could eat it for lunch later. I asked the window person to add it and she looked unbelievably puzzled. She asks me if I want to change my order to which I reply \"No, just add a Jumbo Jack.\" Then she goes and calls the mic person I first spoke to in which she says \"You ordered a #23 though\". I asked again, \"I just want to add a Jumbo jack to my order! Is that okay?\" They both reply with a \"Yeah, I guess\" YOU GUESS? So sorry to make you think outside of the realm of a single combo order. I finally get everything, drive off, and arrive home to find my coffee to be lukewarm anyway, just a plain hamburger Jumbo Jack with no toppings or lettuce, and a smashed bun.   As usual, crappy service, crappy food presentation, and crappy overall execution. Maybe that's why they always withhold the receipt so you can't contact their hotline or know their names? I think so."}
{"text":"The Drive thru was fast, and the service was decent. The burger was messy and how i like it. A Exit onto Bonanza would be good though."}
{"text":"Definitely love Jack in the Crack because its not to expensive., The Food and Shakes are made fresh. The desserts are tasty and they let you add stuff to your order at the menu without frowning. And if SOMEONE steals your cherry on your Strawberry SHAKE they will give you another one LOL."}
{"text":"Do not visit this location. They left an entire twist tie in my taco then told me that they didn't use the type of twist tie that was literally in the center of my taco. The manager Jessica refused to give me a refund. This place is a joke and I intend to that this higher."}
{"text":"It's a shame this place is closed. great staff and the place is clean too. I never have any complaints about this location."}
{"text":"This place is disturbing. It's dirty, sticky, greasy, and reeks of filth everywhere. And that's before any review of the food.   You gotta be kidding!"}
{"text":"i don't know why jack in the box is hyped up so much, i blame george lopez for talking about them in his comedy skits.  bad place was very small, dark, slow service. food was edible (barely), i kept spitting out my hamburger b/c the meat was chewy.  good cheap  wasted a dinner in vegas here...FAYUL"}
{"text":"Drive thru was extremely slow. By the time I received my order the food was no longer warm."}
{"text":"So I Use the drive thru to get two shakes, and they tell me no shakes. I can't backup and now I have to wait in line for more than 7 minutes. I get to the window and no even an apology. I asked the manager Christina for some comp coupons for my time and she gets nasty and tells me no. What happened to their company motto they will make your visit right?"}
{"text":"Probably the best fast food location in the entire east side in terms of franchises. I've lived over 10 years in the east side and I've never had a problem at this location. It is well managed and the drive thru is always fast and accurate"}
{"text":"The drive through didn't work. When I came inside the kid explained that it was my fault. The place was pretty dirty and the other kid cleaning was moving at a snails pace. When my food came, the fries were pretty fresh and good. The jalapeño burger was delivered to me with no jalapeños and no burger. I showed the kid at the counter and it blew his mind, lol. I know it's fast food, but come on guys... make an effort."}
{"text":"If I could have given -0 I would have done so. Employee Nayeli was preparing drinks (all ice coffee).  She filled the cups and then carried all three over with her fingers in the glasses. Really??????  When I advised of what she did and I wanted ad new one, her body language and facial expression was of anger. She did not verbally acknowledge my complaint, smirked the entire time. She went and prepared a new drink.   How she thought this was okay after handling cash, I am baffled.  I am certain this is a regular occurrence.  My son works for the Clark County Health Department  and I will be filing a complaint.   I understand she was busy and may have not been mindful of what she was doing. However, her attitude and lack of professionalism and customer service is not acceptable."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review I thought I would call the location first to speak with a manager but I guess they don't know how to answer their phone. The people at this location are so rude they took forever to respond at the drive-thru and when they did it was two or three people speaking at the same time. And on top of that the menu boards prices are not the same as what they charge. When I decided to just cancel my order because it was a joke how everything was being handled as I passed by the drive-through they're standing there laughing this is what kind of customer service these people have I get it they don't get paid enough but come on,  just stay at home."}
{"text":"The young lady that took my order at the drive thru really did a good job!  She was clear and concise and she spoke well.  I got my order and it was 100% correct and it was hot.   One of the best services I have received from a Jack n the Box."}
{"text":"I'm always here and they absolutely suck. They ALWAYS not once but every single time I go or my boyfriend goes they forget to give me at least one item. EVERY SINGLE TIME! Wth I'm paying for it stop fucking up my order."}
{"text":"if i could put a negative on the stars i would do so!! this by far is one of the most worst experience i have ever had at ANY food place. It started off with me needing to use the restroom, so i entered jack in the box, there were no signs anywhere stating restrooms are for customers only. As I walked towards the restroom and try opening it, the door was locked. I went up to the security guard, whom works there, letting him know what was going on. before I could even finish my statement he rudely looks at me up and down and says in the most rudest manner, \"the bathrooms are for paying customers\" OK 1. how can you look at someone and assume they have no money? 2. you would've said it in a nicer manner. i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that? whatever happened to the customer's are always right? i immediately demanded to speak to a manager, while i was telling the manager what was wrong he seemed as if he did not care what i was saying, he didn't pull the guy to the side and talk to him, or even apologize to me for his employees behavior. i pulled out my receipt for the rude racist and judgmental security guard and he pushed the buzzer to unlock the restroom. i walked to the restroom door to try opening it and it still didn't open, i turned to the security guard and stated the restroom still isn't opening, he then says\" well you have to wait til someone gets out\" (still in a rude tone) i say\"well it says vacant\" he then says\" well it's not so...\"  like how was i suppose to know it was occupied when it says vacant? and why didn't he tell me that before buzzing me in?  while waiting in  for the restroom to become vacant, i realized more and more customers were entering jack i the box and the security guard was being just as rude to them. some were so furious they walked out of the store cursing. its crazy because some customers he allowed in without showing him a receipt while others he harassed, yelled at and embarrassed as what he had done Me. I came down to Arizona for my daughter's 21st birthday and it was the worst experience in all my travels of any state. I am sad to say this but i will Not be returning any time soon. the blatant rudeness and disrespect was not okay, i have been employed with customer service jobs and I have had food thrown at me, spit at and cursed to and still have i never taken that out on any customer. the fact that the manager didn't say or do anything didn't even help how hurt i felt, i guess it goes to show you no matter where you go there is ugly everywhere."}
{"text":"Since this was close to my hotel, I went over here on a Saturday morning for a to go breakfast & lunch.  One nice touch is that you can order any menu item 24 hours a day.  The down side to that is a burger during breakfast hours adds a bit of wait time.  The Ultimate Breakfast sandwich included ham and egg - good sized portion.  Free wifi while I waited was nice.  Wish Jack's would come to Raleigh!"}
{"text":"I have visited this store about 5 times now, 3 times by drive thru 2 times dinning inside.  1 the service has always been fast and friendly no matter if it is early in the morning or mid after noon.  2.  Inside of the store is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"This is a decent jack in the box.  Quick to make food inside or through the drive thru. Friendly staff. I've had no problems and would go again."}
{"text":"Service was not at all what I expected for a slow third shift night. The employee taking my order was very rude and seem to rush me while I was ordering even though I already knew what I wanted all I asked for was no lettuce on tacos and he made a comment. After all that still they shorted me to Fry's and the tacos ended up having lettuce on them I called customer service 800 number left a detailed message and they never got back to me even after leaving my order number time date Etc this is not the first time it's happened that's why I'm leaving this comment I've lost probably $30 just dining with them and getting back home and having my order incomplete or just discussing where I couldn't eat it"}
{"text":"Wow! I just stopped in to order b-fast. I didn't mind the longer than normal wait with only one other family in the store. The lady that took .y order never thanked me or told me my order number. Just handed me my receipt, looked at me, then turned around to joke with her \"co-workers\". Then when my food was ready I heard a her ya go. Didn't know if that was for me so I turned to look and she was staring at me. So far I have heard F#@$ and A$$hole come out of her mouth since I've been here for 15 minutes. Hire more professional people please!!! There should be a way to post 0 stars."}
{"text":"This jack is always the spot for the midnight muchies/hunger!! But today was a cherry popper for me.. I just want to thank the brother DAVE!! This guys is the most professional polite gentleman i encountered! I just had one of those \"damn i wish that was me\" moments happen to me for the first time! I was amazed and very thankful. All i gotta say is this guy needs a raise or a promotion! You dont encounter kind and generously considerate people like this anymore. If i was a girl id be on it! LOL"}
{"text":"I've been at this jack not once but 4 times  I get rushed when I'm ordering and they are rude! They talk to me like I'm retarded. They always forget something! There is never one day I can go  Without them forgetting my fries or onion rings. I only get a 20 min Brake that's why I go here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I went to jack n the box to use a coupon  Buy one get one free  They would only accept cash  and so I had to go to the bank  Evelyn the manager would not accept the use of a coupon  What a waste and an inconvenience  They should at least give one for free and honor the coupon anyway  Completely worthless"}
{"text":"Were do I start. Curly fries here aren't curly they are crooked. My jalapeño poppers? Burnt to a crisp. My tacos? About 30 mins old.  I asked for a jumbo jack and received a Jr jumbo jack. I get to my hotel to feed my starving kids and come to find one of my child's order missing. I call to get a refund and refused unless proved receipt so I call and was put on a 45 min wait. So I gave up and made a corporate complaint . Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. Person in window barely spoke English. Had a horrible experience and complained and never even heard back from them nor the company. Will never go back to this location....ever."}
{"text":"So of the dumbest people working there... You ask for a \"Big Cheeseburger\" plain, they give you bread and meat no cheese.  Oh and then you call them to fix it and they don't pickup the phone.  Their excuse is the company hasn't bought them a new $9 phone.  Terrible service!"}
{"text":"This is not about the food but about my service as a customer. I get off work pretty late and sometimes want to eat something quick so I can go home and crash. Today I got off about 3am, pretty hungry and happy no one was in the drive lane. So I pull up and order my tacos and get to the window and pay. Nicholas was the guy who took my order and money. He asked me if I wanted any taco sauce and I told him I'd like 2 ranch and 2 red hot. He looked at me and said 'really....? 4 sauces for two tacos ?' And continued staring at me as if I requested too many. He continued to awkwardly stare at me, I thought he was joking but quickly realized he wasn't. And I replied 'yes' he then responded by saying 'be careful with that bcs jack in the box limits how many sauces ppl can receive' I replied, 'oh I've never heard of that' he said 'yeah my manager gets really crazy with that because some people want 15 ranches with their order and take it home.' I said, 'oh, well I  really use 1 red hot and 1 ranch for each taco sooo...' He then said 'I'll give to you but be careful.' First off, though it may have been extremely early in the morning I was very kind to this guy and not once did I try to argue with him. I know this is fast food and if he insisted on charging me I would have paid for the sauces. It being really late Im not really looking for chit chat I just wanted the food I paid for and to leave. I don't appreciate my integrity as a customer getting questioned for 4 sauces especially since I am a PAYING customer and I do like my tacos to be pretty saucey. Now this is not that big of a deal but I myself work in food and beverage and if the customer is paying give them what they want. I get that if something is free to not abuse it but over 4 sauces ? It just seemed stupid to question that."}
{"text":"How many time does it take to tell someone your order?  Well I told that Spanish girls 5 times what I wanted and the B&$@! Still got it wrong so I drove off....Very bad service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place had a horrible smell to it when we walked in. It smelled as if their sewer was backed up. Our orders were all messed up and they didn't care. My burger was very hard and the bread was stale. Just as we were leaving the kid working the register hopped over the counter and went outside and pulled his car up on the curb and plugged it in to charge it. This also blocked us from getting out of the entrance. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Really Really  went in the drive threw for lunch and just wanted two monster tacos and a chicken sandwich and I got grief for the tacos really it goes as so hello I'd like two monster tacos . other side we have two tacos for a dollar .me oh are they not available anymore . them they are but they are frozen and would have to cook them but we can get you two  regular for a dollar  are you fing kidding me really . the pure lazyness of it and disappoint I love jack in the box but that was beyond lazy"}
{"text":"The drive thru was a little but not bad and the girls voice was soothing and kind on the ears. She was well mannered and prompt with the food. Jack in the box is kinda like the caddilac of fast food most of the time it's great but once in a while it really messes you up...I guess we will see in about 12 hrs"}
{"text":"Food was good at this location... Morning service was the worst ever... Don't stop here if your in a rush in the morning take my word for it."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is the worst location I've ever been too. I walked in and saw an African American man needing to use the restroom, he asked for the code and the lady by the name of Jessica rudely said that he can't have the code because bathrooms are for customers only, I quickly intervened and offer to pay for this mans food so that he can use the restroom. The rude lady denied and said I couldn't do that! And at that part, I got upset and started asking for the manager and she says I am the manager. I asked her if my money was good here and she said no it's not , you need to leave. I was so upset about how me and that poor African American man was treated. I will never go to this Jack in the Box ever again. I called and asked for the general manager and the corporate number and she refused to provide any information to me. Please do not support this racist corrupt business. Theirs a place right across the street called Lenny's burger that place has way better food, a drive thru and way better customer service. No wonder why this Jack in the crack only has two stars ?"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, only two guys working behind the counter, our food came out pretty quick but the people after us were in line for a long time, 2 ppl actually walked out mumbling how long they were taking.   Drive thru service seem to be quicker since they seemed more focused on those customers. If I'm in a pinch and super hungry and in the area, will be back."}
{"text":"Oh jack in the box, why would you get rid of my one and only favorite sandwich, well item, period, on your menu. The grilled cheese sandwich was my absolute favorite.   Oh anyways, the breakfast is alright for fast food breakfast. Sweet tea is good. Curly fries are the only way to go!"}
{"text":"I use to hate this place because people always messed up my order and had the worst attitudes. They  would basically throw my food at me . I decided to stop through today because my little brother was really wanting their tacos.. Sara is an employee there and I freaking love her! I don't know when they hired her but it must have been the best decision they ever made. Our order was perfect and she was so nice and professional! Thank you Sara we will be seeing you soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I just went to this particular jack in the box, which used to be my favorite because they had great customer service. Not only did they give me the wrong shake, when I got home I took a drink and water bug shell was in my mouth. After swirling it with my straw I could see the entire bug was mixed in. I will never go here again. I am so disgusted."}
{"text":"I am far from happy . So because I could not get the coupon number right the girl rolled her eyes at me her name was Sakura or some sort of oh Beast person who obviously eats more food than I do giving it away and this person went out of her way to make me feel like I was inferior when she's working in the fast food restaurant this Jack in the Box is by far the worst I've ever dealt with an all of my 30 years of being a patron at this store"}
{"text":"Most Jacks are usually the same to me. Fast service and they usually taste the same. Nothing different here. Friendly staff that always smile and sound happy. Added an extra star just because they ask me what kind of sauce I want every time. Many other Jack's don't ask that."}
{"text":"I'm just letting you know, do NOT eat here! I have been in the drive through for 12 min now. ( started with 4 cars in front of me, still have two in front if me as I type this out) all I gotta say is, this shizz better be good. Holy cow man!"}
{"text":"Just spent $7.91 on a medium sized #8 combo, Chipotle jalapeno burger combo. This is the worst burger I have ever had. The picture on the menu board makes a disingenuous representation of the actual product being thrown together and pushed out of the window. What pinches my panties is that these workers assembling food at the majority of the fast food restaurants around think that they are worth $12-15 an hour, I beg to differ. They need to seriously re think the life choices they have made to this point in their lives and they need to get retrained to at least try to BS the customers that are paying the wages for these workers to think they are actually worth more money per hour. At least when the living wage gets  ramped up, only the strong will survive and many of the sub par restaurants will close."}
{"text":"I spoke too soon. Went back and they cheated me on a whole chicken sandwich. On an order that only had three items, they couldn't even remember one of the three."}
{"text":"I live a block from this jack in the box for the past 5 years and have had countless good experiences with it.  Until recently that is...   My last order was ruined by mayonnaise and cheese on everything, ewwww, not so bad really but when i brought it back i had to deal with 3 different people telling me how i was incorrect and that i recieved the order i had placed, (after years of ordering the same thing i think I know what I want)...   Today though takes the cake.   Not only did they forget my spicy chicken sandwich and give me a stale bunned burger my wife's jumbo jack had some thin gross looking ranch type sauce on it and the bun was soaked in grease/water/ranch stuff i'm not even sure.  To top it off when my oldest son opened his burger wrapper there was a bite taken out of it (the burger not the wrapper)  I am done, done done with this place and they are lucky I am not your typical american with my hand over the attorneys  speed dial, cause that's just nasty.  Plus with no cars in the parking lot and none in the drive through I still was asked to park and had to wait for ten minutes befor  this terrible meal was delivered to me.  horrible experience, absolutely disgusted with this jack in the box on university and stapley."}
{"text":"It was very good experience, everything smooth I got exactly what I ordered very fast and people were extremely friendly.  I don't leave these for chains, but I definitely had a good experience."}
{"text":"Monday 25th May 1am Guy that took my order was very polite and courteous  Order was quickly ready even though there were people ahead of me I was skeptical because I visited before and had two very negative experiences from staff fighting amongst each other to a 15 min wait in drive thru This time it was good"}
{"text":"I popped in here looking to see if they had any antenna balls. They were out and were getting new ones in, but didn't know exactly when. They had a picture to show me what they looked like but that didn't really help me.  I grabbed a Jumbo Jack while I was in. It was tasty and gave me my taste of JITB that I can't get in Canada."}
{"text":"Im not surprised to enter yelp and see 2 and a half stars on this place. I wish I checked before because it's the worse jack in the box around. Worst service ever. People waiting 30-40 for \"fast food\" And rude employees. It's a joke. Don't waste your time. Horrible."}
{"text":"Not a lot of options around here. This Jack in the Box has a nice clean dining room, so it's not a bad choice if you're stranded in the area. Also, the restrooms are kept clean through use of an electronic lock system. I'm guessing it was inspired by Sheriff Joe's nearby facilities.   The fare is standard Jack in the Box. Service seems fine. No problems except the soda machine on this day. No sugar free or caffeine free beverages available in the infinite option coke machine, a big problem for me."}
{"text":"2am Taco fix?????  Look no further than Jack in the Box to help soak up your booze filled tummy and make you feel much better in the am.  I won't condone eating here when you are sober unless you are really in need of something fast."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick bite and the especially feminine male cashier forgot our curly fries like three times. He was like \"Omigawwwd I totally forgoooot.\" Then five minutes later, he screamed and jumped away from the frier-- \"Omigawwwd I'm like, so scared it's gonna burn me!\"  It took literally fifteen minutes from when we ordered our food to get our stupid plastic trays full of crap. I thought this joint was supposed to have \"fast\" food. We sat in the dining room, which might have been our first mistake. Oh well.  Also, our tacos had way too much lettuce and not enough meat. Boo, Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would..... This is not a reflection of the actual location or food but solely based upon the attitude of the employees. I wanted to make 2 separate orders to pay separately with 2 credit cards. I placed the first order informed the order taker I needed to do a second and he said \"you can't do more than one order in drive through and only cash and card spilt payments but you can come in the lobby\" mind you cars in front cars in back of me. I say screw it and only order my friends food. I get to the window and say, \"it would be convenient if there was a sign\" the girl gets an attitude and says something while walking away which apparently was \"the lobby is open\" THATS NOT THE ISSUE!!! I just spent my time in the drive through bc I did not know this was the policy!!!! I have no problem getting out of my car to walk in! The point is I'm already in the drive through with out a way to get out! Mind you none of this I said to her, she continues to talk mess with her coworkers which I can clearly see her doing! Fast food is not that serious!!! With an attitude like hers she will remain in fast food the rest of her life!"}
{"text":"I used to like this jack in the box,  but not any more. They just charged me nine bucks for a number ten. The menu displays just under seven bucks, but what what ever. I don't even like fast food.  I don't like it even more when i get two dollars in tax for something under ten bucks. I guess it's about convenience"}
{"text":"This place is not very good. I quit eating here after the second time I found hair in my food"}
{"text":"So Ive. Been holding back this review for 2 weeks, to see if it could be resolved but has not.  I went there ordered burgers Togo got home \"NO BEEF NO PATTIES \"lettuce sauce bun. Wtf talked to manger ohhhuuu nothing can do. Hey give me what I paid for. FYI no help from the corporate office same response"}
{"text":"Went through drive through for a quick bite. I asked for nacho cheese to go with my curly fries. Imagine my disappointment when i get home and open a box of melted shredded cheese, not the nacho cheese I paid extra for. I thought it wouldn't be too bad, I could just eat it with the bbq sauce I asked for, yet again, I got honey mustard instead of the bbq sauce i asked for. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru and holy heck are they S-L-O-W!!!! We must have waited for our food for more than 10 minutes. Think they were still trying to hunt down the chicken and cows for our meals. Then to make it worse my teriyaki chicken bowl was all rice and about 5 of the most pathetic slices of chicken."}
{"text":"Too bad most people only give negative reviews (and it's usually based on one visit). I just moved to this neighborhood in April. After 10 /11PM, your only drive thru options are In n Out and JITB. In n Out is really only one specific meal, and you can get tired of it if you have it too often. I was wary of going to JITB based on the past several years of constant disappointment. The employees were always indifferent/rude and completely incompetent. Every single time I went, my order was messed up in some major way. I went less and less, cursing myself each time for trying again just for the same hassle. It made no sense because the employees and management changed fairly regularly. It seemed like JITB purposely scrapes the bottom of the employee barrel. Sad, because JITB at one time was so important to me, I refused to move anywhere that didn't have it (major reason I didn't move to Nebraska).  That being said... ONE employee has brought my faith in JITB back. His name is Kendell. He has served me three times now, and every time (around 11PMish), he is polite and courteous, COMPETENT, and efficient. I'm slightly high-maintenance with customization, and my order has yet to be wrong in any way (he even remembers the extra ice... rare!). Props to the cooks too. :) Just tonight, as I was waiting for my food to be ready, I couldn't help but notice his multi-tasking. He even noticed one of the soda machine syrups was empty and swapped it out. I can guarantee you that the other locations would just let it remain \"out of order\". They all seemed extremely lazy. I introduced myself and asked if he was the manager (honestly, he's WAY more competent than most general managers I've dealt with). He isn't, but I told him he should be.  I'm writing this review mainly to let management and JITB know that there is talent in Kendell. I really hope he is acknowledged for his great attitude and hard work, and if I were in charge, I'd get him into management training ASAP. When a company has an employee with potential, it's wise to retain that person, before a random customer that owns a business makes an offer of employment on the spot. It's happened to me three times. I have also been a manager, so trust me when I say truly good employees are few and far between."}
{"text":"Ran through the drive thru this morning. Why cant I find anyone in America who speaks English anymore? Spent 5 minutes at the box trying to order, surprisingly they actually got the order right after numerous (and I mean numerous) corrections because they a no comprende. I refuse to speak Spanish in this Country. Thank God for those monitors outside to make sure they get it right. Other then that the order was correct, hot & tasty. I like the Ultimate Breakfast sandwiches and had the hankerin for one."}
{"text":"$7 for a sourdough jack. The prices are ridiculously too high might as well go out to a nice restaurant. I wont ever come back. They also need to lose the fake pre-recorded lady at the drive through whats up with that.."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new jack place in Vegas. I overall never had a problem here except for one time when the order taker in the drive-thru could not get the concept of switching the cheese on the spicy jack chicken sandwich. It was a little frustrating.  I have been back several times after that and never had a problem. The food comes out quickly considering that it's made fresh."}
{"text":"I get great customer service everytime I come. Everyone is nice and friendly. The food is nice and got and my drinks are as I order them."}
{"text":"Worse service ever at this location. The person working the window is talking so soft you can barely hear him when placing the order and then at the window he talks even softer. Keep thinking that the service would get better but it doesn't. Hands you the food and drinks but doesn't say thank you that completes your order."}
{"text":"Don't spend your money here. I purchased curly fries here the other day and have been sick ever since. I am not sure what they are doing in that kitchen, but unless you are looking to vomit and feel like trash, spare yourself and drive by this \"establishment\""}
{"text":"Why in the world is it legal for you to advertise your store as 24 hours if your cash registers \"mandatorily\" close between the hours of 4am-5am. Extremely misleading and illegal false advertising. I've never been more frustrated with a fast food chain."}
{"text":"After munching on just peanuts and sun flower seeds and a long night fishing at lake mead we had to stop at the drive-thru heading home to re-energize. Tried the new chipotle sandwich and it was tasty.  I give it 3 stars for good service and food."}
{"text":"I don't go here too often, but I have fond memories of this franchise since I was a kid, and you could order into the clown.  Well, we went today because we wanted breakfast after a grueling trip to the airport and lots of errands.  They offer a full menu 24 hours a day.  I love that concept, but  what we got was a mediocre breakfast with serious sanitary issues!     There was hair in our food, and due to the fact that we waited until we got home to eat, we were just \"SOL.\"  A ten dollar pile of warm garbage, hairs included."}
{"text":"I have to say...this is probably the worst Jack in The Box ever!  Sad too, since it's the closest one to my house.  I have been here about half a dozen times, but I am never coming back.  Reasons why...........  1. Unfriendly service-  Go to the drive thru and I hear a monotone voice come on, \"What are you having?\"  Same monotone, unhappy in person look once I get to the window.  This has happened multiple times! 2.  Crappy food-  I crave Jack in the Box Tacos every so often.  Every time I have been here, the tacos are a soft mess.  They are the greasiest tacos in the world, and are never crunchy.  I have experienced this once or twice before at other JITB, but this one has had limp, greasy tacos EVERY time I have ordered them here.  Also, have been out of certain items (jalapeno poppers) multiple times.  How does that happen?   3.  Long lines-  Takes forever and a day to get your food here!  JITB is usually pretty quick with the drive thru line, but not here.  They lag and take their time.  I'm over it.  I will drive to the one down on Waddell.  This Jack in the Box sucks!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a breakfast sammich and to use the restroom while working today. There was no tp in the women's room and when I alerted the worker behind the counter she told me she will get to it when she can. I asked her for napkins because Aunt Flo wasn't going to wait for her ass. 20 mins later, still no tp in the bathroom. I left a stack of napkins in there for other people to use. No Bueno!!!"}
{"text":"I went with a buddy who wanted to get some tacos and a breakfast sandwich.  I had an Iced Tea and for what it's worth, it was good.  So here is why I gave the place 2 stars:  We walked in and the place wasn't that busy but the employees were running around like they were slammed.  There was no line when we ordered and asked the girl behind the counter how she was... She said she was \"Stressed Out\".  But, she was cute about it and didn't let it deter her from trying to give good customer service.  So, I give her one of the stars because she had personality and a good smile.  As we were waiting there was one person who was waiting for her order.  As we stood there waiting; we watched what was going on in the kitchen.  They were giving out wrong orders at the drive thru and had to redo things.  Buzzers were going off and not answered.  Anyhow, we got our order before the girl who was before us.  It took about 15 minutes for us to get in and out.  But, who knows, maybe we caught them at a bad time."}
{"text":"Do the owners and or managers even read there reviews? You would think that after so many poor reviews , they would look into their customer service at this location and either fire or retrain their employees so they can produce a quality product and quality friendly and competent customer service. Word to the wise if you don't like your job find a new one. people pay for service and convenience. Take pride in your work, even if it is fast food!"}
{"text":"I ordered a number one with churros and a chocolate cake. I drive all the way home (which is a distance from this location) and I open the bag to see that half my order was missing. Of course I was mad due to the fact I spent $14 and only got half of what I ordered"}
{"text":"Awful! Awful! Awful! If I could give it ZERO starts I really would. First off, they forgot to give us half of our order and when I called to let them know the lady Brittney know she didn't seem to nice about the situation. She said we can come back and pay for the remaining food. Mind you, I already paid for it! So me already being home I also noticed BLOOD ON MY SODA CUP!! Like really?? Horrible place. Never returning."}
{"text":"We've lived in this area for about 5 months. We've given this place multiple chances and they are definitely hit or miss. This is the 3rd time they've been \"out\" of ice cream for shakes."}
{"text":"It took about 12 minutes to get my breakfast meal. Trust me, the place was not packed. This is supposed to be fast food right?"}
{"text":"Okay so I love Jack in the Box. Yummy food and a fairly reasonable price. In my opinion the two best things on that menu are the sausage egg and cheese biscuit and the mini churros. However, I had a coupon for 3 mini croissant donuts things with the purchase of a sandwich so I just got the sandwich no churros today. So....why only 3 stars? I am removing a star because of rudeness... they called my number and I went up to get my order and was told \"um that isn't your food\" and I showed them the order number and they're like \"oh okay yeah I guess you can take it\"  and one for the fact that I requested BBQ and honey mustard when asked about sauce and I did not  receive any sauce. However, the food was still good."}
{"text":"David the drivethru was very nice and great employee handled me very well he needs a raise !!!"}
{"text":"Really bad service at this location very bad attitude from Bernice and the manager Lettica. We went through the the drive thru and order 5 meals when we got home we were missing one of the order, we called the store to tell them we were missing a order, the manager Christine told us that they would replace the missing order, just come back next time and mention her name and that she would leave our name on a board for us. When we went to order our replacement order we talked with Bernice at the counter and asked to speak with Christine and that she had promised to replace the one order that we paid for on our last visit. Bernice told us that there was no information that she could not find for us and that she could not replace the missing burger, I did ask to speak to the manager, which Bernice told us that the manager was busy, I did then ask her for a district manager name and number. Which she refused and walked away from us. The manager Lettica did finally came out to explain to us that they have homeless people trying to get free food from them, I was not looking for a free meal, I was looking to pay for 4 meals and see if I could get the meal I paid for on the last visit. After being compared to a homeless I then took my business elsewhere. I still would like to hear from a district manager to let them know how disappointed I am with this store. I know going through the drive thru this does happen, but going inside to recieve this kind of service is not acceptable.   Dave F"}
{"text":"I work graveyard and I always stop here in the early morning. Almost every time I have had a great experience really fresh food, but today I ordered a peach tea and it wasn't peach at all. it was so bad I couldn't drink it & that's what I went there for."}
{"text":"Used the drive thru on our way home.  Food tasted fine and staff was okay."}
{"text":"I went here at 1:30 in the morning and I was happily greated by Sean. He was in a good mood and treated us perfectly especially having us be there so late. Will be back just in hopes to see him."}
{"text":"The only downfall - homeless ppl in and out of the facility begging for food. I wouldn't mind helping out with food or money, but not while I'm eating."}
{"text":"Fast Food has become a necessity with my new position and today's choice was Jacks place.  It's close by and I have not been there in some time so we checked it out....  Never have I been a fan of the drive through so Melissa and I went inside to place the orders even though we were going to take it with us....probably a better choice as the drive through was packed.  Todays choice was the Sourdough Steak Sandwich with Curley Fries and a fountain soda. I also opted to try out their Two-Taco's-For-$.99 deal.  Melissa had the Chicken Fajita Pita combo.   The counter person was Perfcta, although I thought her name tag was different.  She was courteous, efficient and seemed to care that she was offering great service.  A nice surprise in any fast food joint.  My food was delivered quickly and was still quite hote when we arrived back at the office to eat.  The sandwich was actually quite good, a nice change from the satandard everyday burger.  The tacos were a bt greasy and I would say to save this for days when you are broke or needing a hang-over remedy as they will be more like a scoop of Draino to my system!!  Mel says her Pita was great...its seems this is what she always orders as its consistantly the same and always good.  So, whats the rating??  I would go back.  The service was fast, the food was hot and the person behind the counter made me feel valued.  I will be saving the taco's for my next night out drinking!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"What a joke. You got to be kidding me. We went there and ordered a simple crap breakfast, eggs burnt, hash browns cold coffee taste like water when my wife went to the counter the supervisor or manager whatever she was just tried to explain how good it was, they remade the eggs and were still overcooked, she tried to explain they were pre made. SO WHAT make the new eggs. We got a refund for the nasty breakfast trash and left, only thing okay was the OJ. Customer service was a negative 5. what a disaster of a place, sad state of service, you should be ashamed of yourself, stop blaming the customer, smile and try to correct it not explain why your a disaster. What a joke. CLOSE if you don't want to take care of your guests, the person's name who was POOR at customer service and rude was ALEIZZA. Get rid of her she was RUDE and a negative employee. She needs to get out of customer service forever,"}
{"text":"Yes, it's fast food. Yes, I know what I'm signing up for when my car pulls up to the drive through window. I know it's not five-star dining, and I don't expect it to be.   Was my burger piping hot like one you would find at Cowbell? No.  Could it have been a little warmer for my personal taste? Probably.  Was it cold? Absolutely not.   I made a breakfast (healthy, I know) out of their new Sriracha burger. Tons of spicy sauce, perfect amount of cheese to burger ratio. The lettuce was a little less than desirable, but it met the expectations I had. It wasn't a treat like my dinner at Roosters, but it was a bit of a treat as the chain has yet to make it to the northeast Florida region. Maybe one day..."}
{"text":"Definitely not going back to this Jack in the Box again. We were the only customers in the drive through. Two people kept trying to answer the speaker box, confusing both us and themselves. When they finally got it right on the screen we pulled up to the window. We were handed a drink first. I'm glad I tasted it right away because I ordered Dr. Pepper but they gave me Coke. The rest of our order was a sirloin burger, onion rings, jumbo jack, and curly fries. We were handed a bag and told to have a nice day. I looked in the bag before we drove away and it only had a sirloin burger and curly fries and the box of fries was only half full. We told the window guy that we were missing onion rings and another burger. They asked us to wait. At this point cars are getting backed up in the drive through line. When he came back we asked him to fill up the fries which thankfully he did. Eventually a girl came to the window with the onion rings and burger and told us to wait another minute. Apparently she was waiting for the sirloin burger the guy had already given us. Finally got it all sorted out. Food was below the par of what I would expect from Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"I seem to never get a receipt and the price always seems higher than what's on the menu- I'll order breakfast with a soda and the total is $1 more, I think somethings not right"}
{"text":"Service and food have really gone downhill at Jack in the Box. They have the absolute worst fish sandwich I have ever had . I was so disappointed I don't even want to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty legit Tacos and fast. Went here with my brother and the drive through was quick, although the tacos were greasy but its fast food!"}
{"text":"WORST JACK IN THE BOX EVER! So much for being 24/7. There was 1 car at the window and about 2 in front of me. I waited for about 30 mins and still was in the same spot. I ended up leavening. Not very happy and still hungry."}
{"text":"Service was super, super slow. We ordered 3 White Chocolate Peppermint Shakes. C said; \"taste chemically\" K said; \"tastes like there's Cherry flavoring mixed in with the Peppermint\" I said; \"the test market that gave this crap a thumbs up has no idea what good food tastes like\"  None of us drank more than a few sips & we threw them away. $11+ down the drain."}
{"text":"Jack's is what it is. And if everything was normal everyday stuff, I would toss out 3 stars. But this was kind of a joke. I order the kid's cheeseburger combo ($4.19) with fries & drink for C. Nothing on it but the cheese with extra extra extra extra pickles. I guess I wasn't clear enough. What C got was a cheeseburger with 1 pickle. C said the burger was kind of blah and a bit overcooked. Plus, he was bumming about the pickle drought. Now the dude working the counter was Roberto. And his name tag said \"in training\" so I'll let it slide. But ... The dining room had 3 dirty tables with debris scattered on each one. There was NO ONE ELSE in the place & we were there between 5:30 & 5:50 Tuesday night. Hmmm, that should have been my first clue. Then there was the fly that kept \"bugging\" us. Aaarrrghh! I hate flies and especially when you're eating. Mediocre food. Dirty dining room. Pesty fly. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Do you like paying for food that you'll never get???  If so, then this is the place for you!    I guess at some point I should be blaming myself for going back.    Should you be desperate enough to venture here then check your order before you drive away or be prepared to wait 20 minutes in line again. Also be prepared to be parked each time so they can keep their drive-thru stats up.   I did give one star as the staff is usually friendly, just can't seem to complete an order correctly."}
{"text":"Awful. Every time.  First, it's hard to hear the person on the speaker. Or at least it was when I have gone. And I've gone more than a few times since it's close to home.  I have never been satisfied with a single experience here. Either my order was wrong or they ran out of what I wanted or it took a century to go through the line.  The last (and I'm convinced it was actually my literal last) time I went, I had spent the day hearing over and over about their new bacon burger on the radio. By evening I had decided to give into marketing and temptation and try it. Got there, waited a gosh darn eternity before I could even order, and then actually finally ordered.  They didn't have it anymore. Did they run out? Did they discontinue it (no)?, did they forget how to assemble it? No idea. But they told me they didn't have it anymore and asked if there was something else I wanted. There wasn't. So I spent a lifetime in line, and drove away with nothing.  Combined with my other bad experiences, it spells the end of them getting my occasional business (which clearly they weren't trying to keep in the first place, so no loss for them I guess)."}
{"text":"What a waste of $7.50.  I came in today because of the attractive $4.99 combo with spicy chicken.  Obviously that's a scam to bring in more foot traffic since I didnt order not a thing extra (it comes with fry drink and sandwich automatically).  Pretty sure tax doesnt come out to $2.50 on a $4.99 order.  I should've told them never mind.  Only reason I didnt is bc they had already started on it since it was so dead in there.  Now I know why."}
{"text":"Ricky at the front counter he the most dope food taker the world I'll highly recommend this Jack In The Box who ever is faded just saying"}
{"text":"I really like this jack in the box, the people are always nice and the food is always hot! When I had to wait for my burger, I didn't order a drink i was standing near the register off to the side they handed me a free drink and thanked me for waiting."}
{"text":"Saddest thing ever is jack in the box has the best food but the shittiest customer service. I walked in today, did not get greeted, cashier (Rose) took our order when she wanted to. Didn't read my order back to me, did not tell me my price. She pointed at the screen & expected us to just know. The phone was ringing throughout my entire lunch there. I'm not tying to ever go back there again"}
{"text":"The worst location aside from the east side. Always reheated fries, missing items, rude employees. I live next door to this location and it never fails to disappoint... Never has my order been correct. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great service for a fast food chain and the time that I went, at around 4 am. Drive thru crew were all very professional and courteous. I Had a craving for Curly fries and buttermilk and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Terrible unprefessional service. They have messed up on our orders multiple times. I dont know why I return to that place but I will never go back after my last visit. The drive through guy was very rude and his attitude was uncalled for. His name was Ronnie. He will cut you off while talking and throw your food in the bag carelessly to make a complete mess of everything."}
{"text":"Some of the worse service I have ever received from a Jack in a Box. Instantly we were bumped out of the way from an employee while we were walking in, than she came back in an gave us horrible service starting with \"alright what do you want \" than one of our ultimate cheeseburgers came out with only 1 patty and we we're scared to go complain cause we thought we would get spit in our food, was absolutely awful never coming here again"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this Jack in the Box 4 stars because the dude that works there sometimes slips us free things for no reason. Like a Siracha burger or puts fries in the bag and adds an extra scoop. Why? I don't know. But he'll mention its in the bag when we leave, so its not an accident. But I shall not ask questions. Just eat my deliciously free 7 dollar burger with my favorite hot sauce on it.   Or because when we want to ride our bikes through the drive-thru, sometimes they don't mind! I'm pretty sure thats illegal, but yay jack in the box! Did I mention they give you dog treats if you ask for them?  Actually I like this jack in the box now that I've written the pros, I would give this Jack in the Box 5 stars is they were consistent with the quality of the food they produce. One night my Homestyle Chicken Sandwich will look like something out of commerical and other times I'm like WTH IS THIS!?!?!   Or for the stingy lady with the buttermilk ranches. Listen, If I order 6 different entrees, I deserve at least 6 buttermilk ranches. Quit trying to hold out on the wealth.. I'm pretty sure they don't deduct them from your paycheck.   That is all for now."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger combo for breakfast. Fries tasted like they been over a heat lamp and some of them were even cold   Ewwww"}
{"text":"The girls that work their aren't very friendly at all, but John & Jose (I'm pretty sure those are their names) are awesome! They always strike up conversations and remember me when I come in the drive thru. They seem stoked to be there and I just love that. Oh and the late night munchie meal thing is amazingly good."}
{"text":"This restaurant kinda sucks. When I first ate at this one, the lady didn't understand the meaning of the word \"plain\". She told me they didn't do that and we would have to take the food the way it was. She finally got tired of me bugging her so she made it the way I wanted.. it took her 30mins to argue with me. She also refused to give me my receipt. I stopped eating here but decided to give them another chance today. My family and I decided to grab lunch here. My daughter got nuggets, I got a burger and my husband got the chicken sandwich. We asked for it to all be fresh. The guy that gave us our food said he made it all fresh. You could definitely tell it wasn't. It was hard and burnt. We decided to just leave.   Seriously Jack In The Box... it's not that hard to make an order correctly! Get it together!"}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews for \"fast\" food, but this Jack and the Box has really went downhill.   Very slow and expect to wait 10-15 minutes if using the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Worst Jack In The Box ever. The cashier was rude and rolled her eyes when I asked for help with the drinks machine. She also got my order wrong...twice. I noticed she did not wear a name tag. I asked for the manager, but she ignored me. Then when I used the restroom, I opened the door to see some old guy passed out on the floor. He reeked of beer and urine.  I won't be coming to this place ever again."}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of JIB in general, but I must say that this one surprised me. The cashiers are always friendly and quick and the manager is always eager to ensure each customer is treated like royalty. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is the disconcerting fact that the restrooms are kept under lock and key...you have to ask the cashier to unlock it."}
{"text":"Years ago I thought their food was trash but now I think they are one of the best. Good staff and the food is awesome (for fast food). :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service by drive thru manager on Saturday 22 around 145 am. Handling cash and food without proper sanitation!??!! Gross"}
{"text":"The young lady working the drive thru this evening about 6pm was so rude. It was very windy and I could barely hear her so I assume the wind was an issue in her end as well. My order was very simple but I had to say it to her several times she kept interrupting me and I couldn't understand what she was saying. She needs to remember her microphone is on when she calls customers names as they drive away.  When I pull up to the window I was greeted with a deadly glare from her. No hello nothing just a total F U stare. So I drove away. I don't need spit in my food from a child with an attitude."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service, not to mention I got sick off these tacos and my stomach and ass literally made me pay for it, for 3 days. It was the tacos because I was perfectly fine and the minute I ate them, bad stomach. Also not to mention they cheated me out of 8 bucks, paying for my food. I ordered two tacos and a small fry that came out to 2.19 (I had to give her a 10, I had nothing smaller) and she rung it in as I gave her actual change. I politely told them I didn't get my change and they said they didn't have an extra 8 bucks in the register and told me no. (which I'm sure they did, they're just to stupid to add or subtract). I got frustrated, Tod them to \"f***\" themselves and after 15 years eating there since I was a child, I told them that it was gonna be my last visit. So far, 4 weeks in and I'm doing great."}
{"text":"i  ordered a chicken sandwich plain. i told him plain at least 3 times. he said okay i will make sure its plain since it was not on the board. when i got home it was NOT plain. that really irked me. i think he is new but all he had to do is put it on the board and it would have been the way i wanted it."}
{"text":"So last nite around 2:00am in the morning I was drunk I went to this Jack in the Box since it's around the corners from my house.. I order a ultimate bacon Cheeseburger with a large curly fries and large drink.. the girl at the window repeated my order TWICE!! So after I went home sat down open my box and it was a sloppy jumbo jack I was so pissed I drove back! The line was super long waited for about 15mins got to the window and the lady didn't even seem sincere... with attitude she said \"sorry\" took them about 5 more mins on top of the 15 I waited they gave my burger which by the way was also sloppy... and the cheese wasn't even melted never am I going back again"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I don't think they've ever screwed up my order."}
{"text":"Standard Jack-In-the Box that has greasy food fast and cheap.  I ordered the Hot Mess Burger and a couple tacos and everything was great.  Not sure what the other reviews were about, I had no problems here."}
{"text":"That sucks for the guy that got food poisoning, but I've never had a problem here.  Jack in the Box serves cheap, tasty, hot fast food.  The tacos are really good.  If you want to go healthy, pretty much you have to get the chicken pita.  It is delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on the way out of town. Weird experience because of some little kids paying in change. Other than that, pretty standard JITB"}
{"text":"I think they either remodled this place or it's newer, but it doesn't look very old.  The service is fast and efficient, and I do love that its' open 24 hours.  Pretty standard J. in the B."}
{"text":"Never been to a place that was so rude. She said \"I'm waiting on you?!\" She was so rude to us. We asked her to just wait one moment to decide. No one was behind us until we left the actual place. Her name was lorainna? Something like that.  She parked us too. Even though like I said no one was behind us.   She was so impatient and didn't smile once.  Probably won't return as she always seems to be manager on duty"}
{"text":"Saw a long line in the drive thru so I decided to go inside, where there was no line or customers whatsoever. Horrible decision. I ordered 10 tacos and a drink. Received my order 15 minutes later. Come to find out,  they ran out of tacos and change... what!!! I love jack in the box, but this was by far the absolute worst one I have ever been to."}
{"text":"We don't have jack in the box in South Carolina so I was really excited to come here when we landed in Las Vegas. I always get their 2 for $0.99 tacos, curly fries, and buttermilk sauce. So good! And just what u needed after the long flight! One thing that went wrong was the woman cashier decided to give me fresh curly fries and said she would bring them to my table when it was done. Well I finished my 2 bed taco and still no curly fries. I went up there to see what the hold up was and she said oh did you not get your curly fries? Well you did say you would bring them and if you didn't then no??? That was really strange. She did offer a shake or dessert for the wait which I declined so that was a good make up for the snafu. I am just glad I got to have jack in the box because it has been almost a year!"}
{"text":"It's not that bad, really. Never had any problems at this JITB. Fairly quick, too."}
{"text":"Really, pull around for a kids meal chicken nugget???? There's no cars in the drive thru accept us and you want me to pull around.  You guys suck and I will never come to your restaurant again!!   The girl is an idiot and she has horrible communication skills.   No one ever came through the drive thru the  entire time I waited (10 minutes) out front and when she came out she couldn't even find our car.    This place blows."}
{"text":"Literally on the way to McDonald's for breakfast, saw this Jack in the Box on the way and thought \"awesome, I love jack in the box breakfast\". I pull in to the drive thru and see this hand written sign on their drive they menu which states: \"No Curly Fries, No Ranch, No Iced Coffee, No Bacon, No Mayo, No Onion, No Regular Fries, No Sweet & Sour, No Shakes, Sorry For the Inconvenience\" - which they did misspell inconvenience. It looked as it was maybe some kids playing a joke because of how it was presented. Sure enough, it was real. So now I am stuck in a drive thru and can't order what I want, and have no time driving to McDonald's which was my original plan. So had to order crap I didn't want because I was starving and no longer had time to stop anywhere else or I would be late for my meeting that morning. Complete fail of the management of this location and should be ashamed. This experience has made me less likely to return to any jack in the box due to this."}
{"text":"After an extremely long day, I needed something down to Earth like this BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Monday morning stop by here on my way to work to grab breakfast. I asked for a combo breakfast with hashbrowns. The lady behind the desk told me they were out of hash browns n asked me if I was okay to have fries instead. I said OK but she didn't tell me that they were going to charge me extra for the fries. Also I asked for light cream in my ice coffee. It came out loaded with cream. They charge two dollars for a small ice coffee n not getting what I want is unacceptable. I will skip this one from now on and go across the street to McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"Very nice people. Just a little trouble with my order. I had a bit of a confusing request, so it wasn't the cashiers fault, but the manager Bruce came in to the rescue and fixed everything in a very pleasant, professional manner. Great job, clean store!"}
{"text":"Very poor service at drive-thru.  Guy mumbled and you couldn't understand him through the speaker.  Order was wrong. Over charged for what was in the bag. and was not given a receipt. Gotta quit hitting up fast food joints I guess."}
{"text":"Ordered ONE effing item and they can't even get it right! Bacon, EGG and chicken sandwich.  Where is the EGG?!"}
{"text":"This place is a pile of crap.  Garbage food and they will call and have your car towed in less than 5 minutes.  People around ASU are supposed be good neighbors, they are mean-spirited and cause you lots of trouble!  They are horrible, stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"This place is like a zoo just run by animals literally I stayed waiting in line for 10 minutes and there was a couple a head of me waiting there for an extra 5 minutes and I said you know what I'm out of here I'm going to Carls Jr."}
{"text":"I can't really rate this place more than 2 stars, for one thing is that it's a fast food joint, and if you read my reviews then you should know that I rarely rate anything above 2 stars if it's a fast food place. This place has low and I mean very low quality of food, but because it is cheap, fast and open late, it will get my money. I really don't enjoy eating at this place, but it's really hard to resist 2 tacos for 99 cents after a great night of booze overdose. When the day is over, I usually find myself at this place after hours. I guess you can say that as long as they got cheap food open late, I'll continue to come here."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I was not greeted or anything. One of the workers did see me as well. The first thing she said to me was how can I help you? (Obviously I wanted to order & I was ready) and then she asked if I was ready. I told her I wanted 3 ORDERS of tacos (she was confused, so I told her a total of 6) AND I also told her I wanted a Jumbo jack with no cheese, mayo, & pickle. And guess what... She \"forgot\" the pickle. Bad service and she messed up the order. I told her how j wanted my food. But of course , it's fast food. Can't always expect the best from fast food places. ********************  THE BURGER ENDED UP HAVING MAYO IN THERE! I am truly disappointed. Never going to this location."}
{"text":"So, I went through the drive thru last night and forgot to get my debit card back. Figured it out this morning after tearing my place apart.  Went back and was told to come back again when the manager who was there last night was in. Wasn't told when that was until a second visit inside the store today. Why can't they just tell me it is or isn't there before I call my bank and cancel it?"}
{"text":"I came here because I had a coupon for a buy one get one free breakfast sandwich. When I arrived at 7 am all the doors were locked except for one. when I finally figured out that they were really open and got the right door, someone had finally come out front from in back. I ordered my sandwich. In no time at all I had my breakfast sandwich. The sandwich was good. Comparable to any other Jack in the Box. I may have had the same experience If I had gone through the drive through. Nothing bad, nothing special about this store. I'd come back if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"Like most other Jack in the Box stores, it's clean, it has good food, and it's reasonably priced. Today the air conditioning was cranked up and it was quite chilly inside. I came here to get my free Jumbo Jack. They partner with the Arizona Diamondbacks. When the D-Backs hit a home run during any game, Jack in the Box gives out free Jumbo Jacks with the purchase of a drink.   The burger is a quarter pound burger topped with lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes. The burger was up quickly. I would hope so as I just happened to be the only one in the place at that moment. The Jumbo Jack was as good as any fast food burger. Nothing bad, nothing great. The fries I ordered also were average. I will return again if I'm in the area to claim my free Jumbo Jack when the D-Backs hit a home run."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? My first time back to jack in the box in a long time and guess what? They messed up the order, AGAIN!  Went in for a quick snack, ordered our food and didn't have to wait too long for our order to arrive. As the expediter person was reading off what was in the bag, they realized they forgot an order of hash browns, which was readily fixed. Heading home, we divvied up the food and realized they forgot my main sandwich.   I called, now 7-10 minutes after we had left the restaurant and the lady who answered the phone said, \"Oh that's where this sandwich was supposed to go, they just handed it to me.\" Are you kidding me? As soon as I hung up the call, realized they made my wife's sandwich wrong too. They were not busy at all, there is no excuse for this many mistakes, except for incompetence."}
{"text":"If you decide to eat at a Jack in the Box in the Sahara and Decatur area, quadruple check your order before you step off the premises (for to go orders).   They CAN NOT manage to get my order right, even though I eat there 2+ times a week. Either forgetting to include all of the tacos that we order, or just decide to give you whatever sandwiches they want to provide for you.  Today, for instance, I was able to get the last of the forgotten items from my last visit, before leaving, I looked through the bag and verified the proper number of items. I get back to work, divvy up the food and notice that instead of giving me one each of the 3 sandwiches that were ordered, they gave me two of one, and one of another.  They decided not to bother answering the phone this time, so I guess it is time to go to corporate to try and get this rectified."}
{"text":"I think this location has sealed the deal. I am not eating Jack in the Box any more. At least, not in Las Vegas.  The entire purpose for the combo numbering system was to avoid confusion. And when establishments place stickers next to certain numbers stating options, the employees should understand apparent requests.  For example, last night, we hit the drive through, I ordered a #31 (sausage egg and cheese biscuit) however, the wife doesn't like their sausage. Right next to the number is a sticker stating \"Bacon also available\" - so I tell the order taker we wanted \"A #31 NO sausage, bacon instead.\" Problem solved? Not quite. The order confirmation screen has all sorts of abbreviations, some started with b, some did not.   Arriving at the payment/food transfer window, another person reads our order and asks if we need anything else. I inform him what the order should have been, and he gets it rectified before the order comes out.  I completely understand that fast food is not going to recruit the best and brightest employees. I would at least like to see people who can take, prepare and serve an order properly. We were the only car in line, and the dining room looked empty, so it was not a case of they were so busy it was an honest mistake."}
{"text":"I've had both good and bad experiences at this location.  It may be far fetched to expect at least DECENT customer service.  I know it is a fast food restaurant and the cashiers are likely making minimum wage, but come on!  At least be happy you have a job (for now) and stop treating people like crap.  The only thing that keeps me coming back is that it is a 24 hour drive thru and really hits the spot if you've been drinking.  Although, if you hit it at the same time as the rest of the drunks, the line can be really long, and it seems like the food takes forever sometimes (although I will not complain, at least it is fresh)."}
{"text":"I never understand negative reviews of fast food places, especially if you've not had a REALLY bad experience (like hair in your food or something)....  It's Jack in the Box.  I know what to expect.  The service typically isn't good and the employees are generally not helpful.  That's the way it goes when you are making minimum wage and helping drunks and stoners all night, I suppose.  This is a pretty typical location.  I've only been through the drive-thru.  I've always received prompt and courteous service and never had to wait TOO long for my food.  I'd rather wait a little longer and it be fresh, then know it's been sitting there waiting for me to order it.  This location is on my way home from work, so I occasionally stop by for a breakfast sandwich and OJ in the morning.  It's easy to access off of the 215, on Gibson Rd.  Not much else to say - it is what it is!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Jack in the Box.  I've only been through the drive-thru - the service is always friendly and pretty fast.  This location runs out of Dr. Pepper more than any place I've ever heard of, it's weird.  Also, double check your order before leaving the window.  They are notorious for not putting cheese on their Jumbo Jacks (that come with cheese standard).  Otherwise the food always seems hot and fresh and they are open 24 hours, so it's a great stop after a night of drinking (when someone else is driving, of course)."}
{"text":"Pretty standard JiB.    The staff has always been friendly.  I've only been through the drive-thru, so I can't comment on the cleanliness of the restaurant.  I pretty much always order tacos, and they are always hot and fresh, as are the fries.  Not bad for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Quick and great customer service. I've been here multiple times maybe too much. Rarely do they mess up my order and even gave me tips on ordering their food. Example: if you order a combo and want the bacon cheddar potatoes wedges you can upgrade your fries to those for only 40 cents more. Saves you money."}
{"text":"Never ever will I go to this location again. I use to go all the time, Jack in the box is my favorite. I spent about 15 minutes in the drive thru, ordered 3 burgers ($6 each) curly and regular fries. They did not give me a receipt, and when I got home my order was all wrong. There was a $2 sandwich in one of the boxes and only 1 order of fries.  I tried calling but there was no answer, and it was 11 pm so I emailed not wanting to go back. Corporate contacted me and comped me 2 combos, but when I went back for them the assistant manager said I had already used my comp, when I assured her I didn't she called me a liar and said I wouldn't be getting any more free food. Well this location won't be getting my business. It sucks that this is the only location close to me."}
{"text":"Always love jack in the box because we don't have it in our area. Just not a fan of their prices. But it's expensive at all fast food joints. Maybe it's a good thing we don't have it in our area. Hahaha"}
{"text":"Rude as teenage girl , her & another worker kept starring at me & secreting each other . I had to ask for my order more then twice & forgot to give me sauce i had to ask again for ranch & ketchup, i asked her for the 3rd time for ketchup & i decided to drive off . Very immature little girls"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru at the location on horizon Ridge and horizon (attached to the convenience store) and ordered our food. They then asked me if the order was correct on the screen, we said yes and went to the window and paid. They gave us our food and we went home. I ordered a chicken strip meal with regular fries. That's not what I got. They gave me dried out small pieces of chicken \"fingers\" also instead of regular fries they just took a handful of curly fries mixed with regular and threw it in a burger box. I am pissed. Why ask me if my order was correct on the screen when you're just going to make what you feel like I should have. Wasted money and gas to go to the crappy location. They also have our food in a bunch of burger containers because they ran out of the right boxes and forgot to give me my drink. I talked to Rosa who was very rude with me on the phone. She wouldn't let me talk to anyone that was in charge she just kept arguing with me when I asked to talk to a manager. She really needs to learn customer and service."}
{"text":"So, my office is right down the street from this location. I've been there probably 25 times and the services is always horrible. The only reason I continue to come back here is because the french fries are awesome and it's conveniently located. Other than that The service is horrible. They literally cannot words \"soda water\".  So we pull up to the drive-through, and I ask for my meal with a large soda water. The individual in the drive-through said \"you want a large number whatever with a bottled water\"? I replied back \"no, I want a sparkling water \".  She replies back \"a bottled water?\" I responded no! A soda water\"! And she says oh, a soda water. I replied \"yes\"! Relieved, she understood what I said. Then she rang it up in the register as sparkling water. What is wrong with plain English?  If you are going to hire someone to be the voice of your company at a drive-through, they should at least understand of the word sparkling. It's ridiculous. I would give this -4 stars, no -5 stars, but they're only only place with soda water in a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"This place isn't very clean and the staff is rude. The the drive-through is always slow and backed up. We go there, but I just won't go anymore. I would not recommend this location to anyone. They always give you attitude and condiments."}
{"text":"Although this place was the last choice on a road trip home to California,  I should've kept driving another hundred miles to go anywhere else besides this place.  When I walked in no one greeted me and in fact no one took my order for approximately seven minutes.  A nice young gentleman with the double pierced ears and a gentle lisp helped me take my order.  He was fantastic at taking my order but I chose the big breakfast and this as you'll see, was the route one of the reasons for my poor visit to Jack in the crack.  The big breakfast consisted of approximately five items along with a container of syrup. Each item got worse than the previous item starting out with the hashbrowns that were actually pretty delicious and moving through to the bacon that had to be a few weeks old.  The Pancakes were pretty good but the eggs were rubbery.  Just forget about trying the bacon and sausage I actually spit out of my mouth into the sac that it came in.  The guy at the gas station was one of the most friendliest gas station clerks of ever met.  Unfortunately, this did not overshadow the poor quality of the food that I consumed.  I don't blame Jack-in-the-Box I just blame myself choosing Jack-in-the-Box as a place to eat."}
{"text":"I can see why this location was rated so low. The service was bad and the food was average at best. As a former Jack In the Box manager, I know the standards were not followed. Is there a manager at this location?"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here in this damn drive thru because my kids best friend is a picky eater and my hot water heater is broken so no hot water makes it hard to cook and clean.   Anyhow whoever takes the orders here for drive thru needs to learn how to Speak and understand the Nice English.   I'm a daughter of a foreign person however I also own companies. I don't want to go somewhere and have a barrier of understanding, listening and comprehending.   I told this damn drive thru lady to let someone else take my order AS I HATE REPEATING MYSELF 3-5 times because they can't get it right the 1st or 2nd time.   So I yell to get someone else this idiot keeps speaking to me so I say fk it and keep ordering. She missed so much and I repeated so much. I go to pay and she still forgot an order of egg rolls.   I'm just like where is the quality anymore? Your job is shit I get it but I've worked in a fast food restaurant too and if you put your all into any job it goes by much better and much more productive.   I'm sick of the Las Vegas half assed employees. Do you know how many of us former McDonald's employees are now our own bosses?   You all work there to make your money but you don't learn nor care about the quality you show people. The quality of what you have to offer meaning your establishment and the quality of who you are as a person as someone handling our food  The people here are nice but who cares about knife when you want efficiency and kindness and professionalism I am sick of people in this industry only giving one of those things instead of all of it this is how I know you will not be successful in life"}
{"text":"Ordered Sourdough Jack at 9:30pm or so on Sunday night.  Took it home along with no-so-hot fries.  I was too hungry to care about the food until about half way through my burger.  It was pretty awful.  The meat looked like and tasted like it'd been cooked about 30minutes before and was reheated.  the outer layer of the meat was so dry and icky.  crunchy, even.   Sorry to say that I won't be going back there for burgers..... too bad - because it is really close to my house."}
{"text":"Everyone has such bad comments at fast food. I think good service is just taken for granted. I eat fast food almost everyday and this is by far the best in this area. The Taco Bell's around here have great service but food can be hit or miss and Arby's food always wonderful but service not so much. BK always makes mistakes or misses some food item.  So this blew me away that she was way polite. Very clean. Dbl checked my order and actually asked if I would like ketchup!! Holly cow! Mcds never asks that simple, amazing question. Would u like ketchup or maybe ranch! Awesome... flawless. Thanks jack in the box staff!! Made my night. ( wed night  130 am on march 23rd)  dead serious. The only issue is I didn't see a receipt to thank her by name."}
{"text":"Drive through took awhile to order food.  Paula came out to our car and told us to come in and get our food because there was a situation with the previous customer.  Our food order was comp because of the long wait and inconvenience.  She apologized and handled the service great"}
{"text":"I got the jr bacon cheeseburger and the five piece nuggets and both were pretty disgusting. Never coming back. I'll keep getting the mcnuggets from mcdonals"}
{"text":"Fast drive thru but got exactly what I ordered and that alone can be tricky sometimes. The server was very nice and quick to offer ketchup and make sure I was good. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! We walked in at 11 am. Nobody in line, there were at least 4 employees talking by the drive up window. The manager walked by and avoided eye contact, never said we'll be right with you, nothing at all.  We walked out. Hope the owner sees this and fires their lazy butts."}
{"text":"Ask for a proof of purchase when you come to this location they messed up my order and I almost drove off."}
{"text":"I wait for help at the front counter no hello  No I'll be right there nothing. Feels under staffed and water on floor, garbage left on tables. If you wanna get a staff infection jack in the box on van Buren and 19th ave is giving it out for free! Yuck I'll never come to this location. No even if my car broke down and I was about to die of thirst needing water!"}
{"text":"Thanks lady's for the food it was truly the meaning of FASTFOOD. Clean outside, the staff was great. My bag was ripping as she gave it to me, and instead of just throwing us the bag , she was nice enough to grab another bag to put my food in. You ladies ROCK"}
{"text":"I am giving one star because of Cheyenne, the drive through worker that helped us.   Worst service ever by the manager. The soda machine wasn't working properly. Scott let them know. The cashier said there was nothing he could do about it. So Scott asked for the manager. She said she would fix it. She came out from the kitchen, piddled around with the machine and went back into the kitchen and back to the grill area. Didn't say if she fixed it, it was broke, nothing. So then I go up and ask for her again. I pointed out she went back into the kitchen and asked if the machine was fixed. She tells me the machine is fixed. When I asked why she didn't let us know, she stated she was the cook and the manager.   She then returned back to the grill. When Scott asked to speak to her again, this time about her long pony tail flapping around, she refused to come out to speak Scott.   I'd like to point out that Cheyenne, the drive thru worker, did what the manager should have done: she offered to get a drink from her soda fountain. Easy peasy right there. How hard is that?!?  Needless to say, we won't be returning. Sad really as this one is close to us."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience here. On the plus side, their Coke Freestyle machine was completely and totally stocked, There were some lemonade flavors that I've never seen elsewhere.  The restaurant was clean. They had just finished mopping the whole place when I got there, so that was nice. The condiments station was tidy and there was no litter outside in the parking lot.   On the minus side, the fries were cold and the burger was both bland and messy. The two patties of beef seemed overdone and the ketchup was leaking out when it was brought to my table. I know it's just Jack in the Box, but it really wasn't all that.  As the two star ratings go, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong jumbo jack with CHEESE like it says on the receipt and no pickles got them anyways."}
{"text":"I think it's rude to assume the cm is a sir when upon waiting to order at the drive thru then laugh. Then say sorry ma''mz As I finished stating my order male taking my order asked if it was for here or to go and proceeded to laugh then apologize. This location has always had problems think that the employees should care more about their job then giving bad service."}
{"text":"Went super late and food was not fresh!! Did not even put cheese on my sandwhich which was asked and charged. Why not make it fresh and correct the first time so you don't have to make it all over again."}
{"text":"I literally have never had a bad experience at this location! I'm an uber driver, so I frequently end up out here by the airport. I drive through here for a quick bite to eat between passengers. They always have my food ready very quickly, on time, and they are pleasant to speak with. There's a woman in the drive through in the mornings and she has a great smile - just an added bonus to the great food! Also, if you link up your card, you get cash back! 7% I believe."}
{"text":"On our way back from visiting the Hoover Dam, we stopped at the Jack In The Box in Boulder City, having never eaten at one before.  My husband and I went simple and tried the Jumbo Jack burger with fries.  Both were pretty good, maybe slightly better than a Burger King, but not as great as we were expecting.  During our visit, they also had special holiday shakes (pumpkin pie and eggnog), which were actually really tasty.  Prices are on-pair with other national fast food chains.  We paid about $15 for our meal."}
{"text":"Boooooo! Got a grilled cheese burger and there was no cheese.  I also paid for an extra meat patty and didn't get it. I have three buns and one scrawny meat patty and a very big frown. More salty than the limp fries I got."}
{"text":"Ran out for a late night milkshake craving with the misses. Order our shakes in the drive thru. We pull up and the small lady with green hair gives me the wrong total. So I say it's wrong, two shakes don't cost $12. She responds: \"Oh I thought you were the car behind you. We don't have any milkshakes. Bye.\"   The fact that they didn't have milkshakes seems like the least of their problems at this location. Maybe there's some kind of shortage in local fast food talent. Either way, an apology would have been nice. I had to drive all the way across the parking lot to get my shakes from Carl's JR. Which was delicious BTW. Way better than Jack in The Box."}
{"text":"This is the slowest jack in box I ever been to. I came here for a quick fast food meal and I been waiting like am, in a dine in restaurant. I have no idea why fast food places have become so slow. I will not be back at this location due to the waiting times. I can say they attempt to give good customer service."}
{"text":"I order a jr. Bacon cheeseburger with ketchup and mayo, and I got a hamburger with ketchup and mayo. Really!! I order a jr bacon cheeseburger w/ketchup and mayo. And you really want to get paid $15/hour.."}
{"text":"Terrible parking lot with bums everywhere.  Good thing the curly fries were hot.  What a neighborhood bars on all the windows."}
{"text":"At first was upset because I was missing a cheeseburger and I'd ended up seeming to a paid way more than what I should have for my meal but in retrospect I gave them a call back and they told me to come back and they rectify the situation gave me two cheeseburgers extra set of jalapeno poppers and an overload cake so I believe they did very well the only reason for 3 stars is because the fact that I had to drive back there basically waste my fuel and time"}
{"text":"After enjoying a weekend in Vegas, I embark my journey to Arizona. We quickly stop at this Jack'n the Box to get some breakfast. My sister and I order a supreme croissant and my dad a breakfast platter. As we pull up to the window I ask for a cup of hot water to warm up my baby's milk who is wailing in the back seat. The cashier comes back to tell me her manager does not want to give me a cup of hot water...ok i'll buy hot water...no you cant either wtf? Isn't it a right that you get complimentary water? Regardless if it is hot or cold? She claimed that we could burn ourselves and it is a hazard, ummmm I could burn myself with the coffee as well. Finally she gave in after wasting my time and hearing my daughter scream some more. Next, since my mom was driving behind me I decide to pay for her meal, only so they could charge her again when she came up . Our supreme croissants turned out to be sausage croissants -_-. No cream or sugar for our coffee of course. Also, no napkins or ketchup and I must've gotten the most dehydrated batch of curly fries. Great start to our little road trip."}
{"text":"Nice location and 24 hours just don't try to use card over night cuz it's cash only, that's the part that's not advertised, who carries cash now a days anyways?"}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good. I do enjoy the salads but the one I like the best, the Southwest, is sometimes out of stock for the day. Burgers are good when you're hungry after a long day at work, and you've driven through rush hour."}
{"text":"This location never gets my order right. They either forget food from my order or downsize the items. I actually wrote a complaint, and I got a phone call from a manager basically asking what I wanted them to do.    Bottom line, support a different fast food chain or a different Jack in the Crack. This one really sucks."}
{"text":"I've worked in the food service for a while. I never knew that we could wear pajamas too work, especially for a manager. If I had known this I would have been wearing sweats or sleeping shorts at my previous food restaurant This is disgusting and it shows that manger sure as hell doesn't care about her job and her performance as an employee."}
{"text":"I'll say that it's clean and a lot of choices.  I only had a drink b/c my husband wanted lunch while our grandkids were at the library-it's closest to them since we only had a few minutes.  Good idea about the Coca-Cola drink machine.  I am not a lover of fast food but I was impressed w/ the manager who was very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwiches are fine, but EVERYtime I have gotten a burger at this location, it has been dry and burned crispy around the edges."}
{"text":"Drive thru open but the lobby was closed at 7:30 pm tonight. When I waited at the door, a gentleman came out and said machine was being fixed so the lobby is closed."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is pretty good.  Fast service, clean restaurant, filled-to-the top shakes and drinks at the drive-through.  I like having this place close by for 24-hour American fast food.  The children I've seen inside have appeared happy, so they must have good toys and meals.  The chocolate milk shakes are the best!"}
{"text":"Gets the job done. Filling value menu, can usually be full for $2. Quick drive through that doesn't close."}
{"text":"Tasty grub. Fast food wasn't exactly \"fast,\" but I'll wait for fresh food.  Friendly employee at drive thru."}
{"text":"Drive thru service is always 5star! But have to remind myself never to order their breakfast menu on a hangover...I think my hangover got worse! I will stick to my favorite next time \"Jumbo Jack with Cheese\""}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could!  I literally just got off of the phone with the night manager, I was explaining to her that when I eat there it is a cheat meal so I look forward to it and that the past 3 months I have gone there three times and the first time there was no bacon on my bacon burger, so I called in and spoke to the manager I didn't want anything for free and told him they just need to pay more attention. A couple weeks later I went again  at night and when I got home and got ready to eat there was 1 piece of bacon on my \"bacon burger\" that time I called i spoke yo her and told her this was the second time and it was starting to get ridiculous. She told me they had a new cook and would make sure they would pay more attention. Again i refused to take any free food I simply asked them to take care of it. Now we come to tonight, guess what I ordered...yep! Guess what wasn't on it!! Yep.... bacon... none. I called and this time she crossed the line and had the nerve to ask the person  making the burgers how many peices of bacon he put on the burger then proceeds to get on the phone and tell me and I quote \"I don't know what to tell you,he said it's on there... ( I have attached a picture, if you can find it please... Let me know.) Bottom line I WILL NEVER EVER VISIT ANOTHER JACK I  THE BOX AGAIN."}
{"text":"Drove by for a quick munchies while tv hunting and stumbled across Jack, haven't had this in years so why not. The only problem: guy in front of us in the drive thru was ordering for a family of a billion and took forever! I quick 2-3 min stop turned into a 20-25 halt.. Even had to put the car in park. But, the cashier at the window was more than apologetic and friendly. Her attitude made me look over everything else, good job on service!   The grilled cheese was meh.. Needed more filling and the curly fries are always yummy."}
{"text":"Just a average Jack in the Box always messes up on my order. Manager never calls and talks after I leave a review"}
{"text":"I've had my issues with this place in the past, but its gotten better. The cashier Barbara was anazing. Very nice, considerate, and she got all the food out correctly with all of its modifications"}
{"text":"We came here after I got off work today. We went through the drive thru and when we got to the window, we told the employee that we could only pay X amount on one card and the rest on another card. The employee said she would have to ask her co-worker for help and they started conversing in Spanish (RUDE!). When the original employee came back to the window, she said \"we can only take one card\". Then the other employee said something else to the first and then they tell us \"oh wait, yeah, we can ring it up the way you want.\" My wife and I then reiterated that we could only pay so much on the one card and to have the rest paid on the other card. The employees said they could do that, but it would be better if we had more money on the first card (Strike 2). We asked them if they had a military discount since I'm a USAF veteran, hoping that might reduce the cost, they said they do have a discount to which I provided my veteran ID. A minute later the other employee says \"No, we have no more discount\" then charged the FULL AMOUNT to the card that we told them we could only do a set amount on (Strike 3). When we asked them why they charged the full amount on the card, they both stated \"We told you we can only charge one card\", and when we reminded them that they told us they could run our payment the way we asked, the first employee walked away while the second employee started talking over us and said we were in the wrong. When we tried to have them do a refund, the employee got a sour look on her face, then looked everywhere but at us, like she was hoping we would just leave (In Baseball, this is where they'd be called OUT, but this isn't baseball). The second employee then demanded our card and the receipt back so she could do the refund.   At this point I was so mad, I went inside and asked the employee at the counter for their General Manager's name and contact information. The employee who was giving us crap at the window came over and said \"I'm in charge, you need to talk to me, the lady has the refunded receipt.\" I then repeated my request for the GM's contact information and was told \"Call the 1-800 number on the receipt, that is our GM's direct #.\" When I asked for the so-called manager's name, she said \"You can't have my name, I'm not going to give it to you, we told you that we can't charge two cards, get out or we will call the police.\" I thought I was going to have a heart attack on the spot over the stupidity of not only the incident but of the staff who are supposed to be providing customer service and instead failing at de-escalating the situation.   As I type this, I am still livid about the incident and have both called the 1-800 #; which was just a survey line and I could not get through to a real person to voice my concern, and sent an email to their customer service team with my contact information, requesting a call back. This whole experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), funds on hold for the weekend and then some, and this bad review of a fast food chain I used to enjoy."}
{"text":"Quick bite. The teller was easy. Game me the time I needed to make a choice. Line moved extremely fast food came out to order. Was offered sauce, and did receive receipt and napkins. Smooth and eazy."}
{"text":"One for the plug...  never had da pkug.  But people are people.  Haven't had a bad experience.  I just hope the people are being themselves and not living for onwners. Both to the atvatage but one before the other"}
{"text":"Young employees who would rather have fun joking around with other employees, than take care of there customers. Stood there for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Then they say OH I KNOW HIM!! I walked out."}
{"text":"These girls are always so sweet. My food is always hot and my order has never been wrong. I go there almost every day and order various items as well so thank you all!"}
{"text":"I ordered in the drive through at midnight tonight and was given the absolute worst service EVER. The worker who took my order completely cut me off mid-sentence after I was told he was ready. I then had to repeat my entire order after I had already waited another 10 minutes to order the first time when no one was even in front of me. I then came to the window, and the worker messed up my order and was speaking to me as if it was my fault. He was continuously making me feel uncomfortable and that I was doing him a disservice. It's not the end of the world to change a drink that you didn't hear right when I told you 2 times what it was.He was very short and had such a negative attitude since the get-go. After rudely throwing my order in the bag, the man finally gave me my order and ended up giving me the wrong order anyway!!! I'm NEVER going back to Jack N The Box AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I have never in my lifetime had to yell at a worker that is serving me due to the fact that they might spit in my food. But I had to yell at a female working on 8/9/2017 around 8 pm.  It seemed as if she was trying to make a quota for bonus, extra credit who knows. She made me back up and pull up to the window twice. I'm guessing there is a sensor we pass as we are going thru the drive thru. And offered a drink for it. Which I didn't need or want. Then she was rushing to charge me. I tried to explain to her that my order cost more still no response since still trying to rush me out. Finally she realized she charged me less for someone else's order. I WAS SO UPSET THAT I WENT OFFFFFFF!! Telling her I had tried to explain that to her and needed to slow her f$$&@ a@@ down. She walked away then made a manager help still same s$&& since he was on his person cell phone. The worst service in history.  I have never had to yell at someone like that."}
{"text":"I don't even want to rate this place with ANY stars. It needs to be shut down! Not for the food, but for the drugs! When we entered, we quickly realized why everyone was in the drive-thru lane and not inside. We arrived around 9:30pm, placed orders and requested to use the restroom. Someone was in there so the employee banged on the door. No response. A minute later, A MAN WALKED OUT OF THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM! When my friend entered it was smokey, and smelled of something sweet burning...I assumed it was meth considering the man who walked out looked homeless and also looked like a tweaker. She came back out and we got our orders and ate our food in the car. As we waited for our food, a different employee approached the counter and whispered to the man who had been in the women's bathroom. And he proceeded to leave the restaurant. You can guarentee that we will not be returning to this location...EVER AGAIN. Absolutely disgusted."}
{"text":"They take DECADES in the drive thru!! Seriously either pay for the gas I just wasted there or give me my food for free!"}
{"text":"Really the credit machine is broken. Not good for a society moving towards being cashless."}
{"text":"I tried to go to this location on Thursday night and their page says they're open late but by the time I got there, they were closed. It was a bummer because I had to drive down the road and eat something else.  No one makes potato wedges like you. My little world was crushed. I hope they can update hours on this listing as soon as possible to avoid this from happening again!"}
{"text":"horrible service, staff and worst experience of my life!!! do not go to this location!!! i wish i can give them a negative 5 stars but i cant! they take forever!!!!"}
{"text":"Came by here for a quick bite and it was so good !  The  burger was freshly made , bun fresh and fries piping hot .  Decided to just pull in a space to gobble up my goodies before I drove home from work .  If you're in the area give this  location a try , I also tried some of the fried churros and they were yum -o !"}
{"text":"Not to shabby... Tried Jack in the Box on my recent trip to Arizona, and overall it was okay.  Ordered the double cheeseburger with curly fries.  Burger was good, not the best, but tasty and the curly fries were okay as well.  Will definitely try them again.  Overall, okay food, okay service, okay prices."}
{"text":"While the facility was relatively clean, I was quickly reminded why it's been 15 years since I last put this food in my mouth. The burger was disgusting on a level equal to what I imagine purina dog food would taste like. They need to change the name to Crap In The Box."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast service is slow they give us cold potatoes went up to change the potatoes for pancakes the manager came out to inspect the Box tried to tell me the potatoes are hot when they're cold check like it was a big deal to give me the pancakes instead of the cold potatoes crappy service order the breakfast sandwich with the hamburger patty hamburger patty you can taste with old it's not fresh meat like they say I would not be coming back here"}
{"text":"Good morning to everyone out there. I must say that you can Always count on Jack in The Box when you're in a hurry.  At this location, The Manager Mrs./Me. Nina carried out my order to my table.   My food was made just like I ordered it and it came out got. The Manager Mrs./Ms. Nina also took my order at the counter.  Mr.. JP"}
{"text":"Had a good lunch at this Jack in the Box location.  It was fast, even though it was busy.  The food was good, and got service with a smile.  What more can you expect?"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE EATING!!! I found this hair in my supreme croissant this morning, so disgusting! Won't be returning here as it seems the employees lack the ability to take the proper protection measures."}
{"text":"This location is always quick and friendly, even when I had a mistake they apologized and gave me what I wanted. They are friendly, professional and great for a quick eat."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you want fast service or in a rush. I wasn't but everytime I go I have to wait forever to even get a response thru the drive thru.  I went to get two shakes. An Oreo and chocolate and he gave me pumpkin ? I even repeated twice and he said it back and still messed it up. I didn't care and I was still good but I waited sooooo long and there was no one in the drive thru or inside. Then tonight I get shakes and waited like 3-4 mins to get a response then I wait literally over 10 whole mins for the shakes. I can see them sitting there melting while this huge black(?) chicken and this dude are doing things. One person inside and no one in the drivethru and it takes two people to do what they were doing which was close to nothing ?  No one could just quickly hand me my shakes. It's all small shit but altogether it's just annoying as hell. Plus her attitude. Why does it take 10 mins to hand me a shake. Why does it take like over 25 mins to get a shake when I'm staying 4 mins away. They need to step it up. And respond at the drive try faster. Not make people wait 3-5 mins. Thanks for the soup melted shake real nice."}
{"text":"While going thru the drive thru, the manager on duty asked me to reverse before the sensor and pull up. This is the fourth time I've had to do this at this jack in the box. It's very inconsiderate to ask a customer to do this so it looks like I'm being served quicker. I asked for my drink three times while the employees were having a conversation and one employee was sitting on top of the cashier table."}
{"text":"My chicken was cold and still frozen in its center of my sandwich. I called for a corporate number last night and the manager gave us a wrong number and we called back today and got the corporate number and called earl8er this morning and never even received a call back from them. Highly disappointed with their service as my fiance and I frequent jack in the boxes all over town however this one we will not return to. I would rather drive 3 to 5 miles out of my way for something else or anotger location than go back here. I wish I could give less than a zero star for this health hazard we shouldnt have even been in contact with. Chicken has to be cooked. Not to mention gets were cold and stale. I do not recommend in the least anymore."}
{"text":"They got one start due to the boy on drive thru shout out to you!! But man I ordered chorizo fries and that had to be at least a month old. Will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"My husband refuses to go here because of an employee who uses his hands while putting the fries in the bag. Happened two times and we don't go back."}
{"text":"The food is jack in the box, nothing more nothing less. This review is about a drive thru girl that was working 5/12/16 10:45pm, I've had her a couple times and must say she is the absolute warmest person and friendliest person. Totally unexpected when going to a drive thru late at night. Please, who ever is in charge of this place, do yourself a favor and give this woman a raise, I'm a server at a restaurant and always get off late so I'm left with very little options so coming to j-n'-the-b and being greeted with such amazing professionalism and warmth is just something that will make me keep coming Back."}
{"text":"So I went through the drive through and ordered the new 'Buttery Burger' that everyone was talking about saying it's the new thing. The guy in the speaker sounded confused when I said the Buttery Swiss Burger lol   Anyways when I got the order, the burger was just nothing more than a regular Jack in the crack 'Swiss and Bacon' burger splashed with melted butter on the beef patty. Like really? I though it would be the bread that'd be the difference but nah. Y'all ain't missing out.  Just a greasy buttery drenched burger. All I kept thinking of was Paula Deen. Lol 2 stars for a decent burger presentation."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and decided to get a quick dinner and boy it was straight out forgettable. Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and 2 orders of the value tacos and a number 5 double jack with cheese. Here is the break down for tonight's disappointing eats  1/5 value tacos was so bland taste like cardboard  3/5 spicy chicken sandwich nothing special or stood out  1/5 double jack with cheese I didn't eat it because I was full of disappointment   4/5 Onion Rings not bad   3/5 large strawberry shake it was ok nothing god or bad  For late night owls saved your stomach and $ and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Last time I'm visiting this place. Went there 2 nights ago thru the drive-thru a little before 10pm. Ordered 3pc egg rolls, a SDJ sandwich, and a LG caramel iced coffee. Order taker didn't reconfirm my order and told me to pull up to the window for my total. Well, how am I supposed to know if they got my order right?! Pulled up to window, no greeting from employee, she just took my card and ran it. Handed me the bag of food and drink and not even a \"thank you\" or anything.  I drove off BC their were cars behind me. Sitting at the first traffic light, I open my bag and what do I have...a #3 SDJ meal w a small fries and LG caramel iced coffee. NO egg rolls (which is what I really wanted in the first place) and I didn't order a meal, I only wanted the sandwich!! Arrrrggghhh Jeez...Quality and accuracy of their labor at this location suck big time. This is the last visit to this location. They are bad!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through tonight 1/4/15 2:20am. Ordered 4 items off the menu for me and all of my friends and asked for some butter milk sauce. SHE ONLY GAVE US ONE. How do you share only 1 sauce when you've pressed so many items? Especially sharing with others? Plus she seemed so sarcastic. Would not recommend this location she had short dark hair and was very skinny"}
{"text":"Always quick with food. It's always hot and they never get my complicated order wrong. Nice workers as well"}
{"text":"Went at 11am on a Monday morning with almost no one inside. No on in line and waited 5 minutes before we were eve spoken to. Finally started the order and could barely hear the girl taking our order and she spoke so low. They were out of curly fries, the coke machine was broken and another person in the lobby had already told the girl and she has to get him his soda from behind the counter however she immediately handed us empty cups and we had to tell her again that the machine was broken. There was zero napkins in the dining area, we didnt even see a dispenser for any. As we were waiting for our food a woman came in and she wanted her money back as her shakes were not done correctly. The girl behind the counter said I didn't wring u up for that and turned to another customer. Horrible place and I love jack in the box"}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru service around noon today!  If you can't hear the customer, how about not scream \"what????!!!\" after each item , try \"I'm sorry can you repeat that\" or whatever other saying is in your employee training/handbook.  Seriously, there is much better way to treat customers even if this is just a drive thru fast food job... SMH"}
{"text":"Stellar service here! I went here during the week around lunch time last week and experienced very good drive thru service which is unheard of! No complaints on the food, was hot, fresh and tasted good for fast food quality.   Quick service and very polite employees! This is the best jack in the box in Chandler hands down! The other locations need to take some pointers! *****"}
{"text":"Open 24hrs, fast drive through, delicious food. I love their curly fries and tacos but my boyfriend always gets the sourdough jack. The customer service is always great too! That surprises me because most fast food places aren't as friendly but the employees here seem to always be smiling, enjoy their job and very courteous to all patrons."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, didn't give me attitude like most other jack in the box. Food has actually imported."}
{"text":"Not very friendly and very unresponsive in the drive thru had to ask numerous if they received what I had asked for. Took really long to get our order. We asked for Powerade and got Dr Pepper instead,  asked for hot sauce and got home with nothing. Also did not get the correct change back. Pretty frustrating stuff but what can you do place is been the same way for a while now"}
{"text":"This popping up Jack did not match the quality of others I have frequented.  Although our cashier was friendly enough, and accurate in taking our order, several miscues that followed dampened this dining experience.    Realizing it might be difficult to obtain, Diane and I nevertheless asked for our burgers to be prepared as medium rare as possible.  A cook then came out to tell us that per corporate policy the meat has to remain cooking until it reaches 155 degrees.  I nodded that I understood, and then within about a minute our burgers were produced.    What?  There was no time to have cooked them fresh after our brief encounter, so it is obvious that these dry and utterly well done burger patties (mine for a Sourdough Jack, and Diane's for a Bacon Ultimate Cheese Burger) had been prepared ahead of our order, and then all ingredients quickly cobbled together.  And, although my order of Curly Fries was present, my order of a Monster Taco was noticeably missing from the two plastic trays holding our food.  Back to the counter to report the missing taco, and it was swiftly supplied.  So, we sat down to eat, and I noticed that some of my fries were congealed together, while Diane asked me to get her some salt.  When I tried to find a packet or two at the condiment bar, I ran into two cups of pepper packets but no salt at all.  So back to the counter to report this, and the friendly cashier went to the back of the kitchen and returned with a few packages of salt for Diane.  So, now were we finally ready and well equipped to eat our late dinner?  Unfortunately, not quite.  For, as Diane prepared to dig into her cheesy Bacon Cheddar Wedges, she noticed that she had no fork.  Back to the condiment bar I went, looking for a plastic fork.  Yes, you guessed it; there were none visible.  Nor a knife or spoon.  So, back to the counter I went to ask for a plastic fork, which was soon produced by the cashier in a plastic package that also contained a plastic knife and a plastic spoon.    At last we were able to eat our meals.  My Monster Taco was fine, and the bacon in the Sourdough Jack cooked just right, in contrast to the overly done hamburger patty underlying it.  2-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with Jack in the Box. This restaurant was what you'd expect from a place like Burger King or McDonalds. Food was ok. The staff here was pretty friendly and the food came out quickly and our order was correct.  We went at the end of the day and the tables and floors seemed to be clean and got the sense that this location does a pretty good job at keeping it clean.  I'd go back to a Jack in the Box. Not a bad experience."}
{"text":"We had some discount coupons available and hadn't been to Jack's in quite awhile, so I talked Diane into dining there with me, and she ordered two Ultimate Cheeseburgers for the price of one, while I paid for a large order of French Fries to be paired with a free Enchilada Monster Taco, which is a new menu creation.  The Ultimate Cheeseburger featured two patties of beef , 2 slices of American Cheese, and 1 slice of Swiss Cheese with ketchup and mayonnaise on a nice Poppy Seed Bun.  The meat is always prepared well done here, but was at least still noticeably moist, which made it a better tasting burger.  But this much cheese is Diane's thing--not mine.  And, I would have preferred the addition of a few pickle chips, a slice of tomato, and some raw onion.  Just so, while I am an admirer of the traditional Monster Taco, I found the Enchilada Sauce on the Enchilada Monster Taco to be rather spicy and overbearing, even though it had the same beef and bean groundings as the basic Monster Taco, which I determined I liked better.  With the Enchilada Sauce dominant, no Taco Sauce was needed.  The French Fries were okay.  And, service was good.  3-1/2 stars overall on this recent night outing!"}
{"text":"The Dr. Pepper I ordered was literally just dark carbonated water and the fries were less than room temperature."}
{"text":"I can't believe that i'm saying this but i haven't had a jack in the box taco since my visit to vegas 5 years ago. We don't have them anymore in delaware. Odd as it may sound the taco tasted exactly as it did when i had it as a teenager...35 years ago! For me and better half it was heavenly"}
{"text":"I know... it's just jack in the box. but we don't have this fast food in the north east and they are missed. good or bad, the tacos taste exactly as they did when we were teenagers... delicious"}
{"text":"I order a couple 99.spicy chicken sandwich. .... and fries ...  Di worst I ever had soggy and old fries ... ... I use to like the Jr western  burger I guess I'll try one more time ....."}
{"text":"A little out of my way, but better than the other two locations near me. It's just another typical fast food joint.   But the only thing that sets them aside from the others, is the service and the fact that they don't mess my order up. It's happened once or twice but very minor and they are quick to fix it. I can be very picky and make changes to almost everything I order.  With it being fast food, I don't expect much. They can get busy but they are pretty quick and the food actually looks good."}
{"text":"I normally avoid this location, but it was on the way home and it seemed convenient.. We had just arrived from a short road trip and decided to stop here, that way we didn't have to cook.  This location has horrible service, and seems to always be dirty. We went through the drive thru, and I ordered a couple of chicken sandwiches as well as a supreme croissant no cheese. I get my order and I check real quick to make sure there was no cheese before driving away (keep in mind it's kinda dark in the car) since it didn't have cheese I assumed it was ok.  We get home and I'm getting ready to eat my croissant, but as I picked it up, you could feel that the bread was hard. Unfortunately it was burnt! I tried taking the burnt parts off so I can try to eat it but it didn't help, the taste was disgusting. So I'm already upset cuz I had been starving and was looking forward to eating.   At this point I had already decided to call and complain. But I'm still hungry so I figured I'd eat the chicken sandwich and then call. So I pull it out the bag, and it literally looked like someone stepped on it! I open it and it looked gross so I couldn't even eat it. Seemed like they played patty cake with it.. smh and they didn't give me a receipt either..  So I call and ask to speak with the manager. This gentleman gets on the phone, and as I start to tell him the situation, he responded as if he already knew we would call. He was quick to want to replace my food, and I wonder why? Probably because they knew the quality of food they gave me was disgusting! When I asked for his name, he mumbled it not wanting to give it to me. Please avoid this location! Unless it was your last option lol"}
{"text":"Got my sourdough jack and a shake through the drivethrough- too bad they didn't give me any napkins."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times before and used to be so clean.  We were there around 1pm.  Very quiet but the restaurant was trashed.  Most tables were dirty and the women's bathroom was disgusting.  The employees were standing around and the place looked like a dump.  I remember it as being a very clean restaurant up in that area of town and was very disappointed to see the state of it today.  Not sure if they have new management but I would be embarrassed if my name was tied to that restaurant looking the way it did."}
{"text":"Tacos.  They are so delicious yet so bad for you.  But at .99 per 2, you can't go wrong after a long night of beer.  On a side note, their Asian Grilled chicken salad is good too."}
{"text":"Drive thru line is almost always only a couple of cars at the most.  I like that JIB serves breakfast all day.  Sometimes it takes a while to get a breakfast item though because they have to cook it to order. Which is fine to me.    I wish they would post the specials near the drive thru menu board.  Like the ones they have posters up on the windows.  Reason being is that if you come in from 32nd st, or from east on washington, you can't see the posters."}
{"text":"Came for the awesome shakes & fries. We usta come here sit at the front window & watch cars & ppl. But there were too many transient ppl here slummin & loitering. Came here today tables clean, quiet, organized & helpful. I ordered the vanilla shake real thick & flavorful. Gson got the strawberry shake he could barely get the thick ice cream through the straw. The fries were crispy on the outside yummy on the inside."}
{"text":"For a jack in the box it's on par. Food is always hot and correct. Sometimes there is a wait."}
{"text":"Kind of over this place after the rude customer service I received from the manager then I gave them another shot only to have all of the meat missing from 2 breakfast burritos. Really? 9 bucks for 2 burritos that aren't even made correctly? And they won't do anything to compensate or fix the dissatisfaction from customers. I guess I'll be sticking to Taco Bell, In N Out, Filibertos, and Chick Fil A as my fast food joints of choice considering they do a lot to please their customers. And make things right. Looks like I'll be getting my \"fresh off night shift craving a breakfast burrito\" fix somewhere else."}
{"text":"Slow service, tables and floors not clean, coffee really old in the carafe, and soft drink dispensers spray you with some of the flavors.  Food was just ok, and that usual mistake of making your food to go instead of dine-in even though you clearly said dine in."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a few tacos, and the register I was waiting to order from broke down on the customer in front of me. I knew I was in for a wait. But Brandon handled it like a true professional. He tried a few things  (smiling and happy the entire time) but when the register didn't respond he was able to flag down the manager who was busy co-ordinating orders and get the problem resolved. A new cash till was brought up and in no time the second register was up and running. Thanks Brandon for going the extra mile and getting things faster than I was expecting. Good job. You're a credit to your store and the organization."}
{"text":"Was told to pull to the front and park off to the side for an order of two items...... might I mention WE WERE THE IBKY CAR IN LINE . No one else and we've now been waiting 10 min. The girl who took our order asked us to hold for a minute (really 5-8) mid way through our order. Mind you this whole time (20min) NO ONE ELSE IS INSIDE AND OR IN THE drive through line !!!!!!!!! FAST FOOD MY A$$"}
{"text":"Waited at the drive through for 20mins!! That's not fast food at all!! Mind you we were the only ones there at 4am.... well after all that waiting they decided to give our friend( separate order) his food free for the long wait but not mine!!!! Once we got home we realized they gave us all the wrong food! How hard is it when we are your only customer!! Annoyed"}
{"text":"The spicy chicken sandwich here saved my life more than once while I was in town. Seriously."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this Jack In The Box a zero star rating. All of these other reviews saying \"it's just your typical fast food place.\" I can't stand this specific Jack In The Box. A few times I've been there, they shorted me change, and got my order wrong. Last time I went inside, the lady was standing by the drive thru and turned around \"buenos dias un momento\" and then turned back around and laughed and mumbled \"oh it's a white person.\" One of the cooks came up to me and basically told me what it meant. Just because I'm white apparently doesn't mean I know Spanish, okay??? I will never go back to this Jack In The Box."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood JITB. I have to say, whomever is managing this franchise really needs to look at their cooks and counter help. It's had been months for reasons their food is cold and bland. After ordering from drive through, I get home only to find my coke was nothing carbonated water and AGAIN, they screwed up my order by giving me mini bacon and burger with onions and pickles when I ordered a breakfast jack! WTF, these people can't get it right. I will never give them my business AGAIN. I will drive to Reems and Waddell or to the new Burger King on Dysart and Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Okay. So I just was still drunk after a way too early trip back home to LV when I landed in Vegas at 6:30am. I was hungry and really wanted a burrito.   Apparently, I'm a rookie when it comes to the fast food game and my roommate was ready to show me the light. Thank goodness for him.   I ordered the Meatlover's burrito. When I say me ordering it, I mean my roommate ordered and I obeyed.   The service at 7am was fast and friendly. The burrito was hot, but not mind blowing.   Will I be back?!   100%."}
{"text":"I Always thought I lived in a good neighborhood. Then I visit Jack's here and find graffiti  carved into the tabletops? Food was pretty good for Fast Food so maybe I will use the drive thru next time."}
{"text":"For years this Jack in the Box has sustained me through college, when I was working and now that I am back in college. The staff is solid and food always consistent with Jack in the Box quality. (Yes you can read this anyway you want)  When it comes to late night eats and you are to lazy/any other excuse you can think of not to walk into one of Las Vegas's many 24hr establishments, the Jack in the Box drive-thru is like a safe haven in the middle of a dark, vast wasteland of hunger"}
{"text":"Why am I giving them four stars? Because I am a fan of Jack in the Box and they are the closest JTIB to school. Over the years, I have grown to love them for just about everything their greasy menu has to offer me. Everything from their two $0.99 tacos to their 24-hour breakfast, to their 24-hour drive thru, JTIB knows how to hit the spot after a long night of drinking, early morning hang over, or just plain hungry."}
{"text":"Gotta say, the friendliest Jack in the box I've ever been to. When you walk in they say hello and welcome, loud enough so all can hear. Clean and fast with the food. There's a guy that even walks around and asks if everything is good... good service and happy people. How delightful!"}
{"text":"I used to like Jack in the Box.....2 tacos for 99 cents and jumbo jack at $1.50 and they both had meat.....now burgers are $3 and all bread--no meat....I don't care which location it is---I am done with ALL of these locations everywhere....never eating jack in the box again..."}
{"text":"Very sad to say I will not be going back to any jack n the box after this. I am currently pregnant and went for a breakfast sandwich at this location. Luckily I didn't take a bite yet. There was MOLD on my croissant. I posted a picture.  I went back and asked for a refund and gave them everything back. The manager tried to give me the drink back but I didn't want anything from there. To top it off after I left I noticed the manager didn't even give me the correct amount back!  Do yourself a favor and pay a little more and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The perfect spot in less than a mile from my house when I can't drive because I've been out all night.  I'm not saying you won't feel it the next morning, but look - we have all been here.  I mean you've seen the commercials...and if you haven't been to Jack in the Box it's time to re-evaluate how you're living, or not living.   You're not going to have the best burger that you've ever had...you're not.  It is going to cure your hunger and make you regret it the next day.    This is too close to my house so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I come here often, it's my default drive thru. For those that are broke, you can still fill up for a couple of bucks. Chicken sandwich and two tacos, I think that hits all food groups. For the true gourmet, the monster taco and jumbo Jack is an American treasure. Dr.pepper here is always a tasty beverage.  If you need a quick breakfast, the breakfast combo will get you through till dinner time. Actually, they are close, and servers friendliest in the biz."}
{"text":"I have a picture of the pork belly BLT I would love to send you. I got it at 6400 W Charleston Blvd in Las Vegas NV  at 10PM on March 19, 2018. I love Jack In The Box, but this location sucks every time I've been there. There were 2 little slices of pork belly. The paucity of the sandwich weight was noticeable as soon as I took it out of the bag. If I had eaten inside, I would have said something. I don't how this works, but these guys need improvement. It's the closest one to my house, so sadly, I will probably not be eating there again. I'm unhappy because I've liked  JITB since I was in college in 1969."}
{"text":"Talk about a shitty attitude and I belive he's a dam manager and he has the worst attitude his name is Alex can't smile or greet. He should not be in the front end"}
{"text":"So, after 2 failed visits, we tried one last time to give them a chance to get it right.  After a homeless guy accosted us in the drive thru, which is after a TV show skit-worthy attempt to order a large cherry Sprite (come hell or high water, he wanted to give us a large curly fries...Of course the screen is broken!); this mess is what they call jalapeno poppers!  For real, y'all?"}
{"text":"I'm trying this location since it's the only Jake  close to my house.  Let's start with they Always get your order wrong. I mean always. When they do there's no ketchup or sauce in the bag. More ice then Soda .. Need more workers .. Food not Nasty just service is really bad"}
{"text":"Burgers weren't bad. The fat cow behind the drive thru window had such a nasty attitude. Shoved money in my hand, when food came she handed it and said \"here u go\". Closed the window and turned her back."}
{"text":"I'm here a couple times a week picking up food for my parents...  It is the only Jack in the box anywhere in the area and it still constantly displays great customer service and decent time both inside and at the drive through.   There have been a few rough patches over the years as they trained new employees and I have only needed to complain about one of them.  It is Jack in the box not a 4 star restaurant or a QT so don't expect posh seating or exotic culinary delights and don't expect food ready to go under a heatlamp...  However, you can expect clean tables and bathrooms and reasonable wait times along with friendly service."}
{"text":"Yes... I know Jack in the Box is a fast food place, but it's hard not to like it.  Their menu is very extensive so it isn't just limited to burgers and fries-Many of the fast food places are starting to offer some healthier choices, so at least that's a change for the good.  I usually just go here once in a while- maybe once every 3 months when I'm in a rush to grab some food while running errands during lunch or just don't have time to sit down and have a decent lunch break.  The staff here is very friendly and efficient, normally your food (cooked to order) comes out really quickly.  The dining room is kept really clean.  I haven't used the drive through, but it seems to move a lot of people through from what I have observed while eating there."}
{"text":"This place is on my way to the office so occasionally I stop through the drive through if I am feeling exceptionally hungry that morning.  The morning staff is super friendly.  There was one lady that was so amped up to see you in the morning (it was pretty infectious) so it's a good way to start your day.  Granted it is \"fast food\" so I wouldn't eat here if you are counting your calories, but I am still amazed at the range and offerings of their menu.  Some may say it's \"too much\" but heck, if you can swing making all those different types of food in that short amount of time, I say more power to ya.    This Jack in a Box is off of a busy N Tryon location, but you can get to it from either direction (there's a break in the median).  It feels like is a little \"off by itself\" with only gas stations that neighbor it along with some tire shops and a paint store."}
{"text":"Five of us stopped in very late night/actually very early morning and it was an ok visit.  The Loaded Breakfast Sandwich  and Sausage Biscuits were your typical Jack in the Box menu items, the Burger and Fries ok... the fries were hot and crispy.  Service was friendly.  The restaurant itself could have been cleaner and neater but it was ok."}
{"text":"Always have issues with this location! We always order Jalapeño Poppers and Egg Rolls and they never fail to forget the sauce!"}
{"text":"When it first opened it was really good. The past three times I have been here they gave me the wrong food from what I ordered. You seriously have to open every box and lift the bun to insure its right. Today I had a cashier named Adilene in drive thru. She was rude at the order menu and even worse at the window. She handed me my food without asking if I needed taco sauce or ketchup so I politely asked her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and grabbed one of my bags back from me. She then threw 21 taco sauce packets in my bag (seriously, no joke, 21) for my two tacos and pushed the bag back at me. Then when I got home, she got me again, my egg rolls were missing!"}
{"text":"I went to the drive through, picked up my food went down the road. I took a bite into the hamburger and the top bun was rock solid and could not even eat it. So I took the bun off and took another 2-3 bites and the Tomatoes were not tasting to good!. So I stopped eating the food as it was Not a Good Sign!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service and management... I go in there last night I guess before their, \"Systems shut down\" and I get home to find that the munchy meal I ordered had no fries in it and the burger was just a Patty and a bun. I try to give them the benefit of the doubt that obviously things were going on so I call and express my concern with the manager Veronica. She says I could come in and she would fix it I mentioned to her that I have my receipt and she says, \"oh no don't worry about it I'll just make you a new one if you come in now\" so honestly I wasn't even thinking of my receipt when I left the house which I should have still... so I drive all way down there and then I get to the window and she starts giving me a hard time saying oh no we have two people to make sure everything is in the box..I'm going to need your receipt... \"when she just said on the phone it won't be an issue and I tell her absolutely nothing new in person that I didn't say on that hon \" so I pull over to find it and realize I left it at the house and at this point A six dollar meal is not worth the hassle especially when you give them a chance to make it up and then they tell you they will and not to worry about it but then you get to the register and they give you this interrogation over a burger. Lol I understand this is just fast food but I will not be coming back and they should really look into new management or training."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and at 11:30 in the morning they are out of ketchup, napkins, lids, coke and sprite. Will never go back even though the food was good, b/c the first time experience was that bad!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this location and my review is based off the drive thru customer service, the girl was so rude I felt extremely rushed and she kept cutting me off and then just said pull around I get to the window she gives me my total takes my card is taking other orders doesn't say a thing to me just starts handing me my stuff, hands me one bag doesn't say anything I look in the bag notice half my order is still missing again doesn't say anything then a few mins later hands me another bag and walks away. I understand it's fast food it's a drive thru you need to hurry but you still should have some sort of customer service."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Super slow.  Had to wait like 10 minutes at the counter just for them to take my order. No one else was there.......... Patiently waiting while the three workers talk about life and dilemmas and blah blah while I'm waiting. She looks at me and says I'll be right with you. A long time later finally takes my order and rudely, might I add. She doesn't even say thank you and just passed the receipt to me like she hates life.  Needs some customer service training. At least the food was okay. My sourdough jack was kind of dry."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a greasy food fix.  When I have those shameful cravings, this is my fast food joint of choice.  The staff is always friendly and gets the order right.  Though I can really only comment on the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Being from Arizona and working in Southern California I grew up eating Jack in the Box.  Too bad Virginia doesn't have them!  Anyway, I already knew some cities in North Carolina have my favorite fast food restaurant!  So, I purposely planned my road trip route just to get my Jack in the Box fix!  Ordered a couple of Meat Lovers breakfast burrito's (with no egg, of course) and a good ol' Jumbo Jack with cheese.  Customer service was great and so was the food!  More details coming soon!"}
{"text":"One of the best jack in the box's in the Las Vegas area. I've had jack's food for awhile now but it's not prepared fresh like this location makes it. Top service! Freshly made every time. They really follow jacks motto \" we don't make it till you order it \" also unlike other jacks I've been too, they don't make you park. The employees here are also one of the friendliest. I think that's what sets them apart from other jacks. I would rather drive 5 mins to get here than the one near my house just for the friendly people that work here!"}
{"text":"This review is a based on a very strong 2 or weak 3, however you want to take it.  Service is hit or miss with this location.   Problems I have experienced with this location are as follows:  *Very Slow Service *Rude Staff *Messed up orders  I can almost tolerate rude employees at a fast food joint because they aren't paid very well and have to deal with a wide array of people. It's a tough job.  But with that said, at least get my order correct. If I place a simple order for myself, it will almost always be correct. If I place a large order for me to take home to family for dinner, it is almost always wrong.  Let's admit, most of do fast food drive thru because of the convenience factor. So, with that being said, we are most times in a rush to do something else besides wait on our food or wait on the 2 cars in front of you getting their food.   I love Jack. But this location can definitely improve in some areas."}
{"text":"Okay, so this spot is a little shady. I have seen crack heads meet in the bathroom to do drug buys, hookers and pimps, panhandlers, you name it.  It's all about the entertainment at this location for me.   Okay, sometimes they are not the cleanest, nor the fastest when you are inside. However, drive thru is always good here. Minus when they give me 1 packet of taco sauce for when I order four tacos. I always, always ask for extra taco sauce at this location now.  So if you like the JIB food and don't mind people watching, then this is the spot for you!!"}
{"text":"The past week I had been slaving away in the kitchen and I was ready to eat out. I had to run some errands and while driving I saw this big billboard sign for Jack in the Box and I was like, \"Oh Yeah!\" but then I was instantly sad when I didn't see one immediately around.   Nevertheless, I kept driving and I look ahead and I see Jack in the Box.  I quickly look over my shoulder and move over 3 lanes and quickly pull into the driveway. No other drivers were hurt, I should mention.  I was hot and tired, so drive thru it was. I got my two tacos on and they had a special running for the All American Combo for $4.99 so I said why not and went for it. I don't typically purchase burgers from Jack in the Box so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Randy, that is the name of the fella that serviced me. He was polite, cordial and very friendly. When he asked me if my order on the screen was correct and I told him I couldn't read it, he didn't make me feel bad or give a fuss, he politely repeated my order to me. Then when I get to the window and he takes my payment, he hands me back my card and explains that he is going to close the window on me but my food is being prepared and will be ready momentarily.  I think my jaw hit the ground. I was completely amazed at his EXCELLENT customer service. You know when you are at the drive thru and you feel like you are more of an inconvenience to the employee rather than a paying customer, or how rude they can be when they just shut the window on you and don't say anything? Randy provided STELLAR customer service. I was so dumbfounded by his most awesome job that I forgot to check my food when he gave it to me. By the time I thought about it, I was already in the street and it was too late. So I said to myself, \"Self, just pray that is right when you get home.\" What I should have said to myself was, \"Self, you know that fella Randy isn't going to mess your order up\".  So I get home and guess what... My order was correct and he wasn't stingy with the taco sauce like some places are. He gave me just enough, four packets. These little things matter.  Onto the food -   Burger: It contained to big meaty patties, melted cheese, mayo, lettuce ,tomato and I think onion. It was very tasty and I was a fan. This burger ain't no joke. I couldn't even eat half of it. I was stuffed but wanted to keep it eating it.  My fries were piping hot (even after my drive home). My tacos were not sloppily made and well, you can't go wrong with a fried taco.  I am definitely going to go back to this location. I need to see if my first time experience here was a fluke or the real deal. But let me tell you this, I never truly say to myself I need to go back to this fast food place. They are a dime a dozen and a huge corporation so the food will always taste the same but this service stands out above the rest.   Today, that Randy, he made me fan.   Thanks Jack!"}
{"text":"I went to this location at 6:30 am specifically for an Oreo Milkshake and fries only to be told, \"Our milk shake machine is down and won't be running until later.\" Why? Why the hell is your location 24 damn hours and I can't have what is being advertised to me on the menu??? Already angry and pissed off because I was craving this while I'm pregnant, I ended up ordering the number 12 which is the chicken strip deal. I got home and my chicken strips were gummy and tasted weird. The fries were ok but the whole meal overall tasted like disappointment."}
{"text":"THIS COMPLAINT IS ABOUT THE FRANCHISE LOCATED AT 4866 S Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, NV, 89119  My visit was on 7/13/3016 around 10:30-10:45  I was openly mocked by the employee as well as other workers while I was giving my order over the intercom. I was seriously mind blown when I literally heard my order taker laugh as employees in the background mimiced the sound of my voice. My order taker was so distracted by her co workers making fun of my voice, that she had to repeat questions that I already gave the answers to. When I told her that I already told her that I wanted my combo a medium, she literally changed her voice to mimic mine and proceeded to answer me with a disgusting attitude. Not only that, as I was trying to complete my order with her over the intercom, a girl came out from the back hallway EXIT to \"pretend\" to look at the drive thru menu just to take a look at me. . . like no one has ever ordered from their drive thru before. I was so put back and felt so disrespected that I didn't even bother pulling up to the window to give them a single penny of mine. I was so upset that I called the store to speak to the manager, and the employee that said she was the manager had THE WORST ATTITUDE and mumbled her name every time I asked what her name was. . Like she was scared to tell me, because I KNOW she knew exactly who I was when I called, my voice is so little and unique that it is 100% unforgettable. Shame on this entire location for making fun of someone who sounds different from them! I never felt so belittled in my whole life, I just wanted to order a meal for myself, and I left humiliated and angry for being judged just by the sound of my voice. I just got off work and all I wanted was to just put up my feet and enjoy a late dinner. So thank you Maryland Parkway for treating me so poorly, you will never receive my friends or family's business again.  I wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"This is my first ever Jack in the Box, a little different fast food for me.  Breakfast all day, burgers, chicken sandwich, shakes, brew coffee and ice teas, Taco and egg rolls, like they are not sure what they are.  Staff was very   The commercials did not prepare me for my first visit, undecided as to if I would come back.  Self serve soda machine with many choices, our favorite is Barq's orange cream soda with a splash of vanilla soda."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has a lot of great burger chains, so why do people even consider Jack In The Box.  The burgers are very greasy and have a very bland taste, even with tempered jalapenos.  Don't even get me started on the tacos.  Fried corn shells with that culinary oxymoron known as American cheese makes a taco?  I do not think so!  Go to In-N-Out or Fatburger instead."}
{"text":"I live in MD, so this was my first time eating here. My burger and fries were good, nothing to seriously write home about. Prices are cheap, and there is a wide variety of food to pick from. It's pretty close to the strip, but I'm not sure if it's totally walkable unless you're staying at New York New York, Tropicana, ect."}
{"text":"As I sit here in the drive thru line FOURTEEN MINUTES after I placed my order, I ask myself, \"WHY?\" The girl at the drive thru says, \"sorry, it's early morning.\" I look thru the window and see at least 2 employees standing around drinking soda and shooting the bull...gotta love it."}
{"text":"I never thought the day would come when I'd be writing a review about fast food.   Here is the deal, this Jack in the Box is right next to my work and I happen to be a big fan of their iced coffee.  I stop in every morning to get it and if I don't my day just isn't right.    I am not a fast food person so all I can comment on is the iced coffee and the service.  I have created a following at work, my coworkers are now addicted to the iced coffee as well.  It actually tastes like coffee and you don't feel sick to your stomach after drinking it.   The service...this place is always busy and they are quick and efficient and the staff always has smiles on their face.   Special shout out to Perla, who is a sweetheart and I can tell is going places.  She always asks how my day is and has excellent customer service skills.  She can't help but make you smile!   I would give them five stars but out of principle I simply can not...it is a fast food place after all! ;)"}
{"text":"Ok so this review is based on my experience here. We walked in and got in line behind two people. For 15 minutes we waited and not one of them served. Then one person got his food and to my surprise the order was wrong. It was two chicken strip meals with fries and he got one chicken strip meal with 3 tacos. How does a man not remember an order that simple? Is it because he is lazy, or stupid, or unmotivated? I think it is all of those because that halfwit must have done the worst job behind the counter  that I have ever seen. In the end we did not get our food because a very hairy and sweaty man with a John Deer tattoo on his neck went behind the counter which really disgusted me."}
{"text":"Horrible service and after waiting almost 30 min for my order it's wrong.  I was clear about this being correct and obviously everyone at this store is incapable of following  instructions or reading, not the first time this has happened.   I will never visit again. Its no wonder retail is a dying industry, it's because nobody working understands how to to handle customers or cares about their jobs."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and courteous, food was hot, but tasted as if they haven't had a new shipment of ingredients in a few days. But that's to be expected."}
{"text":"A little disappointed in the service tonight. I purchased  combo meal and asked for a strawberry soda and got a fruit punch instead. I didn't realize the mistake until I left and I was in no mood to go back. And my chicken sandwich was piled with mayo  Do better!"}
{"text":"I came here for only 2 tacos and I've been waiting in this line for 30 mins. Horrible service! I should've went to Mcdonalds!"}
{"text":"My husband had to leave early for work so I ran to get him a quick lunch and went through the drive thru. I placed my order, confirmed it was correct on the screen, and ran home to quickly eat. I get home to find instead of ultimate bacon cheeseburgers they gave me breakfast sandwiches and 2 less tacos. I look at the receipt and it's not even what the screen had showed. I call and speak to the manager Bobby and all she did was try to argue with me, so I eventually informed her that they have messed up a few of my order and I will not be returning. Sorry but I know what I ordered and I know the screen showed. I wouldn't confirm an order if it's not what I wanted and had food I was allergic to. Plus after taking everything out of the bag I found hair in the bottom of the bag. My husband went to take the food back to the location and to get a refund and said the manager was a total bitch. Hope you feel good Bobby about being totally rude to a pregnant emotional woman and making her cry!"}
{"text":"John is awesome!!!! He needs a raise! He is a really friendly hard working guy! #teamjohn"}
{"text":"Man this Hendertucky... never fuck with a white man's jumbo jack  I just watched some pissed off white folks trying to rob this place... stating  they didn't get food that they just pigged out on! Bitch ass manager gave them some more food ahah man I would have put these putos out the back door. Never have a crew that can get stole on by drunk white people in the middle of the night. People are drunk and trying to smash on a mediocre sammich as this time of night never fuck that up! Shout out to dude that works the gas station he's holding it down"}
{"text":"Standard issue Jack.  Not bad, not great.  Really shocked at the price of an ultimate cheese burger."}
{"text":"Ugh! Yuck! Ptooyey!  I was a big fan of Jack-in-the-Box when back in the 70's and I have made a pilgrimage to Jack-in-the-Box every time I get west of the Mississippi.   I had a burger from Jack-in-the-Box two nights ago while vacationing in Phoenix. Maybe my taste-buds have grown up. It was the worst burger that I have had in a long, long time. Two bites and I threw the rest out.  They get a single star because the young man at the window was so nice and polite."}
{"text":"I don't think this location has a full menu, it seemed pretty small. Though I haven't been to a Jack in the Box for years so I can't be sure. They serve breakfast all day which is great, sometimes you just can't make the breakfast cut off at other fast food locations, especially after a night in Vegas!  I had my heart set on breakfast, but ended up getting a grilled turkey, bacon sandwich which sounded pretty tasty. It took awhile to get our food considering the place wasn't packed at all. My husband and I were both pretty disappointed in the sandwich, it had some gross sauce on it that we both did our best to wipe off. Yuck! Totally ruined the sandwich. Maybe I should have stuck with a breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"Lesley greeted me on the drive thru and asked me politely what I would like to order. I told her 4 tacos with 2 free tacos with a coupon. I was told that they are no longer 2 tacos for 99 cents they are now $1.19 for 2 tacos. Still really not a bad deal. Got 6 tacos  for  $2.59. Yes, they are not the best but when when you're hungry it fills in the cracks. They were hot and crispy and recieved extra hot sauce and napkins. Now where can you get fresh hot tacos with no hassle? In and out in less than 5 min. And she had a big smile that would melt a mountain of daily problems!  Thank you Lesley"}
{"text":"What a dump.  This place needs to be condemned.  I don't even know where the laundry list of disappointment begins with this place.  Lets walk a customer through a trip to this place.  The parking lot.  I would like to find out who designed the layout of the parking lot and castrate them and their family.  The parking spots are smaller than my dick.  Door dings or someone smashing into your bumper are a almost a guarantee.  Only thing smaller than the parking spots are the tables inside this place.  Good luck negotiating the drive through.  Walking into the place:  Once you get past the homeless people begging for change, you go inside to almost always find more of their clan sitting at a table, asking for more money.  Even when you are eating.  I've had some of them sit at my table and start asking for my food or money.  This has happened more than once.    Always smells like bile outside here.  No one working there seems to give a shit.  The carpet.  You know those run down casinos just outside of Las Vegas, with 50 years of dirt, smoke, piss, and drinks spilled on them?   This place looks like it bought their carpet from them and let 10 years of wear continue afterwards previously mentioned conditions.  Then added all sorts of fries, condiments, and other various shit all over the place.  I stepped in gum there last month in the dining room carpet.  Told an employee and they said \"O.K.\"  Wiped it off my shoe on a chair.  Was still there last week when I came back.  Have never been here without at least seeing ketchup or mustard on the walls or chairs somewhere.  Gross.  The crew: I love trying to eat my 3000 calorie meal listening to the crew YELLING at each other in Spanish.  Has happened every time I have been here.  The bathroom: Jesus, hold it, piss in the parking lot, or go before you get here.  I am sure there is some sort of paranormal activity in the john there coming out of the plumbing.  A month ago there was a syringe inside the toilet.  Lovely.  Could probably just piss on the carpet of the dining room while eating, I don't think anyone will notice.  Or care for that matter.  Food seems to be the typical garbage at all Jack in the Box restaurants, so no ding on them for that.  However, I always feel like I need a shower after I eat here.  A plus:  Seems a lot of the day crew entertainers that work at the strip joint next door eat lunch at this dive before their shift.  At least they have that going for them."}
{"text":"I've been to this Jack in the Box on several occasions. There really isn't anything distinct about it. The service has been standard on every occasion that I have visited via the drive thru and I have no qualms about stopping here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Another typical Jack in the Box location. They aren't particular remarkable. Like most, they are fast and efficient. The service is friendly and they are accurate with their orders.   I have no qualms about stopping by the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This morning we had the grilled breakfast sandwich. It is large enough that my husband and I split it and the hash-browns were hot with a crispy out side. We will be having this again soon."}
{"text":"Don't go here . Horrible customer service. The food was terrible ...  couldn't get a simple cheeseburger right !!!"}
{"text":"Wow seriously the worst experience ever at a fast food restaurant..... Funny thing is the food was fine, the service... The service was absolutely horrible. The guy who I do t remember his name(probably because he was forgettable) refused to even give me a small cup for just ice. Meanwhile a large family had asked for a ton of water cups and had nothing but come on them. He was rude to other members in our group, not taking their correct orders. Just overall the worst. Never will go back to that place ever ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Filthy! Floors, drink station, everything! Returned my sons apples that were completely brown and watched the employee rummage through many more before bringing out a new box... He handed them to me and they were expired.  Never again."}
{"text":"the only place in NC that reminds me of my days in California... I order 100 tacos every time and they do not bat an eye, very gracious staff. The breakfast Jacks! The tacos!!!! the Jumbo Jack, woohoo! Order a shake and the curly fries, you'll be set."}
{"text":"The staff is obviously pretty busy and it's the middle of the night and yet they are very friendly! I honestly downloaded yelp just to say how great the service is here."}
{"text":"It's fast food so of course it's unhealthy and perfect for when you're low on money. :)"}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food. If you wish to be treated like an idiot and never get your order correct ever, by all means, please visit this establishment. Don't ever ask for any sandwich with no mayonnaise, because rest assured, you will get extra mayonnaise. And don't bother showing up to the 24 hour drive thru at anytime between two and four. They'll be closed..."}
{"text":"Headed on way to work it is 4:11 am thought great jack in the box is 24 hours...... well it's not. They state on the greeting thank you for coming to jack in the box my system is now updating have a great day I can't take your order.... then it goes silent.... ummmmm is there one near by that can? No (he's a manager by the way) Ok jack in the box you should have a system in place when downloading because this associate didn't even know when the download would finish."}
{"text":"Disappointing almost every time the order is wrong.  This morning took the cake!  Ordered 2 breakfast combos they forgot both hash browns.  We had already pulled away from the window so had to park and go in.  Then we got home and the Grande Sausage burrito had NO sausage!!"}
{"text":"Yes it's fast food, but that doesn't mean you won't be able to taste something exquisite. For a dollar, you get two tacos that are like nothing else you will find (now I see what all the fuss is about).   But if you really want to try something that you weren't expecting to be unbelievable, you'll want to try their Spring Rolls. I recommend getting the three pack because these are the best spring rolls money can buy. They're perfectly crunchy on the outside, and the most moist feeling I've ever had in a spring roll."}
{"text":"It's Jack in the Box. Nevet got an order wrong, always pleasant and helpful. Only complaint they don't have shakes late at night."}
{"text":"Pretty fast drive thru unless it's lunch hour like any other place. Employees are pleasant. Can't say anything about the dining inside as I've never been there lol"}
{"text":"First time going to a Jack In The Box, and it was really good. Great service and good food."}
{"text":"the food is fantastic but the customer service leaves alot to be desired. tonight I witness 3 orders in a row including myself turn back around to get the order corrected. Not because we got each-others orders,but because the orders where just wrong."}
{"text":"I've actually not once had a bad experience at this location. Bacon cheddar wedges for the win!"}
{"text":"Awful place with poor customer service. There are even signs posted of a \"dining room time limit\" of 30 minutes, which I've never seen at any other Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Lets just say this place rocks on a late night! I love their tacos! They have a great selection of other menu items. Ranging from burgers to milkshakes and fries. You can make almost anything a combo for an additional charge or buy things a la carte. (Single) lol They are open 24/7! The staff is friendly & they always try to be as quick & efficient as possible when there are long lines. Which there almost always are at late night! Swing by for some good late night eating!"}
{"text":"******SCAM*****SPIDERS WEB*****  Park your car, eat Walk off property and those you didn't know we're watching have car towed. $180 later and you get your car back.    Now the tow truck company is very poorly reviewed but people forget, JITB hired them. They (tow company) are parasites by nature.  JITB though,  if everyone boycotted this location,  well the tow company lilies contract to new owner who wants reputable service from tow company.    This has been happening for years.  It is so well documented that a cab will usually be waiting to take you to impound lot to get there slice of the pie."}
{"text":"I won't even go back to this location every time I come here and get a to go order on the drive thru on graveyard they always forget something and it happens multiple times...nothing wrong with the food but I think the employees on graveyard are not paying attention on the order."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I enjoy Jack in the Box, but my recently visit had me disappointed. I ordered my meals with curry fries instead they put regular fries and they were half way full and cold!"}
{"text":"To the woman behind the counter: leave your freaking kids at home.  It was bad enough that my simple order of tacos and fries came to me incorrect, but the kids who were running around, screaming, and making a mess made it even worse.  They were going in and out of the side door, slamming those doors, running around the tables, and playing with the soda machine. I'm standing there, a paying customer, waiting for these brats to stop screaming \"LET ME PUSH THE BUTTON!\" so I can refill my diet coke. Mom came after a while and offered to fill my drink while her kids were still picking which flavor of Fanta to choose.  I almost lost it when one of them went up to the counter and started kept shouting \" MOM MOM MOM MOM MOM MOM MOM!\"  If I had acted half as badly as those kids at that age, my dad would have whooped my ass. Never coming here again."}
