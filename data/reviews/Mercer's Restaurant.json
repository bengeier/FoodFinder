{"text":"Good basic American food. The prime rib is tasty, tender and juicy. They serve it with a horseradish sauce upon request."}
{"text":"We stopped in around 10:30 am and ordered the all you can eat meals.  Both were great and the service was prompt.  Refills came quickly.  Will be back more often to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"Great food and a friendly staff.  They'll remember your booth and drink preference and have great patience with special orders.  Food is consistently good and always hot.  They've got great breakfast deals and I'd gladly give them five stars if their soups and salads were better.  Soups tend to be thick and gummy and my salads could have used a few more spins to get them dry.  Overall, good family joint with quick, friendly service and great deals."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place to have a good quite meal then this place is for you. The food isn't knock your socks off good but it's good. Love taking my wife here for breakfast."}
{"text":"The other reviews are pretty much dead-on: good food, great price, dated decor.  Went here with my grandparents -- it's a staple for them. Had the #1 breakfast. Toast was a bit crunchier than I would have liked, but the hashbrowns and eggs were dead on. The coffee was just good, regular, restaurant coffee. The service was nice and efficient, but not too fast (when it can start to feel pushy). They had a good crowd, but it wasn't crowded for a Sunday morning -- at least not until we were leaving and one of the church groups was coming in. Don't know how they are for other meals, but it seems to be a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was average with a fair price.  The TV'S were on and it was the political FOX news.  There is enough politics on TV and when I eat I should not have to listen to extreme opinions either right or left."}
{"text":"Breakfast review.  Great simple dinner food.  Great friendly staff. Fast service. Large portions sizes and great prices with daily specials"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here today, for first time.  WOW!  What a great time we had and the food was wonderful!  Home cooked and very tasty.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast from here for the first time today. The food is super yummy and the portions are huge ! By far some of the best pancakes and bacon I've had from a restaurant! I will for sure be ordering from here in the future"}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  We both had the 10oz prime rib for $11.99, which came with choice of potato, salad, and vegetable.  This would have been $20 easily at Texas Road House (but Mercer's does not have peanuts).  I was glad to help out a local business and receive cheap food with great service in return.  We will be going back to try something else soon."}
{"text":"YUM we have driven by this place so many times and so glad we stopped. It was packed on a Friday night Fish Fry was the special of the day. I had a Ribeye and husband fish fry while college girl had chicken strips. Service was excellent and food was good. Staff is efficient and chess back often. First time and it won't be the last :). Shop and eat local!"}
{"text":"Better than what we anticipated-food is good, friendly and prompt service. Get the cheeseburger or the French dip!"}
{"text":"Waitress was rude. Got burnt waffles and she shook her head as if it was my fault. Didn't apologize. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Cheap too! Went on a Friday before noon, fast and easy. A little outdated, older atmosphere, but great food."}
{"text":"First time eating there. Got there about 10 am prompt seating fast service a very good food reasonable prices. They have a all you can eat fish fry Tuesday's and Friday and looks like one option is all you can eat shrimp and fish. I'll be trying that one. Great place"}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast! Chicken fried steak and eggs with home fries is a must! My husband is from Philly and appreciates the true diner experience."}
{"text":"Was told of this place from a friend and was sooooo happy we checked it out!  We had a short wait but as soon as our buts were in the seat we were asked what were we drinking!  Not just once but by everyone that walked by as they noticed we didn't have something, awesome!  The coffee is pretty good although we found the oj to be kind of watery.  The entire staff is johnny-on-the-spot for coffee refills and everyone was pleasant and fun.  Amber was our server and was awesome she was full of smiles and wonderful suggestions.  They were calling put the regulars by name and that is always great to see....we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and who knows...maybe one day they will know our name!!!"}
{"text":"Have been going to Mercer's  for many years now and just signed up for yelp, thus the new review! This place has great food and for the most part great service. The owner and the wait staff that has been there the longest are fantastic! You'll figure out who they are. Now the food. Good all american fare. If you want a good meal at a fare price this is the place. It is right next to SunCity so the retired crowd are the main clientele. The only downfalls this place has is the decor, which they just spruced up. It is clean and maintained, just dated decor, southwest colors from the 80's, the others downfall is the desert. Pies, and cakes both seem to be frozen and thawed food service food. Otherwise you'll love the food. chicken pot pie is great and the fish and chips is just like back home in the midwest!"}
{"text":"I was brought here for breakfast on several occasions and I'm happy to say that while the decor is a little grandma-y the food is good and the prices are even better. The servers are friendly and make you feel at home.  Good eats."}
{"text":"No where else can you get a huge...perfectly cooked..ribeye steak...with mashed potatoes..veggies and a salad for 12 bucks!! Also ...great prices on good wine!  My husband liked the all you can eat fish fry...and my uncle really enjoyed his French dip sandwich.  Great family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"average diner, rueben was soggy and they serve thousand island on the side? So you have to take apart your sandwich. Thousand island is part of a rueben folks.  huge variety of choices which probably says they can only do average on taste."}
{"text":"Mom and I have been looking to buy a house in that area for months and have stopped to eat here 4 times and every time it has been delicious. The customers are friendly, the staff has always been friendly and the food is great. So far the chicken pot pie is my favorite. We just bought a house in desert vista which is just around the corner and we are so happy because we love this place. We will be seeing allot of it soon. Prices are reasonable too. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars not for the ambience, or outstanding food.. but for the price, service, menu selection, staff and overall.   Mercers is a great place for a great selection of good food at great prices.   Pork chops and cabbage Rubens Really good breakfasts Good Coffee Seafood  and all your favorites.   I have gone to eat there had a really good meal.. paid for a couple of people's meal at the same time without them knowing and still come out with change of $30"}
{"text":"If you are expecting \"edgy\" food with exotic undertones, tinkling fountains and lots of atmosphere -- don't come here. This restaurant is all about what is comforting, classic, and familiar. They serve a clientele that includes a heavy percentage of older people, and they understand the demographic they deal with very well. The staff is patient and not easily offended. Their prices are low to reasonable, the portions hearty, and the dishes all easily identified without a lengthy menu legend. When I can't stand to face another plate decorated with stuff I don't recognize, we come here so I can relax.   This is basically a large version of a hometown diner. If your expectations are in line for what they do best, you will be very happy you came here."}
{"text":"Older crowd. Nice quiet dining which is important to me. Price is cheaper than fast food and the portions are large. Mercers is good ol down home cooking. My uncle was excited to see corned beef hash on their breakfast menu. DÃ©cor is outdated as mentioned but its cozy and geared towards older folks. If you have kids that are well behaved expect many complements, if not expect a lot of granny glares :-)"}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband 's very favorite restaurant!  The food is home cooked and tastes like your mom or your grandma made it! The serving staff is excellent. The prices you just can't beat. Give it a try you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great conventional food.  Always consistent and good.  I think best waffles in town.  We eat there two times a week.  All you can eat cod and shrimp Tuesday and Friday.  Free ice cream on Tuesdays!!  The Cod must be cold water as it is very good and not fishy.  Staff very friendly and efficient.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We actually ate here because the one on the gps was no longer in business.  The breakfast was good and the food was plentiful!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on recommendation from a local and yelp postings. Greeted and seated quick. GREAT service from our waitress and can tell the entire staff are dialed in to customer service. Older retired crowd, but there is a reason they have been there 2 generations...great service, good food..all good. Breakfast was perfect. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. We showed up about 15 minutes from closing and got the absolute best service we could have possibly received. I've been to a few restaurants where we showed up before closing not realizing and received not such friendly service however the staff at Mercers couldn't have been friendlier. They made us feel welcome and made it feel as if we weren't rushed to leave after our meal. Thank you for great tasting food which I highly recommend and again thank you for amazing friendly service."}
{"text":"Nice place for homemade food. Large portions so you will not be hungry , and affordable for senior citizens too! My mom likes this place. Cod & ribs & prime rib & breakfast are pretty taste !"}
{"text":"They've got the best ranch dressing I've found so far in Arizona. They've got burgers they got pot roast they've got old style cooking anything you want it is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 25 years. Never a bad meal. The menu has a good selection of well prepared food. This is the best place to eat in Sun City Arizona."}
{"text":"I saw that they had a 4 star ratting and we were hungry for a Friday Night Fish Fry. First impression was not good as we walked into an almost empty restaurant on a a Friday night at 6PM. The Tops of the booth backrests were dirty and oil stained. Very much in need of a very good cleaning and/or replacement. Shown a table by the host by pointing to the table. We were with my 96year old mother who uses a wheeled walker. He wasn't in tuned into the fact that perhaps he should pull out a chair for her or at least ask. The waitress was friendly and welcoming. Clam chowder was quite good a large bowl was provided. I ordered a Cod and Shrimp combo. Although the shrimp were rather small, they were tasty. The cod was marginal. Not really nice clean cut pieces  and breaded, just chunks. Baked potato was tasty and done fine. My wife had a baked cod that had obviously been frozen (not too long ago) and not very good. When you pressed down on the fish water came out.  I asked for seconds on the Shrimp (all you can eat) and had to wait forever for the waitress to return to take the order. Much too occupied with talking to a table of regulars and not paying equal attention to all the customers. We will not return."}
{"text":"Food was great. Wonderful mom and pop atmosphere. Very clean, and the staff was very kind. Food was delivered quickly and hot! We will make this a regular place to meet our son and DIL for meals, since it is right between where we each live. It is pretty convenient and has plenty of parking outside since it is in a strip mall."}
{"text":"We have patronized this place several times over the years, and the food and service have always been good.  It's a family atmosphere and is almost always crowded. The only drawback is that you may have a wait to get in and the front lobby is very small, so you may have to wait outside.  It gets even more crowded when you try to pay at the front cashier's station in the midst of the people waiting to get in.  Once in, the menu is quite varied and the food quality has always been good.  We have never had poor service while there either.  We live a ways away, so only go there on occasion but they have a lot of faithful regulars who live in the area on Peoria Ave."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place to grab an affordable yet satisfying meal, look no further. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner options that are sure to appeal to a wide assortment of diners. I had the biscuits and gravy with bacon and coffee and I couldn't believe how affordable the meal was. I also love the fact that this place is family owned which really comes through in the excellent service and attention to detail. You won't leave here hungry!"}
{"text":"On a quest for the best biscuits and gravy.  Mercer's was recommended by a friend as she felt, \"they have the best biscuits and gravy\".  Um, I don't think she knows what great biscuits and gravy are supposed to taste like. We had a heart to heart. The gravy was served in a cereal bowl with sprinkled sausage on top. The gravy tasted of flour and there was not a hint of pepper in it.  The biscuits were perfect.  The search continues. Also ordered the scrambled eggs. If you don't like your scramble on the wet side, order them well. I admired my boyfriends scramble and pouted as to why as his were perfect. He stated that he ordered his well cooked. I didn't know to order scrambled eggs in the same fashion as a steak. Overall, the service was awesome. Quite busy on a mid Sunday morning. Very senior cafeteria ish."}
{"text":"We arrived there at about 11am and waited awhile for the hostess to show Ordered the Reuben and it came with no dressing, hostess said it was because they had a lot of seniors! WTH? If you're going to modify a standard sandwich, the least you could do in note the new sandwich ingredients in the menu. Bizarre. Soup out before the sandwich. When you get soup and a sandwich, most people expect them at the same time. You can at least ask if you want the soup out first. Server kicked a utensil across the floor. Unbelievable. Food generally pretty good but the service was on par with a low rated restaurant. Food out fast and hot which is a plus.  The general gist I got was they cater to seniors and judging by the reason they modify their Reuben, I think it's an accurate impression. 3 stars and I think I'm being generous. I won't look to come here again but might not pass it up if I don't feel like going further.  Meh."}
{"text":"We like to go to Mercers because it has a relaxed homey atmosphere and the food is excellent for the price. Breakfast is served all day and the biscuits and gravy are outstanding. Also good are the baked cod, prime rib, turkey bacon salad, fried chicken, and tilapia, just to name a few.  They also have all you can eat fish and chips a couple of times a week and free ice cream on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick dinner. Definitely not a \"foodie destination\" but the service was good and the prices are nice. I had one of the specials, corned beef and cabbage, for $8.99. The portion size of the corned beef was very generous and it came with a quarter head of cabbage and some carrots and potatoes. You definitely need to add salt and pepper as the seasoning does tend to be rather bland as noted by another reviewer. The small side salad I got with it was good and I really liked the addition of the beets on it. Hubby got the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were instant and the green beans definitely came out of a can but he said his steak was good. We ended up splitting a strawberry shortcake afterwards and it was really good. I liked how they used a regular biscuit instead of spongecake so it is not too sweet. So all in all it was an okay dinner and I'm sure we will go back simply because of its location to the lodge and how quick they are in getting your food out to you."}
{"text":"Great food, my husband and I split the steak and eggs and we were both topped out, with everything perfectly cooked. They know what they are doing!  Good service as well,  and we loved how they were patriotic with a flag in the entry at the door and pictures of veterans on the wall. Highly recommend for any red blooded American who loves good food and country!"}
{"text":"They have fish fry specials on Tuesdays and Fridays. Came out to dinner with my best friend and her family. We all had the fish fry special. You can have the fish or fish with shrimp. I choose the fish with shrimp.   It was a nice entree because it also comes with two sides and a soup or salad. I had the salad with raspberry vinaigrette and chose broccoli and fries for my sides. The fry fish and shrimp is also all you can eat! The fish is so good!   Also, they have free ice cream on Tuesday's! Service was great and food was great"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here to try out something new for dinner. After reading the Yelp reviews, I had to try the fish n chips for myself, because I am PICKY! PICKY! PICKY! when it comes to fish n chips. My b/f ordered the Texas Burger. So our order arrives and the food was piping hot (very good), HOWEVER.....the quality wasn't there. My fish n chips were so-so, they look like deep fried blocks/cubes of fish. It was dry and the tartar sauce was too mayonaiss-ie. The Texas burger was oddly shaped, (rectangular) and served on a sub style bread. The burger wasn't the best and the flavor was bland. I guess this place has a thing for square-ish looking food? Anyway, I've certainly had WAY better fish n chips in Rio Rancho, NM at Turtle Mountain Brewing Company :D  As far as decor....it just plain sucks! very, very, very drab and outdated. It's bad enough dealing with flourescent lightning at work, but in a restaurant?? wtf! Everyone looked sallow and yellow.  I would've gave it 1 star but I added the extra star because the check was easy on the wallet and I liked the iced tea lol :)"}
{"text":"The all you can eat fish and shrimp was very good. I went there in a large group and everyone liked what the ordered so I will have to go back and try different foods. My friends said the Ruben was very good too. The waiter was very nice and got the food out to us quickly and came back several times to ask if anyone needed anything. Great job !!"}
{"text":"Just a good ol' neighborhood restaurant! The kind of place where people gather to chat over a meal and coffee.  Very friendly staff and quick service.  The food is good, not gourmet, but good.   I just had today's breakfast special. Chicken fried steak, two eggs, hash browns, and toast for $5.99.  My tummy is happy."}
{"text":"Great little family ran cafe. One of my favorites in the west valley along with Peoria Cafe and The place!"}
{"text":"This was by far 'the' worst meal I've ever had~!...I had the veal parm & there was so much tomato sauce on it, I should have just ordered the sauce as a side of soup~!...The veal was not even warm...The green beans were obviously frozen as when I bit into them, water squirted out...The baked potato was fine (but how hard would it be to screw up a baked potato, right?) however, it would have been nice to have more than a tablespoon of sour cream 'for' my potato...My daughter had the liver...It was dry & had the thickness of an sole insert for a shoe...My daughter said that it had a very strong taste of the grill on it~!...Our waitress neglected to bring my daughter her drink (without being reminded) and she never came back to our table to see if everything was ok or if we needed anything...That meal & visit was truly a waste of time and money and we left hungry...I would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason`!...  Ms Sidney M Covich"}
{"text":"I love the fish fry all you can eat cod!! Its the best! Big pieces,flakey, very delicious and full filling. Not to mention the staff is friendly and the atmosphere has a home feeling to it! Keep up the great work with this place!! My family and I will defiantly be back!!"}
{"text":"For a Mom-and-Pop restaurant- it's not bad. It is located by Sun City so the portion size is for elderly folks.   They did have speghetti  and meatballs. It was very good. This discontinued it. They replace with some other version of speghetti. It was not that great. I walked out out the restaurant still hungry.   Now I order either pork chops or chopped beef. The food quality is fair. You get three side with it. I go there from time to time when I want a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a meal at. Although it's sort of hidden from the main road and is located in an older strip mall but don't let the looks fool you. The food is great and the prices won't set you back to much. You get big portions for under $10 for breakfast. I had the chicken fried steak, hash browns, three eggs scrambled, and your choice of pancakes or toast. I also had a soda to drink. Not bad for $10. The service was very good and our server never let or drinks run dry. So this is one of Peoria's hidden treasures to eat at.  I would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This is good ole time, mom n pop style eating.  It's most popular with the older crowd which is a signal that this place has good food for a good price.   Their vegetable soup is delish and so are their hamburgers!  Stop in- it's not fancy, but it's good clean and yummy!"}
{"text":"My parents took me here with my Aunt and Uncle. It's a home cookin' kind of place with a super friendly staff and decent food and really good prices. They were very accommodating to my dad, who is disabled and everyone seemed satisfied with their meal.   I ordered the pork chops which were pretty regular, how-ya-doing pork chops that were hot and fresh and just salted, nothing fancy here.The quality of the meat was just average but since they were hot and fresh they were reasonably tasty. The carrots either came out of a can or they were boiled for a good long time 'cause they were mushy. My fries were fries.  Holy good lord was it bright fluorescent in there! Don't go on a date here unless you are really sure you want to see every wrinkle on your date's face. Plus, your date will look extra special in this bright light with the backdrop of the old school paneling you had in your basement growing up. It's not a swank place but that's A-OK because no one was there for the decor.  So ... Mercer's is not really my kind of place, BUT, it is highly practical with its pretty good food at very reasonable prices without the frills. I'd say a lot of people would like that."}
{"text":"A small neighborhood restaurant,family run. The wait staff are people who stay forever,so you know they must be doing something right!  This is a place you get to know who's serving you! Nothing fancy,but the service is good and friendly and they will do anything for you. The food is consistent--and that is important-and very good overall. Kudos to the breakfast cook,b/c this is the only place I can get over medium eggs and they are perfect every time. We've been coming for years,most of the time for breakfast. The customer typically is older,which is fine with us. Prices are very reasonable,and they have specials. No complaints at all. We love the place and the people there!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it has been around forever and passed up about 5 opportunities for updated decor.  It is done in the old southwestern pastels.  I think it was an all booth restuarant, but the booths have seen better days.  Whatever - they do pack em in.  We both ordered omelets but they forgot the ham in my companions.  The omelet was fine - nothing notable but hot and tasty.  Coffee was fresh and good and they kept it coming.  I'd go back for breakfast and maybe try a dinner.  They have beer and wine so it isn't a total minus 1 on that note."}
{"text":"We're staying near the University of Phoenix stadium for Phoenix Comicon Fan Fest. There are a ton of restaurants in the area within walking distance but it's a Saturday night and everything is very busy. So I turned to Yelp looking for alternatives and Mercer's kept coming up.   What the hell, we jumped in the car and drove a few miles down the road to check it out. The restaurant is a dark corner of a strip mall and didn't look like much on the outside. Things don't get much better when you enter. Everything is in washed out shades of blue, grey and beige. The combined age of the clientele has to seriously be in the thousands. You really think you've stumbled into a senior center cafeteria.   But once you get over that, everything was great. Service was fast, the waitress was friendly and the food was excellent and cheap. We got the cheeseburger and the prime rib sandwich. My only real complaint was that the cheeseburger was a little on the small side but it was a hand made patty and it was very tasty. Our meal came out to less than $20. I'd go back to Mercer's any day."}
{"text":"Oh Mercers how I love thee.    This is my family's go to spot when I don't want to cook.  I have tried several items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  My new favorite is the prime rib.  It's so juicy and delicious.  The portions are huge and the price is more than fair.  We come here at least every other week, and it just feels like grandma's house (but with better cooking).  :)  Decor isn't anything special, but it's clean.  The staff are always friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes made from special house batter were perfectly golden, light/airy & spongy in texture, and had a subtle maple flavor even without the addition of their syrup.  Pancakes are their flagship breakfast entree, though you can choose from the many other items including omelettes, french toast, or the common 2-egg with sides combos.  This place has a local owner with a family member as the chef named Dean that is admired by most patrons.  Oh, and he's the one who makes the delicious pancakes of course.  Atmosphere is clean, sterile, and almost like an old hospital cafeteria from decades ago (notice the operating room blue colored booths).    Patrons are almost exclusively senior citizens and the feel is relaxed, comfortable, and really is a throwback to casual breakfast spots were in the past.  Location is on the north side of Peoria just before 99th ave., not far west of the 101.  It's an older strip mall with ample parking, but down't be thrown off by the modest exterior (restaurant is to the far right when you enter the lot).  I really like this place because of the overall vibe, friendly service, and pancakes.  It's also a nice getaway from Millennials."}
{"text":"Upon entering, wait-staff was rude and short. After our order was placed, it took forever to receive our food. My sandwich was really bland and my girlfriend's soup tasted like it was fresh-out-of-the-can. Totally agree small-town diner experience, but expect a sub-par sandwich and mediocre service. If you have no other options in the area, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Horrible. Came in Sunday at noon. A good crowd, but not slammed. I only had the French toast with bacon. Simple right. Apparently not. The bacon was definitely sitting. It came out tough and cold. The French toast. Again cold. Not worth the money or another visit."}
{"text":"Looking for another place to eat breakfast on Sundays. Not that the place we usually eat was not good it is just we wanted a little change. Even though is is table service it almost feels like a cafeteria.  There is many people here that you can tell are regulars. The food was good the service was good and this is why people come time and time again.  I had beacon and eggs over easy. No bread no potatoes. I was asked if I wanted to sub something else for no bread or potatoes but no, I was satisfied with just the eggs and beacon. To my surprise when the meal came they had given me three eggs, Nice.  We had a good meal and will probably be back occasionally."}
