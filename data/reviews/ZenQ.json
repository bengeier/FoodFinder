{"text":"Service was SOOO slow!! Was already in line for 20 minutes, I ordered one shaved ice for takeout and that took 25 minutes. I was there 45 minutes for a freakin shaved ice! Why did I even stay so long?! Never again, not worth it"}
{"text":"They have no service on me and foods taste bad. I think yonge st one is better than that."}
{"text":"I come here to eat the coconut thing every week. It's very good. The bubble tea is good too. It's got a unique flavour I think it uses earl grey tea. The place also plays decent music unlike some other desert places. I haven't tried the food items here besides one of the rice dish. The deserts here are great!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Wasted one hour in total waiting for two bubble teas and it wasn't even busy. The girls don't seem to know what they are doing or they are too busy chatting with each other. The milk tea is too watered down."}
{"text":"I have been to all 4 Zenqs in the gta. All of them are good except this store. This store is the only one who doesn't have combos for dinner (available only till 4 pm). We ordered popcorn chicken and pork ribs in plum sauce. They all tasted terrible. Chicken was hard not crunchy. Ribs were bland and not sour at all. Service was awful. They do bare minimum only when you make them. Not going back. I recommend all the other Zenqs though. We are regulars, still love them."}
{"text":"Came after 10:30 on a friday evening. Packed with groups so maybe call in advance to check for seats.
Loved the tofu dessert and the mochis are fresh housemade and the tofu pudding is silky and soft. Not overly sweet. The taro topping is very good and balanced wel with all the other toppings. Would definitely come back and have it again."}
{"text":"Came here a few times to order bubble tea to go, mainly because it's convenient. They have a variety of food and dessert options (including many shaved ice flavours).

Their bubble tea is good but nothing extraordinary and is similarly priced to bubble tea places in the area. Some options come with pearls and some don't so pay attention when you're ordering! The cashier didn't ask me if I wanted toppings with my drink, which led me to forget to add tapioca (the original and honeydew come with tapioca but taro doesn't?). 

Speed is hit or miss. One time I was there the cashier had multiple drinks to make and a few people waiting in line to order while another worker just stood idly by, staring at the tables. This led to the people in line being helped very slowly and my drink order taking awhile to be made.

I would want to come back and try their dessert options and maybe the bbt if I was too lazy to go the two blocks to the Commerce Gate plaza. Cash & debit only"}
{"text":"Very good option for affordable and decent Taiwanese food particularly for people working around that area. For $7.90, you get a bento box with rice and 3 side dishes of your choice. Add another $2 you get a bubble tea from their selected menu. I ordered the crispy popcorn chicken and they were flavourful and in good portion. It didn't come with a dipping sauce though. The side dishes were nothing fancy but were surprisingly good. I got a little bit carried away with their dessert and diverse drink menu and would definitely come back for those items."}
{"text":"This is ZenQ's first Mississauga location. It's a chain of Taiwanese Desserts & Food. So if you are in the mood for something sweet. This place will not disappoint. It's located around the corner from Kinton Ramen (same plaza) and it gets pretty busy."}
{"text":"Food is average at best
But if you order lunch special with 3 people, and each person gets 3 side dishes, how to determine who gets which side dishes when all 3 people are only given one order slip to write on?

It is very sloppy way to take orders
So they just randomly give people the 3 sides.

Overall I am not a fan of Taiwanese food"}
{"text":"Been to the location near Woodbine & Denison, but this was my first time here. Came for the lunch specials - which are now 10.50. This is a pretty small location and luckily was able to be seated before a few more groups came in. Got the popcorn chicken and rice, with the grass jelly milk tea. Food was a good portion, had vegetables along with the chicken. Chicken was too salty even when mixed with the rice and other toppings. Drink tasted nice but was lacking in the grass jelly relative to other tea shops I've been to. Wondering if prices will keep increasing but for now a drink and dish is still relatively reasonable at the lunch special prices. Not a huge dessert person so can't comment much on that, although there were people inside the store during lunch hour just ordering desserts or teas, so there's that.   

Its super close and convenient for me in terms of location but if I were going to ZenQ I would probably prefer the Woodbine location just due to the more spacious seating."}
{"text":"4/5

Always looking for places that serve bubble tea....visited around 12:30 on Sunday to try the food specials as well. When you walk in you're asked if you want take out or dine in. There was only one other table at that time so we were able to grab the booth seats, with a few people getting take out. Service was extremely quick and ordering is done on your own sheet. Got the crispy chicken with rice while brother got the spaghetti and meat sauce. 

Food: Surprisingly, a lot of chicken with a decent mix of rice and vegetables. The chicken flavourful, although a tad bit dry. Spaghetti sauce was a bit diluted for my taste, but brother seemed to like it. 

Drink: Got the pearl milk tea and the litchi qq refresher. The refresher actually had a nice hint of litchi and the tapioca and jelly were not too chewy. 

Overall, pretty worth getting a drink and food for $10 (combos are $9.9 now instead of $9.5 as previously posted). The atmosphere was nice and casual, and is a good place to chill with friends. Bonus for good music and wifi!"}
{"text":"This is my favor chill out place with friends, clean environment, good service, food serve with efficient and not too crowded. 
Dinner box serve until 8p.m.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"ZenQ specializes in bubble tea and Taiwanese desserts.  I first went to their Markham location at Langham Square two years ago.  I remember really liking their popcorn chicken as the portion of the order was large and the fried chicken bites were up to my standards -- big, crunchy, and seasoned relatively well.

Unfortunately, I found that I was disappointed with the order of Salty Crispy Chicken (Popcorn Chicken) that I ordered here at this Woodbine location.  They also used a piece of wax paper here in which to serve the chicken on top of a basket.  The portion was very small.  I was first disappointed with the size and then disappointed with the quality.  I found that the pieces were very small and bland. :/  You can see in the photo that they used the wax paper to hold the chicken atop a basket.  If they took away the basket, you'd see the basket would barely be full...  A marketing tool to serve a smaller portion perhaps.

My mom also ordered from the Special Combo which was available from 12 to 8 p.m.  It included a choice of a Taiwanese rice or noodles dish with a drink.  It was a good deal.  We got the Minced Dry Noodles with a Winter Melon Tea.  Minced Dry Noodles is a Taiwanese dish that includes minced meat, preserved vegetables, tea-infused egg, with some dry noodles.  I thought that the noodles were pretty good in texture but overall seemed like an average dish with nothing too special to write home about.  

The Winter Melon Tea was pretty average where it wasn't bad and definitely wasn't too sweet."}
{"text":"Was happy to have grabbed a spot to eat-in during Sunday lunch. We got our BBT soon after we ordered. I get that they were busy, but it took more than an hour for a simple ramen and rice dish. I had to chase the waitress down for an explanation because I was worried that they had forgotten our food and when I finally found her, she was unapologetic and quickly brushed me off and said it was \"very busy.\" The results were very unimpressive. I would say the ramen is comparable to instant noodles and the broth was watered down. The curry pork cutlet with rice came with barely any sauce and it was cold... I was very underwhelmed. Will not be returning, I'm not sure how ZenQ will compete against other major BBT/taiwanese restaurants in Mississauga. The growth around the Square One area is ridiculous (Kinton Ramen opening in the same plaza) and with all these options, it would be silly to return to ZenQ."}
{"text":"Cute little cozy place to go to. Food was good more for a dessert place instead of having a dinner there. More for if you're looking to have a late night snack or to go for dessert. Not really meant for small children but overall if this is a place to go in chill and relax you found it."}
{"text":"Been here the second time. Thinking ZenQ should follow regular sanitary procedures. My server was fine but as I was waiting for my food, the other guest complained their extra bowl was dirty, a lady server - the one who looked really relax and lazy, took it away. As she was stepping away, she scratched off the dirt in the bowl, put it to an unoccupied table, then served another guest at nearby table, returned the same dirty bowl to the complained guest only that she cleaned it by scraping off the dirt.  I would advise to get any stuff you need there by yourself.  As far as the food goes, it is decent."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and it was totally empty. First impressions wasn't so good, they were cleaning and it smelt strongly of bleach. IMO cleaning should be done after or near closing...not when you still expect customers to come in.

Anyways I ordered a ZenQ Grass jelly special while my bf got the mango sago. Mine was ok - not too sweet but also a bit bland at the same time. I would prefer if the mochi balls were more flavorful. The mango sago my bf had was too sour."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing if you are thinking about getting rice noodles that are spicy don't get them unless you are up for a challenge. A VERY LONG WAIT!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a ZenQ closer to my place!

I ordered the fried chicken with rice, it was really good! My friend got this soup noodle bowl thing that was very bland. 

The shaved ice milk tea thing was PHENOMENAL. Tapioca and lychee jelly too? By the power of Zeus this is something I would go back for. 

One weird thing though was that they brought the dessert to me when my hot food just arrived. Really turned off by that.

The bubble tea though, the house tea has a strong floral scent and flavor and sugar and ice options, always good. My only gripe with the bubble tea was that there was very little in toppings both in tapioca and grass jelly.

I would go back just for dessert or bubble tea."}
{"text":"Good food but bad service.  The star is for the food and if the food was rated itself it would get rated higher.  But the service there has always been shotty when you eat in, e.g. takes a while to get your food.  Last night it was extremely bad.  They forgot our order and we sat there for 20 minutes.  Tables that came after us received their orders and we realized they forgot our order.  I walked up to tell them they forgot our order and made two observations from that exchange.  They became more lost after I told them that but didn't try to correct the situation.  The second (which is why I just walked out) is they had 3 staff making one dessert order at the front counter.  When I say 3 I really mean 1 with 2 others looking."}
{"text":"This is for the cold QQ ball desserts. I loved them when I tried it in taiwan at jiu fen, so obviously I was hoping to love again. Unfortunately it's mediocre at best. Sorry but no Zen Q!"}
{"text":"The minced pork rice was way too salty.  We told the server and he refused to change it but offered to give us more rice.  We didn't take his offer and left with 2/3 of the bowl untouched.  Adding rice to a salty dish is what I do at home with my own cooking.  I dont expect to do this at a restaurant.  

The popcorn chicken wasn't as good as the yonge location either.  If you like popcorn chicken, I strongly recommend trying ZenQ on yonge.  

Glass jelly milk tea was great!

But No I am not coming back again!  Been here twice and both times were disappointing."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't that busy. There was a wide variety of food to select from. We were quite hungry so we chose the meals rather than desserts. I ordered the salted chicken bites for apps and that was pretty good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. I also ordered two fried pork and rice meals (L10) for my friend and I, which the waiter said there was no pork left so we subbed it for chicken. My meal arrived first and I waited to eat till my friend received his. After 5 minutes the second meal didn't arrive. We tried to get the waiter's attention and he made no attempt to check up on us. Still, the second meal didn't arrive. So I went ahead and began eating. The fried chicken had no flavour and the mayo that came with it was bland. The veggies were also very bland. My friend tried my meal and realized how bland the food was, that he was happy his order never arrived. He did receive his iced peach green tea and he liked it. We tried to hail the waiter again to get our bill but he continued to serve other tables than ours.  Luckily we were not charged the second meal because it was never sent to the kitchen. We left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This cute little location had some great food and really friendly service! It's almost hard to miss in the plaza if you're not looking. My fiancé and I ordered two servings of their sweet potato fries because they were just so good. The place is very small with limited seating so it's perfect for take out or if you call in advance. Will go back!"}
{"text":"New bubble tea place around square one. Nice decoration. Friendly stuff. Overall experience is great."}
{"text":"Came here last week and was told they ran out of food and only had drinks available, and when I tried to order a drink, found out they ran out of tapioca bubbles, so I left disappointed. 

Fast forward one week and it seems they sorted out most of their issues and are now running smoothly after being open for only a couple of weeks. 

The food we ordered was delivered quickly and was quite tasty. The portions are pretty decent and the special combo price is very reasonable. 

The original pearl milk tea was not bad, but I think I prefer the one from Coco or Alley in the Commerce Valley plaza.

Overall, was quite happy and will definitely be back to try out their other specials.

NOTE: They do NOT take credit cards, cash and debit only."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting anything since my last zen q visit at the Unionville location was horrendous.

I got the $9.90 special combo, which is a rice thing including a choice of bubble tea (choices listed on the special combo menu).

My thing was the fried chicken rice which was actually really good! The chicken was a little too salty but the steamed rice had a dash of the minced pork. Overall I liked it.

It was a 3*.

Then i tried my dad's minced pork rice and it was amazing. It came with a whole marinated egg!! But yea I think that pork was done really well. Full of flavour, not super salty, and still had pork flavour. Def recommend this.

My drink was the Peach QQ refresher, no ice. I loved this drink.

Def recommend this place for drinks and snacks. Lunch and meals are ok. Not too much choice, which I like, but I think they do drinks much better."}
{"text":"If you are short on time and need a quick lunch with large portions, this is the place to go.  ZenQ has the lunch combo that is $8.90.  If you want to add a drink then it is an extra $2.  

I typically order the popcorn chicken with rice and they allow you to pick 3 side dishes.  Honestly, I have only ordered the popcorn chicken with rice so I can't speak to the quality of other combo dishes.  

I came here a few times with different groups of friends and they all seem equally pleased with the food here.  

Worth a try if you are thinking of what to eat for lunch"}
{"text":"Wasted 30 minutes for 2 takeout bubble teas. They need more (competent) staff, with only 3 people at the front counter and serving altogether. Other customers were waiting as long as I did for drinks that were apparently done already but the people serving them forgot about. They forgot about my drinks too. For something that should take max 5 minutes to do, I don't know how they manged to take so long. For those of you in the area, head to Chatime instead."}
{"text":"I think this place is just too small for a large crowd (16 people) on a Friday night. Since no reservations are allowed, we had to wait for a long time just to have the majority of people sat together. This is one of the smallest ZenQ I have been to and definitely would not recommend it for any party more than 4."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Dropped by after work for a bowl of minced pork noodles and a cup of ZenQ grass jelly drink for $11.30 + tax. 
Minced pork noodle : flavour of the mince pork itself was good, but it was extremely salty
Grass jelly milk tea : flavour was good as well, but was still towards the sweet side when we had asked for less sugar

Service: 2/5
The total amount of time spent at the restaurant was about 40 minutes, and had no memorable moments at all, but a grumpy waitress. Upon entering, the waitress came up to us and asked whether we are ordering or combo or not without providing any menus. When I asked for the menus because we were unsure of the combo items, she continued to explain that there are no cooked veggies and would need to cook it... (....??) 
I decided to go up for the bill as we were in a bit of rush, the waitress saw me approaching and chucked the bill on the table without eye contact but still with a grumpy face. 

Throughout this entire experience as a customer at this ZenQ location, I felt it was quite disappointing. The customer service could definitely be improved by a long shot. As a frequent restaurant-goer that values customer experience, I would only return for a take-out drink."}
{"text":"New BBT and dessert spot in Mississauga! I absolutely love the interior blue, the wood, light bulbs and design. This location is located under a condo building. It is not the easiest to access since I would still assume most people would drive and unfortunately parking is not free. Luckily the friend who we were seeing and were planning to make a visit to this new spot lived in the nearby condo so we just parked and walked over. On a Friday night past 8pm, there just was not a spot for the 6 of us so we just got take out. As far as I can see there were a lot of people either waiting for a table or getting take out as well. I ordered the tofu drink with green been and it really was not a drink ...more like a dessert in a cup. It was good don't get me wrong but I felt like I needed a spoon and not a straw. Do not get this if you actually want a drink- you have been warned. One of my friends got the the coconut dessert to go and it was served in an actual coconut but he only got plastic utensils which was not helpful whatsoever-good thing we had our drinks and desserts at friend's place. All my other friends just got bubble tea and drinks and no complaints. 

The new spot looks pretty chill, drinks and desserts are decent. Looking forward to trying the food and snacks next time but I have to say the parking situation may be the main consideration for when that next time may be."}
{"text":"After deciding a half-point meet up location I decided to try ZenQ.  Supposedly there are other ZenQ locations but this was the closest to home.
Known for their traditional Taiwanese desserts and hot foods this place was definitely worth it.
They've got a great selection of desserts whether you want shaved ice, ice cream or even bubble tea, they have it all.
If you're feeling hungry ZenQ offers a great selection of hot foods.
The location is central, convenient and inside the place is clean and contemporary.  
As always coming here during dinner time it can be tough finding a table due to its  popularity.
here's the breakdown:

*Taiwanese Fried popcorn Chicken: great portion, perfectly fried, sweet honey after taste.
*Sweet Short Ribs: delicious, great portion. 
*ZenQ Superbowl: was it huge, brown sugar topped over taro ice cream, served with yam, Q balls....it was the worst out of all dishes, plus it didn't even look appetizing.
*C6 Matcha Shaved Ice/ ice cream: This was a lot better than the ZenQ Super bowl I ordered.  This was served with tapioca, green tea ice cream on a bed of matcha shaved ice.
*DIY Monster Ice: Served with side condiments, Jen decided to try their HK Tea flavor which tasted more like earl grey, but nonetheless it looked cute.

I'll have to make another trip and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I would probably rate this a 5 star, but to be completely objective... i have changed my mind and made it into a 4 star.  There is a couple of reasons for this and the easiest way for me to put it is the fact that I am a bit biased.  However, location is key as I work close by within all the office building environment, this place provides great access to delicious food at a great price.  Especially when they used to have the lunch special which was actually a great value for the amounts of food they provided.  

The reason I said used to is because it has increased a bit (due to inflation) and it is definitely natural and even with the increase in price, still a great value for the amount of food that is given.  The price of the special is 8.9 dollars for a main with 3 side dishes and a bowl or serving of rice.  A very good value meal especially when restaurants are limited in variety and provides a decent selection of bbt for an extra 2 bucks which I think is pretty neat.  

You can probably find me here once or twice a week due to convenience as well as the fact that I am just a big fan of their side dishes =) Make sure to go a bit earlier before noon because otherwise sometimes ordering is a pain in the bu**, hence you have been warned =P"}
{"text":"This is not authentic Taiwanese restaurant at all.  Half of the menu is not Taiwanese dishes.  I ordered popcorn chicken with noodle soup.  The popcorn chicken tastes like fried chicken.  There is no pepper spice taste to it.  Secondly, they didn't wash the veggies that came with soup.  When I bite into it, i saw a chunk of dirt stuck in the veggie stem.  This is disgusting.  I stopped eating the whole noodle soup.  Thirdly, the service was terrible.  I asked an extra ??, the waitress gave me the plastic big spoon.  Then I asked for a metal one.  She corrected me as its not ??, its called ??.  I am telling you here, taiwanese don't have ?? in their dictionary.  If you are operating a 'Taiwanese' restaurant, you'd better get the language right."}
{"text":"I was so happy that there is finally a nearby Taiwanese food place opened near my neighbourhood.  However, I was a bit disappointed base on my couple times takeout experience.

The girls working there didn't seem to be welcoming nor helpful.  

It wasn't only the waiting time for take out is long.  It was also taking long just to place an order.  One time, a cashier got distracted on something when she was taking my order.  I was just waiting in front of her like an idiot.  It was all because of the lack of professional training or just simply being negligent?

The food and bubble tea I tried were just ok and nothing impressive."}
{"text":"Not bad not bad.
Came here at almost 8pm and apparently they have a combo special till 8pm! 
One entree plus a drink for $9.5 only.
We both ordered the popcorn chicken rice; one with lychee refresher and one with regular bbt.

Popcorn chicken was good and overall reasonable portion. If I were to be picky - the rice was a bit mushy. As for the drinks, lychee was meh (tasted artificial and I should have asked for less sweet) but regular bbt was fine. 

Services was pretty good too cuz there weren't many customers at that time; at some point it was just me and my bf. probably not many people know about this location yet. And another couple came in just past 8 and they asked for the combo. Initially the server told them that it's only offered till 8 but eventually gave it to them anyway; which was a nice gesture.

New and clean fixtures and nice decor too with huge tv looping Taiwanese music videos. 

I saw a previous review saying that at Lunch hour the takeout was confusing and while I was there dinner time I saw there's a sign up for a take out line. So look like they are open to comments for improvement. ;)"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on their grand opening day. The line up for free bubble tea went out the door and down the side of the plaza despite the rain. 
We opted to dine and skipped the line and feee bubble tea. 
We ordered minced pork on rice, bbq eel on rice, fresh hot taro tea, passion fruit black tea and mango milk shaved yogurt for dessert.
The minced pork on rice tasted standard and the portion is decent sized.
Bbq eel was ok. Actual size of the eel was small especially over the large bowl of rice. No bbq eel sauce so it was a bit dry. But still decent. 
The hot fresh taro was really delicious as well as the passion fruit black tea. 
Shaved ice lacked toppings, we ordered straight off the menu and it wasn't packed with topping like at the other zen q locations. 
The service was pretty good considering how busy they were. Overall I think I'd return. The take out line for the free bubble tea moved really fast, I was pretty surprised. There's a few things that need improvement but so far so good. Can't wait to come back for the other shaved ice desserts!"}
{"text":"Food not as good as the other location. Popcorn chicken was not fresh, so as the yellow/brownish bok choy in my noodle. Server not attentive and not helpful at all. Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"If you are looking for okay Taiwanese foods/desserts, this place is an option. Their menu is extensive and offers many traditional and fusion meals. We popped by for lunch and ordered their minced meat bowl and spicy noodles. Both came with drinks however I found that they put a lot more rice into the bowl than the delicious meat sauce and their noodles didn't have much else except for the spicy broth. The service was quick and the ambiance is nice. The individual beside us had an individual hot pot meal, perhaps that's something to try next time."}
{"text":"Finally, there's a bubble tea place in this area.  I'm working in this area, and ZenQ is now my new favourite place for lunch.

This Woodbine location has a different lunch menu than other ZenQ locations: Siao Tao Yuan Bento (?????).  Taiwanese bento box at $7.90+tax with 3 side dishes. Add another $2+tax to get one of their 5 drinks, including bubble tea.  Good deal, big portion, and love that I can pick my fav side dishes (try to get more veggie).

Regular ZenQ combo available here after 3pm. So not much different from other ZenQ locations.

They need a better waiting area for people waiting for their lunch take-out.  And need very clear signage for people lining up to pay for their take-out.

It is so crowded here during lunch break.  I'm so confused every time.  So many lines with people, which one should i line up to pay for my take-out??  Where should i wait for my take-out.  But they have signage for where to order my take-out :-)

Really love their popcorn chicken, oh, they call \"Salty Crispy Chicken\" here.  And of course their bubble tea is very good, but need to request 50% sugar, otherwise, it will be way too sweet."}
{"text":"Our hot foods were okay. I ordered a soup noodle and husband ordered a rice special. We both had the same toppings on our meals, i guess some restaurants do that to save time? Premake toppings and use the same ones in most meals?
The desserts were average $9.90 which i felt was over priced, for average taste and small portion. 
They had someone renovating the ceiling and eventually had to work on the ceiling above us and we had to move to another table mid meal. That was quite annoying since i'm pregnant, had trouble walking and super hungry lol."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place a try recently.  Ordered the popcorn chicken, meat sauce spaghetti, and the pork belly combos which all came with drinks.  The popcorn chicken and the pork belly was mediocre, which is find for a normal lunch, but nothing special.  The meat sauce spaghetti was different, something in their sauce made it sweeter that what I was expecting and I liked how it was different.  Overall, the meals were fine and the portions are acceptable, but there are restaurants with the same food for less of similar quality. The service was a tad slow, but not to the point where one would get severely aggrevated."}
{"text":"This place is my kids favourite places to go.  They love the popcorn chicken, and usually after their meal we would order their favourite deserts!  It's considered the highlight of their stay..."}
{"text":"I came here on opening day during their free drink event. 

The line wasn't too bad, but you could tell the line was getting longer by the time I ordered & left. 

The staff was quite nice despite how busy they were. 

I took a look at the overall pricing and it is very reasonable for lunch since the most expensive will top out around $12 with taxes give or take with a drink. 

The menu is not that much more different from their other locations. 

What I like the most is the way they have dearly identified where the take out is and where seating is. The booths are spacious and look very comfortable to sit in and the space has a lot more elbow room in comparison to some of their other locations. 

In general, I'll come back here to grab lunch."}
{"text":"ordered eel on rice waited for 30 mins and the egg was spoiled they canceled my order but its still pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"I have been to the location at Kennedy and Hwy 7 and Richmond Hill...ZenQ is a place that serves Taiwanese desserts, bubble tea and Taiwanese food.  I did try to go to their Yonge and Finch location..it was too small ans crowded, my friends and I want to Mabu down the street instead.

Consistent product whether I was in Markham or Richmond Hill...good food-a variety of choices available ...and comfortable seating.

One star off because : 
1) my cousin asked for a cup so that I can try some of her hot tea... and we were told it'd be $1.25 extra
2) there was a smell if burnt food throughout"}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favourite dinner place. Their combo meal with a drink is decent price but have increased in price a few times in the last year. You can choose sweetness level and whether you want ice for your drink BUT today I asked for 30% sugar but received more like 90% sugar. This is unacceptable. Too bad I found out after I left. 

The customer service have gotten worst over the years as well. Why must customers ask for a glass of water and get a dirty look? You would think getting a glass of water after sitting down is a standard expectation but apparently not at this place. After sitting down for 5 minutes I had to get my own manual because no one cares to offer us one. The staff was too busy chatting with each other. 

Getting the bill was a challenged too since they were hiding behind the take out counter. I'm using the word hiding because there was no customer at the counter and there was 2 staff chatting there. The layout of the place makes it hard for customers to get there attention. Time to find a time Taiwanese restaurant to hang out."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location at Langham Square all the time because of their $9.99 combos that include a drink.

I was disappointed to see that there were no combos advertised in the menu (though it was on the menu at the outside of the store)... There were several things unavailable on the menu and some indicated Markham only.. why advertise if its not available..?

I ordered the popcorn chicken with rice and it was delicious.. the chicken was piping hot and portion was large. My meal was served on a plate that was put on a plastic food court tray. The tray was not even at the bottom so every time I tried pick food up..it would spin in circle around the table...so annoying.

Overall, I am glad to see more Taiwanese food in Richmond Hill.. will probably come to satisfy my cravings when I don't want to go too far."}
{"text":"This ZenQ location is convenient and has plenty parking space. It is spacious with big TV, so it is family friendly.

Food and drink are on par as other ZenQ locations and have various lunch special.

I said this place is only okay because the service is always hit and miss. They made mistakes on our order a few times and very lack of service."}
{"text":"Went to ZenQ for the first time with a friend for lunch. I have to say I'm quite impressed with the lunch deals they offer. There's a bento box option and you can choose from as well comes with a drink. We ordered the mango shaved ice and that was incredible. Definitely couldn't finish everything but a nice treat indeed."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.
I always thought it was slightly odd that they opened a location here since its near so many office buildings, but actually it's a great meet up location since its right off the highway. A nice quiet spot to catch up with a friend - it's a sit down restaurant style and not cafeteria style like the kennedy location. Looks small outside but it's actually really spacious inside.

We had the DIY monster shaved ice, milk tea flavor ($9.90). How it works is you pick your shaved ice flavor, and 4 toppings. There were a lot of options to choose from so that was good. For our toppings we had tofu pudding, grass jelly, their q balls (green tea, sweet potato, and taro flavor), and egg rolls. The eyes are made out of marshmallows and a piece of chocolate chip, and bugles for the ears and nose. I liked the shaved ice - tasted like milk tea flakes just as expected but the flavor was there unlike other locations relying on sauces. The presentation is creative and cute, but in terms of the shaved ice portion, its nothing compared to Cha Me Cha."}
{"text":"The service here was good, they were nice and friendly. The tofu pudding with sweet potato was a disaster! It was very difficult to drink/eat. So I ended up not finishing it and getting athe tofu pudding with red bean instead. It was alright...if you're expecting your traditional tofu pudding don't because this is definitely not it. Their mango shaved iced however is really good! I especially enjoyed the jelly it came with."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely garbage, no water served and the dishes were terrible. It cost 9 dollars and it barely has anything."}
{"text":"Being situated underneath a condo, it was unsurprising that this place is small and cramped. There's not many tables so expect to wait in line during the weekends and late nights. When I first came in, there was a small line but since the employees does not acknowledge you when you enter, it was confusing whether the line was for take-out orders or dine-in. Nonetheless, after waiting several minutes at the entrance, I took a chance and grabbed a waitress near the front and asked for a table.

We ordered a beef noodle soup, passion fruit bubble tea, and a mango shaved iced dessert. I didn't get a chance to try the noodle soup but I heard it looked better than it tasted. For the mango shaved ice, you get plenty of mango chunks and jelly at the top. Much like most other shaved ice places, there's a large lump of crudely shaved ice sitting at the bottom after eating the toppings.

It's a generally nice place to visit if you manage to get a table during the evening hours. However, since it's a cramped place don't expect much privacy as your neighbour will be within a meter's reach."}
{"text":"Came to Zen Q for an early lunch.

I love the Lunch Bento (11 am to 3 pm) options as I can pick my Main and my sides to make a custom lunch order for $7.90 and $2 extra one of their drinks!

A little disorganized though and I got a little confused as I am not sure if it is a self serve or a sit down restaurants. I notice I was not the only one that stood in the front wanting to order from the counter directly.

Probably will be back for a quick bite next time when I am in the area. 

The restaurant does get busy during lunch rush with workers from the nearby offices, so either come earlier if you want to get a seat or if not you can always have your lunch to go."}
{"text":"I finally made it here after since they opened in April. Parking can be tricky due to all the condos nearby. We parked underground for $1/hour which is decent for this city. 

The place has more seating than I anticipated which is nice. A new hangout place for the weekend!! 

They have Taiwanese shaved ice desserts which is nice. Now I don't have to drive to North York or Markham. So indeed, it's good for cravings - less the drive and gas $$. 

My grass jelly dessert was nice. Not sweet at all. And my partner had a drink which he devoured it!! The price is also comparable to other bubble tea places. One can have lunch there too!! 

Verdict: indeed I'll go back!!"}
{"text":"Driving by this place everyday and finally decided to try it out during my lunch time.  I don't expect much from a dessert place, and yet I'm still very disappointed!!! Ordered a crispy chicken (pop corn chicken) lunch plate served with 3 side dishes, they served pre-cooked deep fried chicken, thats cold and not crispy at all. And the worth part when I ask the server to change a fresh cooked one, she first denied right away, and not being rude but I asked her take a bite, and she turned away.  She did order a fresh one from the kitchen at the end. I won't be back! Bye"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out with a couple friends and finally got a chance to. Came here Sat for lunch and it wasn't busy. It sucks that you have to pay for parking underground cause it's under a condo complex. There aren't that many seats.. maybe can fit under 30 people? Looks super urbanized and clean. 

They have lunch specials and all I really wanted to try was the popcorn chicken dish and their milk tea which worked for the lunch combo deal ($11~). I ordered the curry chicken for my boyfriend but they didn't have it at the time so I ordered the basil chicken for him. Idk. This one was weird, didn't like this one. Plus I hate picking out bones.

I liked the popcorn chicken and my milk tea. Tastes different. Fresh and juicy. My milk tea was really food and refreshing.. tho near the end of it it started tasting a bit bland so I guess i drank all the sugary stuff first LOL. 

Service was alright. Seems like the waitress kept coming back to ask to double check our order. 

I wanted to get some desserts but I got too full for that. Will come back next time!"}
{"text":"Came here to order bbtea only and got their most popular flavor, milk tea with herbal grass jelly.  It was delicious, they use earl grey as the tea base and it paired really well with the milk and grass jelly.  The food looked really good as well when I saw people eating it.  Will try next time!"}
{"text":"Dessert: milk tea frappe! This is now my go to pick at ZenQ. While I do get EXTREMELY jealous of other people's  picks... I just can't bring myself to order something different from the menu. (Does anyone ever feel the same?) Luckily my gfs like to share. Aside: the tapioca balls were bouncy (not over cooked) and the portion was huge.... yet I still ate it all... in one sitting... and didn't share...  The owners keep the place extremely warm! When I first walked in, the heat was overwhelming - sweating buckets! By the time I finished my ice cream dessert, I was freezing! Thank you for keeping the place so hot!!"}
{"text":"I love their cuttlefish balls but they raised the price to $7 for only SEVEN of them. Which means it's ONE dollar for ONE ball, which is not worth it. Guys, DO NOT ORDER from this Zen Q they will rip you off like CRAZY. This is ridiculous and unbelievable."}
{"text":"I was excited when I found out that a new bubble tea place was opening right next to the condo I live in. 

The few times I've been there I have only did take out. Most of the time I drop by during the day so there's no line up. The one time I went with a group of friends we weren't able to get a table. The wait was a bit longer but not more than 10-15 minutes. 

The two drinks I have tried there were the pearl milk tea and lychee QQ refresher. Both were good.

ZenQ has a points card system so don't forget to pick one up.

Parking isn't free which makes this location a bit inaccessible. Luckily I live right beside it so I can just walk over!

This weekend they're having their grand opening. They'll be giving 300 free drinks!"}
{"text":"Omgggg this place is sooooo good!! Me and my friend ordered coconut pudding, red bean grass jelly and Taiwanese crispy chicken, all of them are super delicious,  the service is great and cozy environment!"}
