{"text":"Service is alway great as are the wings.  Large selection of food and the signature sandwiches are always spot on.  Best sandwich is the pastrami egg and cheese.  Also large selection of beers.  Great place to hang out and watch the game."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, service was very slow and luke warm even though the place was almost empty at 1230pm.  Food was pretty tasty although it took a long time. The place had a bit of a musty bar smell that I never noticed in times past probably because I usually sit outside in the summer.  In general, I don't think I'll be back until summer until this place gets a bit cleaner and a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Why do we keep trying this place?  We went when they first opened and the service sucked, we got our own food and drinks from the bar.  At that time they were signicantly understaffed. Very noisy...Ok so let's try again. Nice outside deck, but why are they smoking out here next to us and whose going to enforce it?  Then our food comes and they are out of French Dressing.  Of course she said that after she served everyone else.  As it turns out that is the ONLY kind of dressing I like.  So I said I wish you would of told me that 20 minutes ago and I'd of ordered a burger..And in the twenty minutes since I ordered no one could run to the grocery store across the street and pick some up.  I think it's called projecting in restauarant terms.  We're done here!"}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot since I was last here.  We decided to stop in for lunch during the Blossom festivities.  Luckily, the place wasn't very busy, so we were able to seat our large party immediately.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The food was generally okay, and I don't think anyone had any complaints.  If things are on the upswing at this location, I hope people give it another try."}
{"text":"I'll just keep this short and sweet. Place is whatever. Employees are nice. Food is just boring, nothing to crave over. I end up there often enough, since it is somewhere local to go with friends.   But really, the biggest selling point is that the people are nice."}
