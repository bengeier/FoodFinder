{"text":"I always read reviews on yelp but never leave any. This place is bad enough to warrant a post. The fried rice is so bland and tasteless.. The chicken wings look like they're shot up with steroids.. Overall the buffet itself is really small with limited options (didn't even have chicken and broccoli). The booths are extraordinarily small; I'm not a big girl and I could barely fit. It's just a horrible spot overall. Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The worst cook in china was sent to this place as punishment for being such a lousey cook. I can hardly wait for the food poisioning to kick in so i can get the taste out of my mouth. WORST CHINESE BUFFETT I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This may be the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at. At least the buffet was only $7, which was too much for the quality of food. All of the meat was soggy and seemed old. Nothing tastes fresh. I'm honestly surprised I didn't get sick. I could not finish my food. I will not be back. For a few dollars more you can go up the street to China Buffett on Independence which is phenomenal"}
{"text":"Very good food, very fresh. I hate when I go to Chinese buffet restaurant and the food is not fresh and they all look like it's been there all day. Dry and burn. Customer service here is excellent.  The restaurant is clean. I live the salt and pepper shrimp. So yummy. Also fresh seafood and fresh fried chicken. Price is very cheap tho."}
{"text":"I came to Little China with a co-worker and I felt icky upon entering this place.  Located in the dilapidated Wal-Mart shopping center on Eastway Dr. (hint no. 1), this place is tucked behind an Italian restaurant for good reason.  The interior is dingy and has a musty smell-wood paneling and cracked pleather booths.  The buffet is small and bland.  The fried rice was tasteless and lukewarm, as was the sweet and sour sauce.  I tried the sesame chicken; they used dark meat chicken!  I can't understand how this place remains open.  Not even the soft serve ice cream could redeem my experience here!  I guess there are no decent options on Eastway Drive.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"The food is ok.  No chicken and broccoli, mostly Fried frozen food. when I went there was at least 6 or 7 screaming kids running around. By far the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, but the staff is nice. And .... someone just sneezed on the food as I was writing this. ..."}
{"text":"I love eating at Little China the food is great.but they are quick to hand you the bill.My most favorite is the beef and broccoli wish they had the regular shrimp I don't eat shrimp that eyes on them."}
{"text":"I'm only on the east side of Charlotte for work, and this is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant on the east. Their shrimp an broccoli is always fresh, hot, and yummy. I would buy food from there all the time if I lived closer."}
{"text":"This place used to be great but has really gone downhill. No one at the counter is EVER friendly anymore. And now it's at the point where they can't even give a bag of noodles with soup."}
