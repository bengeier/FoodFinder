{"text":"Brought a friend here for his birthday dinner (his choice) and what a nice place. Good casual dining place but the food was great! Would def go back!"}
{"text":"Dinner was so good! We ordered the pesto and roasted tomato pizza with fresh mozzarella! Yum!!!  Only 4 stars due to the butter/margarine served with the bread. It was pretty bad! Not bad enough to stop me from returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Had a multitude of plates with friends and everything was beyond great! Will DEFINITELY be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is a VERY pleasant experience. Food, service and atmosphere are terrific!  Pizza and pasta wonderful. Great beverage selection. Just passing thru but would definitely return if coming this way again!"}
{"text":"This pizza is extraordinary. But order the simpler ones to highlight the excellent ingredients. The Marguerite Pizza is as near to Napolitan excellence as you will find anywhere in Ohio."}
{"text":"fantastic!!  one of the best wine selections outside of downtown Cleveland - they even have their own sommelier.   The food is spectacular.   Portions are perfect - filling but not overwhelming.  Rich flavors.   I would highly suggest!!"}
{"text":"We tried to try this place out when it first opened.  Not being much else in the area, it was pretty crowded and there was a wait.  This is to be expected.  A fact that was apparently not anticipated by the owners.  We would've waited at the bar and had some wine, had it not also been packed.  Any time we spied an opening, it was immediately taken.  Again - to be expected at a new joint that's the only game in town.  My issue with this was that there was nowhere to sit in the foyer area.  If you stood near the hostess stand, you were in their way.  If you stood on either side of it, you were in the doorway, or uncomfortably close to tables in the bar area.  There were no benches, etc.  They had thrown wooden chairs in front of the open kitchen area for some people but nothing was offered to us.  Not that I would've wanted to sit there, either.  It was just awkward and weird, so we ended up leaving.

After the initial newness of the place wore off, we stopped in for a Valentine's Day dinner.  I was excited to try their pizza since I'd seen some good reviews on other sites.  My expectations were, sadly, not met.  At all.  I can make a better pizza at home and I am NOT kidding.  No flavor, sparse toppings and the sauce - oh my - the sauce!  Think tomato paste straight from the can people!

Another thing--our waitress.  We ordered one pasta entree and one small pizza because we couldn't pick just one thing each and figured we'd share.  We told her this ahead of time.  No extra plates were brought when the food arrived.  Most places that specialize in pizza have a pizza stand on the table or bring one when the pizza arrives.  Even Pizza Hut does this for Pete's Sake!  Our waitress plopped the entire pizza on the pan in front of me as if it were a plate and I was supposed to just dig in.   W T H ?   It was really pretty comical but SERIOUSLY.... who does that???   LOL!!

Not impressed at all with this place.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Love the wood fire pizza. Service was very good and the atmosphere was just right not too loud and a good mix of all ages of people.  Would recommend a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and service! We had the baked Brie app and The Italian pizza. Both were fantastic. The restaurant's atmosphere was pleasant and the staff was very nice. I couldn't have asked for a better lunch date with my wife."}
{"text":"On a business trip, ordered a lasagna,  it was more like a meat loaf. could only eat about half the portion,  more meat and cheese , and not much pasta in the thing."}
{"text":"Stopped in mid evening after a swim at the Y. The chicken salad with cranberries and walnuts was awesome and presented beautifully. A large portion.  My daughter opted for the coconut shrimp appetizer. It was a generous portion size and very tasty. Our server was very friendly and welcoming. The place is very quaint inside. The hostess was accommodating about our request to sit at a booth as my daughter wears hearing aides and prefers a  corner booth. Only reason I didn't give it a fifth star is that we didn't have an entree but I am confident it would have scored 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst food I have ever eaten. My lasgna was plain disgusting. Sauce was canned. Filling was dry and bland. There was no bubbley crust on the lasagna just a few squares of semi melted cheese of some sort. Stouffers is better.  My daughter had tortellini with a cream pesto sauce, last time I checked pesto was green from the basil not brown. Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"The margarita pizza is phenomenal. I usually go during lunch, and I reliably get great/friendly service. I think this place is underrated."}
{"text":"Best lunch buffet in town!  All you can eat $9.75.... Homemade daily soup, pasta of the day, pizzas and salad bar. Everyday 11-3.... Love love love it!!!! We love the dinner specials and new menu as well. Will keep returning!!!  Staff is friendly, and very inviting."}
{"text":"Our waitress said she had been working here since April and she still didn't know the menu. We sent our streaks back because we asked for the gravy on the side and when they delivered the steak to the table, the gravy was on top. The manager was SUPER nice and promised to fix it right away. Everyone there was super nice and this one issue will not prevent us from coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! I recommend as long as you like the menu choices, go try it out! Yum! Yum! Very satisfying!!!"}
{"text":"Wood and Wine put out a new menu this weekend.  There are a lot of new choices. Something for everyone and family friendly."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Marriott next door to this restaurant, so we decided to try it because it was close, we love pizza, and we got a discount with our Hotel Keycard. The food was good. Not great. Not bad. Just ok. The service was S L O W!!!! With 3 kids in tow, it made the experience kind of stressful. That being said, a kind and gracious family next to us decided to give our kids some of their pizza because they felt so bad for them having to wait so long. Long story short, the food was ok, the service was slow. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Very busy Saturday night in Avon Ohio at the Wood & Wine, this place was packed! One bartender for what looked like a 100 + person capacity restaurant on top of her bartender duties, however skinny girl rocked her responsibilities and jammed out the service like a pro!
The kitchen window looked extremely busy. I liked that they had an actual food Expediter/Runner/(Manager?) making certain the tables food orders were grouped and ready to be served
The entree house salad looked as if it was something to be served at a banquet or hospital cafeteria. Chopped Romain lettuce! None of those darn fancy pansy, limp wristed leafy mixed baby greens here folks! Why do they put shredded cheese on top?
The eggplant and chicken parmesan was 4 stars-ish. The pasta was was slightly over cooked and the chicken could have been pounded thinner but the taste was there and the dishes could have used some fresh chopped parsley on top of the dishes but meh, it's not an Italian restaurant after all 
Long wait for our plates of soggy uneaten pasta to be cleared
All in all a decent place for a drink and a meal in a one horse town"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!!!!   Had a wine flight it was perfect. I got to try three different wines for 10$...wood fired italian pizza was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss... one great dinner, two not so great dinners. Generally -the food is just OK.. not sure it's worth price. I'd rather pay more for great quality. 

The ambiance could be better... it's too open - like a Denny's feel with booths on the outside windows. They try with decor but it isn't the classy place they'd like you to believe it is. 

Haven't had the pizza yet... if we go again it will be for pizza since we've heard it is great."}
{"text":"Interior reminded me of an upscale Denny's. Calamari was ridiculously small for its $9 price tag. And, I concur with my six year old, the calamari was tasteless, not at all \"spicy\" like its name implied. The pepperoni pizza was nothing special and a bit undercooked. Eggplant Parm was boring. I wouldn't know I was eating eggplant, it had absolutely no consistency or much flavor. The kids wanted the chocolate cake for dessert. Our server came back and told us it was sold out but how about a strawberry cake? The kids insisted they wanted chocolate. The server again suggested the strawberry and we gave in to her suggestion. The $7 sliver of cake was a failure.
We'll never go back -- and seeing so many empty tables on a Friday night -- it looks like others are staying away."}
{"text":"The wine sampler is nice because you can pick your own selection. The wine selections are plentiful. Lobster crab soup wasn't the best tasted mainly of cilantro. Ordered the cheese sampler also not so good some of the cheese was hard and old and some of the pineapples had brown spots. All and all I would say for the price try a nicer wine bar or spot. I've had better.
I here the pizza is ok but didn't try it."}
{"text":"Pizza tasted like burnt toast and was pretty nasty. Also was an extremely over priced restaurant for the quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Food is above average with lots of flavor and a twist. Wait time for your food is a little longer than you would expect to wait. Some of the other reviews mentioned the decor is 80's themed. I don't believe the inside gives off that vibe at all! It is completely new and contemporary."}
{"text":"I went with a guy I have been dating who doesn't really like to go out much.  We arrived hungry and were pleasantly surprised by immediate seating and service.  A nice baguette was immediately, and we ordered the wood fired wings which were delivered within minutes.  They were succulent and tastefully seasoned.  The wait staff were all very genuinely pleasant.  Our server, Georgine (sp?) was superb, cute and sweet.  She brought us wine samples, and we were surprisingly very happy with a $20 bottle.  I usually drink a red zinfandel, but this was a close match at a lower price and very pleasant.  My date who can really put away food ended up taking home half of his lasagna (which equaled an entire portion from another restaurant).  I had the mussels, scallops and shrimp pasta with a fresh basil and lobster sauce.  I am very picky and was impressed with the subtlety of the sauce, i.e. they didn't go with the \"if a little garlic is good, a lot must be better\" motto (I don't like the taste of concentrated garlic powder repeating on me for the next 24 hours).  It was just right.  Everything was fresh and the atmosphere was great.  Our server had a big table on the other side of the restaurant and had another equally cute and sincerely friendly server check on us right away (even though we would not have noticed her absence in that short of a time).  The server asked if were celebrating anything, and when I told her my birthday she offered a complimentary dessert.  I chose the Tiramisu among a reasonable selection.  I'm not a big dessert person so I won't expound other than they were fresh selections - and the price was right.  I really enjoyed the layout and atmosphere and give kudos to the owner for excellent hiring and training skills for the employees along with the wine selection and food quality.  As much as the food is important, a night out is much better with the type of people employed by this restaurant.  And they only use real butter.  One of my bare minimum criteria for a restaurant is \"no margarine\".  The server misunderstood my inquiry and upon verification of whether they served butter or margarine, apologized that the restaurant did not have any margarine.  If I were a critic, I would have checked one thing after another all with the most available stars.  The wood fired pizza oven looked nice and was visible from the restaurant.  Maybe next time we'll get pizza as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Very accommodating when I called about getting a table - to include my mom in a wheelchair.  Food is good - large portions ( the lasagna could feed a family my of four!), good wine selection good too."}
{"text":"This place didnt have great reviews before mine but it was next to my hotel and I really wanted a good glass of wine and a wood fired pizza. I call that self inflicted. I should have believed my fellow Yelpers. 

It has a feel of Dennys and may have been at one time. I sat at the bar. They actually have a decent bottle list. By the glass as pretty limited but I found a cab I was familiar with and was satisfied with it. I ordered a side salad and wood fired wings to start. The salad tasted like dirty refrigerator. You know what I'm talking about. The wings I ordered twice baked. They cook them in the wood fired oven, then they are supposed to toss them is a sauce and put them back in the fire. What I got seemed to fall very short of that. My wings were rubbery like they may have been microwaved. Tossed? Nah, slop a little sauce on them and hit start. 

I also ordered a traditional Italian pizza. It was good but nothing exciting and fell pretty short of the description but not of my expectations at this point. 

The service was rough. I got the impression the general attitude was \"Im stuck here whether youre here or not so deal with it\". The bartender did everything by herself. Nobody to take out trash, handle money, run food, or any visible support whatsoever. I watched her do all of these task and then handle food and make drinks without ever washing her hands. YIKES!

Next time....nah, who am I kidding. DONE"}
{"text":"Nice place with a huge bar area to enjoy a bottle of wine.

We tried the calamari and the sausage and pepper pizza.  Calamari was fried with plain marinara sauce.  The pizza was spicy and was baked perfectly. 

Highly recommend the pizza and would try another appetizer on the next visit."}
{"text":"We would have given a 4.5 star in review with our 3rd dinner visit to Wood and Wine.  Our server did not tell us about specials and service was a bit slow.  We ordered the cheese and fruit plate $12  nice display of fresh fruit crackers, olives, date jam and our selection of 3 cheeses.  He ordered the pork tenderloin medalions with coffee and spice crusted with fruit sauce.  Tender juicy cooked perfectly to medium with red skin potatoes beans and fire roasted red peppers.  All cooked and presented to perfection.   I ordered the Chinese salmon salad.  It was enough for 2 orders  The salmon was grilled perfectly with a sweet glaze.  The salad was heaped with red onions fire roasted red peppers and slivered carrots.  The crunch from the old fashioned chinese noodles was fabulous with the asian salad dressing.   The bill finally came and surprised by the cost of only 56. With a glass of house red blend wine.  We walked out and our server calling out to us with our left over boxes, enough for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection.  Ok food.  I expected more from the mushroom truffle pizza...I could hardly taste the truffle flavor.   This is the best restaurant in the area. Wait staff was fantastic."}
{"text":"Good wood fired pizza. I got the sausage one and enjoyed some Rose wine while I waited. I appreciate people that know the wine brands and can describe them. Good experience."}
{"text":"Went to Wood and Wine for a business lunch.  They have a nice lunch buffet with salad, soup, pasta, and pizza.  Nice variety and friendly employees."}
{"text":"Horrible service  we waited 10 mins. before we had to ask for someone to take our order and we were the only two there besides 3 loud drunks at the bar!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go one time and that will be all. Ordered 2 pizzas and wings. Wings weren't bad, but pizzas were. First pie was incorrect, and second pizza the white pie was just blah. Wife couldn't even eat one piece. No thanks."}
{"text":"What happened to this place????

First time was fab. Not this time.

Yak, tak. Yak. That's the sound the waitress makes to the hostess as my appetizer is sitting under a light getting luke warm.  

Then comes the pizza.  Crust can be described as follows:  flour, water, salt.  It reminds me of a bread that foreign prisoners might be served.  Sauce is a low end generic from Sysco.  And was that cheese on my pizza or melted white chewy stuff? 

My advice to the guests next door at the hotel is to cross the street and shop for a meal at the gas station."}
{"text":"Service was slower than expected and the salad was okay I had to ask for fresh ground pepper price was okay but not as expected for the area"}
{"text":"I recently visited Wood & Wine during a business trip.  The restaurant was very clean and cozy (I actually saw the wait staff pull out tables and sweep under them - unheard of!).  Our waiter was friendly and took good care of us, \"accidentally\" bringing us little extras.  I had the mac & cheese, made with smoked gouda (my favorite).  Very rich and cheesy, mixed with some chicken.  Very good.  We had the baked brie for an appetizer, which was good, but I was bummed out that the fruit wasn't baked in with the brie like I'm used to.  Both of my dining partners loved their meals.  I know several people who had the cranberry chicken pecan salad and they all raved about it.

If you're staying at the Fairfield Inn next door, show your key so you can get a discount."}
{"text":"Atrocious customer service.  Excellent food, but it is overshadowed by the complete disrespect I received in here.

We were sitting at the bar, just before 11, and they're closing up and they are nowhere near close to closing.  The girl is cleaning up and I ask what's going on.  She says they close up \"when nobody is in here\".  My retort in my typical Dave fashion: \"Oh, so we're nobody, huh?  Let me speak to your manager.\"  I did, and said I'd call the owner tomorrow about this incident, which I did.  The owner did apologize, saying it's not the first time he's heard this.  I just wish I had remembered her name, but oh well.

I won't go back again, and I'll spread the word to everyone I know in the greater Cleveland area, since I'm from there, about this as well."}
{"text":"We travel all over the US for work, and this is our second time in the Avon area in two years, also our second time here at Wood and Wine, and it was just as superior the second time around as it was the first! Great service, Top notch food, wonderful decor, a very shiny GEM in Avon Ohio!! Five Star Restaurant"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever had.  I have had better frozen pizza then this.  Salty .  So salty.. we had both of our pizzas (mushroom and Italian ) pizza sent back.  We do appreciate them not charging us for the horrible pizza and half price bottle of wine but we won't be back.  We sat at the bar and our bartender was very cold and kind of rude ish... people don't go there.  If you are a pizza and wine person I recommend a frozen pizza and wine at home.. plus Netflix and chill."}
{"text":"We ate here with friends on New Years Eve and we really liked it. My gf had the special: Lobster and jumbo shrimp raviolis with veggies and i had the Seafood pasta served in a Lobster cream basil sauce. Both dishes had alot of seafood and were delicious. We were with a party of 8 and everyone really enjoyed our meals and deserts. Others in our party ordered pizza and several steaks, all were very good i was told. 

Also had several good beers to choose from. Nice place!"}
{"text":"Three years later... another visit to Wood & Wine. Another 'meh' experience. Would give 2.5 stars if possible.

Ordered 2 appetizers: The stuffed mushrooms were pretty good with a nice delicate marinara and Parmesan shavings. Very meaty filling, which I liked but my wife felt was too much. Potato skins were pretty standard. Canoe-shaped thin potato pieces seriously deep-fried and crispy. Standard bacon/cheese/green onions. Served with two little plastic tubs of sour cream that seemed to have been in the walk-in a bit too long. Very firm and freezing cold.

Pizzas: Not bad, but nothing special at all. We had the white pizza and a build-your own with pepperoni and bacon for our son. Pepperoni was of the very sweet variety. Toppings on the white pizza were good and all; it just wasn't a distinctive pizza in any way. It tasted good, but I'd never have a craving for it.

Service was friendly if a bit inattentive. Had to ask for napkins and silverware, had to ask for bread plates, and there were looong stretches with empty drinks. She was nice, though."}
{"text":"Tried Wood & Wine on a busy Saturday night.  Though the restaurant was full, there were not too people waiting, but the staff was still clearly overwhelmed.  A thirty-minute quoted wait time only turned out to be five minutes, but we ended up waiting for an extended period at the table for the server to take our order and find us silverware (they had run out).  The menu is straightforward--appetizers, salads, pastas, steaks, and pizzas--supplemented by a reasonably extensive wine list for a restaurant in its class including a good number of wines by the glass in the $7 to $10 range.

I was surprised, though, by how underwhelming the pizza was.  $12 for a Neapolitan, wood-fired pizza (8 slices that can easily be shared by two people) is a decent deal, but taste-wise, the pizzas were fairly bland.  The Italian pizza even had an unpleasant sourness to it.  The crust was dense and chewy, though at least it had some of the trademark leopard spots from the wood-fired oven.

I did like the create-your-own cheese plate option--three cheeses from a selection of ten for $12 served with olives, fruit, fig chutney, and crackers (though the crackers were only those Pepperidge Farm butterfly-shaped crackers you get at the grocery store).

All-in-all, Wood & Wine seems like a decent place for wine and cheese, but the pizza offerings leave much to be desired.  I'll put it ahead of Mama Santa's--the standard-bearer of blandness--but I would recommend going a little further down I-90 to Sweet Basil in Westlake (though a far-less inviting interior environment) or, for a real treat, Vero Pizza in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"Been twice and each time it has been just ok. Service was fine, food is ok. Nothing to write home about. Really no reason for us to go back. A couple we went with loved it. You will have to try it for ourselves."}
{"text":"Nice surprise ! Had great food and even better service. A very open a friendly staff that actually seemed to care.

Food was very well prepared - tasty bisque soup that was hearty and not full of just salt.

Pizza was so good - crispy crust and real toppings
Highly recommended- and I am from California"}
{"text":"First time here and it will NOT be our last. Zach was our waiter. Engaging and upbeat, he offered his humor, smile and assistance to us right away. We ordered the wings and margarita pizza. Fantastic!  Wings were not oily, very crispy and fresh tasting. Pizza was hands down the best I've had in a while. 18 wings, one pizza, one glass of wine and a beer under $41. It was a slow time of day but I loved it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Convenient to the hotel next door, but surprisingly nice and well formed for such a location. Steak salad is better than average and a nice wine a beer selection."}
{"text":"We tried the Wood & Wine tonight for dinner and I was very disappointed with the food, service and the management!  The calamari that we had was very greasy and not very flavorful.  Of the five entrees that we ordered they managed to scorch the pizza and burn as well as over cook the coffee crusted pork medallions.  Both of these items were set back - the pizza that came out the second time was acceptable but the second attempt on the pork was delivered to the table being red (raw & uncooked) inside.  Their third attempt at the pork was passable but not anything really special! 

Overall, the Wood and Wine falls short in their attempt to be an upscale establishment and manager failed to resolve the issue - even trashing us to his staff while  I approached him as we were leaving!

The experience was poor at best..."}
{"text":"Although the wait staff has tried to be helpful, my friends wedding reception was not organized well. The room did not accommodate the guests, glasses out on the tables were visibly dirty, and the manager organizing the event and staff arrived 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. The organizing bridesmaid found this to be rather unprofessional, disorganized and rather annoying."}
{"text":"Wood and Wine, best kept secret on Chester Rd. They have a great buffet, several varieties of open fire baked pizzas, fresh salad bar, delicious pasta dishes & homemade soup! #Delicioso I've only been there at lunchtime. Hospitality is fabulous, as we all know, half the pleasure of dining out is the hospitality! #SatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Since they're right down the road, I go there once in a while, mainly to the bar. Excellent mussels. The buffet looks really good, been wanting to check that out for a long time, have now tried it, and it's not much better than CiCi's. The one plus is they had a soup. I'm an excellent cook and if someone is going to cook for me, I hope they can do better. They failed. I had one good meal there, but never again. Shame."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night with some girl friends. I have to say, I really expected better. I know Fridays are probably busy, but that was not the issue. 

My friend ordered a wine that the bar had sold out of. Being sold out on a Friday shows poor planning, but whatever. The waitress could not have been less helpful. She told us that they were sold out, and then she just stood there in silence. We sort of expected her to recommend something, but nope. So we asked her if there were any other wines close to the one we had wanted. Of course there weren't (hard to believe...) so she just ordered what I had ordered. Kind of lame to have no guidance or backup wines. 

The food was bad all around. Pizza was black, just burnt all over. The cheese plate was smaller than a lunchables. Two friends ordered pasta with chicken and they were convinced it was either canned, or not chicken at all. The \"coconut shrimp\" was basically a bag of frozen cocktail shrimp (the size used for pasta, NOT the size used for an appetizer) with some lime drizzled on top of it. 

The wine that we did order was ok, but quite honestly we could get that anywhere. Would not bother going back here, sorry."}
{"text":"This review is wayyyy overdue! I had my wedding rehearsal dinner at Wood and Wine in the private party room. I chose this location due to it's proximity to the hotel that most of our out of town guests would be staying at, plus it was right up the road from our wedding venue. I called many other places in the area about having a rehearsal dinner (Strip, Cheesecake Factory, Brio) and they were an absolute joke compared to Wood and Wine. They either wanted to charge more than my actual wedding venue for a rehearsal dinner or they were flat out rude over the phone (as if I was bothering them by trying to bring in a good amount of business). Wood and Wine displayed great customer service (both in person and on the phone) throughout planning and really made me feel like my business was appreciated.

Wood and Wine truly went above and beyond to make our dinner special! Since I live out of state, I arranged most of the dinner over the phone. I was able to meet with the manager 2 months before the date to discuss menu options, what we could bring in, how many people they could accommodate, etc. She was very knowledgeable and friendly! For the rehearsal dinner, we were able to put together our own menu for our guests to choose from. Wood and Wine allowed us to include their entire wood fire pizza menu, plus 6 entrees of our choice (perfect for accommodating the vegetarians/allergies in our group!). 

On the actual night of the rehearsal, they had printed out special menus for our dinner. Our server was awesome with keeping up with the almost 30 guests that we had in attendance. Everyone absolutely enjoyed their meals and we were able to put together a menu that pleased everyone. Thank you, Wood and Wine, for putting my mind at ease during the wedding planning process and for keeping this bride sane the night before her wedding!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our team's last game of the season by having a pizza party at Wood & Wine on 5/12. It was all you can eat pizza, soup, salad and our players loved it! Thank you W&W for hosting the Avon Boys HS Lacrosse team! We loved it :)"}
{"text":"Pop in off the highway. Wonderful surprise. Excellent food. I had The steak salad and my husband had the portobello pasta.  Both were excellent. Also enjoyed a hefty pour on the house Cabernet. Highly recommend. Prices were fair as well AND they also had a buffet with pizza, salad and soup for $9.95 that looked great."}
{"text":"I chose this place for my sister's bachelorette dinner because it was close to our next destination and I am a fan of the owners other restaurant. Hands down the very worst service I have ever received! We waited 30-45 min. for the girl to even come get our drink order (no exaggeration) and by that time we just ordered everything because we only had a little over an hour in total to be there. We also asked for her to brings the checks right away. Food came out in normal time and was very good. She forgot to put in one of the girl's food (it maybe would have helped if she wrote it down) so we shared and awkwardly ate feeling bad that she still didn't have hers. No one came to check on us even once. I had to keep going up to the bar to get what we needed. I finally had to ask for the manager about the service and the missing food (which I've never done in my life) and she looked at me like I was a punk complaining over nothing. I also had to ask the manager that she bring our checks right away as originally asked. The server finally came over and gave US a major attitude. She said she would bring boxes \"right away\" and that didn't happen. We were LATE for our next destination which was a painting class so we really needed to be on time. They absolutely ruined what was supposed to be a quick, fun and easy dinner for my sister's special night. Even the management should be ashamed of themselves. The hostess was the only person who treated any of us kindly. I will never recommend this place to anyone. In fact, quite the opposite. You literally couldn't pay me to eat here, but hey, if you have 3 hours for dinner and like being treated poorly then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times and always enjoyed it. This time may have been the best yet. The pretzel-crusted chicken special was excellent. Service was spot on. All in all, another good time. Will stay in the regular rotation when we dine out."}
{"text":"I have made a few trips to Wood and Wine. The service has been ok and the prices aren't too high. The decor was very nice and inviting. 

On my last visit I tried the Italian Pizza. This pizza was average. The crust desperately lacked a desired crispiness for me and the sauce didn't set itself apart from other places."}
{"text":"I feel like the stars above say exactly how we felt about our experience here: Meh. It was just.....okay. We had our annual friends holiday dinner here shortly before Christmas and out of 3 couples, not a one of us was wowed by the experience. 

Pros:

*Great wine selection: on this we all agree. Their wine selection was amazing and delicious. As a limited wine drinker myself, I highly recommend the wine spritzers - they were delicious. The more serious wine drinkers found their wines to be full-bodied and paired nicely with their dinners.
*Great ambiance: This is subjective though because we were seated in the \"tasting\" room which made for a nice and quiet dinner. The main dining room was much louder and I feel it wouldn't have been such a great atmosphere had we been seated there.

Cons:

*Limited menu. We weren't impressed with the size of their menu. It was definitely on the smaller side and didn't have a ton of options.
*Taste. Again, meh. Our food wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly wasn't great. One member of our group ordered a steak, medium. It came out rare and had to be sent back only to come back out charred. The vegetables that were served alongside were so spicy as to be inedible. Another of us ordered a pasta dish that was fine but tasted like a frozen pasta dinner. 
*Price: This place was pricey and that was a huge letdown after our lackluster meal and even worse service. Upwards of $80 per couple, which would have been fine had our meals been good but was a hefty price to pay when our experience wasn't terrific.
*Service: They assigned 2 waitresses to our party of 6. We found this a bit odd but we found it even odder when the 2 together somehow couldn't keep up with normal care of a 6-top table. We waited for silverware, drink refills, bills..... I think we spent the majority of our 2+ hour meal waiting.

Bottom line: I'm glad we tried Wood & Wine because we've been planning to for a while, but we certainly won't be repeat diners."}
{"text":"A great restaurant that is not a chain and has something for everyone. Located off the main strip of Avon, but don't let the location be the deterring factor. Whether you want a drink and appetizer or a full course meal. It will please all palates."}
{"text":"I had never tasted wood fired pizza. I was quite impressed with the flavor. The staff was well informed on the the wines and that was important. The decor was warm and inviting. My reviews can be harsh at times but honestly, I couldnt find a single fault here."}
{"text":"My first time to Wood & Wine.  It was not what I expected inside.  Its nice enough at the end of the visit.  Its a large building with wide expanse both ways. As finished it does not have a lot of character.  Its kind of like a pole barn building fully finished.  There are booths, high top tables, a bar, and low tables.  Because of where we sat I did not see that there was a nice looking wine cellar to look into.  That is on the front of the restaurant.  But go see it its attractive. 

I was disappointed in the wine selection. I went to look for some Ohio wines, New York wines, maybe other local wines, like Virginia.  There were none.  Those wines are as good as any in the USA. Their selection is mainly California, some Oregon.  They had French and South America well represented. But the lack of local has fueled the 2 of 5 star rating. 

  I had a glass of Petit Syrah which was great, a glass of Gewurztraminer was had by my dining companion and was good. Later I had a glass of Chile Carmernie which was a kind of flat flavored vanilla ish wine and I did not like it. 

The wine was served in nice glasses and you don't normally get such nice glasses. That is a real plus. 

We ordered the cheese plate, and picked 3 cheese's.  The presentation was very nice and the cheeses were great.  

For dinner, I had the Port Chop which was tasty. It had a nice sauce with strawberries and the vegetables were excellent. My dining companion ordered a margarita pizza which came burnt but they brought another soon after.  However, it stated fresh tomatoes but these were for sure canned tomatoes.  It had a kind of flat flavor and it tasted like sugar had been added to the sauce, another disappointment. 

If I was rating on food along it would get a 4.0 as the cheese and pork chop dishes were 4 or slightly over 4 of 5. The Pizza was fresh but with canned tomatoes and mediocre sauce, and it hurt its flavor. 

The big point drop was the lack of local touch in the wine selection. While there is apparently a person of some experience at the restaurant in terms of wine selection I just felt the choices seemed distributor dominated and distributors have a true lack of appreciation for local wines. If it was not a wine restaurant then I would probably give the wine list at least a 3 of 5. Again the lack of diversity is a big loss for someplace that considers itself a wine restaurant.  

I will probably go back hoping that they might take up some local wines."}
{"text":"Place was nice and clean. Ordered the 8 inch personal pizza for me and my wife as an appetizer to our entrees but waitress brought it out with our entrees. Pizza wasnt hot when it was given to us and the crust was soggy on the bottom. I also got an \"open food\" charge because it was food that was made to order? Never heard that before in my life. Not a disaster of a place but Wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"First visit after hearing lots of good reviews from friends and neighbors.  Can't believe we waited so long to try it out.  Very friendly wait staff and nice bar area as well if you have to wait for a table.  

Since the have a wood oven for good thin crust pizza we tried the brie as an appitizer as well as 2 different pizza's and loved everything.

Good service, good food.  Prices may be slightly high but overall loved it.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has some serious class.  I have never had a bad meal here, so let's just start with that.  But then let me impress you by saying that the one I had this time around was one of the BEST.  Roasted chicken with green beans, yellow squash, over a bed of butternut squash ravioli and pecan cream sauce.  I wanted to lick the entire bowl!  Seriously though, please get anything, any dish, that has the butternut squash as part of it.  You will never, ever be sorry.

As for the wine, one of the restaurant's namesakes, get a glass.  Any glass.  The wine expert there is great at what he does.  Ask him for a suggestion, or any of the servers, and you won't  be able to put it down.  Just try and nurse one glass through the whole meal.  I dare you.  I think you'll need a second.  :D"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend. We were impressed with the decor and the menu. We enjoyed the bruschetta, very flavorfull. The bread before the meal was perfect and fresh baked. We had a simple thin crust peperoni pizza and it was baked just right with a very good crust. We are big fans of wood fired pizza and are glad to have a local option. They have a great wine list but I would liked to have seen some cheaper wines by the bottle. We enjoyed the chianti and the house red was very tasty. Our service was prompt and efficient. Manager came by to check in, that is a nice touch.
We will try dinner here again. Thank You!!"}
{"text":"It seems from the reviews that you either love this place or hate it. Fortunately, for my dinner companions and I, we all loved it. 

We went on a weeknight, so it wasn't too busy. We were promptly seated and given just the right amount of attention throughout the meal. Service was great.

The food was also excellent. It started with all of us sharing a magherita pizza. Fresh basil and chunks of tomatoes, so good. For the entrees we shared wings, mussels and a tortellini pasta with chicken in a basil sauce. It was all so tasty. The chicken was tender, sauces weren't overpowering, and the portions were generous.

Two of us split a slice of the cheesecake, and it was tasty as well. Sometimes you worry about the desserts at a place that doesn't necessarily specialize in desserts, especially cheesecake because you think, 'how long has this been sitting around? Will it taste old?' It didn't. I would highly recommend.

The ambiance was very nice as well. Not sure about the wines, but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Not great, but good. I have been here about 5 times and i prefer to come for lunch for the buffet. Simple and convenient. The decor can use an update and they could just clean the place up in general. The service has been ok."}
