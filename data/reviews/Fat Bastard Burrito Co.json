{"text":"It's good! End of story. The reviews don't lie. Blows mucho burrito away. They really are huge!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times....I don't want to come here but it's so close to where I live. Pretty much every aspect of this place is pathetic and I'm pretty easy to please. The tipping point was how cheap they are with the toppings, it's laughable and now I'll be driving to burrito boyz or if I'm lazy I'll go next door to Falafel world (where they actually know how to run a business and appreciate regular customers). If you go, enjoy your thimble of guacamole!"}
{"text":"Why post hours on yout door is you don't follow them? Not the first time I have  been turned away at the door and It's not like a min before today it was 40min that is not good! Strike 2!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, but hands down the worst burrito I've ever had. Opted for the naked burrito... Ended up a bland meal of rice and beans... Topping selection sparsely added..  Server was skimping as i had to request more than once for more lettuce. And isn't a burrito supposed to have cheese? Where's the cheese?!! I'm a petite individual with a light appetite. I finished it with a few mouthfuls and left starving. So not worth $8!"}
{"text":"Ordered a naked chicken burrito plus cheesy bean and pulled pork burritos for the family. Service was slow but maybe I'm just used to the fast pace at downtown food courts. Skimpy servings and bland taste. So skimpy that I had a cream cheese bagel and a bowl of cereal when I got home. Also they forgot to call out for the cheesy bean so it was left sitting on the shelf for 15 minutes. A real disappointment."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Burrito experience I've had in the city. It took the staff a while to even acknowledge us. We ordered 2 big chicken burritos, one in a whole wheat tortilla, the other naked. They ignored the request for whole wheat and used a white tortilla. We asked them to put everything on both of them, but their green onion tray was empty, so they skipped it (even though I could see full trays of green onion next to it), and for the toppings they were running low on they skimped quite a bit. We took our order to go, and when we opened the naked burrito, we realized that there was only a tiny bit of chicken sprinkled on top. This was by far the biggest rip off burrito I have ever had. I have received smalls from other burrito shops in town that were much larger than these. The ingredients also tasted stale, and the burrito was overall dry and bland. I will not be returning to this location ever again, unless they decide to up their game.
I used to work next to the Fat Bastards at Vic Park and Sheppard, and that one was truly a gem. Large servings and great customer service."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that normally when we order Fat Bastards it is delicious however today, half of our order was incorrect. I ordered a big butter chicken burrito with peppers, cheese, noodles, rice and chips. I got a buffalo chicken burrito with no peppers. My one friend ordered a chipotle chicken burrito, it had guacamole on it which he did not order as he HATES guacamole. Our other friend who has dietary restrictions asked for no cheese and extra guacamole, she got cheese and very little guacamole. At least my one friend was able to give her the guacamole he didn't order. ALL of the burritos were cold as well and had to be reheated. I will give them another try, but we were really not impressed with this experience. I'm going to be bummed out until dinner now. :("}
{"text":"With the recent changes and downfall of those Burrito Boyz, I decided to step up to the Bastards. Not sure why people don't give this place 5/5. What is there not to like? The wash-rooms or seating? Its a take out place. Prices are fair, people are nice, lots of choices and specials, food is fresh and tasty. Free parking on the side street too! Everything from the Yam to the Chicken outshines the competition."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is always on my mind. I am thinking about it right now. It has my name all over it. Who, as a fat man, could rightly pass up on a place called, \"Fat Bastard...\" anything? 
This is the only place I have found, EVER, where a small (LIL) fills me up. 
My first visit was with my wife and we both got the HUGE size burrito, mine a baked chicken and hers a beef. They were awesome! We took them to go. I got about 9/10ths of the way through mine and almost had an aneurysm. The total for both (without drinks) was in the $22 range, amazing.
The service was quick and easy, just say yes to everything and you will have a good time. The food was great, fresh and fast.  The place was clean and you can see all the way through to the back, which I like.

Anyhow, what is the purpose of YELP if not to help places you like at to eat thrive and stick around. I DO NOT WANT THIS PLACE TO FADE AWAY. There are too many boring places around.

EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Routinely visit here for takeout. Massive burritos with creative toppings. Ground beef, feature red ale kettle pork, and battered fish are my favorites. I've found the steak on the salty side.  Nice job finishing on the grill for heat and texture.  

IMO best chain burrito joint around and I've had them all. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"So the food is okay here. There are certainly better burrito places in Toronto however I still prefer to eat here than some of the other places in the area. I really like the battered fish burrito. It's really tasty. But be warned, this isn't for those on a tight budget. A small battered fish comes to almost $10.00."}
{"text":"If I can't get to Jimmy Guaco's this is where I go. Good food, good prices , fast service"}
{"text":"Fat Bastard is one of my favourite burrito places.  Try the fish burrito, it's fantastic!  With fresh ingredients which you pick for yourself, they build the wrap right before you and exactly to your liking.

I find the burritos flavourful and a healthy choice.  Whether you choose beef, chicken, pork or fish, the food is real so I prefer a burrito here over a number of other quick dinner choices."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. Went with the veggie quesadilla and after ordering, they tell me that they are out of cheese...  I still got the food but wasn't too happy that it was cheese-less. It still ended up tasting pretty good though so I'd probably return."}
{"text":"This has fast become my favourite place. I absolutely love the food here. The service is exceptional. Ross the owner and his brother really let you know that your business is appreciated and that that your satisfaction is priority 1. 

I have tried the steak, pulled pork, and butter chicken, and Buffalo chicken burritos so far. All are great. The awesome one is the steak. The pulled pork is exceptional.  

They have 3 sizes of Burritos here. Even with my hearty appetite and an empty stomach, the medium aka \"big\" is more than enough to hold me over until the next day. I can't even imagine trying the large aka \"huge\"

I used to go out of my way to go to Burrito Boys, but because of their locations and my limited time I hardly went. This place more than makes up for it. The other burrito place in the neighbourhood is mucho bad. The service and quality of food there aren't even in the same ball park as Fat Bastard."}
{"text":"Just ordered from these guys for the first time: a pulled pork burrito and a Thai chilli chicken burrito with some nacho chips on the side. I was excited because the flavour options seemed more interesting that other Mexican places.

The burritos were the most bland I have ever had in my life. I'm not even sure real cheese was used in them -- I certainly couldn't see any. The pulled pork was pretty flavourless compared to pulled pork I've had everywhere else, and I couldn't taste the sauce. 

The chips I ordered were $3.50 and they were totally plain nacho chips. The sauce that came with them was probably tostitos. It was so painfully plain I felt pretty pissed that I didn't just go to the corner shop and buy a packet of nacho chips and dip -- it would have actually been worth the money. 

In my opinion, you're better off ordering from burrito express. Their food is more flavourful and worth the money."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location on Bloor West quite a bit a few months back, as it is the location closest to me. I went to grab a burrito tonight as it's been awhile since I have, and was very alarmed by the drastically different experience I had. There were several burritos just left out waiting to be out on the grill as there was no one there to do so. The one girl who was there took my order and with the same gloves she already had on, handled the interact machine and then went back to making several burritos right in front of me using the same gloves. When the only other employee came out from the back at a very relaxed pace, she was visibly wearing no gloves and handled all food without them. I was very appalled at the lack of professionalism, hygiene and pace that these two girls were operating at. Needless to say I will never go back to this location and will proceed with caution when and if I grab food at other Fat Bastard franchises in the future, if this is now the new standard set by employees and management."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was my combo that I chose but I did not like it. Thanks for the epic restaurant name and my 1st FB burrito but I will not return to this franchise. You will eat big, trust me. But that is partly what turned me off."}
{"text":"Visited the location with a bad mood as had a bad day. But got smiley faces greeting me. Made me forgot my stress. Generous courteous staff. Ordered the steak burrito. It was juicy warm n loved the level of hot sauce. Must visit. Loved the staff and the burrito. 5 Star all the way."}
{"text":"Pulled pork and butter chicken burrito?! Shut up and take my money, Fat Bastard! 

I've never tried their other locations closer downtown, but the burritos here at their Pickering location is mucho scrumptious! 

The prices are very fair for the portions. You have the option of (1) Lil' (2) Big or (3) Huge. I ordered both burritos in big and it was enormous, so I'm curious how big \"Huge\" is. 

Topping choices are some that I've never seen, including noodles and crushed chips. The variety of burritos is extensive, from the basic roasted steak to the specialty choices such as Buffalo chicken. I was very satisfied with their pulled-pork and butter chicken burritos - the pork was tender and packed with sweet flavoring and the butter chicken (though not as buttery as I liked) was packed in as huge tender chunks. 

They also sell items including: deep fried Mars bars, Blairs death rain chips, Blairs ghost pepper hot sauce, two-bite brownies, dried ghost peppers and even Mexican Coke.

Service was also amazing. They treat their customers like their amigos and was extremely patient with this one customer in front of me who couldn't decide on her toppings. 

Next time I visit Pickering, I'll be sure to starve myself first so I can be hungry enough to try the HUGE portion."}
{"text":"Yes I'm a fat bastard

That's why I wanted to check out Fat Bastard Burritos.

Great burritos and a creative menu.  I've only tried the Chipotle Fried Chicken both naked and burrito style.

Get the crushed chips and noodles."}
{"text":"I was quite depressed when I noticed that these guys had moved into Bloor West Village. The last thing we need in the hood is yet another low-end, white trash, fast food joint. But I was prepared to give them a fighting chance, especially since I live just down the street and could use another convenient lunch option. So I tried them out today. 

What a disaster. The food is horrible, just horrible: stale fixings, soggy fried fish, burrito sauce that tastes like salad dressing. The fact that they cover the walls with cheesy ads suggesting they are superior to Burrito Boyz is a joke. Not even close, guys. You shouldn't be mentioned in the same breathe. 

Can't wait for these bozos to go tits up and get the hell out of town. The sooner the better."}
{"text":"A solid \"meh\". Yes, your money will go a long way here in terms of the amount of food you'll get, but we were pretty unimpressed by the flavour. We ordered two of their higher-priced, \"premium\" flavour proteins, but the taste was generally bland and became unpleasant after a while in. If you're starving and in the area, I'd say go for it. But the taste would not bring me back here."}
{"text":"This is one of many burrito places that seem to have sprung up in recent years.  Their burritos are a bit larger than most places, especially the \"huge\" one (big enough for 2 to share), but even the \"lil\" is still quite big.  You can get chicken, pork, beef, seafood, fish, or veggie and most are available more than one way.  You can choose between beans and rice or noodles then add your choice of 15 toppings (guacamole is included).  They also have a bunch of sauces and everything from mild to pass the fire extinguisher hot.  Everything is rolled up and toasted so it gets crunchy outside and hot all the way through.  Very tasty and done to your own tastes.  Prices are reasonable too.  

They really aren't set up to eat in with only a counter and some stools (usually filled with people waiting for their order to be ready) and a couple of tables.  Mostly they are take out, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Huge burritos for a good price. Tons of things to pick from to put inside.. and free gauc! I always get a bean burrito with lettuce, tomato, rice, and guac. Simple but bomb"}
{"text":"Pure delicious!! I really enjoy the burritos here. I think they are much better than most of the burrito joints. The people are very nice and I really like all the options they have to put in your burrito! I suggest trying this place out for sure"}
{"text":"RACIST, SEXIST, or maybe just SCAMMERS! Me and my friends purchased 3 burritos 3 separate times and were all asked to pay $1.50 for guacamole when the sign explicitly states no extra charge. A white lady behind me orders a burrito and when she asked for guacamole they not only didn't charge her but asked if she wanted more. 

I never thought I would encounter this type of discrimination particularly in the multicultural city of Toronto!! If I could give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place i finally found the time to stop in.  I walked in and decided what i would like, the gentleman who took my order was a nice guy and courteous, the lady preparing it was also professional so no complaints about the staff.  The place was clean and well cared for.  So why the two stars? Well, i expected wow, and got something that in my opinion was just OK.  Sure the burrito was big,  but lots of food isn't the same as great food.  It was rather unremarkable.  The presentation was nice.  But for some reason it seemed like all the meat in my steak burrito was in one roll in the middle surrounded by all the other ingredients so how do i explain this, it was seared on the outside, and thats great, but it was kinda cold in the middle, and the meat wasn't exactly shredded, it was like chunky.  So texture wise it was somewhere between burrito sushi and a Mexican hotdog.  It was ok but not spectacular and i wanted to go wow this is great but instead i found it rather food court quality.  I will say this though, the cilantro and onion is what stood out so I would say there were some decent ingredients and fresh at that, but it just didn't pop and as a guy that eats out several times a week, this just didn't live up to the hype.  The only thing that met my expectations was the bottle of water.  They serve excellent water here.  Sorry to say that it just didn't seem to come together today."}
{"text":"I ordered the naked bowl and the amount of quantity for the big bowl was more than I expected! The baked chicken was a bit dry but when mixed with the salad, rice and beans turns out to be decent."}
{"text":"There's a reason for all the 5 star reviews this is a hidden gem in Durham. Not much more to say they make the best burritos around and the value is great. If I had any complaint it's that the \"specialty\" burritos your basically adding $1.00 for sauce which is a little silly to me the first time I ordered the buffalo chicken I was surprised to see the regular baked chicken and just some sauce added. Still it's delicious I just don't get the specialty burritos. The sauces are great though!"}
{"text":"I've tried their burritos at Liberty Village location and was excited to get my order. Unfortunately, preparing my ordinary burrito took 50 (!!) minutes.. I watched people come and go, ordering and picking up their orders - and mine was nowhere to be seen. As per my request they told me they've had a hold up with some shrimps that were uncooked (that was after I've been waiting for about 30 minutes already). Weird thou as they could've told me that when I was ordering, and could've offered me something else as they've realized the order will take long. At the end of that hour sitting there I was really pissed and tbh was sure they'd offer me my order on the house, considering how big their screw up was. Nope!!! No offers, no talk about what've happened - just a brief \"sorry\" from the cashier. Needless to say I won't ever go back, thank you Toronto for many other burrito-alternatives!"}
{"text":"My son got me on to the Bastards! The main options for the burrito are many and the toppings are as well. You can spice it up as much as you can handle too. Service is always great and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Both of us got a burrito  and they were pretty good.. The ground beef was good. I shouldn't have gotten a whole wheat tortilla.. tastes better on the plain wrap. The chicken in the chicken burrito was very dry. Still good, just not what I remember since the last time I came here. 

Very nice staff and we didn't wait long for our food. I'll have to try another location to see if it tastes the same. 

Portions are very nice. Can't imagine eating the huge! Looks like a meal to be split in half.. one for now and one for later"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  I go there on weekends for my burrito fix and prefer the beef to their chicken.  The in house hot sauce is amazing and they are generous with it.  I'd always recommend the roasted steak.  They pack a lot into a burrito so its well worth the $9 to $11 dollars for the food.  The staff there is very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before a movie at the Humber Theatre, the burrito was very mediocre. 

The staff was friendly- trying to find something positive to mention. 

I had a tequila flavoured chicken with the medium salsa - it came out sweet - I was not expecting nor do I like sweet Mexican food. 

The restaurant was not clean, which to me implies the kitchen isn't clean either. 

I will not return, there are better options around."}
{"text":"So I tried this place for the first time.  Ground Beef Burrito and the Chicken Quesadilla.  The beef was tasteless and the chicken was bone dry.  Very disappointed.  I mean may be the fact we had a rookie serving us who clearly did not know what went in to a quesadilla?!?   The spouse who knows her Mexican suggested we go to Made in Mexico for decent food"}
{"text":"This place can be a bit of a uprise when ordering anything from your usual to a newer menu item. In my experiences visiting this location, the quality of service and food vary based on the time of your visit. For example the Guac which is usually tolerable at best was bursting with flavour on my recent visit. The staff where willing to do my order and hold on to it while I ran down the street to grab my self a drink at booster juice, and it wasn't soggy when I returned, the way it has been in the past."}
{"text":"Perfect when you have a serious craving for huge burritos the size of an infant.  I've been here many times and haven't been disappointed.  I don't add any goofy toppings like noodles and chips in the burrito.  I did once and found that it didn't taste as nice.  Friendly staff and selection of burritos that taste good make this a good choice for your tortilla wrapped goodness."}
{"text":"The food and service at Fat Bastard Burrito in Pickering were simply outstanding. You can see the passion that the brothers who run the place have. The younger of the two actually came out to ensure that my burrito was to my satisfaction.

I ordered a HUGE ($11.49) specialty burrito, the sweet chili thai chicken with a chocolate milk and a bag of habanero chips. The meal came to around $13, great value for the amount of food you get. The burrito was delicious, in addition to the usual rice, beans, and other vegetable toppings at this place you could put noodles inside which was a nice variation from the usual. The home-made BBQ sauce was a nice touch too. BEWARE: the habanero chips are delicious but are literally the hottest chips I have ever eaten and I can stomach very spicy food. 

Overall great place, will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"There is a reason why these guys are #1 for burritos in the GTA

Wayyyyyyyy better than Mucho Burrito

My ultra fave is the tequila lime chicken
The steak one follows

These guys do not cop out and give you more filler than meat

Portions are equal and I love the option of getting noodles

A regular size burrito can be a bit filling but you won't be disappointed 

Definitely a great addition"}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars because it's edible and the diet coke was really cold.

My wife and I got 2 naked burritos and they were bland and sloppy. I got a chicken with shrimp. The chicken was dry pulled chicken and the shrimp was just pan fried and then covered in this weird mayo sauce. My wife's shrimp bowl was like soup.

They advertise that guacamole is always free which seemed pretty awesome to me, until they put a tiny little scrape of guacamole in the bowl. I asked for more and they gave a tiiiiiiny bit more. Like the size of a toonie for comparison. I would rather pay for it then find out after paying that the free guacamole is just a skid mark worth.

Tasted pretty damn bad too. Definitely not good in any way. I feel bad giving a bad review, but seriously, this is brutal. Seems they need to cut their huge menu down and focus on making a few staple items actually taste good."}
{"text":"If you haven't gone to fat bastard burrito yet, you have not lived. If you want a zesty, spicy, sweet, yummy anything... this is the place to go. They have a range of tacos, quesadillas, and of course, burritos. My personal favorite is the crispy butter chicken burrito bowl.
They have different cultural options to add to the Mexican fiesta. 
They have many toppings like noodles, beans, rice, cilantro, lettuce, cheese, coleslaw, guac... you name it. 
This is the best place to go if you ever get the munchies or even need a huge awakening. The service is even great. They are wiling to accommodate if you would like more of something. Friendliest guys around!"}
{"text":"Best burritos, best service! 
I absolutely love the burritos and the people who work here!
I travel to this specific location at least once a week. ( I live downtown Toronto, to give some perspective)
There is always a consistency with the taste and the atmosphere. 
The employees are friendly,fast and never judge you on how much cheese, noodles or whatever you decide to place on your burrito order. 
The choices for toppings, and overall menu are very wide and give you tons of options.
I've tried every burrito! 
My top picks are:
Butter chicken and steak 
If you haven't already try fat bastards burritos 
Go big or go home"}
{"text":"I came here expecting the unexpected... I mean, c'mon, 5-stars for a fast food burrito place?! I was suspicious, yet I trusted the opinions of my fellow Yelpers.

Clearly I'm missing something. 

We both ordered burritos... mine, the baked chicken with rice, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, sweet peepers, cheese and burrito sauce. My husband's, the pulled pork with pretty much the same topping but the addition of noodles. (?)

I believe the burritos were wrapped by the same person and although a well wrapped burrito should stay together, my husband's ended up in a sloppy mess. Oddly enough, mine held together fine.

The service was average at best - no better or worse than I've experienced at any fast food restaurant. The toppings, I felt, were unimaginative and fell short of those offered at their competition. I'm sorry, I didn't feel that being able to add noodles and chips was an overly mind-blowing option.

The flavour was good but certainly not superior to other burrito places which, based on the reviews, I kind of expected it to be. The aftermath is another story!

My poor husband has been battling... shall we say, \"intestinal distress\" since dinner last night which is leaving me hovering between a 2 and 3-star rating. 

Would I come back? No... especially not with the kebab joint just in the next building. 

I'm sorry but this sheep is straying away from the flock. I expected better.

I'll split the difference and give them a 2.5-star rating and call it a day."}
{"text":"I went to Fat Bastard Burrito on Friday night as my friend who lives in the east highly recommended it. While they had so many creative styled chicken to put into your burrito, I chose to stick with just the original chicken burrito since it was my first time going there. I have to say...this place is now one of my favorite burrito spots.  Most burrito places charge you more $$$ for guacamole and cheese but but this place didn't.  And I'm one to pile on d*mn near everything on my burrito lol. I also liked the fact that they had 3 sizes. Small, Regular and Large. I got regular but it was WAY too big. I couldn't even finish it eating it. Next time I will get a small. I paid less than $10 for it and it was well worth it. My only complaint was that the chicken was a TAD too salty but overall, extremely delicious and I will go back again and try ALL the flavors!"}
{"text":"Best burritos in the GTA....yep...it's that good. 

I am here at least once a week. The service is always so great, the people working there are so nice, clean, professional. 

I usually get either the veggie or the shrimp burrito. The smallest size is perfect for my appetite. Be warned, the hot sauce, is hot. I can handle spicy...but this is a bit much (still tasty though). 

They're open late, theres ample parking up front. Some spots to sit in on the inside, bar stool style. Probably more comfy to eat at home while watching the walking dead."}
{"text":"I came here at 10:30pm and the place closes at 11... the staff told us it was closed because they wanted to leave early... 
loSt a customer"}
{"text":"We stopped here the other day to grab a quick lunch.
I ordered 2 burritos, one for me and one for hubby.

I like that noodles are an option for filling in the burrito, its a nice change from rice.  They have 3 sizes, but I can't remember what they are called on the menu, but the staff refer to them as small, medium and large...so that's a bit confusing.  No one at Starbucks calls a Grande and medium...just saying.

The big reason behind the 3 star rating is because the cashier tried to round up my order.  it was $20.88 and I paid by card, and they tried to charge me $20.90.  I know it's only 2 cents, but say they do that to everyone, and get a couple of hundred customers a day...that's cheating and stealing in my books.  And they acted like I was being a nuisance and were completely unapologetic, which further made me think they do this regularly.  That's really bad.

I don't think I could give a place that's seems to have some dishonest/shady payment practices a high star rating.

We haven't had a the penny for a while, and 2 years later, there's no excuse for not knowing the rules."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and while the food is good.  Getting them to get your order right is a challenge as their process is really confusing.  They also have a habit of giving the wrong orders to the wrong people.  They need a better system."}
{"text":"Probably for the best to only order a \"lil\" or small size. I got a \"Big\" (medium) and it was frankly ridiculous.

Rather than being like everywhere else, Fat Bastard Burrito Co. sets itself apart with some unique filling offerings and toppings. I particularly enjoyed the concept of crushed tortilla chips as a topping, and even more the bizarre and totally fusion like fried noodles. Both add a nice crunch to a steak burrito.

What gives it the solid five stars? Two things: 1. No charge for guacamole, which is why I refuse to return to Mucho Burrito, and 2. Mexican coke. It doesn't have tamarind Jarritos, but I can let that go.

They run monthly sorts of specials, when I went it was a buffalo chicken burrito on offer."}
{"text":"Fast and helpful service, the cashier explained the sizing and topping options before we actually ordered which was nice.  They cooked the meat fresh and grilled the burrito afterwards so it was extremely fresh!  Portion sizes were definitely worth the money and guacamole was included!!  Will be back again"}
{"text":"We arrived at FBB with high hopes based on Yelp reviews and they did not disappoint.  FBB has been the most pleasant discovery since moving out East almost 4 years ago. 

Tucked away in a small plaza and squeezed into a tight 800 - 900 sf space, this place does brisk business.  We arrived late Sunday afternoon and although it wasn't packed, there was a constant stream of take-out patrons for the whole 40 min we were there finishing our magical burritos.  

We ordered big (medium:  this thing must have weighed at least 2 lbs!) Tequila lime burrito with rice & beans with all the fixins and the special of the day, fire-kettle pork burrito and a lime Jarrito, coming to a total of some $23.  Not a bad deal at all.  

The fried and oven-roasted option for the chicken was nice as the fried chicken pieces added a nice crunch to the burrito.  The kettle pork was reminiscent of sweeter version of pulled pork but it was still tasty.  

As other reviewers mention, FBB does offer some rather interesting toppings and since both our orders were loaded with everything except the jalapeno peppers, I can honestly say that their toppings do work really well together.  Notable mention goes out to the crushed tortilla chips and coleslaw (love the added tang and crunch).  Although I was hesitant to try the egg noodles, it worked quite well in the Kettle pork burrito.  

Sorry Mucho Burrito, you have just been out-classed.  I will definitely be back to FBB for all future burrito cravings."}
{"text":"I love burrito's. They're packed with huge flavours and really filling for an affordable price. Got the large baked chicken burrito $8.39

Sad that they don't have black beans a topping. Instead they had a brown bean paste which was also pretty good. 

Happy to see guacamole as one of the toppings and the best part is that you don't have to pay extra like in many other places."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Pickering. I love that they put guacamole on your burrito without an extra charge! Different types of toppings, one being noodles! They also have selection meats, different types of chicken, fish, shrimps and others. 

I have a huge appetite so their regular size is good for me. I feel full and satisfied and happy !!! They have great vegetarian options as well, like sweet potatoes not like other places where the veg option is the regular burrito sans the meat for practically the same price! 

The price of burritos is around $10 bucks, but its money well spent! More of a take out place, not a sit in joint. The place is quite small but the burritos are grande!"}
{"text":"It's a fat bastards burrito which means you're going to get a tasty treat.  I'm not sure if it's the food, the convenience, or the fact I've watched it being built for the last 18 months, but I sure am glad it exists!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located with good service. They have less topping options than Burrito Boyz but the quality of meat is unmatched. They use amazing shredded chicken in their burritos and it's delicious!  They also don't charge you extra for guac."}
{"text":"When a place has 7 reviews, all 5-star, I'm more than a little dubious. But I went at the recommendation of family (not yelp-guided), and this place was an epiphany: it absolutely blows (prior favorite) chipotle out of the water!  In fact, it blows chipotle out of the water and on to the sandy beach, where it kicks sand in chipotle's face and then proceeds to kick the crap out of it!

I wasn't even that hungry, so I split a large tequila-lime chicken burrito with my ma, and just could not believe how much was going on in my mouth - fantastic. 

So yes, in the category of \"burrito\", FB is as good as it gets in North America (and therefore, most likely, the world).  
Noodles in a burrito?  Yes. 
Crushed chips?  Why did I not think of that!
Great sauces.  Love the crunch from heat-pressing.

I have not given 5-stars this enthusiastically in a long time, and I will be back whenever I'm in my hometown of Toronto. 

I'd like to say something negative so my review would look more authentic, but I've got nothing (the name itself may limit FB from worldwide expansion).  Keep up the good work, bastards!"}
{"text":"Have to say its a workout to lift it as it's HUUUUUGGGGEEEEEE.

tasty and well done and staff was friendly..gotta go back :)"}
{"text":"The food is just okay. The prices are high for what you get and on my last visit the staff member was really rude. Like i was not quick enough for her when getting my order. She was kind of snobby. Have not been back since."}
{"text":"The place is you typical burrito joint. I really think what sets it apart are the workers. 

They're very friendly and don't mind letting you know what's in their burritos. Also don't be fool. \"Lil\" burrito is actually like half a foot lob from subway."}
{"text":"This is now a weekly staple. They have an assortment of sauces to put on a burrito. The staff are friendly and the burritos are big. The only thing I think they can do is create combo options. Out of all of the burrito joints I have tried, this is definitely number 1 for me! The chicken is tasty, the choices of toppings are wonderful and their service is one of the best for a joint like this."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location ever since it's opening day. I love the food. The ingredients are always fresh. Restaurant is clean. Staff is very friendly and always make you feel welcome.  I have been to burrito boys and burrito Bandidos in Toronto and the taste more then equal. Fat bastard has three sizes the biggest is their huge  I will admit the biggest burrito I have ever eaten. The ghost chilli hot sauce is very nice and with 8 to 10 lines is perfect. I also would not recommend putting that many lines on unless you love the heat"}
{"text":"Best burrito you can get without getting on a go train or spending $20 parking. Tequila lime is the go to - and order a big one. Huge is too much, little is still good but cmon man it's a burrito what the hell are you doing ordering a little one. Buffalo and Baja chipotle also excellent. Also, the hot sauce is insanely hot. don't make the mistake of being a big man and putting lots on your first time. Like my first prom, it will end in tears and lots of bread.

Burritos are love. Burritos are life."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. food is ok but I don't like some on the items on the menu. Didn't like noddles in my burrito. Love the fresh shrimp that were cooked to order. Better seating area and reno would do wonders for this place"}
{"text":"Arrived 10 minutes before they closed so they only had the baked chicken available but damn was it good and filling. Probably the first time I've had ramen noodles in a sandwich too which was tastes. Deep fried mars bars were warm, gooey and a must try. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Canada after 24 years in the states (12 in LA and 12 in NY) so I understand that I've been lucky with Mexican food. Burritos are plentiful in Los Angeles so my expectations were not too high when I walked into this burrito shop close to my home. Well having low expectations usually protects me from too much disappointment but not today. The \"pico de Gallo\" tastes like ketchup and that's about all I'm really tasting here. It's just a big mushy roll of yuck. The people were nice but the food is not too good. Perhaps nobody has been educated in making a good burrito. Oh well I guess I'll just continue to wonder around Bloor West Village looking for good food."}
{"text":"$12 for a burrito bowl and didn't even eat half of it. I asked for steak, got pulled pork. They were damp and bland. Wasn't worth the money"}
{"text":"Favourite place to get a burrito! There's literally a Mucho Burrito minutes from my house, but I'll drive the extra few minutes to Fat Bastards. Service is always great, staff is friendly and also remember you (or maybe I go too often!!) Always get the shrimp burrito, and love that you can add noodles and chips in it! Guac being free is also a huge plus."}
