{"text":"Food is pretty good. I like the buns on their burgers. Good food, bad service. Waited 20-25 minutes in drive thru. Only had 2 people working on lunch rush. Not the employees fault the employers. Could be 5 stars if they had the correct amount of employees working. But food did come out good"}

Ordered Pastrami sandwich fries, and coke. This is the fifth and last time for me. 
Pastrami is perfect one time and the next it is full of FAT and tuff. I have tried to be patient, but this was unbeatable this time. The don't care what they cook or how it is sliced, so good luck!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for dinner tonight and I'm glad we did.  We went thru the drive-thru and from the time we ordered till we actually got our food was 12 minutes.  And we ordered 5 meals.  Price wasn't bad....spent $36 for 5 meals + a side of fried zucchini.  My husband ordered the pastrami burger and said it was delicious and had a good amount of pastrami' My daughter had the avocado burger ...needless to say it must have been good cuz it was gone in like 5 minutes.  My youngest daughter and My son both had the Jr. cheeseburger and they said it was delicious.  And I had the bacon burger.  It had a good amount of bacon and the bacon wasn't fatty....I can't stand fatty bacon' so it was perfect.  With the meal we all got fries and My husband and kids said that they could've had a little more salt but for me they were perfect cuz I don't like a lot of salt.  And the bag was a big size cuz we couldn't finish them after eating the burger.  And u get a drink which I think is a medium.  I actually thought it was going to be a small sized cup but it was a decent size as well.  And the fried zuchinji was delicious as well and was just over $3 and u get a lot for the price.  So overall we loved the food and the portion size.   I'm hoping they get slightly quicker at the drive thru so I can give them 5 stars.   But, great place and we will go there again for sure.   We needed a place like this in this area."}
{"text":"The fries are amazing, perfectly crispy and delicious. My pastrami sandwich was average nothing amazing but still good. The service was quick but I did notice there was only one guy up front and I assume there was a cook in the back which kind of sucked for the guy up front as he had to work the drive thru and walk ins. I would go back."}
{"text":"I think by now, Wimpy's has worked out some of its kinds which plagued it from their grand opening day.  I'll admit that I won't go throught he drive-thru anymore, because on the two sole occasions doing so--mind you, this is when they first opened, it took about 30 minutes to get my food.  That being said, I have ordered at the counter and have eaten in-house, and the time to get my food wasn't all that long.  The burgers, themselves, are of good size and quality.  While fries are not healthy, they give you a lot of them for your money.  I enjoy their 1/3 pound cheeseburger, their avocado burger, and pastrami burger.  These are not sandwiches for the faint-hearted, because they are all very filling.  For the money, you get a lot.  It is a mom and pop place, and as such, service at the counter can vary.  I'd like to believe that they are doing their best, but the young crew needs a few lessons in public relations.  The place is clean, but there is a pervasive smell of, to me, \"sewage,\" somewhere.  That's probably the only detraction in my review here.  Order out, and you'll avoid the smell entirely."}
{"text":"Their Jr. Cheeseburger is a great deal. Everything is made to order, so you have to wait a few extra minutes, but it's worth it. If you order the sides by themselves, they are huge! Their ranch for dipping is also really good. Friendly staff, it's a great place to go."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible! Not one \"Thank you\" on my visit (My receipt says Josh). Improve your customer service, and you might make up for the wait time. Food is okay..."}
{"text":"Nice staff and a decent enough burger. I got the Bacon Cheeseburger meal, which stuck out as a winner after looking at some pics. Sadly, it was nothing to write home to mom about. I did like the steak fries with the extra bit of crisp to them."}
{"text":"I live about 4 minutes from Wimpy's. Worst food we ever tried to eat... Burgers ice cold tasted like old grease. Onion rings and fries were cold, soggy and smelled like old dirty oil. We also had to wait about 20 minutes for our order. We tossed it all in the trash and went to McDonald's hum their food was hot and good"}
{"text":"The bacon cheese burger is a must have! They give lots of frys with your meal and their ranch is fresh and always cold!"}
{"text":"Bun was delicious patty was decent, I would definitely eat it again. However, like a previous review the wait was absolutely the longest ive ever waited in a drive thru. (20 min at farmerboys and they hooked me up with a free meal) 31 minutes for 1 regular cheeseburger, there was only 2 cars ahead of me first of all and second when I got to the window It looked like the woman was taking orders, killing the cow's and cooking ..blew my mind."}
{"text":"I honestly do not know why people are complaining about the wait time. If you want a burger that's been sitting out with 100 other burgers, then this place isn't for you. There's a McDonalds up the street. The food wasn't greasy, just juicy. Loved it! The wait was well worth the fresh burgers and pastrami sandwich we ordered. 22 minutes to be exact. Friendly employees and while the restaurant's  appearance isn't upscale, the food is great and inexpensive. We will certainly return again."}
{"text":"No passion. The meat in the burgers is likely frozen patties. I ate 1/3 patty and saved what was left for my dog. The batter for the onion rings tasted bland. The French fries were passable, actually good.

My wife brought me a triple patty burger, just too large for human consumption.  

If this business would make burgers from better hamburger meat....onion rings with better batter, I would return."}
{"text":"Best hidden secret!!!!! Juicy burgers...... AMERICAN BURGERS !!!!! \" I'll pay you on Tuesday for a hamburger today\"  type of burgers.....

No further explanations needed...... 

Juicy, satisfying and sinfully goooooooood !!!!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Hot and fresh got to watch Popeye videos while I waited.  Just would have been nice if I got napkins In my bag."}
{"text":"I love this place & they never disappoint. Every time I go I always feel this place deserves a 5 & I have given it a 5 before.. but last night, I was a little upset. First, the wait is always an issue I can't really complain because I wouldn't want the cook rushing my food but other than that , it's such a long wait !!! The gentlemen that works the nights shifts is awesome , he even upgraded my drink to a large for because of the wait & he's always nice! So I ordered the Pastrami Avocado Burger with no cheese & no pickles. Once I got the order he confirmed it, then came to the window a second time just to double check that I said \"No cheese\".. I get my food , I get home , take my Burger out & it's visible that it has cheese ! I didn't mind it , just wish I didn't have it (like I ordered).. i enjoy another bite then I feel like I'm bitting into a tough string, it was the onion, with the skin still attached , the outer layer ! I pull it out & im more upset because I love onion but I was grossed out after that point with it... i continue to eat it & I bite into something crunchy, I did ask for no pickles but why in the WORLD were there CUCUMBERS in my hamburger ? Cucumbers.. the ones that belong in their salads...I do like this place a lot but I was disappointed yesterday...."}
{"text":"I come here often. The food is great, but you have to double check your order. It is a newer restaurant that is still getting used to things. The POS system still needs work. 
The staff is friendly and I have met the owners, they are a good family."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a burger place!  So happy to have found it.  Reminds us the California burger joints with the same great taste.  Looking forward to our next visit!  Their cheeseburger was tasty and the pastrami was just how we like it!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food!!! I remember these places from back in the 80's and when I was stationed overseas in the UK.  The bacon really makes the burger and this place has great tasting bacon.  I've not had a bad meal there yet and I doubt one will ever be bad.  
If you are tired of the other fast food joints, this place is refreshing and will make you come back for more."}
{"text":"Having been named after a dude with legendary burger cravings, I gotta say the expectations were pretty high... Also, burgers are my go-to, so I'm pretty critical of them. I've driven by this place 3 or 4 dozen times since I moved into the area, and finally just tried it. I bought the bacon cheeseburger combo. This burger had a lot of potential, but it was cooked too long making the meat really dry. The buns were toasted on the outside to the point where they were blackened a little and were hard. However, the choice of thousand island with caramelized onions (which were done almost to perfection by the way) added some flavor, making it edible. They gave me a LOT of fries, which I prefer, and they were nice and hot. My guess is the fry cook left the burger on the grill while he put down fresh fries, and ended up overcooking the meat. I'll probably give it another try, but I will wait until lunch time on a weekday when the burgers are flying fresh off the grill and I'm hoping I have better luck."}
{"text":"Good food, decent price. Customer service almost non existent. Shake machine seems to Brake a lot. But still eat here 1-2 month for the food."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times.  Twice thru the drive thru and the last time I dined in.  So glad I did.  One of the cooks (stawky white guy) wasn't wearing gloves.  Then he went to the restroom and bumped my chair and elbow in passing without a word. I went to use the bathroom and guess what, no paper towels.  So I used the blower which made a lot of noise.  That told me the cook failed to wash his hands.  When I walked out of the bathroom,  he had a hand full of bacon.  My friend had the bacon burger lol.  Oh,  did I mention that when he bent over all you saw was crack.  I'll go back but only if he's not there. The burgers and fries are great."}
{"text":"Food was so-so. It took forever to get. My wife's coworker said this place was good so we decided to drive almost 20 minutes to try it and found out we should've went to the in n out down the street! We shared a pastrami burger and chili cheese fries. The burger was just a burger no wow factor. The pastrami was dry and not very flavorful. The chili on the fries was not seasoned and just tasted like ground beef in grease. I will say the restaurant is clean but the staff is not very friendly or eager to assist just kind of going through the motions. As others have said in reviews the price is decent but like they say you get what you pay for so If you want a good burger or good chili cheese fries try tommys instead."}
{"text":"YES YES YES!!! Always awesome staff..... food is real food..... I love coming in and feeling like it's our local place.... even though it's a franchise."}
{"text":"Read some bad reviews but thought, they're new so we'll give it a shot. Very disappointed,  LONG wait, very greasy and very bland. Bummer!!! I was looking forward to a new restaurant option close to home."}
{"text":"Come here all the time. Love their regular burger. Hungry? Make it a double. Best burger in town. Huge order of fries comes with the meal. Onion rings good too. They also have really hot banana peppers that are so yummy with the burgers. Price beats all restaurants and some fast food places but they make yours fresh to order. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I have had my share of burgers to say the least. The bacon avocado burger here is one of the best if not the best I've ever had.
 Great prices
Great staff
GREAT FOOD..."}
{"text":"So sad was hoping it would be similar to the original wimpys located on las vegas blvd ... sad burgers were not very good. frys were awsome . steak sandwich was good. pastrami sandwich was good .the burger might have been better if it was on the steak sandwich roll 
.. honest tasted like oven cleaner sad I'm somewhat bummed. I was oh so hoping it would of been a better experience. .. the line I can deal with if only the food and shakes were better... my only advice is get it together while your new ... before the customers leave and your out of business."}
{"text":"Horrible. Granted I went here almost 4 months ago and maybe its changed but when i wen it was bad. I went through the drive thru. You could overly tell the burger was a frozen patty I  took two bites and ended up throwing it away. I also got a choc. milkshake that i tossed in the trash. You could taste that the ice cream was frost bitten. Never going back, sorry."}
{"text":"I was trying to give this place no stars but my phone wasnt letting me. Not sure where they found a cook that doesnt know how to cook a burger but they did. My girlfriends burger was undercooked but mine was overcooked and dry. There was a brown leaf stuck to the outside of my burger and when I asked about it at the counter I was told it was lettuce and the worker took it from me. Ive made enough salads in my life to know what lettuce looks like. Sat down to eat lunch and watch nearly every order brought back to the counter. I couldnt even wash the taste of the bad food out of my mouth because there was only one option on their soda machine that was working and i dont drink caffeine. For just opening up this place is horribly prepared. This guy at the counter ordered a salad and they didnt let him know they were out of dressing until he got his food. This sounds sad but i would strongly advise anyone looking for a burger to either drive to a mcdonalds or go to the fresh and easy next door and make your own burger."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for me, I stopped in at Wimpy's and ordered a pastrami cheeseburger combo with fries. 

The pastrami was very tough and thick with fat. Difficult to chew through. The flavorless burger patty was dry and overcooked. My fries tasted of the oil they were cooked in, which I'm assuming was not fresh. 

Just gross, all of it. I threw it in the trash after a few bites.

The complimentary yellow chili peppers they offered were brown in their room temp plastic container sitting next to the register. They didn't look safe to eat, so I passed.

I will never be returning."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich and fried zucchini is bomb and all but you literally wait in the drive though forever it's a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went in and the place was completely empty.  The floors and counter were sticky and it looked run down and smelled like sewage.  My sole purpose of going was to try the zucchini sticks. I love zucchini sticks and the pics and reviews on yelp convinced me even with though I was a little hesitant due to the places ' so-so reviews.  I got there and they were all out.  I ended up getting an avacado bacon burger and onion rings and my husband got the steak sandwich and fries.  On the way home I tried a fry and onion ring.  They had absolutely no seasoning whatsoever.  I don't know if that's normal or the cook just forgot.  I was really nervous then but the burger was super tasty.  The steak sandwich however per my husband tasted like mayo with a side of steak.  Half of the steak was just fat.  My husband cut off the fat then had to cut the bun in half since there was hardly any meat.  I really want to try the zucchini sticks but I'm not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Shame on the owner to have one girl take orders and cook by herself. What's the deal with that. If I was her I'd put a sign up on the drive thru. Drive thru closed! And have everyone get down and decided if they want to wait or not."}
{"text":"Wimpy's is not like other fast food places the food is fresh the sandwiches are never soggy and I like the fact that you can get a vegetarian burger from there the french fries are always crisp and never burned and they also serve my favorite chicken sandwich of any fast food place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Very great burgers and the BEST price I've ever seen. The wait can be a little long when you go through the drive-thru, but it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Got to admit, this place serves up a pretty tasty burger, and for a very reasonable price!  Their double bacon cheeseburger is artery clogging goodness, and is easily 2 meals if you get the combo.  The staff is very friendly, and I would like to give an atta-boy to Michael (I'm pretty sure that was his name... I'll come back and correct if I find out otherwise) for top notch customer service every time we visit!  The restaurant is not huge, but it's adequate for a decent size group of people to sit and enjoy their meal.  They also have an old TV in the corner playing classic Popeye cartoons (what else would you expect from \"Wimpy's\" LOL), which entertains my little ones.

I must admit there are a few negative aspects as well.  As others have pointed out, yes the wait can be pretty long, and we've easily waited 10+ minutes in the drive-thru for our order... lord help you if there's more than 1 car ahead of you!  The best way to think about this place is NOT as a fast food restaurant, but a normal burger joint that also happens to have a drive-thru.  With this in mind, I won't penalize their rating... but it was very close to losing a star, as they could definitely stand to have some additional staff to help with the wait times (especially in the kitchen area).  My only other issue with them is the occasional order mistake, but in all honesty they definitely are no worse than a BK, CJ's, or any other burger joint.  Bottom line, this a great place to eat at, and I hope the business does well for years to come!"}
{"text":"Love this place best burgers in town. So glad it's close to my house I get there bacon burger and steak sandwich prices are higher but worth the meal and wait"}
{"text":"Been going here for about a year now! One of my go to spots now! Some of the best burgers in town! Sure there can be a wait time but it's a small mom and pop place not McDonalds. Great customer service and always stellar food. Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Waiting 25 minutes in a \"fast food\" drive through is a tad ridiculous.  I can understand it being a fluke, but this happens everytime we come here.  They have upgraded with a cute tv and outside sound while waiting, but still annoying when you have a hungry kid in the car."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Don't expect to eat here if on a diet. We ordered the cheeseburger combo with drink and fries. The burger was very filling and fresh with all the fixings. The meat was super juicy. The fries are large cut and come in a big portion. We also got a homemade spinach pie and complimentary cookies from the owner. My son says the cookies were yummy. The spinach pie has a flaky crust and very tasty filling, the owner's family recipe. Prices are friendly on my wallet. Definitely would come again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food establishment I have ever been to. We order our food and sat at the drive thru for over 30 minutes not once did the only two employees working come and say hey it'll be this long of a wait etc. I will never come back here ever again. This is the most ridiculous wait I've ever had to experience for some food it doesn't take this long at an actual restaurant this place is freaking gross I found a long hair in my salad that is disgusting and unsanitary as hell"}
{"text":"Best fast food burger I've had in this town!! I hate to say it, but Wimpy's blows In N Out Burger and the Habit Burger away. Not saying that they aren't awesome too. Just give this place a try and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. It's kind of in a bad location though so I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"OMG. This is one of the best burgers I've had in a loooong time. The pastrami burger was awesome. Fries are REAL fries!"}
{"text":"Patty was bland and I found hair on my burger. They offered to remake it, I declined. I lost my appetite after that, I thought when working with food you wore hair nets. Guess I was wrong"}
{"text":"The food is pretty dang good, but you have to wait half an hour to get it. And the service is hit and miss. Too bad because the food IS good."}
{"text":"The burger was very tasty and cooked just right.  The chili cheese fries, however, was not for me.  I can see how other people might like it, but again, it wasn't for me (in terms of a topping on fries that is).

I do think it would be terrific on a hot dog though - just not on fries.  I was hoping for something a little more saucy, that's all."}
{"text":"Seriously AMAZING! The Pastrami burger was so delicious and huge! Tons of pastrami! Also had a side if fries which were delicious and perfectly cooked and seasoned! Wonderful lunch for under 10bucks!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, here now enjoying our food, fresh very clean. Busy for a reason. Pastrami burger chili fires."}
{"text":"Went here because we kept passing it and decided it was time to give it a try! Im glad I did, its very quite and the decor in the eating part is great with pocs from popeye it brings me back a little. I love the fries I used to eat these type of fries back home from little hole in the wall places with bomb food! The pastrami burger was good, pastrami was very tender,  smokey, and full of flavor. The burger was decent sized but could use a little more seasoning. Same goes for the fries zucchini.  The breading was nice and crunchy but it lacked in the flavor department. Overall I have no regrets stopping here and will go back for sure! I give this place a 3.5 and will explore more of the small but versatile menu.."}
{"text":"This place has some issues to work out. Walking in the smell of sewage was overwhelming. Everyone I was with decided to just walk out and eat somewhere else. The smell was so bad it made my stomach feel sick. The employees opened the door and made waiving motions trying to get the stench out. Something that smells that bad needs more attention over a open door. The employees were laughing and seemed to find it funny. One of them also had a hat but no hair net and kept tugging at her hair and rubbing her nose."}
{"text":"Avocado burger is amazing!  Always drove by but, never stopped.  New favorite place! And the Chicken salad is delicious. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"best burgers ever...so glad i found this gem...and their fried zuccinis are to die for"}
{"text":"So tried Wimpys for the first time today.  I had the Frisco burger and my fiance had the Bacon cheeseburger.  We both did combos not knowing how huge the portion of fries was.  The food was good and reasonably priced.  The only negative is that they don't have music in the dining area so you can hear the staff playing their music in the back and their conversations.  Overall was good and would go back."}
{"text":"The best burgers! Food made fresh, they take their time to cook to perfection. The staff is great"}
{"text":"This is my first time her and I'm glad I went. The food is really good the prices are reasonable Avacado burger meal for around d dollars and pastrami burger meal for around 7. My food was fresh fries that are thick and not strings Zucchini were perfect and to top it off customer service was amazing she was really nice and personable talked and laughed with me while i waited and still did her job can't remember her name but she's reason number two that  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Pretty decent.  Enjoyed the bacon cheeseburger.  Pastrami was a little too fatty with a slightly soggy roll.  Rings and zucchini pretty bland but very crisp and fresh tasting.  Ranch was very disappointing it tasted like it had no seasoning.  I thought it was just sour cream in a cup.  Great very crunchy pickles!  Service was very good!"}
{"text":"Had to try the pastrami burger since I've heard so much about it.  Stopped in after hitting a bucket of balls at the range at Aliante GC and since it was early, think I missed the lunch crowd.  Kind of in a out of the way location, but it's worth the hunt.  The pastrami was savory and piled high; also, they must grill some good Angus beef burgers because mine seemed leaner, but flavorful.  Generous amount of hot, crispy steak fries--plenty to share.  The staff were very welcoming and friendly, inquired a number of times if I needed anything else and if everything was alright.  Yes, everything was just fine and even though I live way over on the other side of the valley, I would be glad to make the long drive here to have another Wimpy's burger."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were just there 20 minutes ago and ordered just basic easy food through the drive thru. Bacon burger didn't come out plain like I wanted, fries were soggy, and the patties tasted old and undesirable. Our stomachs are hurting so I'm thinking we'll suffer for this later. 18 bucks for crappy food."}
{"text":"Loved the Popeye shows I got to enjoy along with my meal. I stopped here for lunch and the place was nice and quiet to enjoy. Big open kitchen and lot's of fun Wimpy pictures all around. They also have a drive thru for your convenience. Definitely a place to come back to. Oh and very reasonable prices!!"}
{"text":"Buy 3 meals get 1 free today. Oh yeah! I'm so glad that my son suggested that we have Wimpy Burgers tonight. It's definitely one of North Las Vegas hidden secrets. .."}
{"text":"Amanda and the rest of the crew are so friendly you expect them to sit down and share the meal with you. The food is so good I wish I was a local. The Popeye gimmick brought me in but it was so delicious I knew I would be coming back as much as possible. While I was eating there I overheard the owner training his staff and had never heard someone so passionate. Even the water was among the best I've had. 

What I find most unique about their burgers is the bun. It is soft but dense and textured in a way that keeps ingredients from slipping out."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries in town.  Its a gem and affordable.  Go in the burgers take a little while to make..  secret sauce, chilli burgers everthing is good."}
{"text":"Do NOT pass up this place, Wimpy's is the stop of all stop's when it comes to a hot burger and fries. Last time I stopped in, they started running Popeye on their TV's while you eat. 
Forget In n Out, pass McDonald's, and stop by Wimpy's! And try out the Veggie Burger!! NOT DAMN BAD :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Wimpy's while driving around the area looking for food. This restaurant is located on Centennial and North 5th in a pretty abandoned strip mall. I wasn't even sure they were open at first because I didn't see any cars in the area at all. They have a drive thru or you can eat in. Their menu is small consisting of breakfast, burgers, sandwiches, salads, and some sides.

I ordered two pastrami burgers, adding an extra patty on one, and two orders of fries. I also got a few sides of ranch. My total was around $17 and I was impressed with the amount of food I received for the money. It took about ten minutes for everything and my food was delivered to me hot and fresh. 

The fries were a generous amount, definitely  enough for two people to share. They had absolutely NO seasoning which was disappointing. The ranch was chunky and had no flavor. There seemed to be a trend going on and I didn't like it. The burger was ok. The patty was definitely frozen and lacked, you guessed it, seasoning!! The pastrami was good though. I ended up ditching half the burger and just eating the pastrami. The burgers came with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a thousand island sauce. 

For the price and the amount of food you get I would go back, at least for the pastrami."}
{"text":"My impression on whimpys was that their portions were big especially for the price, you can't go wrong. The burger it self was good. I had the double bacon burger with everything on it, lettuce, tomato, pickles and sauce. The bacon is huge thick cut pieces. The only thing I wasn't to happy about was that the burger was too well done for my liking, on the dry side. But to each their own. 

The service was a little slow when we dined mid day. One woman was running the cashier taking orders and also handling the drive through are the same time which was weird. A bit short handed? Lol. The tables and Inaudible dining area could have been cleaner as well."}
{"text":"My first review, my girlfriend and I got done shopping and decided to get something fast. I know a lot of complaints in the drive thru but I guess they worked on it . Took about 12 mins not bad if its real beef. I appreciate a fully cooked burger, that being said my fiance had the avocado burger and was a little pink and halfway through found either a small hair or sometype of fruit fiber looking thing buuuuut we decided on it being a coarse hair and promptly stopped eating. I had the bacon cheeseburger, good but patty was kind of bland. Needs some type of seasoning and  the fries the same. 
      If you're rolling by its worth spending the same amout for In-n-out up the street. The zucchini fries are proabably the best thing coming out of that place. Hope the owner sees the reviews to make the necessary plans on saving it. I like the concept of small businesses or a least and alternative to all the other corporate monsters."}
{"text":"Always good. Been here 4 times now and I've always left happy. They should add another location."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Waited in the drive thru for nearly 15-20 minutes, with only one car ahead of me. When I asked what was on the avocado burger, the women's response was \"avocados.\" Burger was okay... Nothing special. Also ordered a side of fried zucchini and found a hair in the batch.... Needless to say, will never visit again."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about trying this place but I was not disappointed. Don't let the empty parking lot fool you, the burgers here are AMAZING!!!! You get a lot of food for your money, the lady that works the register is nice and you get to watch some old Popeye commercials while you wait. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! This place is so great. The food is the best around. The food is cooked to order. With it being so fresh there is a wait. But THE WAIT IS WORTH IT! This place feel like a mom and pop kind of place. And the tv plays Popeye cartoons all day. It's just a great place to eat. Great people. Great environment."}
{"text":"Pastrami burger, onion rings, fried zucchini... Yum. Only negative was that my husband wished there was some mustard on the burger. I wasn't too crazy about the buns. Took 1 star away for the service in drive thru. The girl was not too pleasant, slight attitude. Will be back for the grub and hopefully service will be better."}
{"text":"This place use to have a open kitchen where you can see the cook making your food. If you scroll through the pics you will see what I am talking about. I just hope management decides to arrange the kitchen back in an \"open view\" style so I can see if the cook is washing his / her hands before touching my food. Now the cook (s) look so secretive making our food. Gives me an uneasy feeling considering you can see the cooks at Wendys, Mcdonalds etc, making your food. It may sound like a petty request, but trust me, customers pay attention to this kind of detail. Overall, the rest of the restaurant looked clean."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places hidden secret. I hope everyone finds out they deserve the business. They have home made baklava for real!"}
{"text":"I liked it a lot the burgers were delicious and filling as were the fries.The inside does have a sewer odor.Good thing we are outside!I recommend it if you want a good burger that's cooked to order and not sitting under a heat lamp"}
{"text":"Just gross. This place is going broke and you can sure tell. They are cutting Corners everywhere right down to the fountain drink cup.  Been there now three times hoping for it to improve. Can't wait to see what new business takes this space.

Sorry Wimpy's wished I could write a good review for you but unfortunately your food just isn't good."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, BUT you do have to wait min of 5-8 min for your food.  They are understaffed but then again not too many people go there and the food seems to be made to order not warmed to order.  Overall great food, ok pricing."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! We just moved here from Cali and were looking for a decent burger place. I searched on yelp and came across this hidden gem! We got the bacon cheeseburger combo with a hard fried egg. It was sooooo delicious! The burger and their ranch is the sole reason for my five star review. We now stop by a couple time a month. Our favorite little burger shop in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places, used to live right by it. I recommend the pastrami burger,zucchini fries and their huge portion of chili cheese fries. The kids burgers are great and well priced. The wait is a bit long at the window but the quality more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place multiple times since they opened and I finally decided to try it after I noticed a coupon on the back of my receipt from Smiths. I had the free 1/3 lb burger with grilled onions and a strawberry shake, my husband had a 1/3 lb burger with cheese and bacon and we shared fries. Let me just say, we were not disappointed! The fries were great, the burgers were delicious (good size, great flavor, good buns, and I love that they didn't mind doing grilled onions), and the strawberry shake was better than in-n-outs. They also had great customer service and I like that the drive-thru is open late."}
{"text":"Their burgers, sandwiches, and fries are delicious. Avoid corn dogs and such. Wimpy's is close to my house and I have not had any complaints concerning their food whatsoever. 

However, the restaurant is located in an almost vacant shopping center, in front of the dollar store. The service is really awkward every time I visit. The restaurant is practically empty every time I go but it does have a clean appearance. Their drive thru speaker does not work and they seem to put off fixing it, lol, so you must order at the window. Their menu could look more professional; there are a lot of hand written corrections. 

So overall this place deserves a three-star rating. If they can improve on the aforementioned details then maybe their ratings will change. As you can see I clearly have an issue with their service and appearance but their food is pretty good, so stop on in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Was expecting better. Ordered a 1/3 pound cheeseburger and fries. The wait time was average. When I got home to eat a few minutes later, I was pretty disappointed. The fries were hot, but had no salt on them. There was also no ketchup or salt packets in the bad, so the fries were not that good. The burger was equally bland. There was no seasoning on it and I can tell that the burger was not fresh. It was cold and seems like it was grilled hours before. 

Frozen burgers, frozen fries, no flavor. 

Sad, I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Fresh lla cooked foid, great size portions, prices are very reasonable , been coming here since I moved to the side of town, the only burger place I would eat (cheat meal)"}
{"text":"Overall this place looks like a hole in the wall, we were I don't want to say greeted but more of like scared off by and ver rudely attended in the drive through by a server, which says on my receipt as Brittany, I don't want to say she was talking bad but her nonverbals were just to obvious as if we were bothering her, she kept closing the window through our order and I repeated my order at least 3 times, once I received the order there was no greeting or thanks nor come back later, I hope the food is good and I can change my perspective on this establishment although I do like to have good customer service along. With my food so...... maybe/maybe not"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! Service is great, if you want a burger made with real ingredients try whimpys!"}
{"text":"The exterior and drive up menu gives the idea that it may be abandoned. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger meal. The soda has tons of ice, only enough soda to get through my fries. The fries were piping hot but lack any magic. The bacon cheeseburger was fairly good but not enough to entice me back."}
{"text":"I love the fries from their style in and out Tom's burgers its super good here very decent price as well pretty big meals I always order the junior bacon cheeseburger super good"}
{"text":"I've been sitting in the drive thru for the last 15 minutes waiting for my food. I honestly think that they have one person working here at all times. This poor girl working here is doing everything taking orders pouring drinks being the cashier literally everything. They really need to hire some more people because that is not fair for their current employee."}
{"text":"The service isn't the greatest, the cashier seems like she'd rather be anywhere but there. That however had no influence on the food! Unfortunately the onion rings were flavorless but their 75 cent ice cream cones are to die for!! Literally the best Ice Cream I've had in ages. Strawberry cone is a must!!!

We order a bacon cheeseburger and an avocado Burger (doesn't come with cheese, we recommend adding it if you're a cheese lover like we are). The entire burger was juicy and the ingredients were fresh. I would have taken a picture but we were hungry and devoured it quickly. 

As for the wait, it's not McDonald's. We can't expect for food to be ready instantly and then complain it tastes processes. The meat is well seasoned. 

I will definitely come back and recommend to friends/family."}
{"text":"Decided to try Wimpy's since it's only 8 minutes from my house and the reviews looked good. I had the avocado burger meal while my boyfriend had the pastrami burger meal. The food was good, neither of us could finish our meal. However, the reason I won't be coming back is the blue haired girl working the counter was not friendly at all. She went back and forth between taking money from the drive thru and going behind the counter and handling the fries WITHOUT washing her hands. She silently handed us our bag of food without so much as a \"Thanks for coming\", \"see you next time\", not even the slightest grin. The older guy cooking the burgers seemed to be in a bad mood as well."}
{"text":"In fairness to these guys, I tried them out again after about 4 months since my last visit. The negatives that stood out for me were that the service was a bit slow and there was a rancid stench in the air almost like raw sewage.

Well im happy to report that the smell is gone and the service is much better now.

As usual, I got the Pastrami Burger along with Chili Cheese Fries that me and the fam shared. For you newbies, just get the Pastrami Burger. It's the best of both worlds. It's a huge burger and with the meal they give you a lot of fries.

Not sure about the drive thru for I havnt tried it out yet. I remember the first few weeks these guys opened, that the service was really slow and that some folks actually waited about 40 minutes to get their orders. I think that has been worked on for I dont really see any recent reviews in regards slow service at the drive thru.

Keep it up guys! Who knows, maybe the next time I go, I might be even more impressed and have to do another update.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #143 \"Aint nuttin wimpy about the Pastrami Burger!\""}
{"text":"Had the Avocado Hamburger, it was good.  Nice,  clean atmosphere.  They even have Old School Popeye cartoons playing on the TV set,  and Wimpy posters. Next time I have my 'cheat day', I think I'll try the Pastrami Burger. Fries were done just right, the way I like them. 
Exceptional value for your money. 

 They even gave Military discounts. Nice &  Patriotic, not too far from Nellis AFB  in North Las Vegas. Military members & local community should support the business."}
{"text":"I went here last night and this place really lacks in cleanliness.  The cloth that was used to wipe things down with was filthy like it had been being used for a long time.  Meaning, not the first day of use.  Everything around the drink machine was filthy and had dried on gunk.  There was a young (elementary or middle school aged) girl mopping while I was there.  The boy that helped us was nice.  I asked for burgers with no onions and lettuce when I got home. Both burgers had onions.  I have stomach issues with onions and was very specific that I didn't want onions on either burger. The burgers were good if there hadn't been covered in onion.  The chicken nuggets were disgusting.  The kids wouldn't eat them.  The fries were great and the ranch dip was great too.  There wasn't enough ranch (one very small plastic cup) for the nuggets and the ketchup even after asking for more wasn't enough.  Over all we were disappointed and won't travel twenty minutes each way to go again.  It was too dirty and they didn't even get my order correct.  While there we saw one car thru the drive through and one guy and his son went inside when we did.  We waited about 15min for food."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good. Haven't ate at Whimpy's since there was one in Woodfield Mall Schaumburg, IL."}
{"text":"I realized Wimpy's was open on my way to Mcdonald's for my son.  So I decided to give them a try.  Wait in the drive thru was very long for some reason.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries, chicken nuggets, and waited a long time for it.  Once home, the burger was juicy and the fries were nice and hot.  The chicken nuggets were ok, the best thing was the burger."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying  wimpys I ordered a bacon cheese burger by this is one of the best burgers I've ever had thay have great service it's a very clean restaurant and the food is affordable"}
{"text":"Love the food! Great spot for family lunch. My fav is the Avocado Burger combo with no onions and extra pickles. The fries are good (tell them to make them soft and grab some ranch dressing to dip them in) too"}
{"text":"Was in line to order when the front of the counter (Fabricated wood face) popped off and sliced my leg.  My entire upper shin area is bruised, blood ran down my leg at the point of impact.  No manager or owner present.  I sure hope this has been fixed, I am not the type to look for a law suit, however; they are lucky I was not required to go on \"light duty\" at work for this.  Please get your ordering counter, where your customers stand, fixed immediately!  The teenage employee stated \"this has happened before at the other end of the counter\"......Really? Liability people!!!!"}
{"text":"The French fries were extremely fresh and have the same flavor as McDonald's fries and were a little on the salty side. The burger was decent but nothing spectacular. The cashier was pretty friendly.  We feel that they should add what comes with the burger on the menu. They have the cheapest plastic ware but give you your food on really nice heavy plates; contradiction in itself. We wouldn't go out of our way to eat here but if we passed by we might stop."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, we went here today, best burgers in VEGAS!!!  I am very picky about burgers these were AWESOME!!  Juicy, lots of flavor and cheese!  They have anything you want to put on a burger, and will make it anyway you want.  I got the 1/3 cheeseburger combo, with fries, awesome!  My friend got the fried zucchini, huge portion, it was at least 5 inches and 10 spears..big ones no little chain ones!   You can also get 2-1 coupons at the Smiths around the corner.  This one was on the corner of Centennial and 5th.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"The food is still delicious as ever but the service has gone down. Its most likely due to being understaffed. Lots of people don't come here anymore. If more people came I'm sure they would be making more money to have better service. It will be sad to see this place go."}
{"text":"First time ever trying Wimpys. Hamburger and fries were very great. After that it was all bad. Their menu shows they have malts but they do not have malts. We got a chocolate shake instead and it tasted like it had cleaning solution in the shake it tasted so bad. When we took it inside to tell the girl about how bad it tasted, she said it had butter milk in it. I'm pretty sure buttermilk doesn't taste like cleaning solution. So my wife asked for a refund for the four dollar shake, and she said she couldn't give us a refund and we would have to call the owner. I guess we won't be worrying about the four dollars or ever coming back."}
{"text":"The service is fabulous and the pastrami burger delicious. My sweetie had the bacon cheeseburger with fries, also delicious.

Gonna try a pastrami sandwich next time!"}
{"text":"Went to Wimpys today for lunch. We had the pastrami sandwich, fries and a drink. Half of the sandwich was plenty for me and the fries were enough for 3 people to eat and very fresh and crispy.

The food was very good and the price was very reasonable. We will go again and try one of the burgers and maybe a chicken salad. Only complaint I have is there is no Wimpys
closer to us. This is the only location in Vegas. Please open another location or two!

BTW the service was fast."}
{"text":"Was excited to try something different but was quickly disappointed. 20 minutes in the drive thru. Ordered a hamburger and onion rings. The hamburger patty was a little on the cold side...tasted like it was frozen. Onion rings were very bland. Servers had hats but no hair nets on. I was grateful not to be like so many other reviewers that found hair in their food.  My advice:  pass on by and head to In-n-Out down the street."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast if you like big burritos! Not a bad price, big servings. Drive through is a tad slow but food is hot & tasty."}
{"text":"I had no prior knowledge of this place...the sign caught my eye. I am so happy I pulled in as the food was great. 

I had the 1/3 cheeseburger meal for $6. Good quality fresh ingredients. Fries were solid and served piping hot.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Date of Visit 11.23.13 Time 6:19pm. We ordered 2 burgers and 2 drinks. While waiting 25 minutes for our meal, we noticed a few things. The employee's take breaks out in the lobby where the customer's are. The older woman who has long, big hair, was not wearing a hat or hair net, while making burgers, or putting the meals in the bags or on the trays. They did not have their sign up from the Dept. Of Health. During this time, not one of the employee's washed their hands. Also, the pop machine was a hot mess, with not enough lids, ice everywhere on the counter and the floor. The should of had one employee clean that up every 15 minutes. We spent 9.92 and did not even wait for our order. After 27 minutes, we left. I wont go back. 
Read Corrie M's review. She is RIGHT ON."}
{"text":"Quite the hidden gem. Came here after looking up corn dogs because I had a hankering for fried greasy fare. My so came along and was pleased with their omelet, as he doesn't eat non kosher meat. Corn dog was a little above average, well fried but the zucchini fries were awesome. Not sure if they use store bought or mixed in house ranch, but it was good. The breakfast offerings are big (they easily feed a hungry man), yummy and pretty good. And cheap.

Definitely trying their burger next time I'm around."}
{"text":"Use to enjoy it but got a cold burger and hard patty... will not go back. Wasted my money and was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place cause I never had it until now, the burgers are awesome and the price is good specially when your hungry for more."}
{"text":"Soooo, I went through the drive through at like 6 and got my burger under 10 minutes. The pastrami Burger was good and the French fried are awesome. The service was Great too, very nice and polite. The only thing i think could have been better was the Burger buns, so much meat for such little bun, everything was falling out lol. Other than that small detail everything was great!"}
{"text":"We went to this place right after it opened and it was pretty good. Went another time and it was not so good. Maybe two years have passed and I gave it another try after reading the reviews. The order took 8 minutes in the drive thru, meat was rubbery and lacking flavor. They do put a ton of avocado on, at least 1/2, the pickle was good as well as the sauce but something is missing...flavor! a little S&P go a long way. the jury is still out on the bun! their sides are massive! she gave what felt like a pound of fries, pale and saltless too. I accidentally short stopped on the drive home and the bag tipped and dumped out 1/2 of them on the floor which was okay, just a few are enough, the dogs get the rest anyway!I get it, when it's slow it's hard to project. I wouldn't have minded so much if the food was worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place needs some improvement and I'm not gonna be too harsh on them since they are new and are probably still getting a hang of things.

When I first walked in, I was the only customer in line. There was a cashier and a manager (probably owner) at the register doing some cash handling/drawer type stuff for about a good 2 minutes it seemed without acknowledging my presence. I understand they were totally focused on doing their cash handling business but a quick \"Hello, we'll be with you in a moment\" would have been appreciated. It was NYE so I didn't get upset because I didn't want no tricks to be killin' my vibe. I just kinda let it go and browsed the menu while they counted their drawer. 

When they were finally done, the friendly cashier took my order and while I was getting my drink, I witnessed a gentleman pick up his to go order. The girl repeated his order and I heard him say \"it was supposed to be no tomatoes.\" And I just watched the girl just say \"oh, sorrry.\" There was a pause for a moment then she says \"your total comes to...\" The guy just payed and walked away figuring it's just a lost cause. Maybe he didn't want his vibe killed either and just didn't want to bother.

Upon selecting my table, I was defaulted to the least dirtiest one. The one that was closest to the bathroom that had a tinge of sewage smell mixed with air freshener. All the tables were dirty and the trash cans were full with trash hanging on the sides but none of the employees came out to clean until I was already done eating. And it was not busy, there was definitely some down time for someone to have checked the dining room. You got time to lean, you got time to clean.

Okay, now on to the good. I ordered the pastrami burger which came out super juicy and cooked just right. The pastrami slices were not too thick--which I hate. I prefer thinner cuts of pastrami when it's sitting on my burger and this was perfect for me. The juices were running down the wrapper and my forearm which to me is always a good thing. Get your extra napkins by the condiment station. I have to say it is the best pastrami burger I've had in Vegas.

The workers were all very friendly but they definitely need to improve on the cleanliness of the restaurant. I really do hope they stay around long because it will be my go to place for when I'm craving a thick juicy burger. I like the fact that it's also less than 5 minutes from my house. I don't really know if that's a good thing though . So bottom line 5 stars for the pastrami burger and 1 star for cleanliness of the restaurant. I hope that next time I visit these things will have improved because if not, it's definitely going to kill my vibe."}
{"text":"My first visit I waited 20 minutes in the drive tru only 4 cars ahead of me. Food was what I was expecting charbroiled burger that you can get in any corner in california. The food gets a 3.5 stars. Bacon avocado burger was good. Fries were OK. Pepsi fountain drink.

2nd visit after 4 minutes in the drive tru Window without a Hello or please wait... I reversed out. I called the manager and let him know why he was getting 2 stars. He mentioned making everything from scratch takes time and the crew is all new locals who obviously don't have drive tru experience. I don't mind waiting for good food. In fact I went to in n out which is down the street. 6 cars in front of me.. 9 minute wait. 
I might give this place a try again..but with so many options in the area... it's not going to be soon."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait when you get here. If you pick the Drive thru or going inside, the time until your food is ready is about the same. Mainly because the food is cooked after you order. The patties are a good size so be careful if you're thinking about ordering the double cheeseburger. Prices are reasonable if you BUNDLE! The staff is friendly. Overall this place is good and tasty. 3 stars because of the wait."}
{"text":"I should have known that the food wasn't going to be good after walking in and seeing a huge hand written sign outlying the refund policy. I don't think I've ever walked into a restaurant and seen anything as tacky as this.
I was in the area running some errands and was in the mood for a burger. I opened the Yelp app on my phone and Wimpy's came up on top. This fast-food restaurant is located in a desolate empty shopping mall so at least I didn't have a problem parking.  After getting a spot right in front, I walked inside.  The first thing I noticed, as I previously mentioned, a huge sign stating that there are no refunds, but exchanges only. The sign goes on to say that if you're still not happy with their resolution, you'll need to deal with the owner.  The girl behind the counter was friendly and helped take my order. She read back the order to me a few times to confirm accuracy. I thought that this was good for her to do that.  The restaurant was very clean. The bathroom was spotless.  Inside, the dining area, a television was tuned to Popeye cartoons. This brought back memories.  After waiting several minutes, my food was ready.  The portion size was very good.  Unfortunately, the hamburger was one of the worst that I've ever eaten. The beef was not juicy and tasted like it came from frozen and wasn't fresh. The burger tasted dryer than our Nevada desert.  I didn't want to say anything about the food because I was still trying to get my head around their refund/exchange policy. So I made do and did the best as I can to finish the burger.  The staff was friendly and thanked me for coming when I was leaving.  I have to admit that McDonald's burgers are much better. Sorry, but I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had and I have had many in different places. The fries also we're the best. Perfect crispness and seasoning. I didn't even need ketchup. Staff is great too."}
{"text":"i don't know how busy this place is, it didn't seem very busy, but it doesn't seem like the vegetables get used frequently. the food was delicious (we got a double bacon burger and an avocado burger) but the lettuce and onion seemed to be a little old. the food was warm and the fries were freshly made when we ordered, so i will be returning and hope the veggies are fresher because it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great solid burgers. I had the bacon cheeseburger again to make sure my first one wasn't a fluke. Buns nicely toasted, burger well done charred but still juicy. Crispy lettuce and a decent slice of tomato. Bacon was also on point.

Fucking shit was the wait long though. If you're in a hurry you probably wouldn't stop by here but for me the burger was worth the wait. You can taste that it was made to order. Their burgers and fries are nothing out of the ordinary but they are just really good burgers.

I'm indifferent about customer service and price is ok."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had hands down in the Valley.  Amazing food, pleasant service, the wait is the only reason it does not get 5 stars.  I did have to wait but as the food is made fresh and hot, also the Medium size is AMAZING.  The fries are AMAZING.

They speed up the service and next time I give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very good food! The ranch is perfect on everything. This place gives huge portions as well. My wife and I love it !"}
{"text":"Takes so long I turned off my emgine, damn how long does it take to make burger?  Well I'm a personal chef and I know it takes 6-8 minutes for a damn burger, this takes 30 mins.  Update on taste later"}
{"text":"Pastrami burger was delicious!!! Burger was a good size, fries were nice and crispy, loved the ranch. So glad we tried this place. The cashier was very nice and helpful with recommending this burger. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I love this place! These are the best burgers and fries and at the right price. I took the kids and my daughter got the steak sandwich and that was awesome too! Whenever I want a burger this is where I go, i really want to try some of the other food there because I think it'll be great too but when I walk in BAM I get a burger lol."}
{"text":"This is unreal. 29 minutes in the drive-thru!?!?! Are you kidding me? I don't care that I started this journey at 531pm,THATS DINNER TIME! I've received an entire MEAL from Farmer's Boys in less time-and the food was better.
I had the pastrami burger and my wife had the avocado burger, while our daughter had the chicken nuggets. 
We'll make this easy: Pastrami burger- NO seasoning on the burger-if there was, you would be able to tell since I had to take off my bacon because it was ALL fat, and there was NO cheese on either burger. If they don't come that way, then upon ordering you should say 'do you want cheese?'...although I have a hunch they just forgot the cheese. Either way, burger was bland as can be-the avocado on my wife's burger wasn't even ripe yet.
The chicken nuggets were bland, along with the 'seasoned fries'. ZERO seasoning- not even SALT!

All of this took place after we spent 11 minutes IN LINE, then the next 18min at the window waiting for our food.
18 minutes gives you PLENTY of time to look around and asses the store though...the floor was unbelievably disgusting, the lady at the window looked lost (at best). THERE WERE 2 GIRLS WANDERING AROUND BEHIND THE COUNTER. Yes, KIDS (8 and 10 years old if i was guessing)...running from one side of the store to the other-this is BEHIND THE COUNTER WHERE THE EMPLOYEES ARE. How unprofessional?! As if that wasn't bad enough...that coupled with the towers of napkins knocked over and the loose ketchup packets everywhere-then comes a guy...a larger man wearing a yellow hat and an apron-an apron which has a dirty ass white towel tucked into the front of it. He comes over and sits down, in what looks like a lawn chair, and GETS ON HIS PHONE. Im on one side of the window, he's on the other side of the drive-thru window...on the phone. Look. Even if there is nothing you can do, dont EVER sit-certainly not on your phone- in plain view of the customer. I can't believe he did that. If one of my employees did, he/she would be fired on the spot! In the middle of this massive rush-this was the decision you chose? EVEN if he was calling in 'support staff'- go to a freaking breakroom/area!

Argh. Well Wimpy, you may have decent numbers for today's business but i'll be surprised if even ONE single customer returns after the calamity we were all involved it tonight. 
LITERALLY one of the worst RESTAURANT (CERTAINLY takes the cake for 'fast' food) experiences of my life. 
Yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"1/20/2018  I recommend giving this place a try if you like freshly cooked burgers, fries, fried zucchini, steak sandwiches and many other reasonably priced items.  I like their 1/3 pound burger combo and sometimes I get the fried zucchini (which are really good) with it but it's hard to eat it all.    Wimpy's is up on Centennial on the south side of the road and is located just East of Commerce St.  It is at the east end of the Commerce Common Center and a little hard to see until you are right upon it.  I think you will enjoy there fresh food and the kids can watch the Popeye cartoons on the TV while you eat."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it has seemed to go downhill. Not only has the cleanliness been lacking, but for the 3rd consecutive time the bread has been hard as a rock, the fries have been over cooked & hard, & the order was wrong. We couldn't even eat it.The girl at the register could only say they don't give refunds. No problem. I won't give you my business either. How disappointing."}
{"text":"Enormous Pastrami Sandwich was incredibly excellent! Lean cut of pastrami sliced thin. Perfect! Make it a meal and you get a drink and a huge bag of French fries that are perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of crunch about 1/4 pound it seems! 
My husband had their 1/3 Cheeseburger... All I hear him saying is \"mmmmm!\" 
My daughter had their corn dog meal which she loves as well! 
Great personable service! The owner was working in the back today creating these great sandwiches. He told me they are opening their 2nd location in California next month! 
I will be recommending this place to my friends . Good Job Wimpys!"}
{"text":"Originally from CA where charbroiled burgers joints were all over the place - was craving one so bad! The first time we got it, it was decent. Went through drive-thru and it took nearly 20 minutes! 

Second time we ate in and it took just as long for our food to come. It looked pretty deserted, there was no one there when we arrived. One person came in to order out. There was only 1 person working everything..Im sure there should have been.. but I didn't even see a cook. The dining area was not clean, everything was sticky and \"smudgey.\" Husband ate steak sandwich and only took 1 bite - it was gross. Kids had chicken nuggets & fries which was mediocre at best. I had the bacon avocado cheeseburger with onion rings. Fresh veggies but the patty itself was flavorless, weirdly formed, didn't look like real meat..pretty gross. Onion rings were okay, pretty \"bread-y\".

Definitely not comparable to the charbroiled places in CA. Vegas needs more of those! Decent prices but will not come again.."}
{"text":"This place sucks slow service terrible food and their chili is almost as bad as tommys hamburgers. Got the avocado burger and chili cheese fries yuck ate 4 fries out of a tray of trash.  The burger I did eat the patty cheese and one of the buns but the rest my dog liked maybe they should start selling dog food instead she loved the rest of the burger, but I love my dog so I wouldn't even feed the chili fries to her. This is my second time here as the first time was better but far from great.  Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"It would only be fair that I update everyone about Wimpy's. Here is their new rating which they happily hung in public view I may add!!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite spots over the last few months. The service is always on point. They have a nice selection on the menu including burgers, chicken tenders, breakfast items, and my personal favorite.... the fried zucchini. They give large portion sizes for reasonable prices. 

It does take a little longer than other places to get an order, but its nothing objectionable and to me its definitely worth the wait. 

The restaurant itself always looks clean, organized, and well kept."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good.
I enjoyed it. My boyfriend was pretty happy about coming here.
The burgers was so good.
The only thing sucks is the thousand island dipping sauce cost 25cent and it's not even enough to dip all the fries in ..
But overall it's good .."}
{"text":"Food is great but the drive thru wait so freaking long, every damn time! There is one car in front of me and its been 10 minutes so far. Last time 
I waited 23 minutes. So frustrating!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been going back and I love this place. More ppl should come out. Have had the pastrami burger, avocado burger and bacon cheeseburger. All very good and their wait time at the drive thru has shortened considerably. Make the drive or stop by. Way better than InAndOut."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to this place.  It is by far the best burger I have ever had and that comparison includes the overpriced ones they sell on the strip.  I literally drive to the other side of town just to bite into this juicy avocado burger.  Their ranch is also spectacular.  They need to open more locations."}
{"text":"Showed up at 9:45pm and they said they were closed. Hours are listed as open until 10:00pm. The service is always slow...Food is alright but not worth the long wait."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and 40 percent of it. The 60 is customer service. While there food is great they seem to lack customer service. I've been there several times to give them the benefit of doubt yet there staff continues to be rude and snotty. I has ordered a sprite and the lady gave me what she wanted. She said all they has was some crappy knock off drink and didn't offer to replace it. I went through the drive through the third time and when I went to grab my change the guy pretty much threw it at my hand and dropped it on the floor. He looked at me and said oh my bad and just closed the window. To say the least the customer service is shitty and need better training."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect but was very impressed. Probably the one of the best burgers I have ever had! Everything is fresh and burger cooked perfectly! I really don't like hamburger pickles but these are made in house and are amazing! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, I'm from Cali and this reminds me of the many burger drive ins I grew up around.

The food is great with huge portions. Its very satisfying.
The service is so-so but I dont mind since the prices are pretty good for the amount of food you get.

Make sure you get extra sauce for your fries and ASK FOR NAPKINS :)"}
{"text":"Ate here about 2months ago for the first time and I was quite impressed food was good and cheap"}
{"text":"Slow but yummy! They cook everything to order so you have to have time to wait but its good fast food."}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed this shop before but I'm glad I waited. My prior impression was of a long wait for an average burger but after a few months, I'm starting to make this my go to spot. One would think with In-n-Out right within a short drive, that would be the go to place. But I've never been real fond of InNOut (stop). 

The reason that Wimpys is growing on me is the burger is distinctive,flavorful and filling. I'm still having flashbacks of yesterday's Pastrami Burger. Their fries are good too! The bag is so huge I'm convinced that it's impossible to eat the whole damned meal. I still need to try out other specialty items on the menu. 

I noticed that they now serve breakfast too. Not skimpy stuff but real hash browns, etc. 

I think if Wimpys learns to convey that their food is worth waiting for, they'd probably have more satisfied customers. If you remember the Wimpy in the cartoon, he wasn't going through the Drive-thru. This ain't McDonalds; bland and salted unhappy meals. Some things are worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick lunch online it says 10 am but apparently not ! They aren't open till 11:00 they have great food but would've liked to have correct hours"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start......... My milkshake tasted like water so, I asked for a refund instead dude gives me a large dr. pepper and that tasted like seltzer water. When I got home I realized they gave me someone else's food, but they ordered the same thing I did there was just some other kind of burger in the bag. My fries were hard and the cheesecake had to be days old because that was hard as well. I tried to call to let the manager know, but no one answered. Now, I will say this, THE BACON CHEESEBURGER IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Everything else was a bust and I'm disappointed about that. I wanted my burger, milkshake, & fries!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is horrible. There is no excuse to be stuck in a drive through for almost 20 min. When we finally get to the window to pay we ask how much longer until our food is done and she tells us it's ready. Nope still waiting for my food."}
{"text":"Got an order of two pastrami burger combos, one pastrami burger solo and a pastrami sandwich with zucchini fries. Everyone loved the zucchini fries and no complaints on the thick cut fries. The burger was a good size, The pastrami on the burger was not as strong tasting as the  pastrami on the sandwich and the burger meat could have used a dash of seasoning.
 The pastrami sandwich was very delicious and worth the price. Definetly want/need to try this place again."}
{"text":"They a decent pastrami sandwich. My kids love the Chicken nuggets. Large portion of onion rings just need a little salt."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places for a killer burger! My brother and I had the Double Bacon Burgers and they were heaven on a bun! They give you a healthy portion of french fries nice hot & crispy. Fountain drinks with refills as well as iced teas. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this location about 15 times in 2 years and i keep trying to give them a chance because they are newer and there are not many options in this ares but they always let me down. If you want to keep you food down don't go inside the store is not kept up well use the drive through but be prepared to wait.  Poor customer service.The food is ok if by chance they happen to get your order correct"}
{"text":"Pretty good pastrami burger. Just the right smoky flavor.  Place is very clean and service is great. The prices are just right for a neighborhood burger joint. Will be back"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting how close Wimpy's is to my place and was in need of delicious, greasy, decently priced food. Wimpy's definitely give you more for your buck.

I only have it 4 stars because it's not the best but it's good enough for me. 

It's a little hole in the wall joint where it's made to order cause you definitely have to wait. So be patient it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Bacon cheeseburger all the way! The patties are nice and thick and juicy, and the bacon is good and crispy and bacon-y. 

Haven't been through the drive-thru. Try getting out of your car and going inside to eat. There are other condiments available inside as well. Mmmmm.

Anyway, seems pretty clean. Prices are fair. Fries are nice and crispy, drinks are large."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPARE!
The service here is slow. Extremely slow. Waited in the drive thru from 4:15pm-4:40pm. There is no way to exit the line. Once you pull up, if there are cars ahead of you, you're trapped. The food is mediocre at best. Definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is great price is decent but they take foreverrrrr.
They no longer serve the Gyro...sadness falls upon me."}
{"text":"I got the pastrami burger here and it was amazing! This is one of the best fast food burgers in the neighborhood. The wait was a little long, but everything from the fries and fried zucchini (which tastes like it's breaded in the restaurant) to the burgers my girlfriend and I got were hot off the grill and fresh out of the frier. I hope this place gets the business it deserves so it can expand and be around a while!"}
{"text":"Great service, food was good, a lot of food for your money.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something other than a large chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This was not my first visit, I believe in supporting small buisness. However, I went there today and this time ordered breakfast.  It was aweful. Toast tasted like cardboard and the sausage had a funny taste to it. 

I will not be going back, particularly not for breakfast."}
{"text":"The high chair was disgusting and dirty. The place was empty. Wait time average. Decent burger and fries. Fried zucchini were good. Overall, not bad but not the best!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Everything was very fresh tasting, so don't expect to be in and out in a flash. I was sad that they didn't have ice cream for the milkshakes, but maybe next time. 
So, the staff was nice. I would say that I'm not a fan of hearing about staff personal lives, that was a little annoying. 
Not sure what it was, but there was also a \"sewer-like\" odor when we first walked in. The staff apparently couldn't smell it and another customer also noticed it. The explanation was \"I don't smell it, but it's probably just this area\". Yeah, no...it's only inside the store. 
We will probably go again...you can't go wrong with good burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I came here after I heard my coworker rave about the burgers and the price. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the bacon burger. My sandwich was amazing- the chicken was nicely grilled, fresh lettuce and tomato, buns are different than run of the mill places! The burger was tasty too - I only had a bite of my husbands burger. The price for the size is amazing - my sandwich was like 10 inches for 4.99. You can't get chicken sandwiches at in and out(other people compared this place to in and out). 
Also this is a family owned and operated business which is rare in vegas and I love to support that! Check out the desserts they are home made by the owners. I will defiantly be returning to try many more items on the menu. Try this place out !"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best burger joint in town. If you're near the In N Out on North 5th, do yourself a favor and continue to Wimpys. The burgers are tastier and you won't leave hungry. 
I read some of the reviews about slow service. I haven't experienced that but the place is fairly new. They're going to have a few hiccups. 
Finally, if you're a hipster looking for a trendy stop this isn't it. If you're a family, a burger fan or a hungry working man this place is for you."}
{"text":"Very slow service. And they need a better drive through speaker system. It's very hard to hear them on there."}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad reviews, if I have nothing good to say it's best to keep my opinion to myself, but half an hour sitting in a drive through for a cheeseburger is beyond too long. At a certain point I started honking my horn, all I wanted was a refund so I could leave, but was ignored. The cashier never even bothered to check on me until she handed me my food.
The thing is, the food was good. I enjoyed it, particularly the chicken nuggets, they were so savory and flavorful I didn't bother with the dipping sauce. But the wait time, being ignored for so long you resort to honking and even that being ignored...I won't be back."}
{"text":"Never heard of Wimpy's before as back at home in Hawai'i we didn't have any. I ordered the gyro & a 1/3lb cheeseburger meal. I loved my burger. It was fresh and juicy (how a burger should be) but OMG THE GYRO IS AMAZEBALLS!!! I had my uncle go back the next day to order me another lol. Also the gyro was too good I didn't get a chance to take a pic of it."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Friendly people & fast service.  Food is always fresh!!! It's pretty hidden in the shipping Center though.  The 2 dbl chz burgers,  2 drinks and 2 french fries deal for $8 is a steal."}
{"text":"Food was ok. A bit pricey for what you good.  Don't get me wrong the amount is decent size. I think if they lower price maybe a dollar less and did more promotional coupons or something to get there name out there more. Only reason I k ew of it was bc I passed by once."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the north side of Vegas and are in the mood for a good burger, I recommend Wimpys! Good size  Burgers with really good fries. I actually come sometimes just for the fries. It's not a gourmet, or the highest quality but just a good old fashioned burger!"}
{"text":"Good food, but they take way too long. Went for the first time today and waited 15 minutes in the drive thru just for a cheeseburger..."}
{"text":"The food was AWFUL!!! Burger bun was STALE. Burger party was hard and cold!!! Straight nasty"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Best pastrami I've had in a long time. It was not dripping in fat and was good quality. Huge portions with great flavor. It was about a 10 minute wait for the food but it was worth the wait because everything was fresh and made when I ordered."}
{"text":"I'm not one to right reviews especially bad ones. But I never had bad customer service like this in a long time. The employee Kevin was rude and unprofessional. He was rushing us out and had a attitude. Every time customer came in he was shaking his head. They only had 2 people working. Kevin and the cook. The hamburger and onions were really bad. I went there support my local neighborhood business. Unfortunately I cannot recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Prior to moving to NAFB we lived in close proximity to Wimpy's. We were huge fans of the restaurant as well, the burgers were fresh, the fries were amazing, and the service was great.

Recently we visited because my husband really wanted their pastrami burger.. We were so disappointed. Their ingredients are no longer fresh, the burger was like a McDonald's pre cooked patty, the bun was stale, and the people working there were miserable and rude. 

The fries were still good, but hate to say it -- y'all lost our business."}
{"text":"Good burger joint with fresh beef. You get more for your buck as well. I love all the picture frames of Popeye in the restaurant. 

You should really give it a try."}
{"text":"1st visit. Hamburger was good. That's the only thing that was good. Malts are on the menu but when we ordered we were advised they no longer have malts so we ordered a chocolate shake. My husband and I each took a sip and it was awful! Really horrible like something was wrong. Tasted like chemicals or cleaning solution. When I went to ask for the manager the teenager behind the counter to,d me there is no manager. She said she cannot do refunds. She said the owner won't be in until 4:00. I called the owner but there was no answer."}
{"text":"I had the wimpy's breakfast burrito and have to say that this is by far the best breakfast burrito I have had in Las Vegas. This place is good and I will be coming back for sure. Plus the price is not too expensive. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Decided to give this burger joint a shot after driving by so many times. Immediate reaction was the prices of the food on the menu, very affordable. I went through the drive through, it was a little wait but I don't mind if it takes the time to grill and cook my food. Took the food home and upon unwrapping I was surprised. 

The fries were a golden crisp, the kind you see when the fries are cooked to perfection. The burger looked juicy with an attractive size to compliment it's fresh toppings. I also ordered onion rings, which didn't look too appealing but the taste is unforgettable. The rings were delicious with an interesting sweet taste to delight the taste buds. The fries were fresh and didn't taste like they were drowned in oil, perfect fullness with enough crunch for your munch. The first bite into the burger left me speechless until the 3rd or 4th bite. It was definitely a game changer compared to other burger joints I've been to. Everything about Wimpy's I enjoyed and would recommend to anyone and I'll definitely be going back. I got the avocado burger and was surprised and satisfied not only by the quality of the food, but the value you get by making this a dinner choice when eating out. Don't be a \"wimp\", Get Wimpy's and be happy!"}
{"text":"I got the pastrami burger which was absolutely delicious! The pastrami was a great addition to their thick cut patty. They served thick cut fries which I don't usually like because I like my fries crispy, but these fries were amazing! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Very good meal! Also the service was great! The establishment was very clean. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Jeez....I really wanted to like this place. For those of you whom read the first few sentences to determine if a place is worthy, here's my three word recap: A big disappointment. There, I said it. 
I pulled up to the drive thru at about 8:00 tonight (12/22/15). After feeling like I was singing Hello by Adele (I must've said it seven or eight times), I finally heard a human voice reply. The reply was \"Sorry, just a minute\", followed by about 2 more minutes of silence. 
This gave me plenty of time to peruse the menu. It was at this point that my OCD kicked in a bit, as there were several misspellings on the menu. 
When the voice came back, I was ready. I ordered the Pastrami Burger Combo. I pulled around the corner, to find one car ahead of me. Once again, the wait was long....the car ahead of me was there for about five minutes. I pulled to the window, and waited. After about 5 more minutes, I paid. I got my order and away I went. 
Pulling back out onto Centennial, heading back to work with my food loot, I could control my hunger no longer. I reached into the bag and made contact. The first thing I touched was lukewarm and soggy. It was a French Fry. Still, my hunger pangs overrode this. I ate the soggy fry. Maybe it was a fluke. I again reached into the bag. Disappointment began to replace the hunger pangs. I ate several more fries, but to no avail, they never got better. 
I arrived back at work after a quick five minute drive. I rushed in, and sat at my desk. I reached into the bag to find that the fries weren't the only lukewarm item in the bag. The burger. The poor poor burger. Why would anyone do this to a cow?? Why would they be so abusive? The patty looked to be about as dry as the Sahara. The reviews I read of Pastrami being piled onto this burger must've been penned by someone working for The Enquirer. It was all lies!! There was hardly any Pastrami on my burger. You'll be happy to know that the Pastrami was competing with the burger patty over which one of them my mouth would find more dry. My tongue and throat called it a tie.
Sadly Wimpy, I would've rather not have paid today for the hamburger they served me. Matter of fact, I wouldn't pay any other day of the week either. 
Wimpy, you broke my burger heart. 
Back to spinach for me...with a side of olive oil."}
{"text":"So in my last review I said I would stick to In N Out but my wife wanted fried zucchini strips and I gave in to a burger. Here was my return experience.

Interior: I intended on using the drive thru but it was closed so inside I go. It looked like your average fast food place with a bunch of seating and it had a lot of cartoon artwork on the walls.

Food: I tried the avocado burger tonight and it was delicious. They were not shy with the amount of avocado and it had thousand island dressing on it. I'm extremely sad to say this but I enjoyed it more than In N Out. :( They gave me skinny fries tonight instead of the ones from last time, I don't know if you can order different varieties or if certain meals come with different fries. Either way the whole meal was good and better than my initial impression.

Staff: The service was also better tonight and the staff seemed to be in a better mood. I would be happy if I was getting out of work in an hour also.

I will be coming back for the avocado burger soon. You now have a loyal customer."}
{"text":"A very simple restaurant that opened in November, 2013. The burgers were very good (cheesy!), and fries were, too. The one blue-haired girl working behind the counter is not the friendliest, but she knows her job, and did not need assistance with running the front register AND drive-through. In fact, I didn't see any other employees in the store on a Saturday afternoon. I figure there must be a cook in the back (I say cook, singular, because it took twenty minutes to get our food), but they were never seen from the front lobby. No website, or even a Facebook page, that I could find. Bottom line is, the food is good, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and even better for the prices!!! This place is quick but serves delicious American style food. Love coming here for any meal!"}
{"text":"I normally love this place. However I came tonight because the website says it closes at 10 and they were already closed... please update your website or don't close early..."}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business? The food is just ok. The workers tend to be rude cause it seems like they don't care. The owner is cheap. Now charges for a few yellow peppers.! Will not go back."}
{"text":"deliriously delicious and worth the wait because they're making it fresh. best burger place in vegas, i drive across town just for their avocado burger"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. The kids really liked the food. Great customer service!. The Popeyes theme was fun."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Food was 5/10 at best. Atmosphere sucked...bugs crawling on the floor, walls looked like kindergarteners just got done finger painting on the walls, none of the tables had been wiped down, lighting n the girls bathroom was out n the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned n a couple days. 
This was my first time at Wimpy's and I will NOT be coming back again."}
{"text":"My so. Wanted a pastrami burger so I decided to drive here since it's just down the street. Biggest mistake ever!!!! I went through the drive thru and I think there is only one person working here. I ordered a pastrami burger meal. This pastrami looks horrible...I can't even tell if it is pastrami. I also got a chicken finger meal. I asked if I could replace the fries with onion rings and was told yes, no problem. When I got my receipt I was charged an extra $1.50 for the swap...thanks for the heads up. My chicken fingers also look horrible.

Never coming back here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and there was not a single person in drive thru or inside besides the few staff. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and had to ask the drive thru person if they got my order as the drive thru was silent after he greeted me. I drove up and waited 14 minutes for my order to be ready. The burger was simply tasteless when compared to other fast food chains.. I did enjoy the buns but they are just a artisan style bun. The worst part besides the service and lack of communication while sitting next to a drive thru window for almost 15 minutes was the meat... super plain and reminded me of the cheap school burgers from my school days long ago. It was rubbery and lacked a good burger flavor.. almost reminded me of a boiled burger... if that's even a thing. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone that has even the slightest burger options."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try this place out.  We went through the drive-thru.  He order a avocado burger w/ cheese & bacon.  It took awhile to get through the drive-thru (service kind of slow).  Then once we got to the window you can smell the funk coming from inside the place.  Omg it smelled horrible!  I have heard of it being a funky smell inside but man I never was prepared for that type of smell. (That was the main reason why I personally didn't want any food from there). So we received his food and there was no cheese on his burger. He gave them the burger back and then they told us to pull around to the front so they can remake the burger. Why they have to remake the burger and just put cheese on it not too sure.  And why we had to pull up to the front when there no vehicles in the drive-thru not too sure about that one either.  Anywho the food was pretty good.. I tried some of my husbands food. He said he liked it as well but this place isn't worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"I drive by Wimpys on my way to work. I had noticed the sign before they opened and thought, \"can't wait until they open\". Well finally after driving home one day I see their drive thru has cars in it. So last night since my girl friend and I needed some food in a hurry so we could get some relatives to the airport we decided to try Wimpys.

I had the bacon cheeseburger and my girlfriend had the avocado burger. Mine had a juicy burger and good sized pieces of bacon. My girlfriend said there was plenty of avocado in hers. The fries tasted very good. The only sad thing was it seemed they didn't have their dessert stuff. I can understand since they are new and probably aren't sure of how much to supply without running out. I am sure within the coming months they'll get better.

We did the drive-thru and it honestly it wasn't that bad. It seemed to be the same wait time as In-N-Out with 2 cars ahead of us. As the staff and management get used to the demands I think the kinks will get worked out. I'm all for supporting new places.

The food was good and service was good for me. I give 4 stars! I will keep optimistic and hopefully this place does well. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I always have amazing service 
My food is always hot and juicy 
The only bad thing is theres one location and its so far from me"}
{"text":"Ugh, do I have to add a star? 
There were two vehicles infront of me. All I ordered were two fries and a medium drink about 330 in the afternoon. It was my first time here and decided to go through the drive-thru after picking my kids up from school and before we head to the grocery store. Any parent knows you need a calming agent before you take these gremlins anywhere....especially after a long day out to begin with. Lol.

Okay, so...there were only two vehicles infront of me. Please tell me why MY wait was already going on 26 minutes. Now one vehicle ahead of me...please tell me why that was another 10 minutes. No one came behind me so I reversed the heck out of that drive-thru lane before 36 minutes turned into 37mins. Yes, nearly 40mins in a drive-thru. Mind boggling. I was contemplating doing it 20mins earlier but thought I'd try to be patient enough. Pretty patient I'd say especially as a toddler is whining most the time.

The whole time I was waiting in the drive-thru, it felt like one of those waits when after ordering, you wait and wait and wait...and you start to feel like you've been forgotten. Why? Because after all that waiting...never ONCE did I see an employee open the window and perhaps apologize for the wait or touchbase on some kind of status. The ONLY time I saw that window open was when they FINALLY handed the food over to the first car in my two-car -infront-of-me-position. 

Never...ever...ever...ever...
ever...ever...will return. EVER.

In fairness, when they first opened...we wanted to try it out so we pulled into the drivethru. Same story except we were the ONLY vehicle in the drive thru. Awkward. We were so turned off to even wait a minute longer so we drove off. I'm all about second chances. Don't do thirds. Don't care how good of a burger or sandwich they have to offer."}
{"text":"Drove up to the drive thru window and had to drive off because no one answered the box, despite the opening time. Upon leaving the drive thru and employee came out to let us know they are open. We drove around again and ordered the avocado burger meal and then was offered a cheeseburger for $1. The food is delicious. Took about 3-5 mins to receive our food. Large portion and CHEAP. I spent $8 and some change for enough food for me and my wife. The downfall is the appearance of the restaurant, it looks closed and there was hand written prices and items on the menu. Almost looks abandoned. Otherwise, the food and prices were great! 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I love their bacon cheeseburger. Big juicy meat with thick bacon and all the trimmings. And love the fried zucchini.  Yummy!  And not too bad on the pockets. My husband gets the pastrami burger and it's awesome. Filled with lots of yummy pastrami. Quite little place with cool whimpy cartoons on the wall. Love this little burger stand."}
{"text":"Came here with low expectations based on the overall reviews, but I must say I was very happy.

Came through at 8:30pm.  We were the only car and waited 20 minutes in the drive-thru.  The plus is the food was fresh and hot.

As for the food...I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, which I found to be very good.  Didn't beat In-N-Out, but I did find it more enjoyable than Five Guys.

The rest of the family has the \"shicken\" strips.  The were seasoned nicely, and decent size.  Everyone was happy.

The sides...fries were good; and while the onion rings were legit, the weren't seasoned enough.  I'd stick with just the fries next time.

Finally, the kids had milkshakes.  The plus is that they were real milkshakes.  Unfortunately, they were too milky & short on flavor.

$30 for a family of 4, including the milkshakes.  More than I'd like to spend for a quick dinner after baseball practice, but we all felt the food was good and everyone was full.  We'll certainly be back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"There burger patties are huge, but very processed and very dry. I believe this place was charging more than it was worth."}
{"text":"So thought I would give Wimpy's a try with the family... The drive-thru was extremely slow. But that was the best part of my experience.. I ordered 3 burgers and two of them were made correctly. Still not a bad thing! As we began to eat the burgers my wife and I noticed our burgers were undercooked and was able to microwave it and eat it. My sons burger on the other hand was red and cold... even after microwaving it, it still wasn't done. Leading us to think it might be frozen... By this time wasn't feeling the love. The fries were ok after they began to cool down it tasted like oil (as if the fry oil wasn't hot enough and the fries just soaked up the oil)  Needless to say most of our food went into the trash...

Ohh yeah and I forgot about my drinks.. none were marked and they weren't even full...

While in the drive through I noticed two younger children in the kitchen and many employees wearing hats but not hair nets.. One girl constantly removed her hat and her hair was all over the place... No one had their hair pulled back and out of the way. It looked scary, should have trusted my gut when I saw this and left....

The owner needs to change a lot before they go out of business!"}
{"text":"No signage on storefront, dirty greasy smudgy front glass door. Dirty bathrooms. Food was meh."}
{"text":"Well, I'm sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed. When I saw the Wimpy's sign, I was initially excited thinking another Cali Company comes to Vegas! I went to the drive-thru looking for the Chili-Cheese Burger only to find out it didn't exist, but when I got to the window, the guy said it was part of their \"Secret Menu.\" So, he let me change my order. Unfortunately, when I received the burger, it wasn't anything like their Cali version of the burger. It was overcooked, extremely dry with barely any chili and I believe they forgot the cheese as there was no sign of it. The bottom bun was burnt and hard with the top bun being soggy. Quite a disappointment to say the least. The other items the guy mentioned being on their so-called \"Secret Menu\" included: BLT; Philly Cheesesteak; Chili-Cheese Fries; & for Breakfast, French Toast."}
{"text":"Drive through is a joke. Go inside. I waited 30 min to order and get my food.it was such a joke. Management needs to hire more people and update the menus instead of just writing it in. This place is poorly ran and I'm sure the staff is way over worked as maybe one person works the drive through."}
{"text":"I waited in the drive through for 30 minutes, had the order repeated back to me three times only to have my order be incorrect when I got home. There was only one person working servicing the drive through, cooking and assisting walk-in customers! That is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I didnt like it primarily because the service was not good. They forgot out fries and the cook didnt even care, he just walked outside to take his break. The burgers needed salt but the toppings were really good, we got the bacon cheeseburger. We also got a strawberry milkshake, it was also really good but i didnt like that it was served in the same container as a soft drink. For dine in, something out of glass or metal would have been more appropriate. The prixe was also a little much for what we got. Overall, i'd rather go to a bar and have a burger, sorry!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Better than MCD and BK, but not I&O. Cheap. I found that the junior was better than the patty and bun on the regular."}
{"text":"I wanna start by saying they have some of the best burgers on the north side. Great all around considering price, taste, and amount of food you get. HOWEVER, I frequent this place and seriously EVERYTIME, AND I MEAN EVERYTIME, I wait in the drive through minimum 20 min. And that's if there is no other customers ahead of me. I really wish they would step it up I'm positive they would get so much more business."}
{"text":"Good burgers and the service is decent. Been here twice. We've only tried the Dbl Bacon Cheeseburger and fries and it was pretty good. Not many employees but the ones we've had were friendly, hot as hell in there (seriously put the ac down it was 108 today and it was just as hot inside) , not super clean but totally worth a try."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but I am giving them one star. Food is good, but the service is terrible. Took my 5 yr old there today after school as likes the fries and watching Popeye on their tv. Ordered food at 1120am, there was 3 other customers there. 30 min later, no food, kid is pissed and girl keeps telling me it is coming. Finally I go to counter and tell her if it is not ready I need to leave as my kid is hungry and getting upset. Some old man comes out front and tells me they lost my ticket. WTF!! I am sitting right in front of the counter and there is only 2 other tables there. I had asked about my food twice in the past 10 min also. When were they going to tell me they lost my ticket? I tell them forget it and just refund me. He gets angry and storms off to the back, comes back and throws a small brown bag on the table and says take it, I don't want it. I am guessing he is the owner or manager, but he needs to get out of the business as he was extremely hostile to me and my 5 year old! I just left as quickly as possible before he got violent or something. I was worried about my son!! Not sure what they gave me, but it wasn't even close to what I ordered. I just threw it away as I was not sure what that angry old man did to it before he threw it at us. Won't ever be back!!! Get out of the business if you can't take care of your guests. Sad because the food is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Close to the house, great food at an even better price. Key words- USED TO. 

Went here recently with my girlfriend. Ordered a couple avocado cheeseburgers with fries and shakes. Asked if they could make half strawberry/ half chocolate or half chocolate/ half vanilla. Got told no. No big deal. Just ordered a strawberry and chocolate instead. 

This is where the review takes a much more negative turn. The chocolate shake tasted old.  Like really old. Like it was made yesterday, put back in the freezer, taken out to defrost for the day and served to us. Absolute trash complete with ice chips inside. Possibly a health violation waiting to happen. Literally, the worst shake I've ever tried. Gave it back to the very rude female taking our order and asked if we could get a strawberry shake instead.

Strawberry? Nothing amiss. Just a regular shake. Moving on. Got our order 30 minutes later after waiting in the drive thru. At least the  \"made fresh to order\" feeling was there until we got home. The fries were absolutely disgusting. They tasted like shit. I'm not picky about food at all but damn. Think Gordon Ramsey Kitchen Nightmare style. The burger patty was also burnt and not even worth eating.  I haven't thrown a meal the garbage so fast. I'll never eat here again and recommend you go dumpster diving before coming here. 

What's the point of running a restaurant if you hate your job? Seriously, I hope this place closes down."}
{"text":"My husband got the pastrami burger and I the avocado burger, both very delicious. The place looks pretty dirty though. We Also got the chili cheese fries and the forks given were very dirty and had some sort of grease residue stains on them.."}
{"text":"Average burger joint. Good value in a cheeseburger/fries and drink. Pastrami is decent but a little too greasy for me."}
{"text":"Horrible! Came here on my lunch break and had to wait over 10 minutes when there was only three cars in the drive thru (me being the 3rd car) after I finally get to the window the cashier takes my money and walks away for about 5 minutes... once I get my food I drive to the parking area to check my order. I picked up my drink, soda went everywhere because she filled the cup up way too much and my chicken strips were damn near burnt! I spoke with the manager who says \"I can give you a new cup\" A NEW CUP?!!!! I asked for my money back and offered to give the food back (untouched) and he says \"we're aren't going to do that\" horrible service, horrible \"manager\", just a horrible fast food restaurant. Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"One Star: good service. The girl working the counter was nice and knowledgeable. She knew what came on each sandwich and gave me options on the cheeses.

One Star: meat quality. The burgers were juicy and the pastrami was tasty. Chicken sandwich was also good, not over cooked. 

-One Star: bread quality. Of the four sandwiches we ordered, all of the bread was soggy. 

-One Star: ordered well done fries. They were barely cooked. And VERY salty.

-One Star: the wait time. Went inside since there was no one there. But still seemed to take awhile."}
{"text":"Every time I go I get the 3/4 cheeseburger. I must say I'm not a huge  fan of burgers but when I do want one I stop by at Wimpy's. Their cheeseburgers are great!"}
