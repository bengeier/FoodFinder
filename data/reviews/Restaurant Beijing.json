{"text":"Blegh. 

How do I even begin. While good customer service shouldn't be expected in Chinese restaurants, I don't expect aggressiveness.

After hearing so many great reviews for peking duck, I expected nothing less; however what we were served was in the pits of what we expected. First, for $34 dollars, it comes with a whole duck, 8 pancakes and what looked like a random vegetable satay with pieces of duck thrown in. 

I found it very odd that the waiter came out with whole duck sitting on the plate and immediately turned around and went back to the kitchen. 5 minutes later, the duck is \"cut\", and plated on top of extremely stale and greasy shrimp chips. 

The duck skin was scorched black and there were barely any meat. This led us to question if they really gave us the whole duck, and exactly how old the duck was. Judging by its skin, it looked like it was ready to thrown out anyway. We were surprised they would have the gall to serve this. 

The picked radish and carrots looked  like it had been cut by a 3 year old--uneven, chucky, hideous slices that had discoloured tips. 

When we complained about the duck, the waiter had a smug look on his face and said, \"Oh, you want shrimp chips? No problem, we'll bring you more\". Are you kidding? NO THANK YOU.

We left the restaurant happy to not have supported such a terrible establishment."}
{"text":"So we ended up in Montreal Chinatown from Old Town cos the restaurants there felt too much like tourist traps and the restaurant we really wanted to try was booked solid.

It was late and there were a few restaurants still opened.  The streets were very quiet.  We went into the restaurant next door to Beijing Restaurant Inc but RAN OUT as soon as we saw their LUMINOUS sweet and sour chicken!  You probably could use it to illuminate your way out of a coal mine with that!!!!!!!  Was not too keen on Beijing Restaurant cos I am not a fan of northern chinese food (think thick doughy chewy dumplings!)- but then I was tired and hungry and I really did not want to walk around looking for food.  So it was off to Beijing next door.

Think the restaurant was named \"Beijing\" to sound Chinese but the food is more cantonese hong kong type cooking - nothing to do with northern chinese cooking or Beijing for that matter.  The owner spoke cantonese too.  So it was a good thing we walked in.

The food was excellent.  The portions were also huge so you are better off ordering just one dish per person for 2 or even share 2 dishes amongst 3.  Plenty!  The beef dish was tender and had that cooked over a high flame taste.  Yummy.  The fried shashimo with salt and peppers was delicious!  The congee was smooth and comforting as well.  Yum!  The free dessert of cut orange slices was a good end to a terrific meal.

The decor is simple but the place gets kinda crowded and you may be asked to share one of the bigger tables.  Was there late at round midnight and they were still doing a brisk business.  Great tip - they are opened till 3 am!  It seems like a lot of people come in for late night supper takeaways too.

Quality is excellent quality and the prices are reasonable for the quantity as well."}
{"text":"Great hot 'n sour soup! They also offer general tao tofu which is pretty damn good. The noodles are just ok."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US with mom and dined here on 23 June. We're Chinese and have very high expectations of Chinese food. The food exceeded our expectations, especially my mom's, which is rare. She complimented the owner repeatedly for having food that isn't greasy, heavy on sauces, or too salty, things we're used to seeing in American Chinese food. I strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very good chinese food. The dumplings in peanut sauce were unusual and tasty. Mu shu pork was delicious. Egg rolls only fair, skip them.  Open very late, a big plus."}
{"text":"We visited Beijing on a Thursday night around 6:45 and only waited about 5 minutes to be seated, though the line grew quickly. Just FYI, you order by writing down the number of the dish you want on a piece of paper they place at your table and it seems like your waiter won't come by to take your drink order until you do so.

Food: Delicious. Some of the best Chinese I've had.
Hot and Sour Soup: This was the only disappointment. It was overly thick and lacked flavor.
Soft Shell Crab with Pepper: Perfectly cooked and delicious.
Egg Roll: The best egg roll that I've ever had. Crispy with fantastic fillings. The homemade sweet and sour sauce is wonderful.
Dumplings with Peanut Sauce: These were very delicate, though the peanut sauce was a bit heavy and lacked the flavor of Thai peanut sauces.
General Tao Tofu: Cubes of fresh tofu surrounded by an amazing golden, deep fried dough and a tasty sauce.
Szechuan Fish: This was not what I was expecting, but was still great. Lightly breaded but fresh fish in a sweet and spicy sauce with crispy green pepper and onion. Normally I think green pepper is a waste of time, but this balanced the sweetness of the sauce and the dough nicely.

Service: Fine. Friendly and prompt, though my fiance did have to order his beer twice.

Ambiance: Lively (in a good way) but otherwise average."}
{"text":"I always go to this place when I'm in Montreal! Very good dishes (My favourite is the fried rice.), very reasonably priced and good service. I even like their tea! Oh, and very large portion too! 
This place is open till very late, but usually very busy, so it might be good to order TO GO. We can even order in the phone too. 
Lastly, it's just 2 minute walk from Place-des-Arts metro station"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to eat Peking roast duck and we went there. Honestly I am not a big fan of most  Chinese food in Montreal. This one is amongst one of the bad choices. The roast duck was not too bad and it is considered as 50% good as genuine Peking duck if you have tried the real one in Beijing. We ordered the fried noodle with seafood topping. The topping was too hard to bite and I found a human hair under the topping. No smile on the owner looking couples' faces too. I ended up paying 75 dollars for just two dishes, one roast duck and one fried noodle including 13% tips. I would not recommend this to my friends as I think it is a \"tourist trap\"."}
{"text":"Excellent food, price and service.

Try taking several dishes and share with everyone at your table! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better restaurants in Chinatown as long as you go there at night.  

I don't even think there is a chef there at lunch time. I would guess it's manufactured food reheated.  It may be cheap but I stay away.

At night however, the chefs are in and there are some definite gems on the menu.  Although I've been there over a dozen times I don't think I've sampled a tenth of their offerings.

My favorites are anything in black bean sauce as well as their crab in ginger and shallot sauce (they bring you the live crab to approve before preparing it).  Their salt and pepper shrimps are also good but the ones at Hot and Spicy (see review) are better.

It is a small place and tables are small and very close together, except for the 2 large round tables that can accommodate groups of up to 12.

The owner and host always seems to remember you even if you came only once before.  Also on the nights where it's very busy, he will tell you how long the wait and remember you, without taking your name down, when you come back after walking around in Chinatown.

Service is fast, efficient and polite.  When the restaurant is very busy, they will however remove your finished plates and give you the check quickly."}
{"text":"OMG! This is the most awful restaurant in China town! Food tastes bad, service is not better than the food... nothing else to say. I will never come to this place again!! ????????? ????????? ????? ????????????????? ??????"}
{"text":"Quick, good authentic Chinese food. The place could use redecorating but otherwise great affordable food."}
{"text":"Cuisine fade au possible, sortie du congélateur... Service exécrable... Oui c'est pas cher, mais ça ne vaut pas plus. Je vous recommande de passer votre chemin."}
{"text":"Been going for years and unfortunately been going down hill rapidly.

The food is passable, service borders on rude but what has put the final nail in the coffin is the filth of the place!

The carpets and seat covers are horrifically stained that is just plain disgusting. The bathroom is beyond reasonable standards if hygiene.

This makes me believe if the owners can't be bothered to clean up the place, I should take my business to the many other local restaurants.

There is plenty of choice in the area for Chinese food, don't waste your dollars in this place."}
{"text":"Let's make this point form. I'm from Vancouver raised on cantonese food.

Flavor was on point all dishes, nothing to critique.

But here was my issue with the dishes:

Our winter Melon soup came with winter melon seriously under cooked.

Our Yeung chow fried rice wasn't using day old rice and pees were rock hard (don't serve freezer burned pees & carrot ?)

Satay hor fun: not enough noodles and onion was left in massive pieces

Maybe I'm just spoiled from living in van, but stretching it I would give this place a 2.5

Overall needs fresher & better quality ingredients in all dishes we tried."}
{"text":"great service very fast. very friendly and welcoming servers. food was excellent. favorite is the chicken in peanut sauce. a+"}
{"text":"Restaurant spécialisé en cuisines cantonaise et Szechuan.

Il ne paye pas de mine mais on y mange bien. Pas mal de monde y va et ça tourne beaucoup."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty. And it's a good restaurant for those people who finish work late. I'm looking forward for my next visit."}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I have responsible to tell you this restaurant is terriable and do not go.  If this restaurant is in China, it won't service more than one month. They do not pay attention to cooking, and bad attitude to customer. If you  go, you are stupid."}
{"text":"This place is tiny but fantastic!  The eggroll I just ate might be the best one I have ever eaten!  The chicken and corn chowder as well as the chicken fried rice were both very good.  I'll come back here on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Had the Cantonese chow mein  and general tao tofu. 

The service was good. We came with a large group and requested separate bills so ordering was somewhat confusing as we had to write our orders ourselves. Even with the waiter (who had the patience of a saint) double checking there was still some mix ups. They were very accommodating and helpful to fix the issues. 

We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This is a perfect after hours place; we stopped in here a couple of times after Osheaga and it hit the spot perfectly.  It's an easy walk from the Metro green line and is also close to the hotels in the vicinity of the Musee des Beaux Arts (ie. the Hyatt).

We tried a variety of dishes, all of which were on par or excellent.  I was surprised to be able to order Beijing (Peking) duck at 11:30pm but we were, and when they brought the whole duck to show to us before they prepared the dishes, there was a noticeable hush in the restaurant.  We noticed quite a few ducks getting sold after that.

Other dishes that were especially well done were the salt and pepper squid, and the spicy peanut butter dumplings, which they do with oyster sauce.  They also have a surprisingly large and diverse menu, with a large-ish vegetarian selection.

The atmosphere is on par with most Chinese restaurants.  The restaurant is particularly busy late at night but there is a fair amount of turnover so we didn't have to wait too long either night.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the place has the air of a family-run business.

One can undoubtedly find more pretentious, and more expensive, Chinese restaurants (say, in Vancouver), but Beijing delivers very well on standard Cantonese fare."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, especially the pineapple chicken.  Our waiter was wonderful.  Was totally satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"i tried General Tao chicken,and i believe its the best in town"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my experience at the restaurant was unpleasant to say the least. 
When we ordering, the server must not have heard us adjust our order and ended up bringing us a dish we no longer wanted. 
Evidently, their problem solving skills amounted to shoving it on the table without any apology and just insisting that we take it. 
And throughout the course of our supper, not once did anyone offer to come by and change our plates, in spite of the fact that by the end of our meal, all of the many bland tastes had unfortunately blended together into one gigantically bland soupy mess. 
Needless to say, we were glad to reinforce that gratuities are not mandatory for clearly subpar service."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and great food!  Locals come here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delightful beef and snow peas dinner with fried rice. Hot tea a nice accompaniment. Since we has no reservations we were sat with two other groups at a large table. A pleasant conversation took place. This restaurant was obviously very popular. Service was good."}
{"text":"Cantonese chow mein and house fried rice before taking the midnight train back home. I'm here, seated at the entrance waiting for my take out order. 25$ tax in - perfect midnight snack. I wish more Asian restaurants were open after hours. Beats eating pizza. Place is lit with all sorts of people. The OGs, the Filipino that just came back from the casino (I hear you), the artists and the young. I wish I could dine with them right now. I'm hungry. Yelp out.

Food's aight. Safe bet."}
{"text":"Liked this resto for black bean clams using real black beans. But last time we ordered it, the sauce was almost hoisin and soy sauce. Really bad. Not to mention clams were so much overcooked and not hot unlike before. The possibility that the dish was reheated leftover makes me feel awful. Also waiter didn't do anything but saying, \"there are 3-4 cooks always in the kitchen.\" Hmm what does it have to do with overcooked hoisin clams..? Disappointing service."}
{"text":"What an awesome find!!! Amazing food and they catered to my very picky children.  We had so much food leftover and wished we could have brought it home with us."}
{"text":"After years of hearing about this place, I finally decided to go with my wife and parents for dinner and we were not disappointed.

We showed up around 6:30pm, the restaurant was already pretty full. We were asked if we had reservations, we said we did not and the guy walked over to a table with a reserved sign on it and seated us. We were brought Chinese tea with our menus. The tea was surprisingly good. I find the tea served in most Chinese restaurants to be flavorless and glorified pale colored water, however this tea was full of flavor and was a welcome change.

Once seated, we begin to look over their menu. There is plenty to choose from and there is something for everyone's taste and their menu has one of the largest selection of vegetarian options available that I have ever seen and was more than just something and tofu as you find in most places. We spent a few minutes picking our dishes and the waiter came over, confirmed everything with me about what I had written.

My wife ordered a wonton soup, but it was enough for the both of us. My parents ordered a small Hot & Sour soup, that was more than enough for the both of them. Our main course consisted of General Tao Chicken, Shrimp Chop Suey, Seafood Fried Rice, Beef Chow Ho, and my father got a bowl of steamed rice.

My mother was worried we didn't order enough, but than again she's always worried there will not be enough food. However, there was more than enough to go around and at the end of the meal, it was more gluttony that was making me pick at the plates, than anything else.

My favorite dish was the Beef Chow Ho, it had a beautiful smoky taste to it, that was absolutely divine. The Seafood Fried rice was made up of small scallops, shrimp, and what seemed to be mock crab. The General Tao was good, but it could have been a little spicier for my taste, but it was nicely cooked and not soft and mushy like I have had at other places.

All in all, for the four of us, with 4 Tsingtao beers, with tax and tip it came to just under 90$. If we hadn't had the beers, the price would have been a lot more reasonable, because the beers alone were 23$. The service was quick and the food was great. All in all, I look forward to my next visit to try some of the dishes I saw at other tables while I was walking out."}
{"text":"It ain't pretty, but its very good. Shrimp with Black Bean is fierce. Hunan Dumplings with peanut sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Good food ! Reasonable prices , it was our first time experiencing Chinese cuisine , our server was very helpful ! Would recommend"}
{"text":"This is an authentic Chinese restaurant. I have not tried the duck here as recommended but I can vouch for the deep fried calamari and the prawns. VERY delicious....

I would definitely come back, as it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Typical chinese food, nothing to overwelm. We ate just before rush dinner hour on Sunday before labour day. Some vegetables did not seem that fresh. The restrooms could definitely use some cleanup and refresh!"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy upscale restaurant focused on service or presentation, just what we were looking for! Good grub, and fast quick service. The waiter sized me up and suggested a beef noodles with black bean dish so I obliged. We ordered the lobster with ginger and scallions, it was great and only about $20. We also ordered seafood fried rice. Big portions, opens late and everything looked good coming out of the kitchen"}
{"text":"Always very consistent Chinese food. A great variety of choices and all very good. I had the ginger lobster stir fried and it was good!  Had a very nice waiter and enjoyed my lunch very much. Moderately priced and a good bet when friends arrive from out of town. Great for groups."}
{"text":"Seafood and tofu soup was very tasty although ingredients were at the \"cheap end\" of the spectrum.
Chinese broccoli and Chinese mushrooms was a perfectly prepared dish and the broccoli was small and tender. My Chinese guests raved about this.
Singapore noodles were well prepared and had just the right amount of curry.
Schezuan shrimp was bland and tasteless. It wasn't spicy and the shrimp were tasteless, they had obviously used frozen cooked shrimp.
Looking around you clearly have to choose your dishes carefully at this restaurant.
Some looked great some looked like American Chinese take-away."}
{"text":"Referred to Yelp for a quick meal after a long trip into Montreal, that was close to the hotel.  Restaurant Beijing was literally around the corner.  

There were six of us and we ended up ordering something different each and then just eating family style-like.  

Everything was good and I was most impressed with the fried dishes as they were not deep friend and heavy, but lightly pan friend and you could taste the chicken/shrimp.  

Of course it is typical \"Western\" Chinese and what one would expect to find in the States at non authentic restaurants.  Service was very good, especially when one of our friends got sick and had to head back to the hotel (not from the food!!).  Prices were on the low side especially for the amount of food served.  

Down the block from the Place d'Armes metro station."}
{"text":"Very crowded, but my wife and I loved the food when we visited Montreal. We were walk-ins, and there were no free tables and nowhere to sit and wait, but the host gave us a number and a time at which to come back, so we got to wander around Chinatown for a while before our meal. It was nice to have a set time as opposed to being at the beck and call of a buzzer system. When we returned (10 minutes early), we were immediately seated. We ended up ordering a dinner for two, which included some delicious won ton soup, the best egg rolls I've ever had (very different than the standard cooked-from-frozen), and three entrees. It's been a couple months since we were there, but I specifically remember the honey garlic short ribs being amazing. 

The meal wasn't too expensive, and for what we paid we ended up with far more food than what we could finish at the table. Definitely a good value.

I'm hoping to make a return visit here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Le poulet général tao était tendre à l'intérieur et croustillant à l'extérieur. Servi avec piments vert, bamboo et oignons. Cuisson du poulet parfaite. Le buf aux légumes était servi avec brocoli, brocoli chinois, 3 sortes de champignons, carottes, oignons, céleri, chateigne, bamboo, bok choy. Très croustillant et succulent. 

Nous avions la table près de la porte et les gens sont vraiment irrespectueux, ils entrent et ouvrent les 2 portes en même temps et les laissent ouverte longtemps, pas capable d'entrer dans le restaurant pour laisser les gens dans l'entrée rentrer eux aussi. Donc le froid de l'extérieur, nous a fait geler a plusieurs reprises. Mais bon, je n'ai pas tenu compte de ça pour ma note.

Le service n'était pas excellent. Le serveur nous as demander si on voulait du riz, on as dit oui et il ne la jamais apporter. On na demander a un autre serveur. Il a apporter un seul bol et la poser violament sur la table, comme s'il était fâché d'avoir à nous en apporter. Un bol pour deux, il ne m'a jamais demandé si j'en voulais un moi aussi. 

Pour le clou du spectacle, on nous débarrasse et on nous amène la facture avant qu'on ai fini notre thé. Ensuite on entend les serveurs dire aux gens dans l'entrée qui notre table va être disponible pour eux dans 1 minute. On ne nous a pas jetter dehors, mais presque. Ce sont sur ces deux derniers paragraphes que ma note est basée. Dommage la bouffe était bonne mais le service a tout gâcher."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for over 25 years. Yes, my whole life. Used to come here every week with Chinese relatives who ordered off of the Chinese menu. 

The dishes to try from the regular menu are #22 eggplant and the salt and spicy fried squid, Cantonese chow mein...
The soups are all good. Especially the Chinese pear one which isn't on the regular menu."}
{"text":"I actually went there tonight thinking it was going to be a great night of chinese food (because of the high ratings) but was very disappointed. 
The food was not good, the service was very cold.
I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name, this is a Cantonese place. They are Zagat rated but I think that's only because there are hardly any actual restaurants in ChinaBlock. The service is unhelpful and beyond abysmal. If you want to be abused and have to beg for attention from servers, knock yourself out. Otherwise don't bother with this place! And don't order the snails, which come with weak little bamboo skewers to pry them out (good luck with that), or lobster which comes cleaved into chitinous fragments a la Hong Kong style, yuck!"}
{"text":"Don't order the lunch special.  I like chicken in my Kung PO chicken.  Also expect peanuts.  This version had neither, and looked like it had been cooked yesterday."}
{"text":"Terrible, our dishes were salty and greasy and the staff was not helpful. I would not recommend any of my friends to go to this place"}
{"text":"This place gets two stars because I feel extremely ripped off after my experience. The food was mediocre. we had the beef and broccoli, pork fried rice, and chicken and black bean sauce with peppers. As a side, I got the snow pea leaves / Chinese mushroom vegetable dish. The waiter told us that it was seasonal. When the final bill came we were shocked that the vegetables alone were $27. You would think that when something's in season it's not exorbitantly expensive, however this place doesn't play by these rules. Don't go out of your way to eat here"}
{"text":"Ate here with my family. Loved the food. Much better than any Chinese take out I've had. To keep it simple we had the house special for two which we split among the three of us. They had no problem with this. Started us off with tea the the soup, spring rolls and then the main. In the case lemon chicken, mixed rice and a black bean shrimp dish. All excellent. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The lunch here is mediocre at best.  Bland and unhealthy, the ambiance is nothing special.  The best I could say is that it's not very expensive (though you can walk around the corner north on Clark and get the same food for half the price)."}
{"text":"Got here at 1am and ordered about 5 items for 3 people...I thought the food was going to be typical \"chinese\" fare we're used to but the all our dishes were very tasty and not your typical take out style food. General's chicken tasted very good, asian noodles were also very well prepared. Rice was rich and flavorful with the right amount of seasoning. I think I'll revisit this place for lunch next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"stumbled into this place drunk and high at 1am and i have to say that it was probably the best chinese ive ever had. the general tao tofu was incredible. open real late, almost like a chinese dennys. place was packed."}
{"text":"Wow. I have had Asian food all over North America but this place very well might be the best Chinese food I've ever had. It was a great quiet atmosphere, superb food, and all for a more than reasonable price. I will go out of my way to stop in here in the future."}
{"text":"Legit and fresh Chinese food. 

I come from Vancouver where we have a very very large Chinese population, so I compare my experiences from Asian restaurants there.

Great food and good service for an Asian restaurant. There's a difference in service by cultural standards, so most western people don't understand that their food may come out at different times and to share their plates family style. 

We had some wonton soup, egg rolls, chow mein, a beef dish and the boneless crispy fried chicken. 

The wonton broth was SO light and delicious, no scum or floaties, talk about quality, and the wontons were nice and light. 

Egg Roll was properly fried and not greasy.  Same with the chicken.

The other dishes came with nice fresh vegetables and were great portions, exactly what I would expect. 

Left extremely satisfied with leftovers for the next day. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Tres bon resto du chinatown de Montréal. On y est allé un jeudi midi et c'était plain. J'ai pris menu lunch à 6.95$ comprenant soupe won-ton, 1 egg roll et l'assiette avec riz, légumes et boeuf. Dès notre arrivé on nous amène une théière de bon thé vert. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Excellent Peking Duck and other dishes. Service is no-nonsense but polite and courteous. Highly recommend if you're looking for a solid Chinese restaurant in China Town."}
{"text":"Pas mal comme restaurant. Pas cher, efficace et bon! Mais il faut vraiment questionner pour le menu, bien que clair, le riz n'est jamais compris, il faut aller le chercher a la fin du menu qui est un extra. L'orsque je me présente a 1h du matin, le restaurant est plein, mais il y a toujours une place pour moi et mon ami! On aime manger là car c'est abordable. Les portions sont bien généreuses mais encore là, important de demander car certaines sont très variables (les fruits de mers en général). J'y retournerai! (De temps à autre.)"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food here.  Service and atmosphere typical of Montreal Chinese restaurants.  

Caveat: Visibly non-Chinese people may get Westernized versions of dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent place!!! Had the most authentic Hot and Sour soup, and the better cooked Chow Main. I would definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, what I love here besides the friendly service is that they start cooking your order when ordered it, they do not have pre-prepared stuff in advance. Great for take out also, I love to order few places for home to make portions for my whole week :-) 
I found a nice way to have delicious veggies in all my meals"}
{"text":"We came here with lots of people after a conference across the street at the Palais de Congres de Montreal. We got a large multiple course meal that was both celebratory and delicious. Although the weather was very rainy, the food kept us warm and comfy. They could use a bit of an upgrade in decor, but overall it was a nice meal."}
{"text":"I have been going here are more than 10 years, it's my favorite place to go on late night dinner and on days when u think that every other restaurant is closed. Over the years i have brought many friends and tried many dishes which if isn't for my personal taste i have never been disappointed.  Here are some of my all time favorite dishes I always order,  Salt and Pepper squid, Shrimps lobster black bean sauce on rice and the Black bean snails,  Stir Fried Noodle with beef and brocolis, Steam Tribes with Ginger soya sauce, Steam oyster with black bean sauce."}
{"text":"Montreal, Canada ...
Always amazing. I've been here wayyyyy over 30 times as I live (pt) lived (complicated )  in Montreal all my life. Found this place a few years ago. I asked a cop in Chinatown where is the best Chinese food- he strongly recommended Bejing - he was right,  it's the best place I have ever eaten Chinese food!!   When I'm in Montreal, or- when I get back, Bejing is in my top 10 most missed restaurants in Montreal!  Sadly I have not yet found anything comparable in Calgary...Ask for King George to (serve) help you- he's my ultimate favorite server!  I don't even have to order anymore he just knows exactly what I want!!  Enjoy everyone!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a double black diamond on the restaurant difficultly list. You have to know what the hell you are doing or you will fail and choose the \"trap\" items. Make sure you study reviews ahead of time to know what to order. Another option is to creep on the people who are eating while walking to your table and hope you can figure out what they have. I'm pretty sure there's a secret menu if you can speak Chinese.

The black bean clams were legit. I can't remember what else we got, but the noodles were fresh and we enjoyed most things, but were increasingly jealous as we saw amazing options walking past us. This place is kind of a neat mash-up of authentic chinese and westernized chinese take out."}
{"text":"After trying the disappointing food at mon shing, I was still hungry and decided to give restaurant Beijing a shot. The restaurant is vast and the host is friendly. However it takes so long for the food to arrive, I also noticed that some people were not pleased due to parking spots and the food wasn't ready by a certain time! Quite frustrating. In addition, after 15-20 minutes, the food arrived and it was cold and not good! I ordered chicken fried rice and Chinese brocoli. I didn't like it at all. Spent $25 for nothing. Not worth it :/  and I'd never return, the service is so slow and the food was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"They really deserve the 3.5 rating for the hours but I kept it at 3 due to the plastic soup spoons and plastic plates used to serve and absorb the bleach smell of the sanitizing agent. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with this place since most places in the city close early. I had a party of 5 adults and 6 children at 11pm and were promptly seated. Order the chicken congee, Choy sum vegetables, and anything with black bean sauce in it. Flavors are consistent for a late nite but not all too salty that you can't taste the food. The wait staff was versed in English and Chinese which was convenient. I don't know how their French is so can't comment. If this place is crowded head over to restaurant ethan if they are still open!"}
{"text":"Beijing is a godsend! We were so lucky to stumble onto this place while visiting Montreal and staying at the Intercontinental. Beijing is walking distance in the heart of Chinatown (right at the corner of the Chinois alley). Make the walk!
Everything they make is precision. The egg rolls and spring rolls were irresistible. The cashew chicken was yummy. Best of all, I loved their fried rice entrees. Every night, we tried a different plate - both the beef fried rice and the seafood pork plate tasted smoky, savory and outstanding.
Open till 3 AM and filled with Asian customers, this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Working late? Hungry after a 12hour shift?
How about that Chinese crave you've been hiding for a week now?. 
I was happy to see this restaurant open late and glad that they had what I was looking for.
I ordered the bbq pork appetizer with the shrimp and corn soup. 
What is the definition of full? That soup. I was handed a bowl 2 times the size of my head with a lot of broth. I was a little disappointed with the noodles because they were thinner then I expected. 
Also the pork was a little dry but it's based with a sauce which you can put on to help.
Overall this seems like a good place to get that crave. I hope when it's busy the food is a bit better but I was still happy when I left.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to Beijing when everything else was closed around town...expected the quality of food would be better for a restaurant with about 25 people in it at MIDNIGHT.

We had the orange beef and the general tao chicken...very very below par for this standard fare...
Sauce's taste was off, very little meat in the breading and texture was bizarre.

Expensive for that quality, place was overall ok, but would not go again."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in places that is honest about MSG and accommodates those who are intolerant to it. They made ALL of our dishes without MSG - which meant that when we left the restaurant I didn't have to go home and spend the rest of the night feeling like I was going to die. Another bonus is that it's open late."}
{"text":"So it all started at the University of Montreal.. Babu pissed me off and I decided to ignore him.. Safat tried to make me feel better so we came to a Chinese spot to eat at China Town.. as we read the annoying menu .. Taimoor and Farhan walked out and that resulted me getting extra annoyed because I was too lazy to walk out and now I had to sit next to this annoying Ass*.. I wanted to walk out twice after but safat stopped me as the server wasn't polite at all .. Obviously the food I got was crap .. they gave me lo Mein even though I wanted a cho Mein .. Never coming back !!!"}
{"text":"2 et demi étoiles

Ne vous attendez pas à une cuisine gastronomique. Ça reste du fast food. 
Un peu trop de sel par ici et par là. 
Ne prendre que des valeurs sûres comme le riz frit et les nouilles sautées, autrement vous allez être déçue.
C'est une cuisine chinoise nord-américanisée...et cela goûte comme tel."}
{"text":"Best duck you can ever have in Montreal. If you are looking for a non traditional duck and other than the confit de canard then this is the place. 
The presentation of the duck, and the taste and flavour are unbeatable. You go out of this place and after this meal as if you had a bucket of wine. The food is so tasty and they serve you in no time. 

I loved the duck. I like the fact that they serve you green tea at the beginning of the meal on the table. 

Highly recommended and I am already a regular client there."}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit. Que l'on réserve ou pas, il est toujours possible d'y manger sans problème. Si c'est plein, pas grave, le propriétaire regarde la salle, calcule et nous dit combien de temps pour la prochaine table. Il nous donne un numéro et on se présente au moment qu'il nous dit et hop, on est à table. Le personnel offre un service rapide et cordial. Le menu est écrit de façon compréhensible. Par contre, il est très exhaustif. Faut prendre le temps de lire et de poser les bonnes questions, si nécessaire. La nourriture arrive bien chaude et savoureuse à table. Les portions sont généreuses et le prix est très abordable. Vous allez en avoir pour votre argent. Faut pas être difficile ou bec pincé. Il faut vouloir essayer, mais ne vous en faite pas, ça vaut la peine. L'endroit est situé en plein quartier chinois, ce qui est plaisant en période estivale, pour faire toutes sortes d'achats."}
{"text":"We arrived pretty late to the city of Montreal after a long drive from the States. This was the only place that was open in the vicinity of our hotel. When we arrived the ordering sheet and menus were kind of tossed at us and we were left to write down our orders. When the food did come out, it was pretty great, not too oily as some Chinese food can be. I got the beef noodle soup and some General Tso's chicken. They were excellent."}
{"text":"This place is okay. If you're craving the standard fare, North Americanized version of Chinese food, this is your spot. 

The hot and sour soup was great. Small size is a large bowl which is nice. Tofu was okay. You can ask for chili oil which makes everything nice.

Service is okay, food is okay, prices are okay. Nothing to chirp home about."}
{"text":"I didn't like  the noodles, the texture of the noodles was not good, Hot and sour soup was good. I really like the house special fried rice. 
they didn't have the Chinese spicy sauce thing what we all know. instead of that, they had different homemade spicy source which I don't like.
Price was bit expensive.. The bill was 70$ for two ppl.(two small appetizer, fried rice, chicken and noodle)
And they give us can of coca cola which was opened and straw in it. The taste was not like coca cola, so i assumed that they put other coke in the old coca cola can.
I didn't enjoy it.. even though i was so hungry, I couldn't finish the foods."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken chow mein to go...and boy do I wish I has checked the container before leaving. I am not sure who was working the stove yesterday but they definitely didn't take any care in making my noodles as 3/4 were either overcooked or burnt. Who would is serve black, dry noodles to a customer for $10.95. 

Thank goodness my sister's meal was decent, so I didn't starve. Not the worst chinese food ever because I didn't throw it up, but disappointing beyond belief."}
{"text":"Expectations: Good food at a good price.

First of all, some background on Chinese food. The north is known for bread products (buns, noodles) while the south is known for spices (Szechwan being the most well known).

This place met this requirement wonderfully. I ordered the namesake signature dish, Beijing noodle soup. The food was juicy, bland and artfully done, with a balance between home food and restaurant quality."}
{"text":"not very clean environment, waitress is rude. I received the worst service ever in my life. food is not authentic Chinese flavour at all, overall an awful experience. not recommended. ????"}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit. Simple, menu varié, peu cher et service relativement agréable.

Mon choix #1 au quartier chinois, seul ou en groupe!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a late night spot and found Restaurant Beijing. The restaurant is in the heart of Chinatown and close to most of the downtown hotels. 

I ordered the roast duck soup which was pretty good. The beef stew soup was good as well. We also ordered the chicken moo shu. The moo shu was good but the pancakes were all stuck together. 

The service is decent. 

If you are looking for a late night spot, try Beijing."}
{"text":"Talk about nostalgic..the original Montreal Quartier Chinois hangout...the food is Classic Canadian Chinois"}
{"text":"We went here because a couple of locals highly recommended it. It was ok. The Kung Pao chicken was rather spicy. Also ordered the shrimp with snow pea leaves. Both dishes were oily. It's in Chinatown so customer service is non-existence. Eat and get out!"}
{"text":"We were looking for cheapish but good Chinese in Montreal and this ticked all the boxes, the only aspect that was not great was the wonton soup, wontons were too doughy, everything else was spot on. When you can walk away full and happy for $30 including a couple of beers that's a real win."}
{"text":"I work near to this place and have been going for a few years on and off. 

It's good for groups and their lunch special is very affordable! Tasty food too!

If you go around lunch time try to go before 1145 at which time it gets a bit busier!"}
{"text":"Not a good restaurant. ????????A very underwhelming experience, rude staff, and an uncomfortable environment."}
{"text":"After a bit of a wait, we were seated and I must say, they were very efficient.  They got our table ready and service was very prompt.  I think thats about how good they got.  The food was a whole different story.

If I were to break a part the meal down, some part were good, and the other parts absolutely needs work on.  We had lobster congee and a bowl of noodle soup.  The lobster was great!  It was sweet and didn't taste fishy and the congee part tasted bland.

The noodle soup.  The noodles were great, the soup base was salty, the meat was cooked til it was tough and there were hardly any veggies in the noodle soup.  

This place is packed with tourist and locals compared to the other chinese restaurants that I walked passed.  Overall, it was ok, but I've tasted better."}
{"text":"Discovered this place accidently when road tripping with my friends.  Been back every chance I get when I'm in the area.  I live in New Jersey but every time I go to Montreal.  This is a must stop place.  Every dish on menu is amazing.  Especially my favorite dish.  Black Bean clams"}
{"text":"En famille conseiller par un concierge d'hôtel. Excellente nourriture le service sympathique et agréable. Portions plus que généreuse et le serveur nous conseille d'enlever un plat, bon conseil. À recommander"}
{"text":"Flying in late and looking to grab some food I headed down to restaurant Beijing thanks to reviews from fellow Yelpers.  I wasn't disappointed and not just because I hadn't eaten all day.  A pleasant surprise to grab dinner at 1am and find it fresh and very tasty.  I ordered Kung Pao chicken xtra spicy and the only let down was lack of spice.  I have to say that the flavor was very good and tasted fresher than some restaurants during prime time.  I also really appreciated all the veggies in the dish too.  Baby corn, peas, celery, mushrooms and much more!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The food was FRESH, the service was friendly and prompt. We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving on a Sunday night. We ordered one of their \"meals\" that came with a bunch of different things. Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Possiblement le meilleur poulet Général Tao, boeuf à l'orange ou au sésame, poulet frit épicé, soupe Won-Ton et riz frit du quartier Chinois de Montréal. 2 grands garçons de 250 lbs chacun peuvent savourer tout ça sous le regard enjoué de la gérante! L'ambiance est unique et le service digne de n'importe quel Fast-Food. Sourire et sake offert en option."}
{"text":"We just stopped into Montreal for a day. Two places came highly recommended by our hotel staff. First one was disappointing but in all fairness was crazy busy. THIS one however, was more than above average. From the moment we walked in we were wowed. From greeting, to seating to wait staff to appetizer. Timing, temperature, flavor, menu options....ALL of it was simply amazing.  I could go on and on about how good the food is but you really do need to taste for yourself. Definitely will not be disappointed. We're coming back every chance. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great place for a good Chinese food fix. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a decent Chinese restaurant. I recommend the fried tofu. It's crispy and delicious. I'd visit again. Definitely!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this Cantonese style Chinese. Decent Cantonese noodles, and great Peking Duck. In fact some of the best Peking Duck I've had in some time, and I've searched high and low for good duck :-)

Get there early for lunch on the weekends, this place gets crazy fast!"}
{"text":"Old school Chinese restaurant at it's best. If your a fan of Chinese cuisine this place is a must. You know it's going to be a good meal when most of the people in the place are Chinatown residents and most of the conversations around you are being held in Chinese. 

This is the kind of restaurant that lends it's self well to group outings, I always seem to eat here in large groups I find the round tables with and lazy Susan's make it easy to share dishes and try new things. 

The food here isn't always to my taste but that's more of a preference thing then a quality of food thing. I like Beijing because the menu has a wide variety of dishes, a little something for everyone, whether you want the old standards like General Tao chicken and chicken fried rice to pickled cabbage and vegetarian hot pots.

The decor is standard old School Chinese restaurant chairs and tables out of the 70's, waiving cats and half the menu written on pieces of cardboard taped to the wall.  Until recently the menu items on the wall were only written in Chinese. The dated decor give along with the divers clientele give Restaurant Beijing a great ambiance.

This restaurant won't disappoint, if you're looking for a good Chinese restaurant then Beijing should be on your list of places to try."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times over the past few years. I love the food here and considering the demand prices are still good. Chinatown is packed with of course great options to eat out but this restaurant has earned its reputation of being one of the best ones in the town so you can see by the line up outside. Anyway I always come here for their beef tranch fries... Its not really listed in the menu, but you can always ask the waiter for salt and pepper beef with no sauce, or even customize any dish. Really. They have a potluck service going on so everyone is always helping your table not matter what and you wont feel left behind at all. I loved how my particular who made a point on smiling and nodding everytime he passed and asked if everything was okay, making sure he was attentive. And this happens consistently everytime I come here, any given time. 

The food itself is great! As a regular I always get the beef that I was talking about the corn chicken creamy soup and 2 sides that I always change around. One of my fav here is the cantonese fried chowmein. Its crispy with enough chicken around. 

Overall its great here to come check out after your done sight seeing chinatown or down walk from st laurent street :)"}
{"text":"I really don't get why this restaurant only have 3.5 stars, where they should have at least 4 stars.

They have good chinese food, and customer service is consistent and you can't expect 5 stars hotel service from a chinese, anywhere in the world.

Price are relatively cheap and consistent.

What's even better they open late and even later on weekends."}
{"text":"As a San Francisco bay area resident, I thought it would be interesting to try Asian cuisine in Montreal's Chinatown District. Beijing came up as a highly YELP rated place. And, so we gave them a shot. 
Typical, super noisy, large open room, that has too many tables and chairs packed into it. We ordered the Chicken Soo Guy. The server described Soo Guy as a 'special Asian sauce\" . . .UH, your typical sweet and sour sauce is not what I would call \"special\". . . sorry, didn't like it one bit. The spicy beef had a bit of flavor, but that was only because we asked for it to come out \"SUPER\" spicy. . . What's it like in the normal preparation?  All in all, I was not impressed with this place, and would not return."}
{"text":"Needed our chinese meal on the first day of the new year, visiting from NYC although as native vancouver-ites, our expectations are always \"low\"..  Wonton with noodles was arguably as good as anything we have on the east coast so far, not quite traditional, but with all the main checks.  Beef haw fun, was old school good.  Yeung chow fan/rice was ok, a touch greasy and not quite expecting the onions, but had all the right things plus chinese sausage which always a happy point for us.  For $30, about as we can get on the east coast!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was wee and it has always been good. Although my horizons have been broadened by SGV, I have to say that this will be the standard by which other chinese food is measured (ie. is it absolutely positively delicious). We always start out with seafood bean curd soup (what we always referred to as Pa Bo Bean Curd Soup and chinese won ton soup...since we have been going here for almost 30 years, not sure whether this is the correct name or just tolerance on their part)...just perfect with a little siracha. Then comes the onslaught of dishes including ginger lobster, beef with thick rice noodles in black bean sauce, steamed sole with ginger and shallots, shrimps with lobster sauce, snow pea leaves, watercress, baby bak choy, and a few random dishes we may try. This place is a must for me...one of the places that makes Montreal home and I never miss a chance to eat here when I am back in town. This place is definitely not for those on a diet cos they are not shy with the oil it seems...but worth every bite!  

There is only street parking and it is limited so be warned if you try to come here on a busy day like Xmas or weekends, etc. As well, street parking is now $6 for 2 hours (!!!!!)...the only saving grace to this travesty by the idiotic councilmembers is that you can use your credit or debit card to pay. Other than that, I'm just gonna rant a little about the morally reprehensible device employed by the municipal council to maximize their revenue, only to misuse the funds in such imbecilic maneuvers as \"renaming all the english streets into french names\". Instead of using the money to fix the streets, there are giant, extremely hazardous potholes everywhere so that the overpaid, extremely bored councilmembers can come up with other useless measures in a bid to rid the city of all traces of english. Unfortunately, in their bid to preserve the french language, they ensure its demise; who wants to keep around a language whose speakers are so annoying?"}
{"text":"Very good chinese food. We had soup, rice and noodles and everything was very good. service was quick and pleasant although somewhat businesslike. Prices were cheap too (less than $ 30 for lots of food that we had to take home). I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Not awful, but I have had much better. I just can't help but compare to Chinatown LA. I must give them credit for having chow fun... or as they call it chow ho. Good service a well."}
{"text":"Never again. One tell tale sign of a very bad Chinese restaurant is the number of non-Asians in the dining room.  
Do not bother walking in here because every aspect of the restaurant is subpar.
Service - fail.
Appearance - fail
Food - fail (tasteless, not according to standard recipes)
Wine - fail (Don't even know why we bothered)

Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else...anywhere else."}
{"text":"Our long time friend suggested that we meet her for dinner at Restaurant Beijing...she had arrived early and secured a table for four which is great because by the time we got there the place was packed with a line up inside the door. 

I had reviewed the Yelp reviews and knew that we should order the szechuan eggplant, clams in black bean sauce, salt & pepper crispy calamari, we added baby bokchoy, seafood fried rice, lobster with ginger and scallion, singapore vermicelli and started with a vegetarian hot & sour soup. We washed the above average food down with Tsing Tao. The food was hot, tasty and they made sure that no peanuts were present for our one diner who was allergic. 

Of course we ordered far too much food but that was intentional so that the student at our table had leftovers. For me Chinese food is a simple combination of freshness, look and taste. Crispy should be crispy - it was, green should be green - very, and it should all be tasty - not just salty - check!

This is not fancy schmancy nouvelle cuisine chinoise - it is good, tasty chinese food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wouldn't dream of not stopping here as they have one of the best Hot and Sour soups on the planet, consistently good from visit to visit, year after year. This time I went with the General Tso's Chicken, egg roll and white rice which is distinctly different from the States, not cloying sweet and gooped up as you might be use to in our own Chinese American restaurants. Even the egg roll is different in texture and taste all in a very good way. The show stopper was the Dou Miao, stir fried pea shoots in a very light garlic sauce, oh my goodness such a delicate flavor and taste. Restaurant Beijing does many other authentic Chinese dishes and I have always been more than pleased when stopping by for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"As far as authentic Chinese restaurants go, this one is a 5 star in the category. My husband had the most delicious Hot & Sour Soup. We wanted to  take some home to our local takeout joint and say....Make this! Mushrooms and tofu and real pork and shrimp (gasp!) I don't even like Hot & Sour Soup and I was stealing bites. 

I had an eggroll. You could tell it was handmade and handrolled. It was crispy and wonderful. I had General Tso's Chicken since that is my Chinese jam. It was great. Not the sickening sweet stuff of home. Just good crispy and slight spicy and sweet. The house fried rice was the average dish of the night.

A great place in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, and the service was friendly. However, the facilities and seating are horrendous. When I got up, there were patches of sticky paint longing to my pants. YUCK!"}
{"text":"This place is only packed and busy because tourists are directed here for Chinese food....

Stay away, greasy and not that great.

Service sucks ass too... took 15 minutes before anyone came by to take our order.

Bah."}
{"text":"Buddah chow mein for the win! So crunchy and yummy and the mushrooms on top are to die for; I could probably eat this dish every single day and not be tired of it. The sweet and sour scallops are also great as were the prawns nearly the size of my head. Service is efficient, friendly and they have the system down. The only sad part was that they were out of oysters that night and that's why I was told to go; cause no one does them like they do...so I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a find! I loved the family-style aspect of Beijing. We ordered way too much, but are luckily heading back home tomorrow to Vermont so can bring our leftovers back.

The sesame chicken was especially delicious and was crispy and perfect!

The tea was a nice touch, and everything we had satisfied us -- including two picky kids!"}
{"text":"Beijin is where i would go to when finishing up a night out clubbing or after a few (quite a few) drinks at a bar. The food is ok but i do enjoy their shrimp won tons with egg noodles. The service is good as well considering the many times we would show up a little drunk, happy and a little loud lol!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that would take credit cards and I came across this place.  I ordered their beef stew noodle soup and it was nothing like the normal beef noodle soup you get at chinese restaurants.  It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great either.  It wasn't that flavorful. 

However, it was cheap ($7.10 canadian) for the noodle soup.

But what I really dislike was that the staff was rude.  The woman who took my order was impatient and was annoyed at anything I said.  So I never want to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good service, nice eggplant, and chicken with wrap and hoisin sauce was very tasty. Generous servings as well. Only thing is the limited choice for the duck dishes but will try their crispy duck the next time."}
{"text":"You should check them out for the new years menu, I was there for xmas one year and got to partake in Snake soup, ...not sure if they have something like that now, but they must have some good specials given the new year...enjoy"}
{"text":"I love Chinatown in Montreal, as most places can do no wrong. This place was no exception. 

Very busy on a Sunday night and 5 of us were able to sit quickly. 

We started with a delicious seafood egg drop soup which we all (there were some picky eaters among us) scarfed down. 

On to the entrees of some sort of fried squid (delicious!), general gao's (sp?) chicken, beef and broccoli, and I can't remember the rest because it all put me in such a food coma. All very yummy! 

Chinatown is definitely a neighborhood to hit up when in QC, and this restaurant is one of many to check out!"}
