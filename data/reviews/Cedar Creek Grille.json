{"text":"I've been to Cedar Creek several times, and have recommended it to friends and family. I've been going back because I have always had a good meal there, and the atmosphere is great. However, I've noticed a change in the last few months. I used to praise their burger as the most underrated burger in town. I could be wrong, but I believe it used to come with bacon, sharp cheese and truffle fries in a little serving cup. It was really, really good! I had the burger on Sunday, and was really disappointed. It didn't come with bacon (now an add on), seemed to have regular yellow cheddar cheese and plain fries just thrown on the side of the plate. I was a little embarrassed because I brought my parents there for the first time, and was highly recommending the burger! My father & I both had the burger, and like I said, it was disappointing. I know they've changed the menu but I'm really hoping they go back to offering the burger the way it used to be. Also, while the lobster bisque is ok, it's a little salty and there is basically only one substantial piece of a lobster. Maybe they can add more lobster meat.  I love the ambience and it's a great place to enjoy a meal, so I won't give up on CCG! I'll give it a couple months of the new menu and try again."}
{"text":"We visited twice in its first 10 days and had, overall, good experiences (we cut them a break for slower than not service just after opening...)  Some thoughts:  *Place looks like a million (several million) bucks  *Dining room looks inviting from a distance, but oddly small booths, tables too near bustling aisles/front doors and undesirable front room seating locations (to left as you walk in) are a real bummer... Diners will not want to sit in many of the tables (including the large, perhaps communal, table straight in from - and totally exposed to - the front doors and stares of all who enter...) Did the management actually sit at these tables to see how they felt...? Have they talked to diners about the odd seating? Have they witnessed, as I did, diners not wanting to sit at certain crappy tables? They do not feel comfortable..  *Salmon burger and hamburger were super. Prime sirloin is a steal at $20 and was extremely good, one of the best steaks i've had anywhere.. Only \"salad\" on dinner menu was nothing more than chilled prime sirloin with a few greens on the side (Tasty - but how about a SALAD, folks?)  *Soup served in same vessels as at Brio/Bravo... A wise move?  *Temps have been off on nearly every side and soup we've tried. Serving HOT food -meatballs, soup, mashed potatoes, etc... can't be that hard, can it? D for effort on this.   *Pricing is very fair for quality and moderately sized portions. However, side dishes included with entrees are tiny - and look skimpy on the plates...  *Tried to go Black Friday for lunch... made OpenTable reservation for 7 on the spur of the moment... Got a call 5 minutes later saying their only table for 7 was just seated and our reservation spot was not available and we'd need to delay our reservation for 45-60 minutes to be seated...  Nice of them to call - but after 100 OpenTable reservations, this is the first situation of its type. Was there literally not a way to accomodate 7 of us? Could two tables (at 12:15 PM) not have been pushed together to make room for 7, even if that's not their normal policy? I know they've got plenty of 4 tops adjacent to each other. They lost 7 customer that day... Not good."}
{"text":"I been to this restaurant 3-4 times already because someone I know wanted to try it out because its kind of new. And I always give restaurants a second chance.  This place is ok. There is nothing exciting about it. Its just like another american/french/Italian type restaurant. The food is good but it didn't make a party in your mouth."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Waited over 1/2 an hour and finally left. The waiter did bring water and bread within five minutes but then absolutely ignored us. Can't speak of the quality of food, but I can note that the service was bad despite a half-filled restaurant in a district where every other restaurant was full -- and managing to wait on tables."}
{"text":"I've heard they have a good happy hour although I've never been. Inside bar is large &  welcoming & covered outside bar /dining area with open sides is attractive in warm weather. The everything flatbread made in house is delicious, and I have enjoyed a few different entrees that were all excellent.  Friendly service, and a good place to go when traveling on business. I recommend table dining vs. bar if you're focused on service."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation for this restaurant on Thanksgiving on Opentable, with a note that we would have 2 babies with us. The restaurant cancelled our reservation (I got an email from Opentable notifying me it was cancelled). So I guess you'll be free from screaming babies if you eat there, but I can guarantee that no member of my family will ever spend a dime there."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, and unlike many reviewers here, we had a great server. He was very friendly and personable -- we had zero problems. Great meal! I had the French onion soup which was awesome, and a loaded baked potato. My husband had the grilled vegetable plate, which he said was tasty and I will add, the presentation was great. In-laws both enjoyed their meals fully (sirloin steak and the sea bass special). We split the ENORMOUS hot fudge sundae for dessert. Totally pleasant place to eat and interesting views of the open kitchen."}
{"text":"We went to Cedar Creek Grille tonight for my mother's birthday.  The service was wonderful and the food (steak & frites, ribs, and shrimp & angel hair pasta) was delicious.  But what really stood out was our server, Star, who went above and beyond.  We had not mentioned that we were there for Mom's birthday, but when she saw the presents on the table (after we had already paid), she quickly disappeared to reappear just a short time later with a wonderful ice cream sundae with a birthday candle on top.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I walked in an hour before closing: I was immediately greeted by a hostess with the worst attitude I've ever encountered. She said \"let me see if we can even serve you\" what kind of statement is that? I'd say four minutes later she sashayed back & said follow me abruptly. I should of walked out then and there. We were seated, our waiter thankfully didn't have an attitude. He wasn't pushy with getting an order in & got our drink order in right away. We got our drinks pretty promptly, then put in our dinner orders. That's again where it went bad. Our drinks eventually went empty and unnoticed for long periods of time. And I don't think I've ever waited that long for my entree to be cooked and served, EVER. (Anywhere) The waiter took more notice to the coworkers at the bar and a few patrons drinking. Then I noticed he had been drinking, in between checking in very sparsely with us. (NOT OK) We were finally served, our waiter stumbled as he did so. The food was okay, I just wanted to get the heck out of there so we are as fast as we could. I will never return due to the lack of class, etiquette and respect these jokers (staff) I ended up with food poisoning on top of it all, I feel like they messed with my meal."}
{"text":"Did not have a great experience tonight. Table of 10. Server not very good. Too expensive for the experience and food we received tonight. Been here before and it was good. Not tonight. Dinner was $600. Super disappointed"}
{"text":"I would return here with the wife or a buddy and eat at the bar...we got tucked in the corner...cramped 6 top...food ...sirloin steak best steak for 20 around...coleslaw great...deviled eggs are almost as good as my father in laws....shrimp taco app good..no one complained about the food but our Kardashian wanna be waitress must of went tanning and got her teeth whitened between our salads and meal...and after our meal but before our dessert...they actually brought us two desserts to apologize for the wait but would of preferred she told us it was going to be a delay...chop house salad is great too....the wait staff comes off with an attitude and a bit of sarcasm...I pounded my first beer and second (I had to paint a closet and literally jumped out  of the shower and into the car) so I was parched...she looked at me and said. 'Really..already..) and rolled her eyes....that's what the wife wants to hear...all and all reasonable price ...we ate like Romans for $300...that's for six of us...but service looked superior at the bar....and there was a lot of single women there eating in groups and at bar for those 30 and over trollers...I will go back...one more time thus year.."}
{"text":"We were completely disappointed by our dining experience. The dinner started off with the best part, the bread. It devolved into a terrible mistake from there. The calamari tasted like fried breading with very little flavor unless you covered it in sauce. My mahi mahi was overcooked and somewhat bland. The Cole slaw was some of the worst I've had. You won't believe it but it was the blandest of all.   My wife's crab cakes were tiny compared to other restaurants we've been too. The fries were also a disappointment. Some were over cooked and yet others were undercooked.   To top it off our server was mostly absent as we sat with empty glasses for nearly ten minutes at one point."}
{"text":"Very good meal for our group of four! Trout is always awesome! Burger was very good! Great setting at the dinning by the bar outside."}
{"text":"Cedar Creek Grill is a favorite of mine. I travel to Cleveland on business and every time I'm here it's definitely a must to visit this place! They have a great wine and food selection and the staff is always friendly. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Average service and quality of meal.  Was expensive for the quality of food provided. Good location, but lacked ambience."}
{"text":"Went to Cedar Creek for Lunch. A bit on the pricy side for lunch. No specials for lunch.  Nice atmosphere.  I ordered the Cobb salad. It was a nice size but $15.00."}
{"text":"My experience at Cedar Creek was awful. I was so disappointed that I created a Yelp account just to write this review. If it was possible not to give any stars I would. The service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best. We were seated without incident but waited 10 minutes before a server came to our table and offered water.  When we asked to speak to a manager it became quite clear why the service was so poor. She simply shrugged and called over another server to take our drink and food orders. There are several high quality restaurants in this area.  Please do not waste your time or money at this establishment. I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very aloof and never bothered refilling our drinks, and we waited for over 20 minutes after our meal for any follow up for deserts or the check. And the food was terrible, flavorless. Probably never coming back here again."}
{"text":"It was Saturday night when I decide to have a dinner at this restaurant I did the reservation and we arrive some time behind but even though they greet us nicely and they seated us in good position as the table was near to the bar .we enjoy the life band music. The service was excellent and proficiently with all aspect I like the menu easy there is no too many food item so you can pick your choice easily really I love this kind of menus but they do not have a kids menus do my kids did not like that  We had grilled artichk as appetizer it was so nice then the chicken taco it serve as kids food they love it  The soup is tasty and perfect it really remind me the original French onion  The salad with crispy onion ring on top and the dressing on it was good The entree even it is not a fish restaurant but it was perfect salmon cooked with generous piece that I eat it all. I was really full and resist the water offer of the dessert or even a cup of coffee  It was my first visit but definitely would not be the last"}
{"text":"I drove over 30 minutes to try out this establishment and I was more than disappointed.   Limited menu options for brunch. The food was ok.  With a large party of 15, the kitchen could not support the timing so we got our food intermittently and the plates were hot from sitting in the window.  The waitress overlooked me when ordering drinks and only after food was served did i get something other than table water.   While she acknowledged my fish allergy, she didn't realize that she served me food with crab in it.  Her response when I brought it to her attention was:  I told them you had an allergy.  An apology is appreciated however if I hadn't looked, it could have killed me.  For the money, the poor service, and lack of consideration for food sensitivity - it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Bartenders are rude and clearly upset that they are working. The one female bartender actually rolled her eyes at me for ordering a second Fat Tire, as well as when I asked for my check. Unsure as to why such miserable human beings are hired to interact with patrons. The food runners were super nice and helpful - they should be tending the bar and waiting tables! Moving on, the food was mediocre. Would not recommend to my family or friends. Overall, a very bad experience here. Such a shame for a newly opened establishment."}
{"text":"We reserved their banquet room for our sons wedding rehearsal dinner party. Staff was extremely helpful with all the details. We chose to offer Cajun shrimp pasta and chicken Parmesan as the main course. The salads and dessert options were all well-liked. Our group of 50 was very complimentary of the food and the staff was very attentive to our needs. I'm not sure why some reviews don't show higher marks but we will certainly be back when we are in the area. Thank you Amber and all the staff!!"}
{"text":"i wish i could give this restaurant no stars.  The food is absolutely vile. I had the grill salad which was iceberg lettuce, bottled ranch dressing and some weird tomato dressing. Then, i had french onion soup.  It tasted like canned soup -  well actually worse than that.  It was cold and gross.  Then, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer. It looked and tasted like canned salmon.  It was so fishy and smelly - i question if it was even salmon.. I felt sick from the smell of it and I still have aftertaste in my mouth from just only one bite.  My stomach hurts.  Oh and the bread the sent to the table was stale.  They did let me send back the salmon - thank goodness.  The service was okay - just mediocre.  I really don't mind expensive restaurants when the food is great. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Plusses - many: excellent service, attentive and quick.  Fine food - great filet, ribs, tuna nicoise, appetizers veal meatballs and grilled artichokes, recommended by server and very good. Huge negative - exceptionally NOISY.  Round 1 of conversation with the front - \"we are a very busy and vibrant restaurant\" - bully! - \"and no you can't sit in that empty room (terrace) over there.\"  Round 2 - \"you know, noise level can be one of the ways people judge restaurants now.\"  \"OK, you can sit in the terrace.\"  Wonderful!  Had it to ourselves, enjoyed a great conversation with friends.  We really had come close to bailing and going elsewhere.  This did happen with no smiles or pleasantries at all, but it did happen.  Thanks for that! Realized that this place is a legacy of an old favorite of ours - Lindey's in Columbus, where the atmosphere was always welcoming, from the owner all the way down the line.  A better grasp of those qualities, plus noise control, would make this place really top-notch."}
{"text":"Every time we're in town we make a stop here! Great food, ambience and service! Wish we had this place closer to home!"}
{"text":"We were a part of five that went to dinner on a Saturday evening. As we walked up to the hostess table and told them the number in our party, we were told that they didn't have tables that would fit 5 and that we could sit at the communal table or the chef's table. When we inquired how long the wait would be, there was much discussion and finally one (of the three) hosts said \"yeah, let's do that then, why not?\" and brought us back to a fairly empty terrace. Kind of an ominous start to the evening.  We were seated in one of the south tables where the sun coming in made things uncomfortable. The table behind us asked the wait staff if they could do something about it - but nothing was done. Finally we took it upon ourselves to close the curtains so that we could dine in comfort.  Our waiter came by an thus began an evening of poor service/poor attention to detail:   1) He could not properly pronounce the special of the evening.   2) When asked about Scotches he said he didn't know what was available because \"they kept adding new ones and taking away old ones\"   3) When bread was brought out, the tray contained 4 slices for 5 people. Poor attention to detail.   4) A majority of members in our party ordered steak and not a steak knife was brought to the table. We finally got fed up with cutting our steaks with butter knives and had to request steak knives.   5) All of the steak-eaters ordered entrees that were supposed to come with bernaise sauce. We didn't see any and when we inquired, we were told that it was mixed in with the crab meat. When we asked for some extra, we were told it would be a $3 upcharge for each one we wanted. Really? Nickle-and-diming us after we purchased drinks, appetizers and entrees?   6) Mixed up steak order. One person ordered a medium-rare steak and another ordered the same entree but in medium. Those were mixed up. (The same entrees were ordered with different sides. They got the sides right, just the steaks wrong).  7) The wait staff started clearing away side-dishes without asking us if we were done (there was still food on the plate) and we had to interrupt them to inform them we were still working on them.  8) Empty water caraffe's that were not replaced and required us to constantly ask for more water.  The food itself was decent but nothing memorable or worth writing home about.  For the price of the items on the menu, I expect good service and attention to detail. Unfortunately, both were majorly lacking during our dining experience."}
{"text":"After much hype,finally went Cedar Creek Grille. It is a lively restaurant  at LaPlace near Beachwood Mall. It was a Monday evening,very crowded ,very noisy ,tables very close together . Service was subpar and rushed . Our table had a chopped salad(not impressed),filet(small) and some kind of breaded chicken cutlet(dry and tasteless ) Others have said that they had a good meal there for lunch ...maybe I'll try again. Would not go for dinner ....you cannot have a conversation !!"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding lunch with excellent and efficient service. The server was both patient and knowledgeable. The outdoor setting added a positive flavor to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were very excited when we heard from some friends that Cedar Creek was opening up just down the street from our house. This space at La Place has been filled with mediocre restaurants for the longest time (Melange, anyone?), and this sounded like a restaurant that would be good for the area.   We drove past one day and saw that the restaurant appeared to be open for business. So, we decided to see if this place was what we had imagined it would be, and tried to go there that evening for dinner.   Once we walked in the door that evening, we were very arrogantly greeted by a manager. The restaurant was packed, so I asked how long of a wait there would be for three people (my husband, my son, and myself). He then asked if we had an invitation. I told him I didn't know what he was talking about, and that the restaurant appeared to be open to the public from the outside. He said that the restaurant was open that evening to \"friends and family\" only.   Please note... there was no signage stating they were closed to the public on the doors or windows outside of the restaurant, and when we had called earlier in the day (twice, I might add) to see what the attire was and if they accepted reservations, there was no mention of that evening being \"invitation only\".   The manager was extremely short with us and did not even bother to tell us when the restaurant would be open to the public. More than a little disappointed, we left. Not exactly a great first impression.   A few nights later, we tried again. The decor of the restaurant is gorgeous. Very classy, indeed. However, seating arrangement and the layout of the booths is a bit awkward.   Our server was very good, but the quality of the food was lacking. My husband ordered the steak tacos and didn't even bother to finish them, as he said they had no taste to them. My son ordered a burger with fries and found it to just be average. I ordered a salad, which was pretty good. My husband and son both ordered the french onion soup, which they enjoyed.   We had mentioned to a different manager on our second visit the negative experience we had had the first time. He apologized for the incident and graciously paid for our dinner, which we appreciated.   While the service provided by the wait staff was very good, some of the management staff need an ego-check.   Complimentary valet parking is available.   Overall, we won't be returning anytime soon. There are so many better options in this area that you can't even justify coming here... simple as that."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. Thank you for hosting our Grandma's 90th birthday party! The venue was perfect; we wouldn't have changed a thing."}
{"text":"Cool looking place I guess- in my opinion the menu is drab and boring- nothing stands out to me- but what do I know?"}
{"text":"This is my to restaurant. The seed crackers are to die for. I always order the chop chop with chicken. Just went Sunday after commencement for my son. Atmosphere  is always lovely. The hostess didn't crack a smile; luckily this is the exception and not the norm. Had the artichoke and calendar appetizers.  Very good. Our server, I sadly do remember her name, a middle age African American,  was phenomenal.  Super attentive and informative, even when she had to whisper to me that The Grill was out of key lime pie!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before my husband took our family here for Mother's Day.  I was pleasantly surprised by both the food and atmosphere.  The shrimp and grits were delicious.  The half size chopped salad was a steal for $6.  The kids' portions were enormous (plenty for an adult).  The atmosphere was elegant and tranquil."}
{"text":"Although the food was very nice, the hostess gave us a difficult time with bringing in a blind gentleman with a service dog.  She not only berated us with \"is that REALLY a service dog\" but would not put us in the main dining room but designated the five of us to an inconspicuous spot away from everyone.  This restaurant should read the A.D.A. rules very carefully as they are prone to a big fine in the future.  Our bill was over $200 so we were good customers but the inquisition really ruined what was to be a very nice gettogether for us. I would not recommend this restaurant to others under the circumstances."}
{"text":"Great place in NE Ohio.  Fantastic burgers, and the soups are superb, especially the tomato basil.  Casual fare with an upscale twist.  One of our go-to places.  Servers are great too, professional and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Apps = 3/5 Entree = 2.5/5 Dessert = 4/5 Service = 2/5 Ambiance = 3/5  Service was extremely slow but our waitress was very nice. The place was busy for a weeknight, so it was definitely loud - I felt as though I were shouting half the time.  I had a few of the appetizers, which were smaller portioned, but most were decent. The entree I ordered was the filet with asparagus - I was not impressed with the lack of taste. However! The desserts I sampled were quite delicious - the chocolate cake and the chocolate pot were very good paired together!"}
{"text":"They have good happy hour hours and their drinks are good. Happy hour menu food is small but tastes good. I wish they change their menu quarterly . I've been there too many times and started to get board of same happy hour menu every time."}
{"text":"Love a good burger, this place has it.  Really just damn good.   When you're looking for a great burger - this would not normally come to mind.  Don't doubt - just try it.     Wife and I always end up with the same entrees , trout and a burger."}
{"text":"I've passed this place by a million times while shopping and running errands and each time I've given it a cursory glance and said \"maybe some day\". Well, \"someday\" finally came and it couldn't have come soon enough.  Now, I'm always a little weary about dining out of a restaurant located within a mall or outlet complex. I've had some bad experiances, but we decided to give this one a try anyway and I'm so glad we did!  Service was good - of course! The ambiance was very nice - dim enough to be romantic but not so dim you couldn't get a good picture.   But oh my, the food! We started with devilled eggs that were so good we just wished the appetizer was a little bigger. We settled on some spiced apple cider that was amazing - I wish I could have it everyday because it was just perfect! I had salmon that surpassed my expectations - I tend to be picky with seafood and have low hopes from any non-seafood place that has it. However, the salmon here was excellently cooked, though the fries were just okay. For dessert I had a favorite of mine that can be tough to find - key lime pie. It was by far the best part of the night. They got the flavors and textures just right. Why don't they sell these things whole? I'd happily keep buying them because a fresh made key lime pie done right is hard to come by.   Overall, I left with a lighter wallet, but a heavier stomach and a renewed faith in mall-adjacent restaurants. Give this place a whirl, as they are worth every penny."}
{"text":"I came here for a little birthday dinner with my boyfriend.  We were both impressed with the ambiance of the place- the seating, lighting, and decorations were, for a lack of a better word, \"cool\".  The food- very tasty.  We had the veal meatball apps and both ordered the 8oz fillets.    The really \"blah\" experience of the place, however, was the service.  Our waiter neglected to give us any bread for the table, and I only noticed this after everyone else except my party did not have any.  When I asked our waiter, he told us he would get us some, but it never came.  It took more than 15 min after we were done with our app for our waiter finally took the dirty plates away from our table, and then a half our for our main courses to arrive. This was further aggravated by the fact that our waiter took away our silverware along with the dirty app dishes.  After we got our main courses delivered to us by a runner, I was very surprised that our waiter didn't come to check on us to make sure everything that we ordered was to our liking, which it obviously was not since we were missing forks and knives!    I had to stand up from the table and grab a runner who get us our new silverware.  It was pretty frustrating considering our waiter was the one who told us to leave the dirty forks and knives on the app dishes because he'd get us new ones.  Our waters were empty during the 40+ min of waiting for our main course, and our waiter failed to refill the bottle of water on the table. I was already so frustrated with his performance as a server, that we agreed it would be too much hassle to even ask for a basic service that you would expect to have at any food establishment.   Another thing- I actually noticed that the runners were more enthusiastic and friendlier instead of the waiters.  I wanted the smiling, accommodating runner to be my waiter instead of the one we had! I tried to find him after our meal so that I could tip him personally, but he was no where to be found.    Management- if you ever read these reviews, please take note! Your food is great, it's the service that absolutely needs a *NECESSARY*  overhaul.   I will not be returning, or suggesting this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"It is just great. We sat inside and the atmosphere was great and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We ordered their signatures: spinach & artichoke dip and burger. The dip was nice and the burger was juicy and ten tender. Definitely coming again"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5/4 . We had the salmon burger which was really good along with the shrimp and pasta the sauce was kind of heavy but not to bad . I really enjoyed my kale salad with pumpkin. Overall nothing was bad it was a decent meal . The flavors were on point .  The flat bread they had was really good . The fish was wild caught or so they say but it had great flavors . It reminds me of a capital grille or a brio restaurant .   I was to hungry to take pictures I forgot lol ."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend about a week ago, we had to look for the hostess whom we found at the back of the restaurant before being seated.Waiter was rude, cannot comment on overall food experience since it was my first and last visit, but the fish sandwich I had was cold and unsavory."}
{"text":"We had a very good meal. The Salmon was flavorful... the seafood special  tasty and plenty. The flat bread and Kale salad were stand outs. service was solid. Our  wine wasn't the bottle on the menu, but they made good with some encouragement. We will return, but somehow not all seems to be in sync"}
{"text":"This is our first time here... bartenders awful..3 Of them and unless I flag them down.. not returning. They hang out together it seems.. The spinach artichoke appetizer was excellent. Chopped salad just ok. My husband had the walleye.. on a 1-10.. It was a 4..a 10 being great. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Ate there twice now.  First, it's awesome that it's not a chain!  Hurrah!!! I like the vibe and the ambiance.  I thought the food was good. If anything, it's missing some kind of sauces or something that makes me really want to order that dish again.  Perhaps a little over priced.  The server was fine. The food was delivered within reasonable time."}
{"text":"We started eating at this restaurant about 3 years ago, since that time it has become progressively more crowded.  We eat hear typically twice a month.  The steak frites it's great, as is the cedar salmon (either on it's own or over a salad).  The chicken palliard is damn good.  My wife loves the veggie burger and the kids go for the chicken tenders or kids burgers.  The fries are really really good as well. A great spot in the winter for a romantic drink by the fire or at the bar."}
{"text":"My Boss and I were driving around the area looking for somewhere to have dinner.  It was a Monday evening, and as we drove past this place, we felt it looked pretty nice and inviting.    At first when we walked in and looked around we thought it may be a bit pricey... it was very nice, white tablecloths, wine glasses already on the table...  but turns out the prices were not too bad at all.   We sat at the bar and since I was starving I ordered the steak tacos.   They were nice an filled and super great.  The bartender was great, said his favorite dish was the burger, which I ordered, and my boss ordered a salmon( i think or some type of fish) sandwich.   Both of us really liked our meal.   All that food, about 4 or 5 beers for him and about 3 or 4 Rum and cokes for me, and our meal was around $75.     I would definitely come back here next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was terrific. Christiana was a service pro, checking on us without interrupting with needless questions.  Great Pinot Grigio with Eggs Benedict. We will be making this one of our favorites.  One of the best record in a city crying for upscale restaurants."}
{"text":"Good brunch, although the menu is pretty small. Even on a hot day, though, the covered patio is very pleasant. It looks as if it would have a decent after work bar situation as well."}
{"text":"Stopped here for \"Happy Hour\" with a girlfriend.  We sat at the bar around shift change.  The drinks were good.  The Bartenders mildly attentive.  I felt like I had to flag them down for another beverage / water; I find this frustrating when there are only 5 people at the bar and the restaurant is mostly empty.  One bartender made my drink wrong and acted like I inconvenienced him to correct it after I sat with the wrong drink for 10 minutes.  Note to bartenders: tonic is not soda water, and yes, it does taste different.     I enjoyed a Steak salad.  It was perfectly prepared and I had no complaints.   I'm sure dining here would be wonderful as it is a white table-cloth \"fine\" dining establishment.  Hopefully the servers are more attentive than the bartenders are."}
{"text":"Nice place. Loved the atmosphere. Went there with friends and had a great time. Wines and food selections are great. We got to enjoy the happy hour menu selections which were perfect for the evening. Main courses were amazing. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place. Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5, Dim lights, dark hardwood decor, stone hearth seating area, white table cloths, all chairs have arms, and classical/instrumental music playing in the background. The noise level was high but it was lunch time just before Christmas. The 5th star would have required more space in between tables and a cold draft from the front door toward the front half of the restaurant. A couple times people had trouble putting on coats without hitting the person behind them. Service: 4/5, Only critique here is it took 10 minutes each time to get a diet pepsi. Other than that, our waitress knew the menu, soup of the day, and other specials. Service was professional and genuine, not forced. Our food came out quickly and with no errors. Menu: 5/5, Options of soup, salad, fish, steak, sandwiches, and half portions. Long list of wines and enough beers to make a preferred choice. I had the burger of the week: 1/2 pound burger with Monterey Jack cheese, onion strings, and A-1 sauce. It was cooked perfectly to order and served with shoestring fries. My wife had the chicken sandwich which was tender and juicy. We shared the molten chocolate cake with ice cream which was excellent. Overall: 4/5, great lunch spot for the business meeting and hoity toity."}
{"text":"This was the second time we have been to this restaurant, and more than likely our last. Both times our food has been very good and came out exactly as ordered.  However, our first experience had EXTREEMLY poor service, and our second experience was not far behind.  We were invited for the birthday event by some friends and meet up early for happy hour before dinner.  The bartender seemed very behind and distracted.  He did not even have a wine key to open the bottle of wine we ordered and had to go find one.  Our food was good, not steaming hot, and came out in a reasonable amount of time.    Then we moved to the dining room with our friends. We all ordered some apps, which were great, but took a lit longer than necessary....about 30 min.  I got a salad, and would have liked more dressing but never saw our server again to ask for any until the salad was finished.  After being at our table for about 1:20 we asked about how much longer our food would be, our server responded that we were the second ticket back and walked away... so we waited.  Food finally came!! It was good, and cooked as requested, but now we have been there for almost 2 hours!  So we were finally ready for our checks, and per the birthday special all bottles of wine were half off.  We received our checks and no one's bottle was not half off.  Upon finding our server again and pointing this out he said that since our party needed to break up the check, he could not keep the discount on the bottle of wine and that all people got a little off their bill. We paid our check, which already had a gratuity added for our party of six and left. We will not be back again."}
{"text":"Six of us ate there this evening. Mixed reviews on food, liked ambiance, aggravated by the high noise  level that limited intelligent conversation. The Food - breads where wonderful - best part of the meal -crab cakes - average, small crab pieces with too much breading, good fries, OK slaw -shrimp taco - ver good, chopped chopped grilll salad boring -shrimp with angel hair - spaghetti was served OK - stripped bass special was rated so-so - ice cream OK - the Manolo pinot grigio was very good 'Service max did all he could to please, no complains at  al. Ambiance -The volume of the music was extremely loud and conversations with the manager did not help. - temperature was very cool.  I would not rush back to Cedar Creek unless you love good bread and butter."}
{"text":"First time here, was very impressed.  Our server Max was great,  informative, friendly and efficient.   The menu offered a nice variety for every taste and the prices were right in line for what you got.   The inner room was very comfy,  white table cloth but not at all stuffy.  There is an additional semi outside sun-room-verandah-ish seating area that we would probably ask to be seated in next time.   Bottom line when you are still talking the next day about how good your dinner was that's a home run in my book.  So why not 5 stars?  Honestly I don't know why, that's just hard for me to do,  which probably says more about me than it does the restaurant :)  We will definitely be back...probably sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"First Impressions:  The interior was spectacular. I couldn't take my eyes off of all the ways they utilized the various types and stains of wood, from the celling, to the beams, to the floor. They managed to work with the re-claimed wood to leave an elegant and spacious feeling, rather than the typical cluttered and confined feeling often designed around recycled woods. When the hostess walked us to our table, I couldn't spot a single place in the restaurant to which I would have had any aversion being seated.   Service:  We arrived just prior to the lunch rush, and were seated almost immediately. The hostess was warm, and made a point to make sure we were happy with our table. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, yet not so much so as to interrupt our time. Everything arrived in a timely manner; we were never left wondering what had happened to our food or check.   Food:  We ordered the Wood Fired Artichokes as a starter, and they did not disappoint. The artichokes were cooked just right; the meat was tender and the leaves were still in tact. The remoulade sauce had the perfect combination of sweet and spicy to accent the artichoke.   The Idaho Rainbow Trout was my entrée of choice, which was accompanied by mashed potatoes and spicy green beans. The plate arrived steaming; the fillet was beautifully flaky and peeled away from the skin flawlessly. Lobster sauce topped the trout, which melded well into the Yukon potatoes and al dente green beans.   Conclusion:   Cedar Creek's website features the following quote by Cedric Bledsoe, \"Simplicity is the essence of happiness\". Cedar Creek definitely embodies the aspects of simplicity, from their architecture, to their straightforward menu. Yet amidst their simplicity, they still manage to capture warmth and beauty in everything from the atmosphere, to the wait staff, to the food."}
{"text":"We were one of the first groups to get to use the newly renovated party rooms. Gorgeous! Everything from the smiles on the hosts that walked us back to room. Service was great.  They have a private bar in the new room and we had our own bartender  Food was great Service was awesome  Thanks to Amber and the CCG staff for making our work holiday party so nice!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation about a week in advance. The hostess was clueless. They gave away our table to someone else and didn't even apologize. Some other guy in a suit was patronizing telling me to calm down. Again, he never apologized. The proper thing to do would be to buy us a drink or an appetizer or dessert. But they did nothing. The service was very slow. It was like it was his first day on the job. They constantly served us across the table rather than walking around to the person who was being served. The wait staff needs much training. My salmon was cooked properly, but flavorless. My wife's scallops were excellent. The steak tacos app was good, but I got a huge piece of gristle. Overall unimpressed. Go somewhere else.  Bottom line is they don't know how to treat or keep customers."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Cedar Creek Grille. The food was excellent, my filet was cooked perfectly. Also the hostess was amazing she knew it was my first time there and she came back over to see how everything was and what I chose to eat. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I came with my girlfriend for my birthday, the trout was amazing! The special filet was delicious (a little pricey at $40.00) but a great cut of beef. Our server Kaitlin was great! Attentive and polite! I will definitely be coming back.."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. I had the crab cakes and they were ok. Spinach and artichoke dip was very good. Worst bar service! It took our server over 15 minutes to get a second round of drinks...... I got my second glass of wine when the server picked up my dinner plate, I ordered the glasss when it was served. Might come back since the ribs looked really good. My wife had the veggie burger and even as a dedicated carnivore, it was quite tasty."}
{"text":"We LOVE CCG! We have been here many times, it's our favorite go-to dinner spot! The service is always great! The crispy chicken paillard is to die for!"}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous. Food was amazing. Beautiful & classy inside & out. Sean our server was great & very attentive. We had a fabulous dinner. It was myself 2 teens and a toddler."}
{"text":"Upscale yet not formal, place to have a \"real meal\" (vs. mediocre chain restaurant or fast food) near the mall. I highly recommend going on a Thursday (live music) in the summer for happy hour. Fantastic quality happy hour menu. Definitely a step up from the typical pub or bar food at a a different happy hour. Can't beat sitting on their patio on a beautiful day. The service is very professional and courteous. Nice brunch menu (the mini cinnamon pastries they serve with the bread basket are ADDICTIVE. I think they actually changed the recipe, but they are still are welcome on my table...especially when the are given to you without ordering them!)  Great location. All the menus are little over-priced in general unless it is a special occasion. Not really for the hipster or trendy crowd.  I would love to see a small plates or tapas menu even one night a week."}
{"text":"The ambience here is nice, and parking was convenient.  Service was perfectly fine - our server was attentive and polite.  However, the food left something to be desired.  I ordered the classic burger, cooked medium.  I got a classic burger cooked rare/medium rare.  It was so pink that I couldn't bring myself to eat more than half of it.  The fries that came with it were fine, but nothing to write home about.  At least when it comes to quality burgers, there are better places, especially or the price.."}
{"text":"Posted a photo. This is a great place to grab lunch. I had the mahi mahi grilled sandwich. Very attentive manager."}
{"text":"I keep trying to post a pic of their Mac n Cheese  with Bacon but it never gets its time in the spotlight!   It's creamy,  rich and decadent. ..a side dish at that!!! If you're feeling guilty, get another side of the green beans....yummy too! This is so dang good, it makes you wanna yang the chef for his recipe. .. I'm jus saying!  Roberta and Mitch and Jessica make goot,  yea I said Goot... dranks, naw... excellent dranks!!!  They have two bars and outside seating... music sometimes. .. this place is easy to get to...just off I-271 and right by Legacy Village and Beachwood Mall...nestled in LaPlace!  See ya when you get here!"}
{"text":"I ordered the crab cakes. Crab cakes were good but the slaw and French fries for sides were not. The service was atrocious. We waited 15 minutes for our round of drinks. I would not go back here. The server was not attentive. I get that it was Xmas Eve and that the restaurant was busy but still we waited a long time for drinks. Also, one cocktail that was ordered was tequila with club soda and cherry stuff in it. It was really disgusting.    I would not go back here."}
{"text":"Cedar Creek Grill has a great menu and delicious food. I have enjoyed everything that I have ever ordered in about 6 visits.  I have had problems with poor service on 3 of the visits. The servers don't check the tables as often as they should to be sure everyone has what they ordered. Please do some additional customer service training with your staff/servers and I would then highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with coworkers (there were 13 of us). We had originally planned to go to The Cheesecake Factory but their power was out and they couldn't serve hot food. On a whim someone mentioned Cedar Creek Grill so we decided to give it a shot and I'm extremely glad we did!  Upon entering I could tell that this place was much fancier than our original plans. We were seated quickly and our very friendly server was a sweetheart and was patient with us while we were deciding on what we wanted to drink.   For lunch, I ordered the fish of the day which happened to be blackened mahi mahi (one of my favorites) with a delicious beurre blanc, broccolini, and garlic chive mashed potatoes. I think I got that all correct. I have a hard time remembering the names of intricate dishes like this one but I can tell you I won't forget how delicious it was.   The mahi couldn't have been cooked more perfectly. The chef definitely put some TLC into it and it felt as if he/she(?) spent the entire day nurturing my filet just for me. But I realize that that is not possible because the other dishes at my table had to be cooked as well. It was, by far, the best piece of fish I've ever had so kudos to the chef because I'm quite picky about my fish.  The broccolini could have used a few more minutes cooking. The stems were woody and hard to chew. Also could have used some seasoning. I'm not mad though because I need to be watching my salt intake (says the doctor). Maybe a little pat of butter on it would have been nice as well.   The mashed potatoes...what the what??? Delicious! I wasn't expecting the flavor I got from them so when I took my first bite, my eyes got big and I immediately told my one coworker that he needed to try his because they were tasty.  Last, BUT NOT LEAST, my coworkers surprised me and told the server that it is my birthday today (first annual 29th, woohoo!) and they brought me an icecream sundae. It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and nuts. Now, I know that sounds plain but it was not even close to plain. The ice cream tasted like they made it in the restauarant. If they did, that's pretty awesome; it was QUALITY. The chocolate sauce was legit. It was real chocolate, not that gunk in the brown sqeeze bottle (you know what I'm talking about). It was the perfect ending to the perfect meal.   Everyone at our table loved their food. Some got burgers, some got salmon, a few raved about the amish mac & cheese. I was too involved in my meal to pay more attention to their comments.  I will definitely be back, hopefully with my husband so he can experience Cedar Creek Grille. I really want to try the steak frites next time."}
{"text":"Cedar Creek Grille is one of our favorite date night spots, as well as a good place to bring out-of-town guests. It's classy with good food, but not pretentious and has a great menu, drink list and wine list-- what more could you want?  My favorite entrees are the crab cakes and the Cajun shrimp pasta; the pasta is very rich, but delicious. My husband is partial to the steak frites, and has liked the other steak options as well. I've also heard good things about the trout and burger. The French onion soup is only okay, but the lobster bisque is great. While pretty much everywhere has bread, the bread here is top notch and hard to resist.  Service is always knowledgeable and usually pretty responsive, but occasionally we've \"lost\" our server after getting our entree, making it difficult to get a new drink or the check.  It gets a bit loud, but the setting is pretty, especially on the patio in the summer. Weirdly, the restroom is in the mall down the escalator quick a distance away. There's usually plenty of parking. I haven't tried it yet, but the happy hour looks pretty excellent, and they have brunch as well.  If you're looking for a nice night out on the east side, Cedar Creek might just fit the bill."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of my staples. Convenient location, good food, great ambience. But in the last couple months it has been nothing but disappointing. The service is horrible, when you can even get service. Your food comes out wrong, you may never get water, don't order any drinks from the bar because you won't see those, and the waits are getting ridiculous. Unless you know someone working in the kitchen or someone who's a server, I don't recommend going."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this relatively new fine dining establishment at the corner of Cedar and Richmond roads. It sits where Melange used to be, but boy... Cedar Creek owners seems to have spared no expenses in decking this place out. They've extended the space for ample dining areas, which are beautifully designed and decorated - elegant, but simple; not over the top.  On to the food... got a bowl of lobster bisque with my 14 oz. sirloin steak with a side of corn slaw salad. Steak was perfectly medium... oh so tender and juicy! I cleared my plate, salad, too. While I can't say I'm an expert on lobster bisque, I enjoyed theirs. Went with kids; tips for parents - they don't have a printed kids menu but they can make just about whatever your kids may want on the fly... mac & cheese, chicken fingers, bowl of pasta, burger, etc. I was impressed!  On to the desert... we got to try the chocolate pot de creme and the pomegranate and black raspberry sorbet. I'm not huge on chocolate, but the pot de creme had perfect texture. Surprisingly, and by accident, combining the sorbet with the pot de creme made an awesome complimentary pair! The sorbet is probably the best I've had.  Service by Caitlyn (sp?) was awesome. She was personable, attentive and helpful.  Lastly, while our entire experience went off without a hitch, I just left one star out because I wish this place is a little more affordable. Great place, great food, great service... an establishment that I'd love to frequent, but most without a ton of disposable income would probably have to plan for."}
{"text":"Great specials! I had the Tilefish which was served with risotto and wilted spinach, loved it. My friend ordered the rib eye - good but not extravagant the onion rings didn't seem to be mad in house. Cocktails are good as well, the cider mule was nice to try this time of year. Very loud - not a great place for an intimate date night."}
{"text":"I really like Cedar Creek Grille. I've been here many times for Mother's Day brunches and small gatherings and I've never had a bad experience here. Each time, is perfect like the last. I came for Sunday brunch today and ordered the Belgian waffle, home fries and bacon and my mom ordered the crab cake  benedict.  I tried some of hers. It came with a baby kale salad with this lemon vinaigrette dressing that is phenomenal. Blew my mind how good it is. All in all, any day is a good day to eat at Cedar Creek Grille."}
{"text":"I was unsure to try this place with three stars, but I am so glad I did! The service is friendly and the atmosphere is nice. My family and I came in here for lunch and we enjoyed the food. The Cobb Salad was great, the French Onion Soup was good. I give off a review because I believe that the price is a little exaggerated for the area and what you get. With a little bit more affordability, this place hits all the stars!"}
{"text":"The waitress was extremely inattentive to say the least.All of the food for a party came out intermittently . Some of us were done eating and others still hadn't gotten their food.And some of the food was wrong. I would never go there again. Even the place settings were not clean. I expected more . The only thing that was \"more\" was the bill! $25. For tacos and a soft drink!! bad experience.  Pat T."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was overall good.  The atmosphere was perfect....nice but not too stuffy.  The service was good. Our waitress was very attentive.  We were a bit disappointed about the limited menu options and felt the prices were a bit steep.  However, everything we ordered was wonderful (chop chop salad, salmon, asparagus, and mashed potatoes) and worth the money.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great meal the other night. I had a great Manhattan one of their specialty drinks. Service was good and my trout entree was excellent. My wife had the swordfish entree and she was very pleased with that as well. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Was here aout 3 weeks ago on a Friday night. Love the drink choices; the specialty drinks come in old fashioned jars. I enjoyed the Caesar Salad and Lobster Bisque. I like the atmosphere; great place to visit after work with friends. I'm sure once it warms up, people will sit in the outer area. The place is very cleaned up; it used to be Melange and I didn't enjoy going in there because it was so cramped for no reason."}
{"text":"Sequins & Fur Coats. Ties & Sports Coats. 30-45 minute wait. Surrounded by 70 - 80 year olds. On a Wednesday night.  Wait. . .what?!  I had little to no expectations for this very new restaurant. You'd think this would make me easy to please, no? Well, no.  All I wanted to do is meet a couple of my friends for a drink and a small bite to eat. I arrived early and grabbed an unsuspecting \"first come / first serve\" tall top in the bar area.   It was so busy, that although my friends were 15 minutes late, I barely received any service. The server was nice enough, but was unattainable and elusive. My friends and I felt like we could never quite get enough. Anything.  My friends and I love a quality martini and some great wine - however, with the minimal service, we ordered only a drink each.   The menu is unimaginative and very limited. I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were just fine - nothing special. My friends, disenchanted, each ordered salads.  The decor reminded me of Bravo or Brio. . .oh wait! It's the same ownership, now that makes sense. BORING.  Unfortunately, Cedar Creek Grille does not give me any reason to come back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a mother's day brunch here today. On the positive side: excellent service; in fact, outstanding for a restaurant in the Cleveland suburbs, much better than what we usually experience. We were made to feel very welcome, even with elderly grandma needing some extra attention, and the pace was leisurely, with no one rushing us to turn over the table. And very comfortable, with nice-sized tables, room between the tables, and nice linens--much more comfortable than most of the local restaurants. Overall, a professionally-run restaurant by any standards, which is very unusual here in our hometown, and a real pleasure to experience. About the brunch, the food was very good with a nice omelette station, good selection, frequent refreshing of the food on offer, and a nice bloody mary station. A little pricey ($45 for the mother's day brunch, plus tip).  Overall, a very nice meal and a relaxing and truly enjoyable mother's day experience-- will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Possibly the poorest and most insulting service my family and I have ever received. Our waiter took 15 minutes to come over after we sat down, took another 15 to bring us our drinks, and then another 30 for our food. But the worst problem was we ordered two appetizers and specifically told them to space them out so we didn't get our entrées on top of the appetizers. But not only did the entrées come first, but the appetizers never came. We asked for the manager and when she came over she stared us down like we were disrupting her night. They comped the meal (which also was extremely underwhelming - and they never brought the appetizers), but we will NEVER go back. Save yourselves the aggravation and do not go there."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Friday night with some friends. Very nice looking inside, it definitely had a better appearance than I expected in a strip center near the mall.   The food was good, beer and wine choices were decent. Probably a bit pricier than I liked for the portion sizes.  (At least for the location. I would expect this more from a downtown restaurant) I was also surprised at the limitations on substitutions for side dishes. The service was ok, but our server seemed a little awkward, we thought maybe he was new.   I thought it was overall a nice place, though I don't think it would be in my \"go to\" list of restaurants. It's probably worth the drive downtown to get a little better for the same money."}
{"text":"I am absolutely shocked by the negative reviews on here. I went with my family on Christmas Eve and we agreed it was the best meal we've had at a Cleveland restaurant in a long time.   I made a reservation a few days in advance so we were shown right to our table. The atmosphere is comfortable but classy- well-lit, a reasonable noise level, and framed photographs of Cleveland landmarks adorning the walls. The table was a bit tight, but not too uncomfortable.   We ordered three appetizers: crab crake crisp (small serving but good), jumbo gulf shrimp (delicious!) and bruschetta (not a fan of artichokes, so can't comment on this one). We also ordered a couple bottles of red wine (Malbec) for the table, on the recommendation of our waitress, who was friendly but not outstanding.  For my entree, I ordered the cedar plank salmon, which was fantastic- very flavorful and cooked to perfection. It came with crispy golden french fries and out-of-this-world coleslaw. My dad even ordered his own side of coleslaw with his filet mignon because he (a coleslaw superfan) said it was the best he's ever tasted.  My family also enjoyed their entrees- another salmon, a couple steaks and a burger. Overall, the meal was pricey but worth it. We agreed the food was excellent and can't wait to go back and try more dishes. Give Cedar Creek Grille a shot!!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent critic and vowed never to voluntarily return, however I went back today with my lunch group-not my choice.  I was pleasantly surprised by the new menu and delicious food.  Service, which has always been an issue was excellently performed by \"David.\"  Has this place turned it around?  Stay tuned as I will give it another chance.  Maybe there is hope as CedarCreek is conveniently located."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and had excellent food each time. Steak frites is dinner favorite and comes with béarnaise and salad. The wild grain salad with sandwiches is yummy - I want the recipe!  Plenty of cheese on the onion soup and chef made a special request sandwich from an earlier menu as well. Nice decor too."}
{"text":"Nice place but  food and Service sucks... Will not go back! So many other places where u pay money and u will get good service and Food!"}
{"text":"We visited this place because all the other restaurants around the area were packed.  There was no wait and were immediately seated.  The environment of the restaurant is kinda upscale and classy.  I had the salmon burger and my boyfriend had the brunch special, steak and eggs.  The salmon burger was cooked perfect, the buns were crispy and had a little buttery taste to it.  My boyfriend said the steak was cooked perfectly and they even cut it up for you.  Our bill was not bad for an upscale restaurant (around $30).  The staff was professional, but also friendly at the same time."}
{"text":"This place is ok. My husband and I went for our anniversary as it is more upscale but you don't have to dress fancy. The inside décor and setting is very nice. The candles were not lit on our table and about halfway through our stay, someone came by and lit them. The service was very, very slow and non-attentive. We had to ask for drink refills and our food took about 45 minutes to arrive. Our appetizer only came out 5 minutes before our meals. The food did taste pretty good, but I don't think we would go back again based on our first experience."}
{"text":"We had a very acceptable meal with attentive service......until....as we sat enjoying the end of the meal kitchen staff threw a giant, open waterfall,of loose garbage that looked like vomit over a wall right in front of us!  Totally gross!  What in the world were they thinking?  We spoke to \"the manager\" ( as did the people at the table next to us) and he proceeded to tell us that due to construction they had no choice but to throw the garbage over the wall!  He actually tried to blame it on the landlord of the shopping center!   You mean they couldn't wait until we were out of the restaurant? Not exactly what I would call an apology. To say the least,we (as very regular customers) were extremely disappointed in the management's lack of interest."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu is over priced and not available anywhere except the bar, so tacos are $3 more at a table??? Long wait for the food also."}
{"text":"Terrible service..waited over one hour and wasn't asked once if I would like to order. The waitress walked right by my table and didn't even acknowledge me right after asking every table around me if they needed anything more. Just terrible service. I made reservations 5 day's in advance and I knew what I wanted to order. Informed the manager. He apologized and sat me at another table. Still no service! Worst experience ever. Not to mention the place is outdated and unkept. Tables and restaurant had visible dirt all over. Bad I cant even rate One star. 2  hours and still not asked what I'd like to order?? Wow. Save your time and money.  I had to rate one star. App wouldn't let me continue. No way, Not even One star."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a Father's Day brunch.  Pros:  The decor was lovely. And the waiter was attentive....  Negatives: Pricey.  We paid over $70 for 2 people for brunch. (1 app, soup and 2 entrees, no alcohol).   Food was bland, not original or impressive.  Very Boring. Small portions for the price. And worst of all - my husband got food poisoning right after eating there!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp bowl for 2 was great! When it first came out I was unsure if it would be filling. It actually succeeded and we had leftovers. Everything was great including the service, with the exception of the lobster bisque....it could be a tad thicker and more flavorful."}
{"text":"Beautiful!  Stopped for lunch while traveling from out of town.  I had a squash, kale and blue cheese salad with chicken, yummy and healthy.  My husband had a burger and fries.  We loved long crispy fries.  Our server was cheerful and polite.  Would love to stop back when the outside seating is open and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Perfectly acceptable mall restaurants full of mature eaters. The menu is very traditional and the drink choices are yummy.  My big complaint was with the noise level. It was very challenging to hear our dining companions just across the table. Ambient noise made for a less than stellar experience.  Wouldn't run back to this place."}
{"text":"came here three times.  The first and 2nd time the food was great!  went there the 3rd time yesterday and my artichoke heart was burned; and I ordered my usualy pork chop, it was burned and very dry.  the manager addressed the issue in a timely manner and they redid the pork chops, the new ones were made just like the 1st and 2nd time.   I think their customer service is great; however, there is room for improvement for food consistency.  (uploaded my burned food pictures)"}
{"text":"I want to like this place more. Yes, it is true, there is a nice classic ambiance, a beautiful bar and a solid selection of drafts. But three elements about Cedar Creek prevent me from giving a higher rating:  1. Perhaps it's the Amish way to cook an Amish organic chicken over salted, but somehow I doubt it. My chicken was so salty, it was hardly bearable.  2. The chicken was not cooked through all the way, there was blood inside of it.  3. Our waitress forgot to bring us the beer, but tried to cover up for it by saying that the bar is running behind. It was a flat out lie as I could see her go to the bar, talk to the bartender and bring the beer 1 minute later. Come on, do you take me for an idiot?"}
{"text":"Summary: Food 4 stars, decor 4 stars, price 2 stars, service 3 stars.  Decor: We sat on the covered outdoor veranda/patio which was very nice.  Service: The service was knowledgable and friendly, but getting waters refilled was a bit of a struggle.  Food: The bread was very good but they only gave 2 pieces for 2 people which isn't nearly enough.  The crab cake entree was good and the shrimp entree was very good.  The side of kale was awesome and I'd recommend it for a salad starter.  Price: 20% too high.  The crab cake entree was $24 for 2 crab cakes!  Their prices are more appropriate in downtown Chicago than Beachwood."}
{"text":"I walked into Cedar Creek Grille to check out their happy hour and instantly noticed that the average age of patrons was about 50. I'm no ageist, but...I thought the crowd might have been a little younger during happy hour.   I'm giving Cedar Creek Grille 3 stars ONLY because they have Moscow Mules on their happy hour menu. And they serve them in copper mugs. Beyond that, I was pretty underwhelmed. The bar area was packed with lots of suit wearing gentleman and a couple older couples getting fresh. (avert thine eyes!) There were two frazzled looking bartenders who never seemed to be around when my party needed them. I had to flag them down to order another drink and they seemed to be bothered when I asked for water for the three of us.   The happy hour and regular menus aren't very veg friendly, so I was a sad panda while my friends ate tacos. Had the bartenders asked me if I'd wanted another drink, I would have gotten one. Instead, I played with my silverware. Fun times.  On the bright side, my drinks were good. I've had plenty of bad Moscow Mules, so that was a plus. But...I was turned off by the poor service and stuffy atmosphere. I won't be in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Wednesday at 6:30 PM on our way home from work for what we thought would be a well executed experience based on previous visits and were very disappointed.  It had been about 6 months since our last visit, and while I still love the atmosphere, the service left a very bad impression.  We ordered two salads the Steak Frites and the wood frilled Trout.  The restaurant was half full and it took nearly an hour to get our food.  When it did arrive, it was obvious the steak had been cooked first, and had sat.  The fries were cool and soggy, and the steak, while perfectly cooked, was room temperature.  We were watching both on duty managers hovering around the kitchen and serving the meals as they came out.  The manager did comp our drinks, but it seemed like he was having to do that for everyone.    I am not sure I will return, and after reading the other reviews it is obvious there is a problem with the team running Cedar Creek that needs to be fixed ASAP if this place is to turn around the poor experiences and survive.  I hope the do figure it out, because I would return if they can fix the issues, but if will definitely check reviews before I return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food, decor and service were fabulous!  Burger was amazing. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"They have the best brunch and lunch in Beachwood  the egg Benedict and burgers, steak and fries, Amish chicken delicious"}
{"text":"Im shocked that Cedar Creek doesn't have higher reviews! We have only had fabulous experiences here for both lunch and dinner. The French onion soup is divine! They sadly took the crab cakes off the menu, they were so tasty! They do steak perfectly. Portions are large, especially for lunch, so you won't go hungry!"}
{"text":"A return visit was enjoyable.  The food was good and our server, Amber, was terrific.  My group was satisfied, but our lunch, including a liberal tip, was $25!  For that price, the food should have been outstanding, which it was not.  Management seems to be lacking.  With the pedigree of the owners, it should be excellent."}
{"text":"Food was on point  Mac and cheese was amazing  will be back  service was good. Ask for Max."}
{"text":"I stopped in this place on a whim after classes. Very nice decor. I chose to sit at the bar. For 3pm on a weekday it was decent. The bartender greeted me I ordered the dirty martini extra dirty. It was on their happy hour menu for 7 bucks. Trust me when I say I received a glass full of vodka. Which is why this review is getting 3 stars. I asked for more olives and olive juice to try to balance it there was no hope. I never thought I could ever have a bad dirty martini in life, this was it. I ordered food the veggie burger with Fries. I loved loved loved the veggie burger best one I've had in the area this far. The fries that accompanied were shoestring.I really wish there had been a pickle to accompany a nice meal. No such luck. Overall will stop back for a veggie burger may just grab a beer next time."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat brunch or lunch before shopping at the mall. Great atmosphere, nice staff, and the breakfast potatoes are or should be award winning. I would go back just for a wheel barrow loaded with those potatoes."}
{"text":"The ambiance is worth 5 stars, and the service is excellent.  The Menu could have more non-meat entrees on it.  If you want a nice dining experience this is the place."}
{"text":"I went today on my lunch hour at 2:15 and it was not busy.  I ordered the Cobb Salad $14.00.  I waited around 15 minutes which was fine someone other than my server dropped the salad off and left.  I noticed right away that the salad was missing the bacon.  I waited to let my server know so she could bring the bacon and I could eat my lunch.  Around 20 minutes later she asked how everything was?  I told her about the missing bacon.  Her response was, \"oh, we are out of bacon\".  Well if your out of bacon tell someone that when the order the  $14.00 salad.  I asked for the check and she asked me if I wanted the salad to go?    Umm no.  If I was going to eat the salad I would have eaten it in the restaurant.  I spoke to the manager before I left and he didn't understand why I was dissapointed.  He tried to give me a gift card.  I told him he could keep it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. The decour was very nice and warm , including the bathroom.I got the Amish chicken with the smoked Mac & Cheese on the side. My girlfriend got the steak and frites. The chicken was smokey herbie deliciousness and the Mac and cheese was smokie,cheesy & crispy. The was  steak juicy and flavorful but the frites(fries) good but nothing special. We ended our meal with the crème brulé it was good but it came with a strawberry that was just sitting on top of it. The problem that is our knives had be taken already & I think a fanned out strawberry would have been more pleasing to the eyes and easier to eat. Overall I really liked the food. My only complaint would be the lack of variety with the appetizers. Nothing jumped out at me like I have to have this before my meal. The service was pretty good. The staff was friendly without feeling like they were faking it. I would advise anyone looking to go to Cedar Creek Grill not to wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there for a rehearsal dinner for a dear friend. They had reserved the back patio with a private bar and three course meal. Our menu had the 'Grilled Cobb Salad' or the 'Cesar Salad' as the salad. The 'Cajun Shrimp Pasta' or the 'Chicken Parmesan'. And finally, the Creme Brûlée or a Sunday.    Everything was delicious, we spilt the menu between the two of us and everything was delicious. The staff was friendly and funny. Good wine and beer.   Definitely would recommend for a private party."}
{"text":"I don't believe that I have ever seen a more professional wait staff then I saw at this restaurant today. They are very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive without hovering. Our server, David, gave us outstanding recommendations for our meals. The food was excellent and we can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"My teenage son and I decided to have dinner out and his choice was this restaurant.  We had previously dined here and I said I'd never go back as it was overpriced, poor service, and the food was terrible.  This visit, however, was nothing short of outstanding.  Chris, our waiter, was articulate, very knowledgable about the menu, and seemed to perfectly time his checkins with us.  My son had the veal meatballs to start.  They were gone in 1 minute and he loved them.  I had a Caesar salad.  Very safe option, tasty, but I wish it had had croutons instead of salty bread wafers.  For dinner my son had the rainbow trout and I had the petite filet dinner with Bernaise.  Son loved the trout, very flavorful.  My filet was mid-well instead of medium, but the flavor was there so I didn't haggle about that.  Overall a great dining experience.  If I had to make a recommendation to the restaurant, try to seat people further from the live music.  The artist was great and we enjoyed listening to him, but I don't enjoy shouting to have a conversation with the person I'm dining with.  Have the tables much further away from the music or just don't seat people in those nearest the action."}
{"text":"A must for dining in the area!  Fabulous menu!  Recommend fire roasted artichokes...even if you thought you didn't like them."}
{"text":"My Mom and I decided to give this place a try last week. Oh boy, we're we both sorry! It's very loud, Mom and I had trouble hearing each other, sitting at the same table together. We were served room temperature water without ice. The most positive thing I can say is, it was definitely wet. Our meals were very expensive and underwhelming. Once was more than enough. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The deviled eggs we ordered were WAAAAAY too salty. I ended up smearing the filling on my bread, which tasted pretty good but shouldn't have been necessary. I will say that my walleye was perfectly cooked and very tasty, but the risotto it was served over was a gloppy mess. Overall, for the price we paid for dinner I would expect much better. Our waiter was very pleasant but the staff had a habit of congregating around the bar and loudly discussing their personal lives - one waitress in particular's voice I was pretty sick of by the time the check came. In some restaurants I wouldn't have cared but it always annoys me in more up-scale places."}
{"text":"Casual food elevated, I would describe it. Everything they do, they do well. You can enjoy happy hour on the couches by the fireplace or at the beautiful bar with craft cocktails or martinis. You can have a great salad or sandwich. You can have fresh seafood or a prime NY strip. Service was fantastic and the space is tastefully designed. We really enjoyed it, the only negative is, you'll pay for it. In my opinion the listing should be $$$, many of the entrees are under $30 but after a drink and tip you're looking at more like $50 per person. But it's a very nice place, so you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Food is spectacular every time I attend. The service is great and I can tell management runs a tight shift from top to bottom. I love the ambiance and the waiters make me feel so important. Haven't been in a month, but from what I remember the tables are always set beautifully as well."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned about coming here after looking at the reviews, but the staff was prompt and beyond friendly. The food was fantastic and worth the price, in my opinion. Every member of our party very much enjoyed their food and the experience overall."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner, great classic food, nice atmosphere and the price was kinda high but overall I enjoyed it nonetheless ..."}
{"text":"OMG!! This place has the Best Steaks!! We order the NY Strip and the Center Cut....when I tell you these steaks were like cuttingg butter. Whew!! I will only come here to cure my steak cravings for now on!!"}
{"text":"We had an absolutely fabulous meal last night at the Cedar Creek grille.  The sea bass, sirloin and walleye special were all outstanding!  The horseradish mashed potatoes we're melt in your mouth good!  Great wines and a wonderful homemade ice cream sundae to top it all off!  Cedar Creek is a wonderful addition to the Cleveland dining scene- bravo!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the areas more premier restaurants. Tasteful decor, quiet environment. Menu lacks some variety for a budget brunch or dinner. A bit pricey but the food is worth the money. Ribeye, medium rare is my recommendation. Grilled to perfection. Rivals Hyde Park. Start with the Tomato Bisque soup. It's wonderful. Courteous staff. Service was as expected. Could use a few more local craft beer offerings. Overall pleasant experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I received a really nice message from the manager telling me that they were working out the kinks that come with being brand new and to come visit them again. I finally was over in that area and tried again. What a difference! The staff was a well-oiled machine and I didn't feel like I was crushed in a booth with other tables inches away. The service was great and the food was great. That chopped salad is the cat's meow. I tried the fish tacos this time and my minor suggestion is that it's too much tortilla, not enough filling. But the fish tasted great. Will definitely add this to my east side go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"I've dined here a total of 3 times. 2/3 have been just terrible. Both of my bad experiences were within a week of each other. From the time it took to get greeted by a server, to waiting over 10 minutes (or longer) for our drinks... to being at our table for over a hour and a half just to be told that basically everything everyone at my table ordered was no longer available. Ended up leaving with just having ate some fries and an app after close to 2 hours of being there. The manager was nice, but didn't really seem phased to the fact that we left very unsatisfied... and hungry. The whole dinner became almost comical after the server (who was very kind) and manager had to come over several separate times to tell us they didn't have what we ordered.   I really had high expectations after my first visit, but I will not be back after my last 2."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other evening and had a great time! We had an excellent server and I loved the ambience.  The menu is not very big and doesn't step outside the box, but everything ordered was delicious and and well-prepared. We started with the calamari trio appetizer, which was great. I had the Idaho rainbow trout and my fiancé had the center cut filet. Both meals were excellent! Get the key lime pie if you have room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Nice change from what was there. Good food. Pricey interior is freshly renovated and nicely done."}
{"text":"I love coming here! They always have great food at a good cost! I will most defiantly recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My Mom and I went with two friends on Sunday night. Happens to be a favorite spot for mom. We had the grilled artichoke appetizer. Very nice! The steaks were disappointing as was the service (to say the least) my friend and I split the rib eye. We ordered it Medium rare. It was raw. I'll give you the readers digest version and tell you I had to send it back it twice and the server was less than pleasant about it. Never sent a manager over. She seemed put out to say the least. The steak was not delicious by any means. I'm glad my mom was happy with hers though. At the end of the meal our sever muttered something about a desert for our trouble. So kind of her, dontcha think? The bill was still over 200.00 and we still tipped her 20%. Not deserved, but I didn't want to embarrass my family. I emailed the restaurant and received no response. So seriously a terribly experience I don't want to repeat.  I hope it's better for those of you who venture in."}
{"text":"They have brunch 1100-1500 on Saturdays and Sundays. The brunch menu was underwhelming to say the least - it has 5 things on it, 3 of them being omelettes. I'd skip this place for brunch just because of the small menu.   If you just want lunch food for brunch that's a different story. The full lunch menu is served at the same time the brunch menu is offered. I had the Faroe salmon which is served cedar plank style. It came with a generous helping of house-cut fries and coleslaw ($17). I ordered it well and it came out perfectly. My friend ordered the prime sirloin steak. It was served sliced. He ordered it well and it did not look burnt, but there was definitely no pink left. It was served with a pile of arugula and the same house cut french fries I had ($17.5).   The restaurant decor is really awesome! I remember this place from when it was the French restaurant Orange. It looks so much better and it unrecognisable! The atmosphere now is a chic, boat house style decor. Nautical, but not over the top. A really classic, fresh atmosphere.   Service was unobtrusive. The waiter kept the water glasses filled. Even though he left a bottle of water on the table he kept stopping by to fill our glasses for us. He wasn't super chatty, just efficient. I've had more memorable services, but I must admit memorable is not always better. No technical complaints here."}
{"text":"I didn't love it at first.  It took time. Maybe they had growing pains, maybe I expected too much.  But I have grown to really enjoy this spot.  The atmosphere is urbane, and the menu has a great selection of entrees and the CCG offers what I believe to be the best happy hour specials around the east side.  The drinks and apps are reduced to merely dollars, and it's appreciated in this area of expensive dining. One night we started at a restaurant across the street in Legacy Village that boasted that they had the best happy hour. Well, when we found out it was only on apps and not on their 12 dollar cocktails, we bailed to CCG, and I was sold.  Been a fan ever since.  My wife LOVES the grilled artichoke appetizer, and I often order whatever special is featured off the daily menu.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Service is subpar for the price - server rarely checked on the table, gave us no sense of welcome/appreciation, slow in clearing table, one meal (only kid meal ordered) came out five minutes later than all other meals.  We saw more people walking out the side door for a break than we saw working on a Sunday evening.  Stuffed artichokes were dry and lacked any meat.  Fish sandwich was very small, sauce on the pasta was over-powering, chicken was not warm.  Frankly, not sure any of the ten people in my party thought the meal was anything worth the price.  Menu was pretty unimaginative, would not go back."}
{"text":"This place is kinda okay. The decor is really nice but I haven't really been here in a while (maybe 3-4 years) because I moved out of the area. I should've gotten a burger or a salad or something better than what I got. I ordered the lobster bisque, which the waiter said was \"pretty good\", but I think they put a little too much milk in it or something because it was sweet and way too thick."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good service. Menu has lots variety. Had strip steak. Did not need a steak knife to cut it, but was a bit chewy. Others had salmon and Chilean sea bass. Was not bad, but have had better elsewhere. Salads and calamari were very good. Nice place to try with good company."}
{"text":"Cedar Creek offers a great ambience for both business and dating outings.  The menu offers both mainstays and eclectic tastebud adventures.  Staff has always been attentive, but not impeccable service.  It's not a Hyde Park or ML Tavern experience, but it is a refreshing step up compared to other local options like Maggiano's or Cheesecake Land.  I consistently choose Cedar Creek over Gamekeepers.  Happy hour deals are good too."}
{"text":"I have NO idea why this place got such subpar reviews. I went for dinner and ordered the prosciutto salad and special-- halibut over creamed corn, wild rice, and asparagus. I split both with my mother and let the waitress know that ahead of time. The cooks were amazing! They split both the salad and entrees for us with extremely generous portions. My only complaint was that the asparagus was a little overdone for my taste. I will absolutely come back. Fantastic service. Great portion size when splitting. Very generous all around. A definite must with a romantic environment."}
{"text":"Cool place for happy hour and brunch! Happy hour 3-7pm featuring a number of classic apps- tacos, mini sliders, veal meatballs, loaded fries, and calamari just to name a few. Drink specials too. Their cranberry Moscow mule is so tasty (a winter special). Loaded fries, chips and onion dip are both fantastic. Taco special was a mahi mahi taco with jalapeños mango salsa! Very good! Happy hour goers must sit at the bar or the lounge area. Bartenders and servers are not always the most friendly, but it's worth it because the food on the happy hour menu is such a good deal!   Brunch crab eggs Benedict and mimosa were a fabulous combination. Came with fresh fruit too! A really good meal!!  Classy leather couches with fireplaces throughout. Crowd tends to be middle aged men and women for whatever reason. Not a bad thing, just an observation! Still a good place to take a date for good food!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and I wanted to give it a try again. Weather was nice so we got to sit on the semi-open bar patio area which was a great atmosphere. The has always been just ok, and nothing special. Don't get me wrong, it was good. Prices are on the higher side. I got the Caesar salad to start which was yummy and the crab cakes for my entree which were decent. Nothing to go crazy over. Service was just ok as well."}
{"text":"Was looking for a restaurant to host a work meeting dinner. I was needing a fine balance between a little upscale, but not too over the tip pricey and this was a perfect fit! Not to mention it's very close to the freeway and easily accessible. Plus it has its own parking lot. I always love a place with it's own parking lot.  Food itself was better than good, but not eyes rolling back orgasmic. Kudos to the wait staff, who were attentive, efficient and friendly. Had fresh bread for starters (warm, soft), followed by a green salad with a balsamic vinagrette. I thought it was a generous portion for a side salad, and I actually thought that this was better than my main meal. I got the salmon, medium rare. Came with a side of french fries and cole slaw. It was moist, but it was just plain salmon, nothing distinctive.   Overall, I think this was place was good but did not leave me with the impression that I can't wait to go back."}
