{"text":"There were quite a few good eats, but their chicken could have been beat by fast food. Maybe I wasn't being risky enough. Nice free appetizers start the meal though."}
{"text":"Being a Korean born American, I'm always looking for Korean restaurant and double bonus points if the restaurant is good. I have tried all the restaurants in Pittsburgh that proclaim they serve Korean food and have been mollified with mediocrity on many occasions. That is why I think think this is by far the best Korean restaurant in the 'burgh. 

One of the best things I liked about Dasonii was that there was no pretense about it being a Chinese or Japanese restaurant that serves Korean food on the side. I understand that sometimes you need to cater to the unwashed masses but Korean food should be celebrated as it's own style that can stand by itself. Pittsburgh can be rather parochial at times, so imagine my surprise when I ordered the appetizers and I asked if the dumplings were Chinese dumplings (aka pot stickers) or Korean mandoo. The waitress told me that they were homemade mandoo and acted like I should expect nothing less! 

The dining area was neat and clean without too many gawdy Asian decorations. The waitress was prompt and provided our table of seven (2 adults and 5 children) with great service. We had two Korean food virgins with us that were picky eaters so we stuck to the tried-and-true dishes that just about everyone likes. We ordered the fried mandoo, seafood and scallion pajan, dot sim bi bim bap, bulgoki, chicken bulgoki and jap chee. Everything was great! Not quite like mom used to make but certainly as good as food I had in Seoul. We will certainly be back to try the more \"traditional\" Korean dishes Dasonii has to offer."}
{"text":"I love Korean food and I love sushi, this place has both.   I first came here with a Groupon and have been been back a couple time since.  They have the standard Korean items like bulgogo, kalbi, bibimbob, which are all very good.  What makes this place special thoguh is that they also have items like the dumpling soup that make you feel like you're at home in your mom's kitchen and she's made you a warming heartfelt meal.  

It is in a really unassuming location.  Look for Golf Galaxy, their sign is much larger, and its a couple doors down. =)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write up a review here on this place.  I've been on a quest for Korean food since moving to Pittsburgh.  I think I've found my place!

I've been here for lunch a couple of times and then for dinner tonight.  All 3 times have been spot on with the food - service is a little unpredictable but I'll still give them 5 stars!

Here's what I've had so far:
- kalbi (beef short ribs) lunch 
- bulgogi lunch
- bulgogi dinner
- Philadelphia roll
- shrimp tempura roll
- California roll

The lunch is by far a much better deal.  You get a miso soup, salad, dumplings and 4 pieces of California roll with your entree.  The kalbi is so delicious.  

The dinner portion of bulgogi ($16) tonight was huge and delicious.  Plus, a whopping 5 side dishes.  I gobbled up the rice and kimchi - I asked for seconds of both and there was still a few bites of bulgogi leftover.

Sushi was OK - not their strongest item here but it's always great going to a Korean place that has some additional options.  The rest of my family doesn't enjoy Korean cuisine but sushi suits them just fine.  We all win at Dasonii."}
{"text":"It's warming up in Pittsburgh, finally!! My daughter, and I were tired of the usual, and after a long weekend (Memorial Day), decided we needed to get back in touch with our roots. We got to Dasonii, shortly after opening time for lunch, and noticed a few changes to the interior since our last visit, closed off kitchen, and only one waitress. 

We were seated promptly, and ordered the mung bean pancake as an appetizer. The creamy texture with different bites of kimchi, and pork, had a good flavor, a little bland, and not as large as the seafood, or kimchi pancakes. 

The Naengmyun caught my attention, as I was scanning the menu over. Naengmyun is a summertime dish of cold buckwheat noodles, in a beef broth, chilled with ice. A nice alternative to hot, heavy foods during warmer months. I couldn't wait to eat! My daughter settled with bulgogi. 

My bowl of Naengmyun was okay, a little too salty for my taste. The noodles were nicely chewy, topped with half a boiled egg. There were a few large slices of beef that were a bit tough. The large cucumber slices looking like sliced zucchini, were the saltiest thing in the bowl. There was no offering of hot Chinese mustard, or white vinegar on the side, which are traditionally served with the dish. (You don't even ask for these at other restaurants they just come with your order). I ate all the solids, but skipped on finishing the broth, which was salty, and had no ice. 
The bulgogi my daughter had was pretty standard, a little sweeter than we're used too, but she enjoyed it. The panchan (side dishes) this time around were average, roasted potatoes were salty, marinated tofu was okay, the vegetables, (sprouts, broccoli, radish kimchi, and kimchi) a little bland, but decent. The food hit the spot, but could've been better."}
{"text":"I had the Dolsot Bibimbap (rice, beef, veggies, chili paste, with a raw egg on top in a hot stone bowl) was so good! The rice got crunchy because of the heat of the bowl which added to the texture. It was a beautiful looking dish dish that tasted even better than it looked. 
My friend had a fried rice with shrimp and veggies, which was pretty good too! We also ordered the seafood salad. They put imitation crab on the salad and they say that up front. I appreciate that. The salad also has raw octopus. Yummers! 
A big plus for that salad dish was the romaine lettuce. None of the iceberg lettuce crap. 
Great service, btw.
My fave part of the meal? The pickled jalapeno! Came with the banchan, it was not spicy and kind of sweet. Not vinegar-y either. Me no likes vinegar."}
{"text":"WOW. Best meal I've had out in quite some time. The Kim Chi pancake is indescribable, just get one. Beef dolsot was good and all but I want more pancake. 

I'll definiately be going back just hopefully with a groupon in hand. 

Only reason the place is not 5 stars is it's a bit over priced and the service is over the top intrusive on occasion."}
{"text":"This is a great place that I worry is overlooked due to its unassuming location in a strip mall among many, many other strip malls.  Seek it out!  I've only been here for lunch, since I'm only in this area during the workweek. What a great deal!  As many have mentioned, the banchan are all delicious - the potatoes are a favorite, but today I had some tofu that was just so flavorful, a real treat.  Whatever they bring is a fun treat worth trying.

I often get the dolsot bibimbap, especially at this time of year, when the sizzling pot is a welcome break from the winter weather. But the Lunch Box is an excellent deal, and a great way to try many things at once. The amount of food you get for $7 or $8 (chicken or pork, respectively, which is what we had), counting the banchan is amazing.  I love that I always leave feeling full, but not overfull, and not queasy from having eaten too much oil or MSG.  The friendliness of the staff is the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"My stomach still hurts from our experience earlier today.  When we got to Dasonii, we were the only ones there.  It's very clean and the atmosphere would be nice if there were more patrons.
We decided to share the kimchi pancake and the jap-chae.  While we were waiting, we snacked on the banchan, which was tasty enough, very mild, but tasty.  
The kimchi pancake came out first.  It wasn't cooked all the way though and it didn't taste like kimchi.  The pancake was overly doughy.  It was too mild to be considered a kimchi pancake.  Just like a pancake with vegetables in it.
The jap-chae was even more disappointing.  When you first tasted the noodles, they tasted sickeningly sweet and heavy.  It apparently had been flavored by the fat of the meat that was mixed into the dish.  
The food was so heavy, that it made both of us feel a little ill.  We couldn't even eat half of our food.  It's been a really long time since i've been so disappointed with a dining experience.  I'm really surprised about all the positive reviews of this place.  Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff ..."}
{"text":"Nice, new place. Nice-looking website. Meh food. 

Please cut back on the salt chef. (this is coming from a Korean mother and talkative members of a Korean church)."}
{"text":"Delicious!  All of our dishes were great but the ribs were the best of the 3 BBQ dishes we had- so tender and flavorful.  The side dishes were very fresh and tasty, too.  I want to go back and try some more adventurous dishes as described in some of the other reviews.  The restaurant is really attractive and clean.  I wish I lived closer!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap and loved it.  The place was rather empty when we arrived but filled up quickly.  Our waitress was very friendly and the service was good.

If you're reading this post-October 2013 and planning to visit them in Robinson Township, you may want to call first.  We were told by the staff that they are moving to the Squirrel Hill area at the end of the month."}
{"text":"We had a really wonderful meal here on Christmas Eve. Banchan was great and home made (try the pickled jalepenos) and our Kalbi, Dol Sot Bibimbap, Bulgogi and Japchae all rivaled (and in many cases exceeded) the quality found in the many bay area Korean places we used to frequent. Can't wait to go back. So far the best korean I've found in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  I'm no huge expert on Korean, but I am a connoisseur of dolsot bibimbap and banchan, and they do those pretty well.  It's a little weird to find one of the best Korean places in town so far out, but it's worth a detour.  (Convenient stop on a trip out to Moon to the drive-in, too.)

Went out on a Friday around 7, and we were seated right away.  It wasn't packed, but it was relatively busy.  We had dolsot bibimbap, veggie and beef, with sushi appetizer.  Sushi was good but not great - seemed fresh, but it was a little loosely packed.  Bibimbap ingredients were excellent, but it was a little cool - the mix itself and the bowl, so it didn't get that nice crusty rice that I so look forward to with bibimbap.  (Could've use a bit more gochujang - the spicy, ketchup-looking sauce - too, and it was about the mildest I've ever had.  I like a bit more kick.)  Banchan - the little appetizer/side dishes - were some of the best I've ever had, definitely the best in Pittsburgh.  Every single one was good.

Service was very attentive - maybe too much so, to the point of being intrusive.  Decor was a little trendy for my taste and a little cold (big tile, stainless tabletops).  The space seemed a bit cavernous, and it was loud given the relatively small crowd - a product of all the hard surfaces.  I don't need kitschy fake Korean, but I guess I think of it as comfort food and want something a little more intimate and warm.  Biggest ding on the space is the siting in a box store strip mall that seems to be on the way downhill.  

This place would be a giant winner in town, so it's worth the drive out if you're craving good Korean food."}
{"text":"What's kind of disappointing about a really cool city like Pittsburgh is its lack of great Korean food and Dasonii bistro can also be added to that list.

Don't get me wrong, if you're craving Korean food, this very well might do the trick, but like Sushi Kim, Korea Garden and Green Pepper, none of the food knocks your socks off and can't compare with that of Annadale, Virginia or Koreatown in NYC.

We got a dolsot bibimbap and soondubu along with the grilled butterfish. The beginning dishes were ok, nothing great and the food also tasted fine. The advantage this place has over some of the others around Pittsburgh is that its relatively good for the price. If you happen to be around Robinson Town Center and want Korean food, give it a shot but don't go out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"You'll find the BEST Korean food in the 'Burgh here...Stumbled upon an ad in City paper and thought I'd give it a try.  The place is a little difficult to find as it is located in the Strip Mall next to Golf Galaxy in Robinson Town Center.  However, once inside it is casually upscale with a clean modern look. The decor may be cool and modern but their food is Authentic and Reminiscent of the traditional Korean Fare.  Most people are probably a little scared to try Korean food, especially because it is new to the Burgh. However, take one trip inside and your mind will be changed forever. Try their Bulgogi Bowl with a fried egg or their Korean BBQ...ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. A MUST TRY. They also have  sushi bar, which I haven't tried yet, but looks good as well."}
{"text":"They closed. :-(  
This was one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, I'm really sad."}
{"text":"I think this place is really more of a 3.5 star place.

I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was empty. 

We ordered a kimchee pancake to share. It was okay.

I ordered the angus beef dolsot bibimbap. To be honest, it was disappointing. There was a decent portion of meat, but too little rice and way too many vegetables. I felt like a third of my bowl was shredded carrots. The bibimbap sauce was more tomato-based than what I am used to. The whole thing wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better bibimbap elsewhere...including at Japanese restaurants.

My boyfriend ordered the angus beef bulgogi. He enjoyed it.

What I really liked was the banchan. The potatoes are amazing! I requested a refill of the potatoes. And their kimchee is pretty tasty. They also gave us sprouts and cucumbers. 

Overall, I got a weird feeling from the waitress/owner(?). It was a semi-awkward dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has been on my husband's radar for awhile now, so we made the drive over to Robinson Township for lunch today. The woman who waited on us was very friendly and helpful. We both ordered hot tea, which is a barley tea, and something I've never had before. The menu is large and well written, with the lunch items listed on the back. We went for dinner size portions, as you get more ban chan with them, and we both really enjoy these little dishes of pickled vegetal yumminess. They were all good here, so much so that we ordered more kim chee and potatoes halfway through our meal. The bulgogi here is different from other places I've had it...marinated and charcoal grilled meat is served on a hot plate with cabbage, onion, carrots and broccoli. The chicken was perfection, but I missed the Korean chili sauce, so she brought us some. The kimchee soup with pork, tofu and rice cakes was delicious. I think I've learned my lesson with this dish; you have to resist the urge to dig right in and let the flavors meld. The rice cakes soften, and the spicy elements of the dish have a chance to marry with the other flavors. Everything was prepared with care here, and we'll be back often to get our fix of delicious Korean food."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great portions for the price, very yummy side dishes.  The bean sprouts and kimchi were a hit.  Lots of options for even picky eaters.  My parents had never had Korean before and I wanted to introduce them to the deliciousness.  Even they loved it!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Sushi not well constructed, fell apart easily. Food good but not as great as described. Server either inexperienced or inattentive, not appearing very familiar with the menu and leaving dishes uncleared. Owner/host checked in on other guests, but not me!"}
{"text":"My rating of Dasonii is four stars, but barely four stars. The food was the saving grace here. The service we got was below my expectations for how slow it was on the night we ate here. Our server was nice enough when she was at our table, but it was the mass amount of time she spent folding napkins while my drink was empty on two occasions that took away from her forced kindness when speaking to us. That's not to say that I'd throw a five star review to this place if I had received better service, though; it'd just be a stronger four star review.

This was my first venture into Korean food, but I've been drooling over the pictures of the food here for a couple months and finally made it out to see if the pictures online tasted the way they look. I really had no idea what to expect as I walked into the door. I like Chinese, enjoy Japanese, love Thai, and can tolerate Indian. It was time to put another country's notch in my belt of food generalizations and Dasonii would set the scene for this event. For how plain the shopping center Dasonii is in, their dining area looks great and adds to the experience.

The small dishes they bring out as a precursor to any food ordered from the menu were good. I haven't the slightest idea what any of it, besides the kimchi, was called, but I could have eaten them in bulk as my meal and been satisfied. Fortunately for me, though, we ordered their fried dumplings as an appetizer. Filled with moist pork and accompanied by what the restaurant calls \"special soy sauce,\" these crispy-on-the-outside morsels were the best dumplings I've ever had hands down. 
I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap and my counterpart ordered a kimchi dish with pork in it. The stone bowl my meal was served in was hot enough, and stayed hot enough, that I could spend an hour and a half eating here and my food would still be steaming hot. That's good in some ways, but bad for the roof of my mouth and taste buds any time I ate from the sides or bottom of the bowl. It was very good, though, and everything tasted fresh. The heat from the stone crisps any rice touching it and the crunch goes along great with the soft vegetables. The sauce provided on the side adds some spice and extra flavor to the meal. While it wasn't bursting at the seams with flavor, I really liked it and would definitely order it again if I found myself back in a restaurant such as Dasonii."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants near Robinson Mall and Ikea. Complimentary appetizer served in traditional Korean way. All entrees are under $15. Try their amazingly good spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"After picking up a rental car at PIT to use for the weekend, my girlfriend and I passed by this place, which I probably wouldn't have visited if I didn't have a car.  The restaurant is located along a small strip mall, next to a Casual Male XL (tip: if you're using google maps, it places the marker slightly past the location if you're coming from the 376.  if you pass McDonalds, you've gone too far.)

First impressions: the restaurant is spankin' clean.  the tables had easy to clean metal surfaces, and the booths were all comfortable to sit in.  we came at 11:09AM, just a few minutes after opening, and we were the 2nd set of patrons besides a small group of three koreans.  later on around noontime (lunchtime), two caucasian groups dressed in business attire came in.  

i'd been craving dolsot bibimbap for over a YEAR now, so i was stoked that i was finally able to have the chance to eat it here. this isn't to be confused with bibimbap, which is the same thing, just without the vital hot stone pot that gives you crispy rice along the edges.  we ordered a dolsot bibimbap, one each, and a soonduboo jjigae (spelling error perhaps), a tofu broth dish (see pictures) with small seafood bits at the bottom, including as little shrimp, one mussel, one miniclam, etc.  Given my sensitive stomach due to lack of sleep (my digestive system refuses to comply when i don't get enough sleep), and the depressing windy rainy day outside, these two warm dishes made me feel fantastic afterwards.

the dolsot  bibimbap was served with a sunnyside up egg(see pictures again). To those who are scared of undercooked eggs, one need not worry; the egg will cook itself if you put it along the edge of the pot.  the rice and everything inside had not been sitting inside the pot for very long, for when i tried to start mixing, the rice came cleanly off the edge, meaning that i needed to leave it for a little bit to get that crispy rice i wanted.  the gochujang (standard chili paste/sauce for bibimbap) was served in a conservative quantity on a small side dish.  this sauce came out slightly sweeter than other places i've tried, so if you're a fan of spicy, i'd recommend you ask if they have anything spicier.  however, it was just spicy enough so that it wouldn't limit the masses from tasting the delicious dish.

The soonduboo jjigae was a perfect accompaniment to my main dish, along with the four side dishes (banchan). each of the side dishes were not the very standard types of banchan i get at most restaurants (see picture, again).  this included a warm tofu in a semi spicy sauce, which had the perfect soft texture that fresh tofu should have; mungbean jello (in picture, the white stuff that's not very easy to pick up with their hollow metal chopsticks), which tasted good with the kimchi; and lastly, some veggie that a food noobie like me couldn't identify. it looked like parsley but didn't seem to be parsley. let me know if you figure out what it is!

the presumed owner (a korean lady), came over numerous times to our table, first asking how i had heard of this place (thanks Darren W.) to which i replied, \"YELP!\", then identifying 2 of the 4 banchan (i should have asked about the greens...), then asking how the food was.  at the conclusion of our meal, she encouraged us twice to come back. the server forgot to give us our side dishes for a little bit in the beginning of our meal, but apologized for not doing so, and when we asked for a refill on the warm tofu side dish, he never came back with one.

this was probably one of my best decisions for comfort food on a cold day.  if you come for lunch, a good number of dishes are 1-2 dollars off (not a lot of savings, but more than none for the same thing!). although i haven't had much korean food in pittsburgh, i'd definitely recommend this place over sushi kim."}
{"text":"This was a good Korean BBQ experience.  Ordered vegetable bimbimbap and it was tasty.  Service left something to be desired (no modifications on order, brought just as it was on the menu), but I think it was just a language issue rather than anything intentional.  Restaurant layout is nice.  I didn't expect much being sandwiched between the Dental Spa and Golf Galaxy, but would go back if I was ever staying near here again."}
{"text":"A must try! A friend and I read rave review in the Pittsburgh City Paper on this place so we tried it out and can't wait to go back. We had the bimimbop and the squid stir fry. Amazing! The service was great as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A big bowl of goodness is what I had!   It is Sunday Afternoon, my long drive from Kentucky has made me hungry for something unusual than my normal football watching meals (pizza or wings).

Continuing on my food adventure of Pittsburgh, I decided to stay  local to where I am staying and saw the great reviews on Dasnoii Korean Bistro via Yelp.

Intrigued, I decided to venture out.  It was actually hard to find for me (probably due to the fact I just spent 5 hours in a car and my eyes gravitated to the Basefall sign below the Bistro).    I found it and glad I did.

I sat down and the waitress knew I was lost.   I knew what I wanted but I have to admit I am a Korean rookie.   I have always had good Korean food but it has been stew based and not sure what it was.

Following the lead of my fellow Yelpers - I purchased the Dolsot Bibimbap (Beef).    All I can say is I went into the meal open minded and I was happy the Yelp Team recommended it.

My waitress approached me with what look like a bowl made of lava rock on a wooden plank.   She warned me that it was very hot.  Like a kid - I did the quick touch - and yes I can tell you it was very hot.  I beleive I burned my finger prints off and to while writing this review I wonder why I did that but ... back to the meal.

The bowl was layered with what looked like a fried egg, beef, rice, veges - I have no idea what kind of veges but  the make up of my garden section appeared to be cabbage, carrots, sprouts,  etc...

I poured the bbq sauce on and mixed it up.   It was very yummy and I am sure good for me.  This meal made me feel good  that I ate versus the tempting 4 beers and 2 dozen wings that I normally do on a football watching day.

I am probably committing sacrilege but my mixed up concoction tasted similar to a Korean style Japanese steakhouse meal -(I am not sure if that is going to make sense but wow! it was good)

I am excited to go back and jump out of a tree with one of their stews.

A high recommend."}
{"text":"I have had the bulgogi and the bibimpap. They were both fantastic. As a matter of fact, I went to dinner there on a Friday night and went back for lunch the next day.

Friendly wait staff, clean, and great banchan. When I am in the area, I'll be sure to visit EVERY time. Well done!"}
{"text":"Good Korean place out by the airport. Dasonii is nice when you are out by the airport and do not want to suffer at one of the numerous chains surrounding it. Slightly overpriced, Dasonii makes it for it with efficient service and adequate food."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there are more Korean restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, but not if the food isn't good.  I came here with low expectations and was still disappointed.

FOOD:  We ordered the Assorted Sushi Deluxe to start.  Talk about cold rice, small-thin slices of fish, and no wasabi.  I've had better sushi at my grocery store!  For dinner I had the BiBimBap(mixed vegetables with rice) with meat.  The vegetables and rice were fine, but no meat and no miso soup to accompany it.  It was edible...but it's a hard dish to mess up.  Plus my friend ate the MehWoonTang(hot fish soup) and was sick for a couple of days.  The prices here are high for a Korean restaurant, and not great food."}
{"text":"We came here with a mixed group of people who have never had Korean, who lived in Korea and who were vaguely familiar with the cuisine.  It was a large party of 8 and they were very patient in answering our questions and catering to our needs (like beverage refills).  

The menu is varied enough that there will be something for every taste, even the non adventurous eaters.  A nice touch was the small appetizer type items that accompanied our meal.  My favorite were the spicy cucumbers, but there was also kimchi and about 4 others.  They ranged from being mild to extremely spicy.  It was a good way to try new things.  When I asked for extra cucumbers because I loved them so much, the obliged.  They even brought me two small containers, free of charge at the end of the meal and the ingredient list!  

Every diner enjoyed their entree choices and most had rave reviews.  Items were spiced perfectly and cooked to the right levels.  

It is a bit far for us since we live in the Eastern suburbs, but I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Am I missing something? Measly portions, lackluster quality and flavor, and pricey menu is all I took away from this place.

The banchan was decent but came in 6 dishes with very small portions. When we asked for seconds, the waitress seemed taken aback by what I thought was a common request. She eventually said \"ok\", then never returned. Uh, alright. We asked another waitress after 10 minutes and she delivered.

For our meal, we had dukbokki, soondubu, and galbi dolsot bibimbap. The dukbokki was too sweet and tough, the soondubu was bland, and the bibimbap had mushy rice and no flavor whatsoever. And they were all pretty meager portions. We ordered off the dinner menu and barely even got lunch portions.

So nope. I don't know what else Pitt has to offer for Korean, but there's gotta be something better than this..."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my fiance for a later lunch.  We had been looking for a semi casual restaurant in the Robinson that wasn't a chain and this popped up on Yelp for us.  Whenever we entered the restaurant the first thing that jumps out at you was how sleek and modern everything is.  The whole place looks very clean and is done in silver and black.

For my lunch entree I decided to have the Angus Short Rib Dolsot Bibimbap which is five different vegetables over rice and a fried egg in heated stone pot for crispy and crunchy rice with hot chili sauce on the side.  It comes with 5 dishes of banchan that are served before the meal that I thought were excellent. They were delivered to our table by our waitress who was a little bit awkward but we assumed that she was new on the job.  After asking her what they were she told us that the banchan consisted of Pickled radish, kimchee, potatoes in sesame soy, tofu and a cucumber kimchee.  After we had finished the banchan, she took them away and our meals came out and I liked what I saw.  Apparently whenever I think of Korean food, bibimbap is what I am thinking of and the presentation of these were nice.  The short ribs in it were cooked good and tasted nice but I am not sure that they were worth paying the extra money for over say the seafood or chicken as it was not really the star of the dish.  That honor belonged to all of the vegetables and the crunchy rice which I loved.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Dasonii in the future.  Hopefully the next time it is during the week as their lunch menu if significantly cheaper then.  Even so, this was still one of the best, if the best Korean food that I have eaten in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Things got started a little slowly with a delay between being seated and ordering.  Once the orders were in, the food was excellent.  I had pork bulgogi and my wife had vegetable dolsot bibimbap with well prepared tofu and vegetables.  We recommend the mung bean cake appetizer.  Unfortunately they were out of green tea ice cream, but I recommend the meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"After an afternoon of shopping at IKEA and The Mall at Robinson, my hubby and I began searching for a dinner spot. He saw great reviews for Dasonii on Yelp, so we decided to check it out. 

The restaurant was quiet for a Saturday evening with less than 10 diners the entire time we were there. Though clean and modern, the restaurant was sparsely decorated. Our waitress was very attentive and did a great job of explaining several dishes as we are not very familiar with Korean food.

The meal started with a little sampling of tasty treats, including kimchi, bean sprouts, and cucumbers. We ordered the Sweet Potato Tempura which was incredible! I was almost tempted to order a second portion of the appetizer it was so delicious. Finally, I had the Sweet and Sour Chicken. Though good, it was not exactly what I was anticipating. However, I am more familiar with the Chinese version of Sweet and Sour Chicken.

Overall, I had a good experience and would definitely be up for returning to Dasonii again in the future."}
{"text":"I had the urge to give Dasonii a really high rating just because it's korean food, but I had to hold on to my yelp objectiveness!  

It's PRICEY (wait for the groupon!) and there's no grill on your own.  It's also far out the way.  Be warned, sometimes they cannot handle the crowd and will ask you to \"wait to order\" to let the kitchen catch up.  

But let's face it---it's good food and AUTHENTIC too, there's no arguing with that.  It is probably the best Korean food you'll find in the Pittsburgh area.  I like that it's a Korean \"mom and pop\" place.  But the mom (female owner) came at me angry once when I said this is not what I ordered?  Lesson learned---use the ordering numbers with the non-Korean waiters to avoid this again!"}
{"text":"Dasonii Korean Bistro is an amazing Korean restaurant and the best one I've been to in the United States. It even rivals ones that I went to while in South Korea! I have tried just about everything on the menu and everything is amazing, but the Dolsot Bibimbap is by far my favorite! Despite this, I would definitely recommend trying items outside of your comfort level because it is definitely worth it at Dasonii. I love the side dishes that they bring out before the meal because they come quickly, give you something to munch on, and are always varied. One of the best things by far is the owner and her husband (the cook). It is refreshing to see a family-owned restaurant that thinks more about the customers than the money. The owner will always greet anyone with a big smile and remembers faces extremely easily. She is a wonderfully kind woman, and she definitely makes sure that everyone is taken care of!"}
{"text":"Huzzah!  Another restaurant in the area I can get excited about.  We've been on a hunt for Korean across the country lately and are slowly becoming knowledgeable about this healthy and flavorful cuisine.  I had lunch here today and was really happy that my fellow Yelpers got this one right.  

It's a clean, modern and attractive space.  The music is a strange mix of American music styles and it's sometimes distracting but it wasn't so loud as I couldn't tune it out.  The service was great.  Of course, it helps that the owner was waiting on us.  She was really patient with all the questions I had today and after awhile warmed up to us and we had a really nice conversation about the history of the restaurant and her role there with the family.  The waitstaff is learning Korean and teaching her English.  You can tell she's a bit uncomfortable but once you show her some kindness she rises to the occasion.  

We ordered the dinner portion of chicken bulgogi.  It comes with 5 dishes of banchan and since someone recommended the picked peppers we asked for some of those too.  The banchan was excellent.  Pickled radish, kimchee cabbage,  potatoes in sesame soy, tofu and a cucumber dish.  One as good as the next.  The peppers were jalapenos that had been carefully seeded and deveined.  I was worried they'd be too spicy but they were delicious.  The bulgogi is simply marinated, grilled and served with cabbage and carrots on a hot iron skillet.  I expected chili sauce on the dish but you had to ask for it separately.  It was delicious on it's own but really needs the chili sauce in my opinion.  

We also ordered kimchee soup with pork, cabbage, rice cakes and tofu.  This dish gets better as it cools in it's hot pot at your table.  It gets a little spicier, a little richer as the flavors develop.  I love this soup.  I have had one better in Cleveland but this was quite good.  

I highly recommend you eat here.  We will be back very often.  I can't wait."}
{"text":"Since my move to Pgh, I've been trying to find a great Korean restaurant.  Was looking forward to Dasonii, and hoping that it would be end my search for Korean greatness.  Unfortunately, after my visit, the search continues...

Food (6.5/10) = Came here with family and got to sample a few things:

1) Side Dishes (Banchan) = one of the best features about Korean restaurants are the side dishes (banchan).  Dasonii serves 5 dishes (spicy cucumbers, shredded carrots, potatoes, bean sprouts, and of course kimchi).  The side dishes I enjoyed the most were the cucumbers and potatoes.  The kimchi?  Meh.  The kimchi was unfortunate/disappointing.
2) Seafood pancake ($14) = per menu, the seafood included were scallops, squid, and shrimp.  Was not expecting much, considering I've never had good experiences with seafood in places situated far from the ocean. The pancake was just ok.  It's not the typical seafood pancake I've had at other places.
3) Seafood Dolsot Bibimbap ($15) = Seafood included were again shrimp, scallops, and squid (same stuff in the seafood pancake). This dish is served in a stone put, and is composed of rice topped with julienned vegetables, and fried egg.  The stone pot is supposed to make the rice at the bottom crunchy.  Unfortunately, this desired crunchy texture did not exist.  The overall flavor profile was bland.  To get any flavor, I had to use a good amount of the gochujang hot sauce (the hot sauce that comes on the side of bibimbap dishes).  The seafood itself was meh.  Was not impressed with the product.
4) Seafood soft tofu stew ($11) = Seafood again was the triple \"S,\" shrimp, scallops, squid.  Was really excited to see this dish on their menu.  This is one of my favorite Korean dishes (soondubu jjigae).  An egg is dropped into the soup shortly before being served.  A bowl of rice accompanies the pot of boiling soup.  Unfortunately again, this dish was meh.  The flavor just wasn't there.  Was disappointed.    

Ambiance (7.5/10) = Very spacious, very clean.  Simple and not overwhelming atmosphere.  Shiny metal tables.  Fancy cups for the barley tea.  

Service (7.5/10) = was nothing special.  didn't get the super warm friendly feeling that other's had mentioned in prior reviews.  Was seated, took our order, ate, and departed afterwards.

Overall Opinion = I really wanted to like this place.  I didn't have high expectations going into Dasonii, just had high hopes.  But even without high expectations, I left disappointed.  After asking Korean friends who have lived in this city, I guess it's time to accept that great Korean food does not exist in Pittsburgh.  I'm giving Dasonii three stars, because I don't have the heart to give anything lower to the family running this place, who for sure put their hearts into their business.  In reality, the quality of the Korean food is just two stars (i.e. Yelp's \"Meh. I've experienced better\").  If you love great Korean food and have experienced it in places such as California, NYC, Atlanta, Toronto, or Annandale to name a few cities, you're probably going to be disappointed with Dasonii."}
{"text":"A wonderful new Korean restaurant has opened up in Pittsburgh, and it is good!

1. The sushi is SO GOOD. 
2. The Korean dishes are very reminiscent of home-cooked meals.
3. The inside isn't too loud or crazy so it's a nice atmosphere to eat.
4. They also have good Korean BBQ.

Recommend. (:"}
{"text":"The food was tasty. :) I thought I knew what Korean food was, but was completely baffled by a lot of the entries. The drink selection is very limited, at least in terms of beers. There were two draft beers and four bottled beers, as well as a stocked bar. I enjoyed myself and the price wasn't outrageous."}
{"text":"Food was amazing....but honestly the host/waitress owner? lady was so super nice!"}
{"text":"I am kind of torn here.  My mom loved her dish, but I on the other hand wasn't too impressed.  Though I do feel it might have been mu fault for what I ordered, but the bigger complaint was the lack of actual shrimp in my meal.  I mean for what you are paying, shredded veggies and beansprouts isn't what I want to eat.  The fish appetizer though was pretty amazing.  I would come back just for that.  It is also pretty beautiful on the inside."}
{"text":"Note: Monday-Friday they serve lunch from 11 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. and dinner from 5 P.M. to 9:30 P.M. On Saturdays they are open from all day from 11 A.M.  to 10 P.M. 

Kay has been on a sushi kick as of late, and when she's on a kick, she's Gary Anderson, so who was I to deny her cravings?

I looked about online for establishments that serve sushi, and being intrepid, decided that we try Dasonii in Robinson, which hadn't been touched yet on Yelp. 

Let me tell you, there is nothing like watching a Steelers game in a busy Korean restaurant on a Saturday evening. 

MAN, do they love Hines Ward. As far as they are concerned he is Superman, and that admiration absolutely toasts the heart. 

Also heart-toasting was the service. I was greeted by a man and a woman (I assume they were the owners) who seemed anxious due to the Steelers/Ravens game playing out on the big screen TV above the bar. We were given a good spot so as to watch the game whilst dining. Each time the Steelers made a big play or scored, everyone in the restaurant, from toddlers in high chairs to very distinguished looking adults in expensive clothes, looked at us (the only non-Koreans in the room) with smiles on their faces, clapping, excited.

Hell, THIS is the kind of place I'd like to watch a game at. There was no screaming, no fighting, no cussing (unless they were doing so in Korean), no bimbos, no buttheads, just a feeling that the Steeler Nation is universal.

Oh wait. I see the triceratops sitting over there on the sofa with the words \"KOREAN SUSHI???\" spraypainted across its hide. 

Everyone else, young and old alike, seemed to be enjoying Dasonii's various \"hot pots\" which include weird things (and I worship the weird) like octopus and beef intestine. 

We almost went that route, but when Kay wants sushi, she must have sushi or our plane of reality will be fractured into oblivion!!!

I kid the galpal. 

We opted for the Sushi & Sashimi Combination Super Deluxe which serves two, comes with Dasonii's fine miso soup as a starter, and is brought to your table on an exquisite wooden tray/plate, with a presentation so ornate, again I regretted not capturing it on film. 

I can't remember how many pieces we were given, but it was more than enough for both of us. You got the nigirizushi, the makizushi, the futomaki, the hosomaki, the temaki, the uromaki, and the sashimi which consisted of salmon, different cuts of tuna, and another fish that I think was monkfish or anglerfish (even our fine waiter and ardent Steeler fan Sejin wasn't sure).

As I keep repeating to avoid being bagged on, I have yet to achieve \"guru\" status concerning sushi and sashimi, but I am not afraid to say that I greatly enjoyed my meal. The sashimi was so good, I barely used the obligatory wasabi, ginger slices, soy sauce and daikon, eating it almost bare. The fatty tuna was satin, the salmon was pure velvet. Naked. Elegance. 

I dunno sushi/sashimi geeks, come here, try Dasonii, and let us know what you think. I wish I could be more eloquent and knowledgeable about the whole affair, but I can honestly say that our mouths and bellies were impressed. 

The nigirizushi (God bless Jimmy Wales), came with shrimp, octopus (!), and eel (!!). The eel was the highlight for me; so rich, so savory, so beautifully alien, Atlantean. 

Dasonii's only real dessert is Green Tea Ice Cream which we did not have. 

Last night marked another new experience for me; I had Ikura (salmon roe) for the very first time atop a small purse of nori. Some would call it caviar, I call them gummy red BB's that burst into mildly salty juiciness when your teeth crush them. Tantalizing. 

Not-so-new experience for me: Realizing once more that I cannot master the use of chopsticks, despite Kay's futile tutorials. Embarassing. My fingers are just not programmed for 'em. Their chopsticks are stainless steel as are the tables, Dasonii's decor being tre modern, sleek, and stylish despite being casual. 

Lesson Learned: One can enjoy an important Steeler game (and eat terrific food for that matter) without having to contend with drunken, uncivil conduct and with people who come from other lands and speak English secondarily. Try it sometime. The name of the restaurant means \"the person you love\" in Korean, and I felt loved, from perfect strangers who were just glad we ate at their restaurant, liked their cuisine, and cared about the Steelers as much as they did. The only thing more joyful than Hines Ward's performance was watching their reactions to the amazing plays he made. 

Heck, we didn't even think they'd have it on.

But next time, I'm putting my foot down and insisting on a hot pot. I was almost jealous of the other diners. Almost."}
{"text":"Its a cold and rainy night.  Looking for some hot food, a good source of energy say the Koreans.  You get it with some authentic Korean cooking with some hot, sweet, bitter and sour tastes in your meal. 

The decor is  nice, a kind of modern/spartan with stainless steel tables. 

The kimchi was great, some nice spicy cabbage.  Received a few small nice servings of kimchi, fish steaks, marinated cucumbers, bean sprouts and more, Some sweet some spicy.  All very interesting and good.
For my main course chose the Jeyuk Bokkeum, a stir-fired spicy pork and veggies, It was very tasty, spicy with some red pepper.  What a nice change of pace.  Yum!

If you like Chinese or Thai food this is a nice alternative."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch while staying at the Hyatt Place across the street. This restaurant was a welcome respite from the numerous chain restaurants in this neighborhood.
I had the Dolsot Bibimbap. I have had Bibimbap in Hawaii at fast food Korean restaurants but I have not had it served in a hot pot. This added great texture to the rice and kept the vegetables piping hot. Lunch dishes are served with three vegetables, Kimche, bean sprouts, and parsley. Their Kimche was great and they brought me more when they saw I had wolfed it down. The bean sprouts were good also, however I found the marinated parsley had a rough texture and was not worth chewing on for the flavor.
The restaurant had good ambience, with a darkened wood theme and Korean pop music low in the background. The service was great, the staff was attentive to all the customers present and were very friendly."}
{"text":"Three stars as compared to other Korean restaurants that I've been to...not necessarily in Pittsburgh.  If this is what Pittsburgh has to offer though, I will admit that I'm a bit saddened.

I am a fan of Bibimbap Dolsot. If you are not familiar, it's a smokin' hot rock bowl full of rice, veggies, meat, and a raw egg.  The idea is that the rice gets nice and crispy from the hot rock, and the egg cooks through the mixture due to the heat.

I just wasn't impressed by their bibimbap offering here.  the egg was pre-fried before being added, there was very little meat (I had steak, gf had seafood (out of bag)) and the rice was relatively bland.  They did have a huuuge table ahead of us and perhaps that's why it was an off night.

The free sides were decent, however; we received 5 and most were tasty.  

One thing that did surprise me, and a reason that I may go back, is the sushi.  Not because it's the best sushi in Pittsburgh, but because it's decent, and for the price it's surprisingly good.  No skimpy portions, well balanced rice-to-fish ratio....I'm generally very skeptical of the \"hey we're an Asian restaurant so we should have sushi\" trend, but they do a good job here."}
