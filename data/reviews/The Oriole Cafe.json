{"text":"Cute little bar. Pierogies are fantastic and homemade. Good prices too!  BBQ sauce is kind of sweet for me, but wings are crispy."}
{"text":"I'll stick with the beer... They don't make it here.  Food was ... Not up to par compared to two and three years ago. The order was screwed up and the food was three different temperatures on the same plate. The Oriole onion soup was delicious. My guess is that it came out of a can. We can't help but wonder what happened here."}
{"text":"THIS IS ALL TRUE: NOTHING IS FABRICATED, I COULDN'T  MAKE THIS STUFF UP: FAIR WARNING!!!!!!  Wow, where do I start,upon entering this place, I should have known better as there were no cars in the parking lot at lunch time,STRIKE1. Second sign should have been the bathroom was similar to an outhouse/ dungeon and made a truck stop bathroom look inviting, and the smell could gag a maggot. The cook was in the only stall for at least 15 minutes. STRIKE 2. Not sure if he had a mixing bowl in the stall with him or not.  My son ordered the chili dogs( and usually he will eat anything) and took one bite and started gagging and said the hot dog was spoiled and the chili was dry, hard and stale. Bun was like a brick.  My Brother in law tasted my sons chili dog and had a confused look on his face that quickly turned  sour, think he said something like that @#$% aint right.  I asked the waitress to bring my son 6 wings and take the bad chili dogs away. She did return later with the wings. When I told the waitress that the chili dog was bad, she immediatley took a fork out of her pocket and said \"do you mind if I try the chili dog. WHAT?? she real did taste it and said, ohh thats how our chili tastes. I wanted to say ohh, so your chili tastes like #$@%. We dont have an acquired taste for that, sorry.  My Cousin ordered a gyro,  took 2 bites and  said it tasted like old microwaved, freezer burnt meat. STRIKEs 3 and 4. He traded with his son who had a hambuger , it was just as nasty.  Wings were below average, the french fries had a very strange taste, like the oil was so old and nasty.   The bill comes and the chili dogs were still on the bill. I asked the waitress to remove the chilidogs from the bill. She said and I quote, \"sorry, I can't, the owner won't allow me to and she started crying and said this happens all the time and the owner makes her pay for it if she takes it off the bill. At this point I couldn't believe what  transpired, felt like I was on candid camera show, I guess the customer doesn't matter to the Oriole cafe.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS IT IS THE ONLY PLACE LEFT ON EARTH, YOU MAY BE SAFE EATING A WING AND A GLASS OF WATER."}
{"text":"another place in berea that some bw grads may recognize (or maybe not) is the oriole cafe.  i met my college roommate today who was in town for..well, getting together with me.  so we met up here by her request.  and honestly, because it's a bit off campus, i had completely forgotten about this place.  but it's great.  yes, it's a tavern and they sell beer and liquor.  but aside of that, they have great food.  i mean, we've been out of school for several years now, and all she wanted were the wings.  apparently they are darn good.  i can't remember ever having them.  but if you want good wings, this is the place.  on monday nights they have homemade chicken paprikash.  and it's SOOOO GOOOOOD. good enough to add extra vowels.  that good.  yes, that good.  and the rest of the menu isn't bad either.  there's bar food, lots of different types of salads, and pita sandwiches.  and bar stuff, like drinky drinks.  however, not a bad place for a lunch, either.  gooooooooood.  vowels=goodness."}
{"text":"My best friend and I come here every year for Christmas when we visit family in Berea. They have a great jukebox. The bartenders are really nice and they have Great Lakes Christmas Ale with the cinnamon sugar rim around the holidays.   I've never ordered food, but I really appreciate the popcorn machine! And the bathroom is pink. The Oriole is a treasure and my favorite bar in Berea."}
{"text":"This is a nice little gem in Berea. A good selection on the menu reasonably priced. Enough TV's to satisfy your sports fix, and a full bar. Stop in for just a drink or for a good home-cooked meal!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving....This place looks like a hole in the wall beer and shot joint; when in reality it is a; hole in the wall beer and shot joint with great food and nice people. You are not going to be blown away by the atmosphere and décor at The Oriole Café, but you will have a good meal, a cold beer and an enjoyable experience. I have been here about 5 or 6 times and wonder why I don't go more often. I will say that the owner, might want to start investing in some structural improvements and general updates, but then again maybe that is what makes the place cool, who an I to judge. I would definitely say give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"great wings & food, impressively long specials list.. Swedish meatballs on a Monday:) eclectic jukebox, kids loved their food and challenging mom and dad w trivial pursuit, tons of character, wish I had come here when at BW for undergrad"}
{"text":"Have I mentioned that I heart dive bars?  Yep, that's right...I'm a high-class broad who loves to get her dive on.  The Oriole rocks.  This might be the weirdest combination of old-man bar meets college coed.  Of course, then you fit in the high-class broad (moi), and whoa, you've got a PARTY!  The booze is cheap, they make a mean Irish car bomb, and did I mention the jello / pudding shots that change weekly and have seasonal flavors?  I love the mint-chocolate pudding shot.  Don't knock the jello / pudding shot, Susie makes 'em STRONG!  Too many of those puppies and they'll knock you on your rear!  I love the Oriole for so many reasons.  Bob the owner is often found floating through the bar and making popcorn (I love the free and tasty popcorn!) and jumping in on your conversation.  The people are generally friendly and I can't say I've ever had a bad time here.  Swing on down, get yourself a Pabst...or a pitcher (Heck, its only $4!), enjoy a burger...(those are good too) and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Good food good service bit the owner kept leaving his beer and standing at our table. Just rude, I am dropping over 120 bucks I should have my own table"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area my whole life and I've been to every bar/restaurant in Berea. For casual dining, the Oriole wins hands down. It's enough of a bar to bring in the drinkers and yet enough of a restaurant to bring in the families. The menu is down-home, nothing fancy: burgers, wings, salads, pierogis, chicken paprikash...you get the idea. The bartenders and servers are always friendly and several have been there for over 20 years. Bobby the owner is often making his rounds to talk with everyone. But my favorite thing about the jukebox is the MUSIC! They play Satellite radio if no one is playing Touch Tunes and its never too loud.  LOVE THE ORIOLE!!!"}
{"text":"I come to The Oriole Café for two things, wings and house made chips. These two items are both excellent and relatively inexpensive.   The Oriole definitely has a dive-bar appeal and is tucked away off the road. I have eaten there a few times but mostly order to-go because I like to eat wings while watching sports and I like watching sports at home.  The place definitely has regulars for both food and spirits which is a sign of how nice the staff can be.  If you order wings I recommend the medium buffalo and the teriyaki flavors. They are properly sauced and cooked to the perfect point of being a bit crispy but still tender. Each order of wings is served automatically with a side of ranch and celery so no nickel-and diming you on the sides.  The housemade chips are long and razor thin. My recommendation is to have them ranch seasoned or seasoned plain. While delicious I have had 2 recurring problems with the chips: 1) Sometimes they're not cooked long enough and still  bit floppy 2) sometimes there's not quite enough seasoning for my liking. Still they're delicious and I will continue to order them.  Friends and family reassure me the other foods there are delicious as well. The entire menu is reasonable priced. Sometimes I'll have a beer or two when waiting for my food and that is reasonable as well. They could use another flat screen to replace the worn out tube TV they have at one end of the bar but it's not a big deal.  Overall it's a great local place with great local food and probably the best wings in Cuyahoga County."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer and some bar food.  Go in for Susie Sundays and you will have the most wonderful bartender!"}
{"text":"The very definition of a dive bar. Classic rock playing on the jukebox, regulars mostly populate the bar area, but the friendly kind, not the \"get outta my bar\" variety. It's an old place with character. Wooden built-in drink holders in the satellite tables near the bar, clean but old checkered floor. I attended BW back in the 90's and frequented the Oriole for its wing nights and was worried the place will have lost its luster over the years. I was happy that the place was exactly the same as it was. Very good wings, great atmosphere, friendly and familiar service. The Oriole is exactly what it tries to be. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Love the oriole... doesn't look like much from outside but food is fantastic!!!  Best wings in cleveland."}
{"text":"The most eloquent way to describe the Oriole Cafe is by the famous Horslips lyrics: \"Time spins down to a standstill. My hands fill with all I desire. I can feel your fire.\"  This place was pretty fun when I went there on a random Sunday day-drinking excursion.  Kind of has a \"towney\" feel to it.  People who own riding lawnmowers and septic tanks im feeling.  Everyone was laid back and friendly!   Happy hr all day Sunday so drinks are cheap.  Food was pretty good but it was standard Sysco stuff delivered on  truck and put together.  Wings came crispy and salad was fresh.  Both were better when slathered with some hot-ass hot sauce.  Their hot sauce is hotter than most.  Jukebox played good tunes and the whole time I was there didnt hear one crappy country song!  They have video poker and Keno too.  They dont have a patio but you can drink indoors...like an adult.  I definitely will be back..."}
{"text":"Oriole is our local bar and eatery, a place to go to eat when we don't feel like cooking but don't want to drive very far, but I like it a lot.  It's a sports-themed bar and grill, but not actually a \"sports bar\" --although it does have televisions to catch the current game, they don't have the dozens of huge-screen TVs playing every possible sports channel that today's dedicated sports bars feature. Basically, it's the friendly neighborhood grill.  The food is standard bar food; Mary likes it because they have buffalo burgers as well as just hamburgers; they also have a special of the day (perch, last time we were there).  It does have music, but it's quiet enough to talk (the waitress said they will turn it down if we though it was too loud, but it wasn't) Pretty good, in my opinion, if you want a classic American bar & grill."}
{"text":"Really need to stick to the wings here. That is what they are noted for... So they are bound to be good...RIGHT....well, they are! But I made the mistake of trying their $5.99 sirloin steak (priced that way all day everyday). Well all I can say is \"DON'T\". It was like eating shoe leather with no flavor, not even salt or pepper. I didn't complain because I though I would just give it a try and I did. What should I have expected for $5.99....BUT I will know better next time NOT to order it. I am sure that in the future I will again try something else besides the wings because you don't know unless you try. I'll experiment and pass the results on to you. Just call me a guinea pig or a glutton for punishment. Either way we will return to the Oriole so the adventure will continue. The service is fast and the staff is friendly, and the drinks are cheap. What more can you ask for from a corner bar!"}
{"text":"I get to this little neighborhood spot a couple times a year when I find myself in the area. They have a pretty basic bar menu, but I usually enjoy the Lake Erie fish. There's not a whole lot on tap, but they always seem to have Warsteiner, which is a welcome choice. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy, if a bit weathered. It's a nice spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! Where else can you go and get a cheap drink and an awesome burger too! They have lunch specails too! My favorite is there sirloin steak sandwich with mushrooms, onions and provolone cheese and a side of fries! all for $4.99 and I mean this is a steak too...not some little piece of beef! They have lunch specials through-out the week and they do take out as well! This is one of Berea's hidden gems..if your in the neighborhood stop in for a cold one and stay for some good food too! You wont regret it!!! :-)"}
{"text":"An old stand by from my days of teaching at Riveredge Elementary. Not often do educators get a entire hour for lunch, but on days when we did, The Oriole was the place to go..."}
{"text":"Cool cheap little bar I went to multiple times on my two month stay in Middleburg. If you're under 25 and you go in there before midnight you'll get some looks"}
{"text":"This place. It speaks to me.  We moved to Berea in April 2015 from the bustling Tremont neighborhood, and while we knew some of the gems of Berea (namely Cornerstone and the Metroparks), we were looking for a place that feels like home. And not only did the Oriole Cafe deliver, it more than exceeded our expectations.  We walked into Oriole on Saturday after moving furniture and unpacking all day and were just looking for a place to grab a pint and unwind. Within a few minutes the owner came over to our table and chatted us up a bit. When he realized that we were not Baldwin Wallace students, and instead new to the neighborhood, he bought us and a few close friends a round of their ever famous pudding shots on the house. Now that feels like the dive bar I've always wanted.  Every time we have family or friends coming in for the weekend or leaving on a flight out of Hopkins, we make the Oriole a must stop. The bar food is excellent, and the prices are crazy affordable. The beer list is solid, and they have $1.50 PBR all day, every day. Not only that, they have happy hour all day on Sunday, and a killer wing night on Tuesday and Thursday (with specials every night of the week). They recently upgraded their tv situation, and it's a nice spot to catch any Cleveland or Ohio State sports game. And a time or two or week, they feature some local live music.  AND MY GOD THE PEOPLE WATCHING. You just can't go wrong. Bang for the buck in Berea."}
{"text":"My mother and I went to the Oriole last night. The place reminds me of the Neil Young Harvest Moon video. Or possibly a bar in Alaska. Or any bar in America with genuine people inside getting drunk and enjoying their precious and limited time on Earth. The people who were at the bar were singing along with the classic rock songs playing on the jukebox. My mom was happy that music from her generation is still enjoyed by people of all ages. They have a lot of European (Central/Eastern) style foods like pierogies etc...The pierogies are not the kind that I like the most (farmers cheese) so I did not order them. The chicken wings were perfect Buffalo style. The cheeseburger was good. Especially for $6. I will be house sitting for a friend in December that lives about a half mile down the road. I will return to try the chicken paprikash."}
{"text":"When I say this is a local dive bar, I mean it with love. Everyone needs a local watering hole that will meet your needs on a whim.  The service is always great... real, hard working people engaged in the bar experience.  The prime rib is great. You can order by the ounce which makes this carnivore happy! The pasta carbonara is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.  Put any pretense aside and give this Berea staple a try!"}
