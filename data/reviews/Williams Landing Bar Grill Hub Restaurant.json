{"text":"Burger was burnt to a crisp. Pizza was salty as a shaker full of salt. Service was nowhere to be found.  Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Convenient place for a drink and decent food but nothing special.  Service is good nice location"}
{"text":"Demetris made the whole lunch experience so absolutely fabulous. His cheeky British humour and accent were a real treat. Overall it's a nice restaurant with lots of amazing natural light. It's never too loud and easy to bring clients for a business lunch."}
{"text":"The food was really good, especially the chocolate dim sum, and when we went during the week, decent beers were $4 a pint! The only thing that spoilt the atmosphere, which was other wise very pleasant, was unnecessarily loud music (during a weekday) that made me lose my voice the next day from constant shouting and repeating myself to friends."}
{"text":"I think they must have changed the chef.  This place was mediocre at best last year but as of late this place has improved ten fold. Everything is delicious. Service is great. Definitely our new spot."}
{"text":"great patio.  decent food.    i had the cheesecake french toast.  it was very good.  right balance of sweet and savory with the blueberry compote and bacon.  decor is fresh and open.  i have only been there on a nice sunny day which i'm sure adds to the ambiance.  if you don't get the patio experience it probably isn't the same.  service was good.  we were a large group and the food came out on time and they were willing to separate billings and didn't add a mandatory gratuity.  i'd go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great burgers, nice staff, clean bathrooms.  I went in for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I can't wait for the warm weather in order to check out the patio.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because Im waiting for the patio to open, then Ill come back and change my rating."}
{"text":"Pricey, but great food and service.  We sat indoors in a booth for a more quiet setting.  We had two appetizers, mussels and chips with hummus, both very good. Main courses were a burger, prime rib, trout, and chicken. No one complained about their meals and few left enough on their plates for leftovers. We shared a cheesecake with three kinds of dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, and raspberry) and wonton chocolate fondue. The wonton fondue was okay and the cheesecake was a little on the light side; the caramel dipping sauce was the best of the three.  I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Friends and I go here a lot. Their location in Liberty Village keeps them rolling.  They have a decent selection of beer and the staff are all right most of the time. They're weird about their TVs and don't really have a clue about sports, but that's Toronto. One of those places that claims not to be a sports bar, but they have 20 big screen TVs and if it wasn't for sports, they'd probably go bankrupt. Anyway, one time we asked a waitress if we could have a Blue Jay game on a TV near our table and we were told, \"We are not adjusting the TVs anymore tonight. They are staying as they are.\" Other than that, they're nice people.  The charcuterie pizza is very good, and they have some good soups specials.  If you're under 40, live in a condo, and own a dog, you'll fit right in. Like a Jack Astor's or a Moxie's. Same kind of thing."}
{"text":"I really don't like this place. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 is because we had a great server.  The atmosphere was repulsive. \"Douchebag central\" as my friend put it. Everyone just seemed so fake and pompous.  The food was stupid expensive. I didn't want to order anything because of the prices but I was so hungry that I ordered one of the cheapest things on the menu. Lobster Mac and cheese app for $12. The tiniest portion I've ever seen. Also, tasted horrible. I couldn't even finish it. At 8pm that was probably the only thing I had to eat since the early afternoon, but it was so off putting that I couldn't eat anything else for the rest of the night. I got really sick later on. 100% from my $12 baby sized mush meal.  As mentioned though, our server was great. He was clearly busy but didn't rush us at all. He knew all the beers very well. He also put up with our shit when we started shifting and moving tables around. As a former server, I know how insanely irritating that is. Sorry dude. Kudos to you for keeping your cool."}
{"text":"Wow where do I even begin? Last night when I flew back to Toronto I decided to come here for a girls night out. When we were first seated my friends and I asked the blonde waitress questions related to the menu. However, she was being rude and only gave us vague answers to the menu. When the food arrived the salad was wilted and very deep green (was rotting) and tasted terrible (I still don't understand how you can serve this to customers). The skin of the fish was super tough and almost impossible to eat. When we asked the waitress she didn't even attempt to do something about it and just told us that \"that's just how it is.\" Not only was the food terrible, the service was even more disappointing. Like another yelp reviewer mentioned before, the only thing they can't screw up is bottle beer which I ordered. Overall a bad experience. Don't come here if you are looking for a great time for dinner/food, only worth it for drinks."}
{"text":"Just so so. Came with a group (we had reservations) and they didn't seem to have enough staff. I never got the Coke/Pepsi I ordered. Tasted someone's Margarita (driving so not my own) and it was horrid - alcohol taste was overpowering without that hint of sweet. Food was just okay. Although the fries were REALLY good, twice fried I suspect. I wouldn't bother going back."}
{"text":"In visiting a friend here - I don't know how people live in the neighbourhood - I imagine this is the worst culprit of sleep deprivation...  I can't believe this place is allowed to play music all night during the week. I especially feel sorry for the new condo almost finished that will directly face the patio. How is this place allowed to be so loud with so many residential buildings?   AND that people line up here on the weekends for bad food and service."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant.... and the waitresses are all gorgeous.. however, you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.  Food was slightly overpriced for what you were getting... nothing to write home about.  The wings were greasy and bland despite a great description.... I think they may have gone overboard on the descriptions (chipotle lime dusted with  feta aioli drizzle. = KFC with a bit more pepper, and a drizzle of blue cheese mayo)  I will grant that the Taco's were delicious as were the sliders but in both cases they seemed a bit conservative... sliders to small, and taco's lacking meat.   Service was impersonal and rushed.  while there were a half dozen people 'helping' me... it just seemed uncoordinated and would have been more effecient with just one person.  The waitress would drop off an item but rush off before I could ask for another round.  Or she would drop off the drink, but we had to wait for a different person to clear the old glassware/food plates.  Just seemed very disjointed and rushed.    Also, I found the menu a bit lacking.  At the very least a rotating special or two would be nice.  (not to mention some drink specials!).   Burgers/pasta/entres were all find.. but it just seemed minimal and nothing really grabbed me. I was also missing the standard 'sandwiches' type section (club, wraps, etc. etc.).     Then again... this is just one experience.  Go for yourself and see what you think."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff and great atmosphere! I love the chicken pizza and the lettuce wraps and if you sit around the bar the people are very friendly!"}
{"text":"We've lived in the Niagara neighborhood for 12 years! We love the Old York, the Bank Note the Dew, the Wellington, Squirrleys, Done Right and more...All different, but excellent folks taking care of us!   We're temporarily living in the cluster that is Liberty Village. Great condo, great access to downtown, great access to a the grocery store. My husband & I have been here 2x in 2 years.   2012: First time the hostess in a too short skirt planted us a booth where we hudden & forgotten.... eventually 10 mins later, we were served by a nice young girl that said 'like' a lot. Service beyond there was decent.   Last week: Just went again after moving to Liberty. We sat at the bar & the beautiful bartender had a really tough time smiling. 'Can I help you?' with a scowl makes any patron feel like $&@\" for walking in the door. She maybe tried a bit? But messed up our food order.... and then voila the smile came out!  I don't get it. We go out a lot, order food, multiple bevs & tip well. We totally respect how hard the service industry works. But damn, if you're going to be grumpy, call in sick! Everyone works hard for their money and you better treat us right.  We'll go one more time & that's it. Good luck Williams Landing."}
{"text":"If this place didn't have an amazing patio in my neighbourhood, I probably wouldn't go back.  Williams Landing is like the pretty girl without a personality.  My biggest complaint is the atrocious service.  It's really bad.  I'm not posting about  a single bad experience.  I live really close and I do like the patio so I've probably been more than 20 times.  With a few exceptions, on every visit there has  been some complaint about the service - some minor, some not so.  I think I realized just how bad it was when I went to the bar to order a drink because the waitress hadn't been by and my glass had been empty for about 20 minutes.  The manager behind the bar didn't seem to think that was an odd thing."}
{"text":"What I absolutely hate about this place is the fact that they take your credit card number to secure reservations. If you do not show up, they charge your credit card 25 bucks per head for each person missing! I completely understand the need to secure your reservation so you do not have an empty restaurant, but what if someone has an emergency and can not show up? Very unreasonable and unrealistic. Their food isn't good enough for me to risk the $25 charge for any no'shows. This fact alone will stop me from ever going into this place again! They also told me that \"I wouldn't find a restaurant in Toronto which doesn't follow the policy of charging for those who do not show up\"- I proceeded to a restaurant located directly across from them who said they can accommodate us and will not charge us if we need to cancel! Thank you to the other establishments in the area for giving us the flexibility Williams Landing wouldn't. Williams Landing, you lost a customer due to your ridiculous policy!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend visiting from Estonia. I wanted to show my friend a good time and I was extremely happy with my choice of restaurant.   I had the Steak Frites and my friend had the Ontario Duck Breast. Both the Steak Frites and the Duck Breast were cooked to perfection and the restaurant atmosphere was superb.   We also had the Classic Poutine and that too was also the best poutine I have had in many years.   Williams landing made a stellar impression on my friend and myself. I can see myself coming here again in the future."}
{"text":"Great location, however the food was sub-par. How could you possible destroy Steak Frites? I gave this location two full-hearted tries, leaving broken hearted each time. My suggestion to this location is that this place could be legend - its got TONS of potential. Just focus on the food, smaller menu that you can master and call it your own. Make everything in-house. i.e. the fries in steak frites, use fresh cut yukon gold potatoes. Remember, you're in Liberty Village - focus on the food and quality, less on looking like a milestones / sports bar."}
{"text":"French Toast stuffed with cream cheese with blueberries and whipped cream. Yummm. Variety of drinks on menu. A bit overpriced but you would it feim this trendy place. Fantastic spot to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Arrived at Williams Landing just after the lunch hour during the week and it was busier than we expected it to be. This being said, our food arrived fairly quickly and our server was attentive throughout our time there. We ordered from the Lunch Menu and were pleased on the quality of the food (despite a few bad reviews posted).   We were pleased with the atmosphere overall and  look forward to coming here during the summer when we can comfortably sit out on the 2nd floor patio."}
{"text":"Wow what took me so long to go to WP?  Always heard it has one of Toronto's best patios and ppl aren't lying!  Amazing view and huge!  Had the turkey burger and it's one of the best I've had!  So juicy!  Definitely a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"Update: we went back for the Grand Opening and despite the insane amounts of people, the service was great and they pulled off a great event.  Love the patio.    ps. the crappy waiter from my last visit had been fired.  guess it wasn't just us he gave crap service to.  happy they're filtering out the bad and keeping the good, experienced people."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a friend. It was busy. We gave our number and they texted us when a table was free.   We sat in the patio. It took a while before our server came and another while before she actually took our order.   There wasn't a huge selection in cocktails and to be honest the stuff they were offering was on a pricey end  Nothing stood out on their menu but I guess we were more so there for the atmosphere. The drink and food was ok. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Four of us headed out to WL on a Saturday evening, with no reservations around 8pm. No ressies? No problem? The venue is massive and we didn't have to wait a whole two minutes to be seated.  First off, I know that most of the staff is inexperienced and young, and that's totally fine -- however, why staff most of your NEW restaurant with staff that just have no clue. They're trying, and they're trying hard. I don't want to knock them because you gotta learn sometime, but I don't think it was a wise decision on HR's part to put the newbies out in the thick of things during opening weekend nights.  A number of times I had to get up myself to track someone down so I could get hot sauce, or a glass of water. I had the regular burger. Don't get it. The bun is like a marshmallow and the fixings are basic. If the burger meat itself was top-grade then you could skimp on the condiments because the beef would be the flavour, but it was lacking. The fries were good though. And the other four people chose the right things because they all enjoyed their meals (prime rib, steak and \"catch of the day\"). I was the only sucker.  Redemption did rear it's head however! The manager came by and asked for feedback, which we all happily gave. Hearing about my not-so-great burger experience he said he'd see what could do. We had ordered a couple of desserts, and when the bill came, they were on the house. Well done Mr. Manager. THE DESSERTS were AMAZING! Especially the friend cheesecake won tons. I wasn't floored by my experience here, but I will go back. It's in the hood, the staff will improve as will most aspects of the place and the managers do care. That's enough to get me back in there. A welcome alternative to the Brazen Head, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This was a delightful summer evening patio outing for me. The area and venue are beautiful and tastefully decorated. It has TVs for the sport fans and a large selection of beers as well. The patio is heated so the chilly breeze was not a problem, service was quick and the food was done well. The crowd was well dressed and it definitely felt like a classy place to have fun. The view from the patio was amazing and the bill was not too high at the end of the night."}
{"text":"The food is decent but not somewhere I would go to specifically for a meal. It's convenient as it's in my neighbourhood. The large patio is refreshing as it's not on street level.   The large bar allows people to gather and easily meet people if that's what your goal is. It would be helpful if the bar had coat hooks on them for the winter."}
{"text":"Did we trampled onto a hair salon without knowing?  Upon rolling out the cutlery, a long, brown hair rolled out with my fine cutlery as well.  What it seems to be a brown eyelash was there for the extra touch.  Also, to my last bite of my entree,  there was a short black, curly hair within my veggies. How fascinating.  Steak frites was brutally tough and overly seasoned with salt. Caesar was watery.  However the water do have some caesar rim spice at the bottom.  Talk about scoring a 2 in 1!  Service was...wait......what service?  Overall experience: DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a drink and enjoy the good weather on a sunny day/evening due to their great patio. There's often a really lively crowd there. Has an upper-end chain feel to it.   Unfortunately, they make for pretty much the worst neighbors you could possibly ask for. I live across the street and they literally single handedly ruined my living experience by blasting their music super loud all summer. On the plus side, if you like loud music, you will probably enjoy their patio. I'll probably never go back because I will be moving out of my building because of them."}
{"text":"No real complaints here. A decent place to come in the summer and sit on their patio and just relax if you live in the area (I don't). It's a really young liberty village crowd and reminds me of a college / university experience. Not a bad thing, but it's good to be aware of, as I wouldn't recommend families or an older crowd 50+ coming here unless you like looking at pretty young things.   They accommodate gluten free diets too!"}
{"text":"I was really frustrated that they've set up umbrellas on the patio touching each other in a line. This creates a very sheltered, covered patio and no wind can get through.... which was fine until people lit cigarettes and the whole patio got filled with smoke... it was even filling the restaurant. We had to leave before dessert. Service was great - very friendly. Food was mediocre, certainly couldn't compete with the cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Best lamb burger I've ever had!  Giving it 4/5 stars based on my last experience. The server did not tell us that substituting fries for a salad would cost and additional $1.00 ...I'm not complaining about $1.00 but, would have liked to know this when i asked for the substitution. Also, we had a large party (about 10-15 people) and the servers forgot about us once the restaurant started to get a bit busy. 2 people in our party ordered  a beer and only 1 person got their beer after waiting 15 minutes. When the server was reminded of the 2nd beer, he apologized and said he'd get another. We never received the other beer.   They need to ramp up their staff on weekends. There's obviously not enough servers to handle the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Surprisingly Williams landing was where I've had the tastiest, most flavourful calamari!   Came here for a friends birthday not knowing what to expect. I agree with some tellers when they say that this is a non chain version of Kelsey's or Montana's (the food, however is a bit better).  I had the charcuterie pizza, which I don't recommend unless you're a sundries tomato lover (I was having them for the first time and really disliked the pizza because of this addition). But the pizza was full of flavour - next time no sun dried tomatoes for me.   This place can get pretty expensive so because of that I probably won't be coming here as often! But it's a nice restaurant bar to come to!"}
{"text":"Food is good here but the bouncer needs to stop taking his job so seriously. We had dinner reservations and were rudely told to go wait in line outside the restaurant with the crowd. When we got inside 15 minutes after our reservation, we were told we were late for our reservation and they couldn't seat us. Eventually we convinced them that we were there on time but I wish we had just left. Our waitress was one of the worst I've ever had! They only time she tried to make conversation with us was when we were paying the bill, looking for a tip. There are a lot of great restaurants in this city and I hate it when we waste our time and money on one like this. Will definitely not go back!"}
{"text":"I've been going Pre and Post Argonauts games all season.  Post game where many Argos supports head to..  Host Jessica, Bartenders Veronica and Patty are friendly and engaging and provide a welcoming environment.   Great atmosphere with the patio view out from the second floor.  Food is very good, beer and drink selections are great.  Ownership change may have had some impacts, but the staff works hard, the beer is cold and the food is hot.. Great place to visit, CFL season or not.. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"3 out of 5! Great place to go with groups! Surprisingly liked the pizzas! Enjoy the patio in the summer"}
{"text":"The patio is stunning.  The positive attributes however, end there.  The first time I went, the service was slow and my dish came out 25 min after my friends dish came out.  They had forgotten to punch it in.   I decided to give it another try.    Once again, slowwww service.  We ordered a pitcher of red Sangria.  We drank the entire thing and didn't even feel a teeny bit of a buzz, nor could we taste an inkling of wine.  It was pure juice.  For lunch I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  Awful.  For $17, you get 3 miniscule pieces of tuna, some canned hearts of palm, and baby spinach with a dressing that definitely came out of a bottle from a grocery store.  The quinoa, which was supposed to be in the salad was non existent.  I left hungry. And stone cold sober.   Will I return?  In the summer next year perhaps, but I won't be eating or drinking the sangria.  I'll stick to wine."}
{"text":"Wow I had high hopes for Williams Landing and so far they have never failed to disappoint me.  I run a number of events and the past two that I have had at Williams Landing, the management forgot/lost our reservation, it was loud and noisy, I informed the front staff that people were looking for us, and they promptly ignored me and failed to direct anyone to our table, and the waitress was snooty the entire time, when I complained to management I was told they would be happy if I took my business somewhere else....which is exactly what I will be doing."}
{"text":"Checked out Williams Landing for dinner just before the TFC game last weekend. Nice looking place and lots of space. Our Service was excellent. Alittle too chilly for the patio but it looks amazing. By the time we were leaving for the game the place was packed. The location is owned by the same owners as South of Temperance and Leslieville's Joy Bistro (on Queen).  Had a pasta dish called Fettucine Forestiere with house smoked chicken, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and parmesan which was super tasty but the portion was super small for 17 dollars and I was still hungry afterwards. Drinks were expensive too.  Overall a 3 star performance."}
{"text":"Fantastic patio space with a great view. Good quality delicious food. Service was prompt and pleasant. Unexpected, fabulous vibe on Saturday night!"}
{"text":"I love the Williams landing atmosphere.  It's modern, clean, and seems like a great place to hang out.  It's a restaurant, but also a fun hang out spot by the bar.  I have been here on several occasions and have always had an enjoyable time.   Most recently stopped in to grab a bit and enjoy some cold beer while sitting on the patio in the sun!  Our waiter was really great, and gave us a rundown of the menu options, with his recommendations.  We both chose the fish tacos, based on his recommendation and they were delicious.  The hot sauce was da bomb!  Loved it!  We ended up moving inside as the patio got cold after the sun went away, and there were no problems.  Really enjoy coming here, and always recommend it.  Was surprised to see some of the reviews less then favourable, as I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"the space is beautiful - on the inside that is! the building it is located in is actually hideous its appaling some planner allowed it to be built but i digress...  this restaurant has done everything right in terms of the space. big beautiful bar, nice bright airy space. lovely clean washrooms. And of course - what brought me there - the patio is a massive selling point! came here to check it out with some girlfriends for some wine and maybe an app on a hot summer night. only problem was the bottle of wine we ordered was served luke warm. white wine. on a hot summer night, on a patio. While our waiter was apologetic he definitely was not quick to offer us a replacement bottle which is what should have been done. we were basically told that all of these bottles were luke warm because they had run out upstairs and had to get them from downstairs? whatever that means... you'd think they would store wine in a chilled cellar of some sorts... it was an awkward situation and at first  we said it was ok we would drink it, then realizing, no if we're paying twice the amount of a bottle in lcbo to sit and sip on a patio it should be COLD. We had to call our waiter over and ask for a replacement which was much better, but still.  We also tried the hummus platter which was good but completely forgettable. I'd return because of the location and ambience and to check out more of the food, but i think for a brand new restaurant they should not be serving warm white wine and if a customer complains they should be OFFERED a replacement bottle, not have to ask for another."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.    Servers were nice, though they looked apologetic before we even ordered.... *ALARM BELLS*  Food was hit-and-miss. My pizza was great, but my GF's salad was...what's less than sub-par?..... horrible.   For $21 dollars, she got a pile of (wilted) spinach, with a couple of chick peas, and a pile of unappetizing looking mushrooms.  They forgot the chicken (which BTW was an extra $6 added to the the price).  That's it.  meh.   bathrooms were nice? nice patio.  it's new i get it. food needs major improvement."}
{"text":"It is burger week.  I was served the most disgusting burger.  Then the second round of utensils had a spiral public hair.  After the first set was all stained.   Our server was lovely.  Really lively and I want her to work somewhere else..  I will never eat at this place again.  Food was disgusting.   Server was amazing.   Owner had ti be a massive douchebag"}
{"text":"Was here for brunch. Food was ok but the service was horrible. Place wasn't even packed. Waits for food, bill, & payment killed the experience, and being a former in the service industry, I know it was not busy. Wanted so much to like the place."}
{"text":"Teena and I ate on the large outdoor patio in the summer just after this place opened. We returned last night for super.   Once again we received excellent service through-out the night and the manager Donna came over to chat with us, even though the place was quite busy.  Teena enjoyed her Pollo Arrabiatta pizza and I really liked my Cuban sandwich with fires.   We were told the patio would be open again next week for the winter.   A couple more craft beers on tap would be nice but I find this an excellent place to go for a meal or just a drink"}
{"text":"Trying to book a reservation for an event here is always such a hassle. It's like they don't want the business so we will therefore take it elsewhere. I can see charging a no show fee for large amounts of the party not showing up when we book a patio location, but for mid March and for every person the doesn't come at the exact time the reservation starts being charged $25 a head is silly. We will take our event across the street to Bar Vespa from now on who welcomes large groups with no strings attached!"}
{"text":"I was here last summer with some coworkers (we work in the area) and I can't say I'd want to go back.  Since we were a larger party, I made a reservation which meant we'd also be charged a gratuity.  When I arrived, I checked in with the hostess. She rudely told me to wait on the side, away from the hostess stand and out of her line of sight apparently.  As someone who's worked as a server/bartender, I was pretty appalled by her response. I appreciate she was busy, but there are definitely better ways to talk to a customer.  Rather than checking in, we spotted some of other coworkers, who'd found our table.  Our server was pretty good and the food was average. I was little frustrated to see how the server's section was stretched over the space, it seemed a little impractical to have her running around so much.  After the interaction with the hostess, I've been left with a pretty nasty opinion of the initially customer service here and am not inclined to return."}
{"text":"I love the stuffed cream cheese French toast here for brunch. While there are plenty of other options, the patio at WL has always been a good go-to spot for me.  I'm not expecting 5-star service as this local joint but unfortunately, the staff/waitress on Sun Aug 16 has upset me and my friend so much that I needed to comment.   The tables were probably only about half full at this time, but it took us quite a long time to get someone's attention to at least start us off with some water on this sunny afternoon. When the waitress finally came by, we ordered our food as well, as we didn't want to flag them down again. It was very warm that day, so we shared the French toast first as it was melting quickly in the sun. No one came to collect the empty plates, nor have they come by to refill our water (which was pretty much empty by this time). We tried to flag someone down with no luck.   We proceeded to finish our sliders after (still no water and with our dirty plates). We tried to flag someone down again to at least get some water. HALF AN HOUR PASSES before we get some attention. By then, we didn't want the water anymore, we just wanted to get out of there. Since we were paying by credit card, we needed the machine. She says she'll come back and get the machine. We waited another couple minutes until we decided it was better for us to walk up to the cashier and pay there. She seemed a little appalled that we left no tip and said nothing on our way out. Tip is for service, better tip for better service. This experience was no different than getting take out at a fast food restaurant, therefore, wasn't quite deserving of any tip.   With the heavy competition in Liberty Village area, the staff definitely need to step it up a bit to keep customers happy."}
{"text":"Great place great crowd, bit on pricey side but lot of tv screens and lax atmosphere.  Big turn off hostess one in particular, don't know her name, but curly hair light black lady. Always annoyed expression on her face, really really standoffish this is message for her. IF YOU REALLY HATE YOUR JOB THAT MUCH MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE."}
{"text":"This is a recent addition to our neighbourhood in Liberty. I found the staff to be very friendly and trying their best. The service totally depends on the server you get. I have been there on four occasions and had four completely different experiences. The bar is snail sluggish. How long does it take to pour a glass of wine? Make a ceasar or put together the worst mojito ever?? Two of the bartenders are usually standing around trying to hit on the attractive wait staff or staging a sing-a-long to whatever is on the sound system. The bar staff is a huge problem for this venue!   The food in general is okay. I did really enjoy the scallops but the pulled pork tacos came up seriously lacking in flavour. The salads are too small and not that fresh. My lettuce or as they called it \"mixed greens\" were definely yesterday's.  It is not a bad menu but not creative either. Pizza has been done and very well at two other restaurants right here in Liberty. The patio is great and the management staff appear genuinely interested in your satisfaction.   With some imagination with the menu, the use of fresher ingredients, retraining of the bar staff to remind them of what they are supposed to be doing, this would be an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"As a somewhat new LV-er, I pounce on the chance to try some of the very un-downtown-esque dining options in the neighbourhood when the occasion calls. Meeting a friend for lunch here, was pleasantly surprised with the comfortable atmosphere. The half patio, half indoors interior was so disarmingly \"un-Toronto\" and reminded us each of Vancouver and Shediac, respectively.  Service was friendly and forgetful, and as the wait for our meals droned on, increasingly apologetic. For a weekday lunch service, a 30 minute wait isn't exactly ideal. Another point is that while their website offers a lunch menu (priced at about $9), this wasn't offered to us once we were there.  For a dinner, when expecting it, $18 for a burger could be tolerable. For lunch, it's  steep. With that said, the Bretta Farms burger was tasty and topped happily with bits of pulled pork. And they asked me how I wanted it done when ordering (medium-rare) and it came out just that way. My friend ordered a tuna salad. Also $18. Ouch.  The atmosphere and my friend's good company was the saving grace for my lunch experience here. Altogether, Williams Landing is pretty much what you would expect. We'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Think of this place as an upscale Jack Astor's.  They've got a pretty large 2nd floor patio and a decent assortment of beers on tap.  Generally pretty packed on a weekend.  I've never tried the food here despite coming multiple times."}
{"text":"Great lounge , awesome food and amazing staff. The decor of this place is very cool, huge patio and open  air style place with high ceilings through out.  Big wrap around bar and plenty on offerings for drinks with extensive wine list.   Pros - location , Staff  Cons - stairs"}
{"text":"WOULDN'T RECOMMEND!!!  Pretty disappointed!  Came here for my birthday with family and friends was rushed to eat even though our meals came LATE!  On top of that we had brought a cake and was CHARGED $2 PER PERSON!! Not enough time to mingle."}
{"text":"My third time dining here and I decided to write a review because although this place has a really nice atmosphere, cheerful, open concept feeling and the servers are polite, the food can definately be improved. Some of the dishes taste like they were cooked a couple of days ago and sort of on the greasy side.  Their cheesecake was probably the worse I've ever eaten.  All in all, stick with the simple dishes like salads and appetizers."}
{"text":"The pappardelle forestiere was incredible! Even brought some home (serving was quite large) and I enjoyed it even more the next day! Angus striploin was done just right (I like medium).   Lots of parking near the venue, good service, nice and busy but enjoyable!   Overall, delicious food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere in the summer especially on the patio! Great place for drinks, food is meh.."}
{"text":"My first trip to Liberty Village!   At William's Landing, everyone was super nice to us, perfectly accommodating a large and growing by the minute group with more and more tables. Wanna try the patio now? No problem, we just settled the bill inside so our server didn't lose our business and then headed out for more fun and a gorgeous view.   I ordered a cesar that was delicious! So drinkable, almost fruity and had a great way of coating and cooling the mouth. Everyone wanted in on the pickled green beans that come along with it but I didn't surrender any of them. There were also basil leaves and a slice of jalapeno so make sure to stir everything around and really develop those flavours!   Something I was impressed with was how they reacted when not everyone loved their drinks like me. My friend ordered a, \"Pink Spider\" or something along those lines and it was SO boozy. There were too many of the wrong alcohols mixed together with basically no juice with these small chilli's on top that blew you out of the water. Just, not great. But when my friend said something, they couldn't have been nicer about it all. The server swiftly took it away and she was able to get TWO other drinks for the price of one. Customer service at its best.    What the heck was I waiting for? A hop skip and a jump away is a gorgeous and unique 'hood that I'd love to explore during the day!"}
{"text":"Here Aug 5 2011. It's looks awesome. The staff are friendly and they all smile at you. The burger is to die for. Just love it , the decor, the open and airy feel  just want to stay as long as possible. The ladies washroom is nice too. Soap smells good. May be back .... Tomorrow. Or soon for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Been there many times. Great food. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Kool patio. No complaints."}
{"text":"Willams Landing is pretty much the worst. We went for brunch, for whatever reason, and it never failed to disappoint.  I had some eggs that were really bad, but I guess we still ate it which says something. Anyway, please skip it. There's always a dull roar of shitiness coming from the patio (as awesome as the view might be of Liberty Village condo-town is).  If you're waiting in line for School at brunch, probably just stay there. But, next time go to 25 Liberty. Don't consider this an option. It's really bad."}
{"text":"I visited Williams Landing this weekend for brunch, they are one of the few places that accepts reservations for brunch.  Williams Landing is located in the heart of Liberty Village; on the second floor overlooking the Liberty Shops.  The restaurant is quite swanky, it has a great upscale appeal.  During brunch, you can order anything off their regular menu.  I ordered their burger, which is made with organic meat from Bretta Farms.  Because it is fresh ground, you could order your burger any which way you like!  The burger was fabulous, perfectly cooked and right burger to bun ratio.  The fries were stellar, I devoured them in minutes.  My friend order the standard 2 eggs + bacon breakfast, it came with pulled pork hash and baked beans.  She was quite happy with her meal.  Service was average considering there were few patrons for brunch.    I will definitely be back for their Happy Hour specials. They have a killer patio for the warm summer months.  Check out Williams Landing if you are in the Liberty Village area."}
{"text":"Amazing food is why I go back, service is ok (moxie like if you get my drift..) management/owners are nice. Atmosphere, only good if you like the Liberty village type of crowd! LOL"}
{"text":"Had the balug lentil bolognese dinner. It was very sour, no salt, the pasta was over cooked. There are no veggie burger options although gluten free buns. They did comp us the old fashioned as we did not like it. Server was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Lunch: great priced menu but not many veggie options. Most lunch items are $9 including my meal - half pizza and salad. If you work in LV, this is a great spot for lunch, especially on the patio - great view.  Dinner: I've had dinner here a couple times and both times everyone at the table loved their meals. The mushroom pizza is amazing, and the half chicken entree is incredible! (although very rich). Both times, the restaurant was quite empty - hopefully it will be a little more lively once the summer season starts."}
{"text":"great place for drinks, and amazing patio.  service is slow sometimes, but food is good in some items, and others not so much  overall come here earlier to have a seat in the patio  in the weekend before it gets packed"}
{"text":"food is decent, service is meh. I know people who continue to go here as its quick and easy for lunch. Go there at night and its a different vibe- creep central...avoid if you can."}
{"text":"Great open air space for a bright sun filled lunch or chill evening during the summer months.  The windows open up during the warmer months, opening up the patio space to the main bar area.  It's a great place to enjoy the summer breeze over a ice cold beer or cocktail.  The food however, seems to be equivalent to that of Jack Astors or any other over franchised bar/pub in Toronto.  The menu offers a wide selection of items, none of which are high quality or extremely delectable.  You can tell they make their living off the drinks and vibe mostly.  I came here for brunch and while I did enjoy the space and the nice pre-spring air, the food itself was lacking.  Portions were also unfortunately small."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have never been this far West on King and Liberty Village is now intensely developed with glass condos/Lofts everywhere!   My fiancé and I happened to be in the area and chose Williams Landing from a recommendation. A walk up some steep stairs and there is this HUGE area with a HUGE patio and it was BUSY!  I have never felt so old because I asked the hostess for the quietest area and she said they had lots of space in the dining area. The bar area and patio had loud music pumping and tv screens on and it just seemed like utter chaos. A club scene in the early evening.  The menu is pretty simple but we gravitated towards the Tofu Lettuce Wraps which were ok. We also shared a Vietnamese-inspired pizza which I devoured in no time and also the Moroccan Chicken which had the most yummiest sauce. I really enjoyed the Pizza and Main and if I ever were to snag a table here, I would order those two dishes again.  Service was prompt despite it being super busy.  I can see why this place is so popular within the area - it's got a modern/hipster/patio/rowdy/drinks/bar scene."}
{"text":"After walking around downtown on a gorgeous Sunday, my wife and I wanted to check out Williams Landing, as we are past residents of the area and still visit from time to time.  It's a beautiful space, well designed and the layout is very different from other King West joints.  The patio was packed so we were seated in the middle of the restaurant.  This was totally understandable given the nice weather.  I would have to agree with Roger B's review of the service as mine was identical.  The remainder of the restaurant wasn't busy at all but it felt as though our server was responsible for the entire restaurant. She would drop & run.  She was very impersonal & not very pleasant at all.  Would bring new dishes & leave the dirty ones there for someone else to take away, sometimes 15 mins later.   Would have to agree with the limited, overpriced menu, but in their defense it was tasty.  We had the burger/fries and the Cobb Salad.   In conclusion, a very forgettable restaurant experience.  I probably won't be back unless its to meet friends there just for drinks.  There are way too many restaurants in downtown with much better experience's for your hard earned money."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the service is so shit. It's sad to see they put no effort in keeping their costumers happy... I gave 3 stars for the food"}
{"text":"Organized a surprise party including 40 invitees.  Williams staff were courteous and efficient and the food was excellent.  Williams was the perfect venue to celebrate the milestone birthday for my wife and I recommend them for any other event you are planning.  Thank you Williams for doing such a superb job."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Liberty village, especially in the summer months when you can go enjoy their awesome patio without the sites and sounds of down town traffic.   Okay so a few things, they have a fair few screens around so even though I go there on weekends to watch the soccer they will get busy before any Toronto FC game.  The food and drinks are pricey and nothing really stands out about either however the service is awesome. On Thursdays they have $4 pints on selected beers.   This is also a local Liberty Village night spot, so on Friday and Saturday nights they do get busy.  You will notice I have not really put any humour into this review. Seriously I just could not find anything to make fun of, that is actually a first."}
{"text":"This place is really close to home but it's literally got horrible service. Any time I have come here, it's full of judgement/rude comments by the staff.   The first time this year I came was right after some condo viewings in the area, and we had to wait 10 mins to get seated when the restaurant was empty that we just ended up walking up to the bar and seating ourselves. After getting served our drinks we placed our order and i got the Lamb burger, to my surprise my friends got their meal but mine was forgotten - no apologies, a simple 'ooops let me get that right this time.' if the burger wasn't so tasty i would have given this place a 1 star.  the second time i came here was after the TFC game, granted it was really busy, we were seated and forgotten about for a good 15 mins (no water or even asked to take our drink orders). I would expect a bar outside the stadium to be better prepared for overflow from the game. My table was rocking and i had asked for extra coasters to fix it, the girl took our drink order and when she returned without the coasters, my friends had asked for them again and we were told we were difficult - to which we no longer wanted to eat there and settled up with our drinks and left.  the most recent time of being there was this past weekend for Brunch - my friends really enjoyed kelly's landing on front and wanted to go here despite me saying no, to my surprise we were seated and served in a timely manner, Williams landing was getting an extra star from me on my review until my friends food came out with a piece of hair in it. When she mentioned it the server, her response was \"how do i know its not yours\" 1) the food hadn't been touched and 2) my friend's a blonde the hair was dark!  the only thing this place is good for is drinks by the bar for $10."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment, serving staff was extremely attentive. We were actually taking care of most of the time by the manager Jeff, which I thought was really great. I have the beef tenderloin, it was a nice cut of meat,  but the interesting thing is it that came with, was some type of a bacon spread that was on top of the steak and was like a purée, it was delicious and had some roasted vegetables and something I had not had in a long time beats, roasted beets they were absolutely divine. The places very much for a younger crowd, it's not really sure of what you would classify the restaurant as far as type of cuisine, but I was very satisfied. Although I thought price point was a little high I would tell someone to go there for a good meal."}
{"text":"This place has been open since the summer of 2011 in the heart of Liberty Village and I've been intrigued from day one to try it since the 2nd floor patio was always PACKED, at least from the view on street-level.    So finally tried it on a fall Friday evening.  Was busy, but not crazy busy in the dining room.    Modern, simple, good atmosphere.  Lots of long tables with stools along the bar side, some regular tables and some big booths.  Our booth of six was good.  Fun cocktails.  Tried the toblerone (served in a martini glass, with hot fudge on the sides, Baileys, creme de cocoa, chocolate vodka? - anyway, delicious, and I believe $9).  Delicious Jamaican rum punch.  Our table mostly ordered a bottles of the same pino grigio.  Strange that I don't see the drink menu on their site.  The Liberty Dip appetizer I ordered because it sounded delicious.  It wasn't bad.  Came with tortilla chips and long slices of flat bread, sticking straight up in the dip, like some fun Asian type cuisine.  Not really enough avacado cream and pico de gallo, too much pepper hummus, but pretty good overall.  Some may love, not sure I'd order again for the $11 it was.  Was kind of full from my good fresh cut fries in the entree, so had trouble getting down the veggie burger.  Homemade and a good size, so happy with that.  But personally, I prefer my veggie burgers to taste a bit more like meat, and this did not.  Again, some may love.  I wouldn't order again, although appreciate their efforts with making it mostly healthy.  Wish I had tried one of the fun desserts, but again, was too full.  Will definitely go back here for drinks because of its atmosphere and location, but want to check out their brunch as well.  Not much else on the menu for vegetarian, so can't see me going for another lunch or supper.  Service was good, nothing special."}
{"text":"I live in the area and come here pretty often on different days, different times. Worst time to come is when there's a soccer game. Soccer fans tend to be a different type of crowd.   As far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they do have a great patio in the summertime like everyone has mentioned, but the service and food are pretty poor. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and the only thing that keeps me coming back is the convenient location."}
{"text":"Pretty view from the patio, but it's hard to talk with friends with the music so loud. The crispy cauliflower is delicious and my favourite !"}
{"text":"I have been here 3x since it first opened. The decor is nice but very miss-matched. They have 4 different sets of tables that are all very different than eachother. I like the servers attire but unfortunately I feel that the servers were hired based on looks instead of service. I have been here for both brunch and dinner. Brunch I sticked to my norm and went with my smoked salmon eggs benny with the salmon on the side. It was really good.  Dinner The dinner menu left some to be desired for me. When I am going through the menu for a restaurant I look for certain things...chicken pesto sandwich, pesto pasta, fish, red meat etc etc... The dinner menu really nothing that I usually go for so I ended up going for with the gnocchi. I was pleasantly surprised but after I ate it I was still left feeling hungry :("}
{"text":"Awful service , terrible watery beer and all round really disappointing experience. There is plenty of other better options in the area worth checking out.  Literally the only thing going for this place is the rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Awesome options for vegans/vegetarians!  I was initially skeptical about the tofu lettuce wrap, but it was basically the only thing on the menu I could eat. To my very pleasant surprise, it was exceptional, with beautifully fresh vegetables and juicy, flavourful tofu done to perfection. I would go there again without hesitation.  I also thought the staff was very friendly, especially our waitress, who graciously checked the ingredients of aforementioned tofu wrap for me.   In terms of space, the restaurant is massive, with plenty of tables and big screen TVs to watch sports (if that's your kind of thing). Fortunately, it's not dark and dingy like some other sports places I've been. On the contrary, Williams Landing has a very airy, modern interior with large windows flooded with light and beautiful wooden walls, bar and ceiling. Ultimately, a great place to enjoy great food.  A word of warning to people with back problems: the stairs to get up to the restaurant from street-level are long and incredibly steep."}
{"text":"I've become some what of a Liberty Village regular with several close friends from home now living in this area of Toronto's west end. At first Brazenhead was the place to be, as it was what we all knew thanks to many a TFC soccer match predrinks.   However after some exploration we've come to realize that Williams Landing is the Go-To spot for Liberty Village Residents and other non resident regulars. Right off of East Liberty street you can hear the music pounding from their open roof top restaurant/bar which doubles as a roof top patio in the summer (confused as to where I am talking about? Its right above Aroma Coffee Bar)  A long set of stairs takes you from street level to heaven in a matter of seconds. This venue is spacious with plenty of seating both at tables AND around the bar. Also Televisions are not in short supply here, you can catch pretty much watch any event here and if you are - you are wise beyond your years (this is a sweet spot).  I would recommend a pre 9:00PM arrival time if you're looking to get a decent seat for dinner/drinks. I find that anywhere around 10PM this place gets CRAY busy and you might find yourself waiting on the street for the bouncer to allow you access through the pearly gates.  On a more recent visit here friends and I held up at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready (and we arrived \"early\"). While there I took in there fairly impressive draft beer selection (very heavy on the Amsterdaam brewery more than anything). I decided to give a pint of 416 by Amsterdaam a whirl and hot-DAAM, that little vixen of a pint went down smooth (which is more than I can say for the slop show woman standing....err I mean leaning next to us at the bar) - fair warning this place may double as a cougars den...even I myself almost was lost to one's POUTINE!!! charms (long story).  After a reasonable wait we were seated and ordered food right away. We ordered the Pulled Pork POUTINE! to start as a shareable appetizer (its no longer on the menu but if you ask for it they'll whip it up for you no problems) - This POUTINE! was put both my legs in the air and scream POUTINE! in excitement kinda good... no joke ...it was THAT good. For our mains my friends ordered a pizza and the house steak frites. Both seemed more than happy with their choices and I was blown away by my thin crust pizza selection The Charcuterie (prosciutto, house-smoked bacon, salami, balsamic onions, dates, and home made tomato sauce).  I'm a big fan of this spot and whole heartedly recommend you check it out (but show up after 10 so you don't take our spot) :)"}
{"text":"We came for a light dinner and ordered salads. The Peruvian chicken and steak and tomato were just the right size and great flavor!"}
{"text":"Where to start, short and sweet....  Wrong beer Wrong drink Notified 10 minutes later that they don't have my beer  Got the entre before the nachos Nachos came cold, they were standing for at least 15 minutes Sweet potatoe fries never showed up  I don't usually run into these problems...this was one right after the other...it was horrible!  One waitress turned into another one, I think that the first one messed up sooo much that they switched it up. They wanted to remake the nachos but I was already tired of waiting for so long, if they did they would have left it on the bill I'm sure.   So the nachos were on the house, the fries, got shots of fire ball but ya no thanks, and a 10$ coupon.   Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was good only reason I give it a 3. Service was lacking. We sat at our table at least 10 mins before a waiter came and asked us if someone was taking care of us. He was actually very attentive to us. Before that there were 3 waitresses just chatting away next to us that just pretended they didn't see us. Usually in restaurants waitresses and waiters have a section they tend to. There were 4 hostesses in the front in red dresses. They seemed very unorganized.  Very loud music."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with a friend of mine to enjoy the last few summer's night on a patio.  Williams Landing has a great patio which is large and great view.  Where we were seated (by a \"I hate my job\" faced hostess) at the very end on the east side.  For all you non-smokers like me, it's best to try and get seats in another area.  Basically, we right next to the smokers corner.  We ordered the Mac and cheese friitters (YUM!), the hummus dip (way too bland and tasteless.  Sent it back).  I had the oven roasted chicken (too salty) and my friend got the salmon (which she liked).  Overall, the service was fine, the food so-so and the patio was nice.  If you want to just have a couple of drinks on a nice patio.  This place is a decent choice."}
{"text":"HISTORY/ABOUT/DECOR:  Williams Landing is the go-to patio in Liberty Village. It is stylish and MASSIVE. It is a great place to meet friends for drink or pre-drinks. On Fridays and Saturdays during the summer they typically have lineups out the door. It is in my opinion the nicest/largest elevated patio in Toronto.  MENU DESIGN/FOOD QUALITY:  The food here is really hit or miss. I have attended for dinner many times and on occasion I've seen food get sent back. Just last night my gf sent back her pappardelle because it didn't taste like anything and a lot of the pasta was clumped and stuck together. She never sends food back anywhere so it was pretty bad.  Typically if I am at a bar or general venue I won't order pastas, or any exotic or worldly influenced dishes - you usually get burned. Your best bet here is the burgers. They source their beef locally from Beretta farms and its antibiotic and hormone free. They are juicy and tasty.  I've also had the Cobb salad as well which is a solid bet.   BOOZE:  Slightly pricier than average but a great selection of draught beer including: Krombacher, Kronenbourg & Heineken just to name a few. They offer some beer blends and a decent selection of bottled beer. Solid wine list and a very well priced signature cocktail list - I always fancy a Dark n' Stormy, especially at 8$.  SERVICE:  The service is generally good. I've been to WL more than 20 times and I don't remember getting bad service there. At times it's been so packed in there that you can barely move but overall the service is good.   BATHROOMS:  Very clean and modern.   FINAL THOUGHTS:  Great place to meet some friends for drinks, however avoid eating here unless you are getting a burger. This place has a notorious reputation in the city for bad food. Try to avoid coming late on busy nights such as Thursday, Friday and Saturday, you won't be seated for a long time on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times but mainly for their patio, drinks and Sunday brunch. I came here last night with a group of girlfriends and we ordered a variety of dishes and drinks. DO NOT EAT HERE. We had the steak and frites and the steak tasted like liver. After we  each of tried the steak to see how bad it was, we told our server (who didn't seem to care) because we thought they should know that they're serving a bad cut but she just nodded her head and took our dishes away. We also didn't touch the rubbery calamari and the mussels. You would think that the server would ask us what was wrong with the food before taking away the full plates. Their pizza tasted like frozen pizza. (but frozen pizza tastes better) The only non complaint we had were the poutine and wings. But you can't really **** that up.   Basically, this place lost some customers last night but they don't give a crap since they're always busy.   Head across the street to Local instead people! At least their food is decent!"}
{"text":"One star for the beautiful venue and the redeeming factor that I will mention below.  I went to Williams Landing for a friend's birthday several months ago and I swore it would be my first and last time. Maybe they were having an off night when I came but nevertheless, the impression I left with was negative.  The service was horrible. The waitress responsible for our party was frankly, a supreme b_tch. I'm the type of customer who acknowledges great service when it's given to me and I tip very well to show my appreciation. I have only been so pissed off twice that I left a $0.01 tip to send my waiter/waitress a clear message on their service quality - this was one of those two times.  I brushed off the waitress' evident snooty attitude in the beginning as I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Aside from the fact that our orders took over an hour to arrive, the food wasn't even worth waiting for, not to mention it was overpriced. The steak I originally ordered wasn't a steak. The dish consisted of like eight, thin slices of beef and they were as dry as a 60-year-old vagina. When I flagged my waitress to inform her (nicely, I might add despite the amount of time I had to wait for my food), b_tch rolled her eyes at me. I had to poke the steak to show her the sad garbage the kitchen decided to send out.   The redeeming factor was when the manager came over after my dish was returned to offer me a replacement dish. I refused several times at first because I was already livid but she insisted on bringing me something to eat so I ended up agreeing on a pizza. Nge. It wasn't bad - too salty but it wasn't bad. Points to the manager for the effort (included in the one star).  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Was told 10-15 mins wait for a table but waited over 45 mins, while there were dozens of available tables. Finally got seated because we complained and all we got were excuses from the staff.   Terribly slow and inept service.   Bartender service (Jeff) was great though. He eventually was the one to bring us our dinner."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of what has become of Liberty Village... There, I said it... BUT one place that I feel gives a bit of shelter from the \"shit storm\" is Williams landing. I have been there twice now. Both times I was greeted with friendly smiles and helpful personalities. Both times I also got a table right away even though they were pretty busy.  Friday I sat on the patio which is a bit of an oasis. The Cesars were delicious and I got the liberty dip which was exactly what I needed. The service from beginning to end was attentive without being pushy.  I don't normally comment on the bathrooms but I had to admit, they are pretty nice. Always clean, always being checked up on, I really loved it.  My next dreadful visit to liberty will end at William's Landing so I can end my experience on a high."}
{"text":"Ok food. Might be worth a try for most people given the great location and ambience - the restaurant is divided into an indoor section and outdoor/patio section (this also means it can get cold easily in winter).   Excellent pappardelle pasta.  Avoid the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Great place to sit outdoors in Liberty Village, while watching sports and/or enjoying the weather. I came here Monday to watch a world cup match. Shared some sangria with some nice strangers. Soaked in the sunshine from the expansive deck. Various cocktails on the menu but did not eat there this time. When I return to Toronto, I definitely would head back to this place."}
{"text":"It makes me really sad to write this review, because I really just wanted it to be 4+ stars, because of the location. I have given this place a shot too many times now. The service is awful, no matter what time of day you go, you can never seem to grab a waiter/waitress. The food doesn't take long to come out, but it isn't the most spectacular thing either. If the service was better, and or it was cheaper, it might merit more stars, but the only thing this place has going for them is the location."}
{"text":"Nice spot with clean interior.  Food is decent, don't expect more than pub food when coming in.  We used to order in as well, but I think they're not on Just Eat anymore."}
{"text":"Finally!  Liberty Village has been waiting for a place like this.. The pints are fairly priced @ $6.50 for an organic and the wings are amazing (meaty and well sauced).  Haven't sat for dinner yet, so this review definitely speaks to the casual pint and apps crowed.    Management is on high alert with a focus on making every customer feel special and appreciated.. I'll suggest that it's awesome and appreciated as long as it doesnt change... They set the expectation bar HIGH. Been there twice and both experiences were stellar! Polite staff that, after only being open for less than a week, seemed to have the deets & kinks all ironed out (quick and knowledgable).  Worth naming one of them - Hanna (tall red head) was absolutely AMAZING - made our night!  (managers reading this should reward her - this is the type of staff that make an amanzing establishment - amazing).   Hands down - best patio in Liberty Village (time to 'act' like you care about your customers Brazen)"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times because it's close to work. The food is a hit and miss. Tonight we took a burger, lobster roll and a nacho plate, and I wasn't happy with my burger. The lobster roll and nacho plate were good.  There's a weird taste with the burger tonight....this brings back to when my sister ordered the turkey burger back in December, her turkey tasted very weird. She got food poisoning from it.  I gave 2 stars only because the nacho platter, the lobster roll, pizza and the fried cauliflower are good. The rest of the food that's on the menu, not good. Ever since they revamped their menu in the fall, their food went down hill. Very disappointed!  I don't feel good at the moment....the burger isn't sinking in. I went straight home because I got sick from the burger. I feel horrible right now! I seem to keep going there since it's near work and I get sick every time! I never learn! From now on, I will not set foot there ever again!"}
{"text":"Everything about this establishment screams suburban strip mall, from the decor to the super friendly server.   I was there last night. It was rammed with people. The service was slow until we got a server's attention.  I had: The Lebanese Tuna salad - The tuna was good. The salad tasted like something I could have easily made at home.   The pan seared scallops - This was served on pork belly and had a delicious glaze. It was slightly salty, but all in all it was quite tasty.   We wanted the Tuna Poke, but they were out. I don't know if I'll return to try it.   If you're looking to have a few cocktails and interesting cuisine, this is not the place for you.   Williams Landing is not trying to be chic, with its light-finished wood decor, scattered plastic patio tables, and sports-bar vibe. That being said, I'm sure this is a decent place to have a few beers and appetizers on a nice summer day with some buddies or a platonic friend, if you live in Liberty Village and all the better patios are full."}
{"text":"New managers could use a lesson in customer service. Been going to this place for years and it's going downhill fast."}
{"text":"Great spot for the Liberty Village folk. Also a great spot to eat if you're checking out a concert at The Molson Amphitheatre it Echo Beach.  The spot can be a bit loud, if you're looking to catch up with a pal, but the service is consistently good and the food is good too. I can't stay away from the lobster mac n cheese - divine - and for dessert, the cheese cake dumplings are the BEST."}
{"text":"Despite some less than stellar reviews, I came here for brunch with my in laws. It was great! Yes, the patio is awesome, no doubt about it.  But we also had incredible service. The food was really great. Between us we had: The Breakfast, The burger, the veggie burger and the apple and cheddar salad.  We all were super happy with our choices, and ate every. last. bite. I saw someone order the french toast, which is full of blueberries and stuffed with what look like 2 slices of cheesecake. Must get that next time!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday and was so disgusted I vowed to never go there again.   My husband and I sat down on the patio and happened to look inside to the bar, only to see the bartender (heavier set guy, wearing a football jersey) take his shoe off, STICK HIS HAND IN HIS DIRTY SWEATY SHOE, adjust it/take a rock out/who the hell knows and then continued making drinks. Putting lemons in drinks and touching straws. I wanted to vomit.   Other reasons I will never go back: hostesses were rude and mediocre looking. Apparently there was a menu shortage because the menu we asked to keep on our table in the event we changed our minds about food was taken away from us. Our waitress was distant and not friendly at all.   Never going back."}
{"text":"Living and working in LV, I've found myself at Williams Landing more than a handful of times. The vibe, drinks and service is pretty good. Nice patio and they even have a live DJ some Saturday nights, which makes for a nice place to sit around drinking in the summer.  That said, I'm always disappointed by the food and don't think I've ever enjoyed my meal here. It's your standard Moxies/Milestone's kinda menu that lacks creativity. The food is bland, overpriced, and often comes out cold. I don't think anyone who lives in LV actually likes it here.  Last time I went to Williams Landing, my nachos came out so cold the cheese wasn't even melted. The time before that, I ordered the steak frites and my fries were ice cold. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I was beyond disappointed. I ordered the turkey burger, usually I love turkey burgers, but this one was disgusting. The patty was mushy and wet,seasoning was weird. I wasn't even able to finish half the burger before feeling sick.   My sister ordered a tuna salad substituted the tuna for chicken. Salad tasted weird wasn't very appetizing.   Service wasn't good, I asked for mayo she forgot. There wasn't even that many tables only 5 tables max!   The only good item we ordered were the nachos. We BOTH got food poisoning. Defiantly won't be coming back,really sad considering it's such in such a great location."}
{"text":"I went here for a late dinner. The restaurant has a nice patio, which was really busy and usually there's a wait to get seated outside. The place was happening after 8 pm, and got livelier as it got later.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I had a merscatto wine, which was sweet but I really liked it. I do tend to like the sweeter wines, so if you like something sweeter this is a good choice. They have a good selection of cocktails and different drinks. We ordered the calamari and the fish tacos. The calamari was nicely battered and flavourful. The calamari batter was crispy, crunchy and cooked just right. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. The pineapple and jicama slaw with cheddar and chipotle sauce nicely complemented the deep fried basa.   I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and I'd be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled into here during one of my first experiences in Liberty Village. Great location, and we sat by the window on the 2nd floor which made for a great view of the neighbourhood (I'm an urban planner -- I appreciate this!)  I ordered the cobb salad and my friend ordered a fish taco appetizer. She liked her dish, and I loved mine. I'd say that it was one of the best cobb salads I've ever had. Amazing flavour, substantial amount of chicken, a whole egg, bits of bacon, and even a side of guacamole! Absolutely loved it.  It's a bit on the pricier end, but for a \"high-end\" pub it's about right. I'd love to try the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Pretty good atmosphere here. Came here on a weekend night with a friend. Really enjoyed being on the patio here with good beats in the background. I'm thinking of bringing my friends here on a weekend again.   Atmosphere: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Presentation: 4/5 Taste: 4/5 Portion: 4/5 Service: 4/5  Atmosphere: Nice patio, tons of seating and great music.   Price: Priced probably a little on the higher side but that's typical for a place like this.   Presentation: Presentation was average.   Taste: Calamari was pretty good a bit on the oilier side but the sausage pizza was great! Loved the sweet potato sauce on it. Have definitely not tried that before.   Portion: Average portions but hard for me to gauge as we shared one pizza between two people. I think one pizza for one person should be pretty sufficient.   Service: Not bad but not excellent either. The staff didn't offer me any water until an hour later."}
{"text":"The service at this establishment is terrible.  The lady that greeted us at the hostess stand spoke to us in a very condescending and rude manner.  We arrived with a group of 6 after the 10k Lululemon run this past Saturday.  They had literally just opened and the restaurant was empty minus the 3 or 4 parties they had seated before us.  We were told that they had not scheduled enough servers and there would be a 30 to 45 wait.  The restaurant was literally empty.  When a member of our party asked if we could at least sit down we were told no.  Regardless of this we still reluctantly decided to give our number and wait for a table.  About half an hour later we were seated.  The restaurant opened at 10:00am and when our server came over to speak to us he informed us that they were out of two menu items.  I completely failed to understand how at 10:35, approximately half an hour after opening they were out of two menu items.  The restaurant was also still quite empty at this point.   It was also a task to get a refill on water and coffee.  I asked another server if she could bring us steak knives (two people from our party ordered steak and eggs), water refill and coffee refill.  She said she would let our server know.  Of course that did not happen and I finally asked a bus boy.  Him and another server came over with the knives, water and coffee.  The food was decent but because of the service it soured the whole experience of eating here.  I would not return here and recommend that anyone that values service not patronize this place.  They have a very nice patio but that is not a good trade off for how poor the service is."}
{"text":"I have conflicted feelings about the food. The fish tacos are my usual order, and when executed properly are great. That being said you can always count on at least one of the three tacos to have almost no fish in it. I guess they think if one or two of the three is done well, they can get a pass on having one taco be basically empty.  If they could serve this simple appetizer better I'd give them 5 stars because the prices are fair, the staff is nice and the restaurant is casual; a relaxed place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Me and the wife had a fantastic time.  The service was amazing very friendly and fast I never had to wait for my glass of water to be filled and she was coming back every few minutes to make sure everything was ok I couldn't ask for better service. Now let's talk about the food I got the rustic burger with bacon and a side salad and man was it good the burger patty was cooked to perfection! Very juicy and full of flavour. The salad was quite good as well I got a Cesar salad it had the perfect amount of dressing and what a good dressing it is they put nice big chunks of bacon in it and top it with a very tasty Parmesan cheese. The wife had sea food linguine. The portion was big with lots of mussels. Now the atmosphere is really cool the restaurant is on the second floor which I love because you don't have people walking past as you eat. They have an nice big patio to eat or drink on and because it's on the second floor you get that roof top feel and again no traffic of people walking past as you eat or drink. So if you looking for a place to take a date or to have a party I recommend this place!!  I give it a five star for the staff they're awesome and so friendly"}
{"text":"If I had a choice, I wouldn't even give this place one star.   Food was okay. But it all came down to service.  Rude server. When I let her know I had been waiting to pay for my bill for 45 minutes, she gave me a disgusting look and yelled, \"No you didn't!!!\"   Then she entered a larger amount in the debit machine ($50 instead of $30) thinking I would not check the machine.   Never have I complained about anything like this before. I'm usually very understanding when it comes to servers but this worker was too much. It's one thing to yell at a customer, it's another to try something shady like that. Unbelievable.   Very inconsiderate, unprofessional and disrespectful.   This will be the first and the last."}
{"text":"I asked if the burgers were cooked fresh in-house. Server said they are. Burger is not cooked fresh. I am sick of over-priced and bland burgers. At least be honest about it :\  They used to have a lunch menu with some pretty decent specials on it. Not sure what has happened to it. The server seemed to have never heard of it. Bring back the lunch specials!  They do have a nice patio though. Just don't bother coming here if you're going to eat inside."}
{"text":"I'm starting to think that somewhere in Toronto, one very successful interior designer is living the high life because I've been to many that look too familiar.  Williams Landing is one of those restaurants - ever been to Against the Grain?  The interior is extremely familiar.  Liberty Village definitely has adopted the \"If we build it they will come\" philosophy as there are dozens of developments going up and as a result, the infrastructure, conveniences and local businesses are popping up.  WL itself is only 6 months young.  It is located on the 2nd floor.  I sure hope there is an elevator available and that drunkards are escorted until they safely reach the bottom, that or I hope Williams Landing has a good General Liability Insurance policy for when people go tumbling down in their state of Friday night \"I had one too many.\"  We came here with a Groupon for a 4 course prix-fixe menu.  We made reservations and were even given a nice window seat.  The lighting is dim but the space is quite large.  The front of the house is the bar/lounge area with large flat screen tv's playing sports.  You will also find the larger tables in this area on high bar-top tables (10ish people).   The back is the dining room area that houses their wine cellar, as well as booth seats and regular tables with red, mod chairs.  The staff here are all relatively young and all sport the signature black that seems to be the go-to colour for server uniforms these days.  And of course the girls are all sporting mini-skirts that would have Catholic school nuns doing the sign of the cross and screaming \"God bless you child\" at them.  We were presented with a set menu.  For our starters we got the Beef Tartlet and the Veggie Spring Roll.  There's a reason why it wasn't called a beef tart - full stop.  It was tiny and you could eat it in one bite. It also came out cold.  The actual tart was extremely buttery and the shoestring potatoes were a nice touch.  The caramelized onions, however, were super! The veggie spring roll came with limp vegetables and was a sight for sore eyes.  It tasted fine though I think the dipping sauce was too salty.  It was a fish sauce and hoisin sauce dip with a hint of citrus.  For mains we ordered a steak which came with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak was seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The meat itself was melt-in-your-mouth and buttery.  I liked that the mash was not smooth as it added a different textural component.  I opted for a mushroom fettuccine which was served al dente with a tomato sauce.  The mushrooms were extremely flavourful and made the dish but unfortunately the roasted red peppers were overwhelming and drowned out all the other flavours.  For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding which was spongy yet dense, but not heavy.  It was topped with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream and drizzled with caramel.    The espresso was intense and dark to the point that it left a bitter after taste.    Williams Landing is basically a Moxies packaged in an up and coming neighbourhood and is a go-to place for the locals as they put in more infrastructure.  If I am in the area, Bar Vespa would be my preferred choice.  William's Landing was okay - but nothing to Yelp about."}
{"text":"MMM the lamb burger here is amazing  Some great crab or lobster something app thingy but forget name - or maybe it was Mac n cheese - either way, great food and atmosphere - location rocks!"}
{"text":"Great patio, service can be spotty at times if you're going before a TFC game but they have great Fish Tacos.  Food is on point.  Great spot to chill on a nice summer day."}
{"text":"As this was newly opened, decided to try it out for brunch The Good: Great outdoor patio.  Nice open concept space with large marble bar that is partly on the patio and half in the restaurant.  Service was extremely friendly and there was no wait.  Washrooms are very nice.  The pulled pork was excellent The bad: Food needs improvement.  The brioche french toast was extremely thin and flavourless.  Their version of eggs benny had pulled pork instead of peameal.  The english muffin base was oily.  Instead of hollandaise sauce, the eggs appeared to be topped with oil. The verdict: Nice space.  Maybe better for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Came here post-Argos game. Apparently it's the Argos' After Party spot ;) Of course, if you know me, that is all meaningless because I'm not big on professional sports!  However, it was a different type of \"event\" for me in that I got to see and meet some new people who ARE all into pro sports.  Now, service was great. We sit down, our server tells us about the half off wine deal, and we're sold. Lovely zinfandel on the menu, after which we ordered the fish tacos and the shareable mac and cheese dishes.  All the tacos come in singles, which is nice because you can try as many as you want! I think we were all intrigued by the fish taco as it had pineapple in it. I will say that as much as I enjoyed the taco, it's quite big. Which is great, because it was $5. But personally, I'm used to the Mexican tacos now -- which are smaller and loaded with more meat. Those tend to get messy while eating for me and this one didn't!  We also got the Brisket Mac&Cheese to share. The general consensus was that we enjoyed the mac and cheese but the brisket didn't do much for us in terms of elevating the flavour. It wasn't a large dish, and while the brisket could be used to cut through what can sometimes be a heavy dish, this mac and cheese did not feel heavy or \"overly filling\" at all.  There was a steady stream of patrons, and they seemed to be going strong in terms of business at 1:30am -- when we decided to call it a night. I'm not sure if I'd go out of way to come here. Liberty Village is not convenient unless you live there. But if I were back in the neighbourhood, I'd definitely pop in again."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch a game. Food is decent here (fish tacos are really tasty) and the wine/drink list can satisfy almost anyone.   Great patio in Liberty in the summer - can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places when I visited! Came in for dinner on a Friday night and stayed until closing.   There is a dinning are, a large bar, and gorgeous deck/patio overlooking the neighborhood. We had some apps and some entrees and loved everything.  I think there were tofu lettuce wraps (I'm not even vegetarian and loved them),  lamb burger, seafood pasta of some sorts, and more delicious seafood. Specialty drinks were pricey but delicious.  My friend loved her dark and stormys.  I loved whatever vodka honey strawberry puree situation.    We loved the busy atmosphere so much we stayed.  The music was fantastic, it was caribana weekend and the dj played everything from ace of base to reggae.   The bartender, holy dinosaur.  Soo slow, so slammed, so not getting though the crowd.  Painful to watch, especially because he kept trying to dance.  I would recommend just getting cocktail service at the bar and not messing with that dancing fool.   Can't wait to go back to both Toronto and Williams (or King's) Landing.  Fantastic music, great atmosphere, beautiful night."}
{"text":"Brought my parents here on a crazy leafs play offs night tonight. The food is amazing! My Mam said that the chicken pico pizza was \"easily one of the best pizzas she's ever had in her life\". And she repeated it a few times so you know she meant it! Gerry is an incredible chef! The whole menu is amazing. Prices are great too. We had great service tonight by Keanne regardless of how crazy busy it was for the leafs play offs! And the managers Sandra and Jeff, and hostesses Siobhan and Christina, went out of the way to find us a table and ensure great service through out the night as they knew my parents were visiting on holiday! Thanks mathew (the server) for the shots of fireball, the first time I've ever done shots with my parents and it was hilarious  what a great night the best night they've had since they got here! Can't thank you guys enough"}
{"text":"Williams Landing is right in the middle of a trendy area full of small trendy restaurants.  Which makes it unique in that this restaurant is huge.  They also must have spent a fortune in upgrades such as the wooden ceilings and wine fridge wall.  The food is fairly good, fresh with good service.  However, other than the great patio they have, I would prefer many of the other local restaurants."}
{"text":"I went to Williams last night for some red wine, and my date and I had a great time!  It was rainy outside and we sat right by the window... Perfect night for red! The atmosphere was perfect. If I had to nit pick about anything, It would be that it got a bit noisy for a Monday night. Not complaining at all though!  I will definitely go back and have dinner one evening :)"}
{"text":"A very trendy modern hip restaurant located in Liberty Village with a nice patio. Part of the \"____ Landing\" brand. They even have a DJ on most weekends.  I actually like the dishes I've had here.. including the Redemption burger and fries, Steak frites, and Moraccon curried chicken.  Dessert I recommend is the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream and it was amazing. Also had the \"dim sum\" dessert, which were cheesecake stuffed fried wontons with chocolate and fruit sauce - give this one a pass as the taste just wasn't good."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in after walking around liberty village. I ordered the steak and frites, which came with fries, truffle dip and vegetables. The steak was cooked pretty well, nice pink in the middle and juicy. My friend ordered the duck  breast, which was served with quinoa, and tomatoes. The duck was quite spicy (especially near the edges) but tasted good.   Our server was pretty good considering the large crowd that formed after we had sat down. She came by once to refill glasses and another to check in.   I was very impressed with the front of house/ manager who was very attentive. He delivered the food, then checked in a few minutes later. I put my jacket on halfway though the meal as we were sitting near the exit to the patio and it was slightly chilly. He came over to ask if I was cold, then proceeded to turn on the over head hearing lamps.   Overall, the food was pretty good, maybe slightly expensive for portion sizes but the location is amazing and the staff very friendly :)  Will come again (maybe not on game day though! )"}
{"text":"Great brunch. Great architecture quality and environment. Eggs benedict are fantastic. Definitely recommend this place. However, they've made changes to the menu lately and it is not as good as previous visits were. 4 stars for great value to $ spent."}
{"text":"Had a good steak dinner tonight. Plate came with veggies and potatoes. Serving was huge and couldn't finish it. The price was on the high side for not being a steak house. My son ordered a plain burger and fries and he though it was just ok. (3.5).  The manager Jeffrey was the nicest and most accommodating.  (5) He came to make sure that things were good several times."}
{"text":"Defiantly NOT a fan.  I like the idea of the large patio in the summer but most of the staff sucks. Especially the Asian hostess (with long dark hair). I don't know who she thinks she's kidding. Sorry! You're NOT that fabulous! She is extremely rude and snotty and always wears a red dress with her boobs hanging out. DESPERATE for attention and it looks trashy!!! I personally think she should work in the back so no one can see her nasty face.   The food is terrible. I've tried many meals and they have been 2/10. Last time, I ordered a steak and it came with a unripe grilled tomato and the meat was rubbery...Ugh....  They should only service drinks. At least you know that the \"brand\" of alcohol is worth the money spent and nothing that they made in the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favourite patios in all of Toronto where the staff make you feel very welcome quickly. Great atmosphere and drink selection.  Had the brunch and Patricia's service was spot on.   Great work Williams Landing."}
{"text":"It is a go to spot with a laid back atmosphere. Fish tacos were delicious. Service was ok, but can be slow if you go on a weekend night. It's loud and busy place, smoking patio included."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch again, was reunited with my beautiful salad. This time we ordered a pitcher of moscato. Everything was excellent, super service despite being very busy."}
{"text":"Does watching team canada win gold at 7am while drinking 8 pints automatically deserve 5 stars?    I think so!    Pints were cold!  A little slow, but it's 7am and a packed bar!    The brunch was awesome and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Hang out with friends on Thursday night after Christmas party. The food is a little bit too salty and the steak was over cooked.   But the waitresses are so friendly, as soon as she know we are having the Christmas party. She was being really hyper and start suggesting some drinks for light up.   Overall the seats are comfy and the waitress are really nice and sincere. Even the food is a little bit over cooked but I would give 4 stars just for the service and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I expected much better from this restaurant. Went here for a friends Birthday Dinner and we couldn't get seated until the full party arrived which to me seemed ridiculous because the restaurant was not busy/full. So we were waiting around for the latecomers, while majority lot of us arrived on time/early. Waiting around the bar for almost an hour. When finally getting seated, took another half hour for people to order drinks when majority of us already starving and ready to order. After another 15 minutes we got to order, the fact that food took so long to come out was disappointing. I have been to restaurants for other birthday gatherings and they were prompt and our food arrived on time. Our food did not arrive until 9:45 pm, did not get seated until 8:40. A lot of us were getting annoyed and grumpy. The staff did not let us know that our food was on it's way until 30 mins into wait. Overall, disappointed at the customer service and the long wait times."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food has not gotten better but it may be because we went on new year's eve.  Possibly the main chef was off.  The calamari was a good start which we enjoyed. Next we got out mains which were pasta and risotto.  The pasta was bland and tasteless.  The risotto was definitely undercooked with raw rice and the eggplant tasted funny.  Luckily, the manager came and took both of the mains off our bill.  At that point, I lost my appetite but my cousin ordered the salad which she was happy about. I am unlikely going to return until the ratings have improved. Very disappointing to say the least but the staff there were patient and kind.  The cooks really need to check their food before sending it out.  Not sure if I will return as this is the second time that I have been disappointed. Maybe only for drinks."}
{"text":"The patio and the view is the good parts about this place. Other than that- food was so-so and service was bad, which took away from the patio experience. Would come back maybe only for the atmosphere and drinks."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, the music was cool, and the servers were very accommodating. Also I love how it has a patio and still an indoor option, very trendy."}
{"text":"Very nice place located at the beautiful location. Prompt service, amazing food and plenty of drink options. Perfect to hang out with friends, watch the game or just chill at the patio. Wide variety of delicious food. Must visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to. The service was sub-par. My order was the last to come out from my party, and it was ok, AT BEST. I mean, how long does it take to make a salad?After I complained, the waitress avoided me for the rest of my stay. I will never come here again, and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Their patio seems nice. However thats pretty much where they stopped impressing.  Foodwise, I had the lamb burger and it was very dry and overcooked. While they appear to have a lot of beer options on tap, Amsterdam and Moosehead are the only true independents. The rest are all internationally owned or big brand owned (and no, Mill Street is not craft beer since they are owned by Labatts now).  Our server may have just been overworked as it was busy, but the general service provided was also impersonal and unattentive. Even if I wanted to complain about the overcooked lamb burger, waiting for someone to come check on us wasn't worth it. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Came here after a game and was pleased that we were seated right away and the food came quickly.  However, I ordered fish tacos, and there was a tiny piece of fish in each taco.  I actually opened them up because I thought the kitchen must of forgot the fish.      I wouldn't go back for this reason. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Recently held an event here with a professional group. Very loud and no mic allowed so just an fyi. Back room was good for maybe 15 people comfortable sitting in the cushy chairs.  Beer/wine selection was good. Food that we tried, sweet potato fries, kale caesar, nachos, cheese and meat plate were all pretty good.   Would come back to try dinner on their large happening patio. Large TVS all around for catching games.   Service was not genuine but good."}
{"text":"Great location and look. Helpful service and a tight menu. Really suggest the duck carbonara. I'm also told that the brunch options are spectacular so I'll have to come back to try them out. Could be the nicest looking patio in the area and that's saying something. My only iffy bit was the duck breast was a little tough."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a friend as he lives in Liberty Village. It seems to be the go to place to go for brunch for people who live in the immediate area. It wasn't too busy when I arrive around noon but this place is fairly big and accommodates a lot of people. For brunch, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles which has chicken tenders, belgian waffle, maple sherry glaze and white bacon gravy. The food came out pretty quickly and I think I made the good decision to good with this dish. Loved the chicken tenders as it was nicely seasoned and crispy. The waffles were fluffy, soft and hot. For $16, they gave a decent portion of 4 waffles along with 2-3 large chicken tenders. Overall, it's a decent place for brunch in Liberty VIllage. Service and food was good."}
{"text":"Nice place for drinks, the service is A+, however no one in my group of ten found the food amazing, just OK."}
{"text":"Good value for your money. Always come here for the patio and the spicy Ceasers are A-mazing!"}
{"text":"After a night of heavy drinking and being hungover we decided to hit up a place for brunch. We initially decided on SCHOOL, but the wait was too long, so we settled for this place. We were surprised the place was very empty. We were promptly greeted by the hosted upon arrival and were seated. Our waiter took forever to come and wasn't friendly. Everyone at the table wasn't too impressed with the food, it was mediocre. Didn't have a vegetarian option for breakfast, unless you request to not have the meat. But you would still need to pay full price for it. Probably won't go back... Bye!"}
{"text":"No complaints here! Service was great and attentive and the redemption burger was awesome.  I hear the patio is nice in the summer so expect me back.  Wait...I lied I will be back every Wednesday night cause I play football around the corner lol"}
{"text":"Food and service are passable for a Sunday brunch but don't bother on a dinner service.  Food was slow and sub par,  barbecue sauce on the Margherita pizza was not a nice touch.   Service was also non existent, even though our section was only half full my server was not attentive.  Although it seems my server was the worse of the bunch, other waiters seemed a bit faster.    Overall joeys and earls gives a better experience in the same type of atmosphere.   Will not return."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. We had a reservation for 12 PM and didn't wait long to be sat. If only the rest of the experience had gone so smoothly. The hostess sat us at a table with dirty plates stating \"someone will come along and clean up your table\" There were other tables in the place that WERE clean why not just seat us at any of the numerous other tables available? Whatever, we moved.   When our waiter finally arrives to pour us water, he spills ice on the table and proceeds to pick the ice up, with his bare hand, returning it into the pitcher. This didn't bode well.   Our food finally (eventually) arrives. My chicken and waffles were the worst I've ever had. This is a food I've had on several occasions so I know how it should taste. Even if I didn't, I know what good food tastes like. The waffle was soggy, probably because they weren't made fresh when ordered but rather had sat under a heat lamp in a steam tray and the chicken was nothing but batter.  As if all that weren't enough, my colleague received his salad complete with a complementary hair. At least they didn't charge us for that!  Dirty tables, soggy food and disgusting hair laden salads aside, what truly made the experience the worst was our rude waiter. I've worked in customer service. It's easy to give good customer service.  William's Landing is the worst. Don't go there. Too busy for their customer's good and too rude for their own good.  Just stay away.  Find yourself in Liberty Village looking for some good food? Try Mildred's Temple Kitchen instead; bigger portions, fresher tastes and, most importantly, better service"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Williams Landing for a friend's birthday party.  In the Liberty Village area, I don't think there's a better place for kicking back and watching the game. It's a very casual, unpretentious setting - something that can't be said for most of the other establishments in the vicinity.  Instead of getting the standard fries with your burger, I definitely encourage you to try the Landing Salad. For a few dollars more, you're getting an incredible salad (especially if you love flavourful, garlic-y greens). Health-wise, I'm sure it's not too much better than an order of fries, but you can trick yourself into thinking otherwise!  The wait staff was attentive, and very accommodating for our 10+ party. The party took place during a snowstorm when the restaurant wasn't too busy, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they were incredible.  I can't find much to complain about here. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and delicious and the view and atmosphere are unparalleled to any other place in LV. The wait staff and the management team are so friendly - once a manager came around and gave everyone sunscreen on a really hot day. The only thing that gets me is every time I walk in the host staff are absolutely brutal! They act like they would rather do anything in the world than deal with you. My friends and I went last Saturday and asked if there was space outside for 7 and all we got was a bored and flat \"no\". She didn't offer to sit us inside, give us a waiting time or ask if we wanted to sit at the bar. It's so frustrating because it's a great place but the first thing you experience really puts a bad taste in your mouth. If you can get past that then I'd recommend going for sure!"}
{"text":"A restaurant on the 2nd story of a building, nice interior with a Moxies'esque feel albeit fancier.  Yvonne T. & I each had the fixed priced four-course menu.   For our amuse-bouches, we had the \"Roast beef tartlet with balsamic caramelized onions & horseradish cream\" & the \"Vegetarian spring roll with Asian slaw & citrus hoisin sauce\". The tartlet was great however the hoisin sauce for the spring roll was heavy on the salt.   Our appetizers consisted of \"Hummus with grilled flatbread & avocado crema\" & \"Tomato salad with house-pickled red onions & feta\". Top pick was the Hummus dish as it was full of flavour & also had guacamole on the side which was an extra bonus. The greens of the salad were not the most crisp unfortunately.  The mains, \"Grilled local Durham county flatiron steak with goat cheese\" & \"Fettuccine forestiere with cremini, oyster, & button mushrooms\". I must say the steak dish could have been the best of them all but my steak was not hot & was strangely chewy, although the tater mash that came with it was excellent in flavour & texture. The Fettuccine was really good, fresh pasta & the essence of oyster flesh infused into the pasta & the mushrooms, resulting in a very gratifying pasta dish.  Lastly, desserts, \"Chocolate bread pudding with caramel & ginger ice cream\" & \"Vanilla ice cream with two house-made chocolate-chip cookies\". The ice cream from both dishes were good, the bread pudding was hot & flavourful & the cookies were nice & chewy.   Our server was attentive & friendly, also the restaurant manager came out to greet us & other patrons. Good dining experience overall, I could see myself coming back again."}
{"text":"Place is okay and seems to be one of the more popular places in Liberty Village.  In a central part of the village, among great pubs, and bistros, W/L gets packed quite easily as soon as the weekend approaches.   If you're there late, the chances of getting a drink at the bar is impossible due to the amount of people lounging by the bar, and at times the line up can get long.  They've got a beautiful patio that's spacious during the summer months, so do take advantage of it.   In terms of the food, I have yet to have tried it, however their drinks are like any other drinks at your typical bar, and are reasonably priced considering the area.  For food I still prefer heading across Bar Vespa, and secondly to the Brazen Head. Overall Williams Landing is an OKAY place, would I come back? probably not."}
{"text":"This place has a 2.5 star rating in my books. Only recommend to go here for drinks on the patio. This place has an awesome atmosphere and vibe to it - great place to meet new people and socialize.   However, this is NOT the place to get food. The only thing I liked here was the pesto dip for calamari (not the actual calamari - not crispy, too salty). Whatever you get, just please stay away from their pizzas. I've shared their Margherita pizza with a friend and both of us were almost 100% positive they've reheated the $3.99 frozen Restorante-brand pizza from a grocery store - no joke. Fish tacos were ok - definitely had better. Had their turkey burger once and sent it back - it was inedible (to their defense, that was last summer so maybe it has improved since then - no idea).   Hunter's Landing has MUCH better food."}
{"text":"On a stormy rainy day, I met up with a friend for a quick lunch.  I've noticed the place whenever I've visited Liberty Village and have always had an itch to check it out.    We were greeted by the hostess and promptly brought to our seats.  Williams Landing seems like the defacto watering hole for the working crowd in the village, with a nice open space patio that was closed for the day as it was raining very heavily outside.   My friend ordered the chicken wrap while I ordered the ribs.  The food came out quickly as they were not too busy this day.    I noticed there was heavy burnt marks on the ribs and expected the worst.  To my expectations, I was right. The ribs were too overcooked and dry. It tasted like cardboard. My companion's food looked better, but according to him, it didn't taste out of this world or very good. It was average according to him.  Our waitress brought over some barbecue sauce in a small dish for my ribs, but it was too little too late.  The sauce was even runny, and tasted like it came out of a store bought bottle. If I had to guess, the ribs were probably leftovers from the previous night or something because it did not look like it was made to order.    I struggled to finish my lunch as the fries that came with the ribs were also soggy and limp.  The accompanying coleslaw was bland and tasteless, the dressing was thin and looked watered down.  Too bad, I wanted to like the place as it seemed like a nice place to hang out as an after work bar.  There was plenty of natural light and had an inviting feel to the overall ambience.  I would maybe try Williams Landing again just to give them another chance the next time I'm in the area, but for now, I am in no hurry to return as there are much better options in the city for a bar/gastropub."}
{"text":"Location is perfect for residents of Liberty Village. The food is great, tons of screens to watch the game (not that I'm mutch of a game watcher!). Love the open feel and the huge open air patio during the summer months."}
{"text":"I came here with a group on a weeknight evening. The ambience is nice and casual. It looks like a great place to grab a beer with friends or to catch a sports game. They have a patio and it is lovely. However, I did not have high expectations for the food and the food was just as expected.   Service: The service was terrible. They never checked up on our table to refill our water. We barely saw our waiter.   Food: My group ordered a variety of appetizers to share including nachos, fried cauliflower, and mussels. Everything was mediocre, nothing special. For the entrees, I ordered the salmon. The portion was extremely small given the price. It was very bland as well. Overall, the food is overpriced given what you get.   I think I would return here for drinks but the food is not worth it here. I rather eat elsewhere then come here for a drink and enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere and location but found the food is overpriced for what it was. Didn't really love the menu choices either. Service here on a Saturday night was incredibly slow as well. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"My husband and I have probably been here a number if time due to proximity. We never had a pleasant experience with food or service. The food is worse than a fast food place and the service is unfriendly and pretentious. All the hype is about the ambience and rooftop which I don't think it is worth it. I'm truly about the food and service and this was less than par across the board. The hero burger across the street is much better in food and service to be honest! There are many far better option in the same location."}
{"text":"Nice hip spot.  I guess it's the place to be seen...  Service was friendly.  I only had the beer.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pros:  Location Beer Fast seating Group get togethers Food Sports tvs Clean bathrooms Clean tables Lunch time is best  Cons: BIG WAIT TIMES Under staffed Cauliflower appetizer  Summary: Third update for this location, again they need to work on their wait times for being served at least a drink, and then food. The average wait time for to have the waiter to take your initial order in my experience is 15 minutes. Wait time for drinks upon ordering for it is 15 minutes. Wait time for food is 40 mins from ordering. Appetizers take average of 25 minutes from order time. Total time waiting is around 55 minutes - 1hr just to finally get all your food, drinks and everything in between. The bill took about 10 mins to get. I think if you  have a lot of time on your hands and would like a good place to not be rushed, Williams Landing would be the place for you. The staff who serve you are nice, but seem overwhelmed. I have gone multiple times now to this location for social events (Myself only choosing this location once on my first time there). The FOOD is FANTASTIC, fries, salads etc, definitely worth it. The beer is priced reasonably and the other drinks are okay. Cauliflower app was okay, not worth the hype.   sum of summary: Wait times = bad Food and location/ sit down times = great Seating = great Great place for groups and not rushed service."}
{"text":"We visited here yesterday before a soccer game and I was really hoping to like the place as there is a real lack of decent spots in Liberty Village.  However after the issues with our visit I won't be going back.   1. My beer came in a filthy glass. It obviously missed the dishwasher. I would usually  let it slide after I got a new beer because I understand that mistakes happen. However it took me about 10 minutes and an interrogation to get a new beer. When I brought it to the server's attention that I still hadn't gotten my drink, he first questioned if some other server had brought it over to the table.  He then took a few seconds to scan the table to make sure it wasn't there.  He then asked a second time if another server had brought over the beer.  \"Are you sure she didn't bring it over?\"  As if we were hiding a pint of beer under the table!  I'm 36 years old and I work full time. I don't need to scam a pint of beer from a restaurant. When he seemed satisfied that we indeed did not have the beer in question he finally brought a new beer saying that my beer had been taken to another table.  Rather than tell me that my beer had been socializing and making friends with other people, I'd would have like to have been told that I he got me a new beer.    2. I ordered a breakfast burrito. It was what I'd expect from a breakfast burrito on an airplane or possibly a frozen dinner.   It was bland, goopy and came with a side of BBQ sauce and slaw. The menu got my hopes up with its description of scrambled eggs, pico de gallo, ancho hummus, \"avocado crema\"?, bacon and cheddar.  There was no pico de gallo.  If there was ancho hummus it was too bland to taste. The avocado crema was concentrated at one end of the burrito.  I make better breakfast burritos at home.  3.The servers uniform is obviously supposed to be basic black outfits which is fine enough.  However the female servers were wearing outfits more suited to a club or seedy sports bar rather than a restaurant.  I don't want my food served with a side of a** and cleavage."}
{"text":"Great place! Not as busy as some of the other places for brunch. Went and got a great meal with great service! Would definitely come here again. Great atmosphere as well"}
{"text":"A friend an I went to Williams Landing last week for some appetizers and drinks.  Th food was great, I recommend the tacos, and the service even better.  We had Veronica as our server.  She was friendly, upbeat and made the experience more enjoyable.  We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I tried this spot for brunch a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday and had a good time.  The scones were delicious and the location was great. I ordered an eggs benny dish made with lobster, which was okay, but not up to my standards when it comes to this favourite breakfast dish of mine. I will probably return to give other items on the menu a shot."}
{"text":"One of the most difficult places to get a drink at the bar in Toronto.    Been here several times.  Bartenders just don't serve drinks here.   Dying of thirst."}
{"text":"Look up in Liberty Village and you may see some greenery and folks sitting on a large outdoor patio.  As a relative newcomer, to the Liberty Village scene, their outdoor seating is incredibly spacious.  It is quite the experience to sit on an elevated patio for a Sunday brunch.  Highly recommend this place for get togethers with friends.  Service was friendly and prompt.    The brunch menu was not very extensive or inventive. In fact, they were even sold out of one its dishes.  A real shame considering how few choices there were.  Reviews from the table were consistent: okay but on the bland side. Chicken on the Caesar salad was dry. Dressing on that dish was sparse, lacking the zest of a quintessential Caesar salad.  The standard breakfast for ten dollars was underwhelming.  Eggs were overcooked and the bacon on the skimpy and disappointing side. Two  thin  strips of see-through bacon. Absolute bacon blasphemy! It should be heartier!  I did find the slightly mushy hash tasty!  The serving size for the hash was on the minuscule side. An extra tablespoon might have done the trick.  However, it is a comfortable space despite the modern surroundings and TV sport screens surrounding us.    A must see is their washrooms! Beautiful! An entire small room to yourself!  Clean, modern and not located in the basement!!!     I would definitely go back again. The patio is an oasis worthy of passing time with family and friends."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a drink before dinner down the street. We too seats at the bar. Fees pace is amazing.... Literally no walls between inside and out. We definitely will go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here the other day for a friend birthday. The place is very nice and clean well organized with lots of TV screens which I liked as they had an NBA game going on. The drinks were good and the price was fair. What I did not like about the place is the rules the run.   My friend brought cup cakes for the birthday which is fair enough and easy to use for a bar location. However the server charges 2$ per person for cake cutting services.i definitely did not like that it's not about being cheap or anything it was more about the concept. Brining cup cakes which are each worth 2 dollars anyways would be funny to charge each individual 2 buck for it it just does not make sence and should be take of. The server was very understanding and said yes it makes not sence but it's the club rules and she can only call the manager and he can resolve it. I did not have to deal with it I just think it's stupid and should be taken off.  The security was amazing and washrooms were clean so if it is not your bday I will recoment to check this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Williams Landing a bajillion times.  My friends even threw me a \"surprise\" party (I kinda knew about it) for my birthday here.  I love it here.  Always a poppin environment and the patio is amazing.  I've tried a couple things off the menu but I feel like it's always changing.  I've never had anything terrible here.  My last visit I got a fish taco and a small kale caesar.  Yo, when they say small, they mean SMALL.  It was literally a side salad for $6.  I really wanted my greens, so I didn't mind THAT much, but I wish i knew how tiny it was. Luckily it was not bad.  My fish taco was bigger than the bowl.  The taco was ok, nothing too amazing.  I would probably get it again.  Red sangrias are delicious and dangerous.  I was feeling pretty woozy after one.  Two and I'd be chattin up a storm with randoms at the bar.  It's probably best I stuck to one. I love the amount and array of fruits they put in the sangria.    Overall, I love coming back here.  Liberty Village in general is just such a different vibe than the downtown core.  Good place for all sorts of groups.  Defs always recommend this place for the patio season."}
{"text":"Good value on food, not that much on drinks.  The best feature of the venue is it's amazing second floor patio overlooking Liberty Village central.  The patio is awesome in the summer, but also in winter, as it is all glass-enclosed.    For those who work in Liberty Village, they have lunch specials which come to about $10-$12.  The food is good, gourmet, done by a professional chef, so even if it is a bit pricey for the amount - it is still a good value.   The drinks are a different matter.  $9 for a pint of Keith's is a bit pricey, even for the overpriced Liberty Village (I know, the rent, I know :).  Inside is very tastefully decorated and the pretty waitresses (is that a job requirement? :) add to the overall pleasant ambiance.  From the regular lunch menu, the pulled pork sandwich is always a good value, also the soup and salad combo and the occasional curry."}
{"text":"The food is just okay, there aren't a lot of options. The drinks are way over priced for what they are. My drink came out to the same price as my meal."}
{"text":"I'm always conflicted when to comes to reviewing places like this.  Not my scene at all and I didn't come here on my own volition (came by for a birthday party).  So take my review with a grain of salt.  This place is like pricier Joey's (acceptable) /Jack Astor's (horrible) that turns into a shitty sports bar/dance lounge when it gets late.  The food was pretty forgettable (then again, that's pretty standard for your usual spot with busty waitresses wearing all-black).  So that's not bad, I guess.  Beer is around $6/glass and tap selection is pretty poor.  But again, this is to be expected at a place like this - so no demerits there.  It's pretty strange they have a glass wine cellar in the back - so it's part wine lounge as well?  The music is quite assertive - but it's not music that makes me want to dance. I live and breathe hip-hop - and they play that middle-of-the-road frat boy hip hop.  The type of 'hip hop' that drunk girls like to slur along to.  As it got late, the popped collars and short skirts started to congregate around the bar - squeezed in the narrow laneway between the bar and tables.  So it was just a mass of drunken humanity awkward half-drinking, half-picking-up and half-dancing.  There are TVs all over the place playing sports as well - so I guess it's part sports bar as well?  I guess I shouldn't mark it badly just because it's not my thing - I mean, a friend liked this place enough to throw a birthday party here.  And they are cool as hell.  I spent some time thinking about it and I realized it's really a sign that your restaurant is 'meh' if someone wants to have a birthday party there.  A party organizer is looking for mass appeal - which often means catering to the lowest common denominator.  They want something for everyone.  So you have middle-of-the-road food and drink, sports, dancing and generic music.  If you can overlook how confused this place is, it's not bad - but to me, it's trying to do too many things at once.  It combines the elements of a sports bar, resto-lounge and dance club and waters it the fuck down until it's devoid of all taste and personality.  Meh, indeed."}
{"text":"Been there about half a dozen times. Food is good, staff is horrible. Pompous and/or incompetent, more often than not."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday! The server was great! We got a mixture of things, calamari, nachos, wings, salads, steaks and most didn't disappoint. If you are coming here I would recommend the wings, nachos and burgers. They tasted amazing and worth the money. The steak was alright, I had to send it back due to it being overcooked but even when it came back it was just alright. However, I have to say the waitress and manager were very good at dealing with the situation and took it off my bill. Needless to say I would come back."}
{"text":"Dropping my brother off a friend and I found ourselves in Liberty Village and decided to stay on that side of town for food. On my brother's recommendation we travelled up the long flight of stairs to Williams Landing. While the music by the front entrance and walking through the bar area was a little loud, the dining area was at a much more acceptable level. The decor was modern and pleasing to the eyes, and the seats were very comfortable. While we sat in a booth, the chairs also looked like high-end and more modern versions of waiting room chairs and turned out to be just as comfortable in the 10 seconds I sat in one just to give it a shot.  Within 30 seconds of being seated the very peppy waitress came over to take drink orders and was more than happy to over-sell their in-house filtered $5 water. After an over detailed description of how they make the water, my friend decided to give it a try and I just ordered a beer. (Note: they are a Pepsi location or else I would have had a rum and coke.) After the first sip the water still tasted like regular tap water, and after a single glass my friend was onto diet-Pepsi. The menu variety was a little lacking, but we got calamari to start, followed by a bliss bbq burger and then finished the meal off with gimme s'mores. I asked which I should get the burger or the California striploin, and the still peppy waitress pushed for the burger saying how great it was.  I do not eat seafood but, as per my brother's recommend, it was incredible. I can't give a taste breakdown as I did not have it, but visually it was a better colour than you see at the Firkin restaurants, closer to what you would see a proper chef make on the Food Network. The house-made burger itself was excellent and the gruyere (swiss) cheese was a nice touch, the pulled pork is where it lacked a little. There was not too much sauce which is okay for some (I like it saucy), but the meat also tasted a little off. Not that it was rotten, just didn't taste like the slow cooked tenderness that usually befalls a pulled pork sandwich. The fried that accompanies the burger were really good and the chef understood what a well done fry is which made them that much more enjoyable for us.  The dessert left me a little under-wowed. For $9 it was house-made grahams and mallows and then some mousse and chocolate sauce. When it arrived, the fact that it was three 2\"x1\" smores had me a little perplexed for the price, but the taste should be worth every penny. The cookies looked good, then a really thick layer of marshmallow, chocolate sauce drizzled underneath them, and that is all I was able to see. I was hunting for the mousse only to find a very thin layer spread on the bottom half of the cookies. Very underwhelmed at this point I picked up the first one and that is when I realized that the chocolate sauce was not a garnish around the dessert to dip the smore into, it was now all over the bottom of the cookie and my thumb. After the first bite, and the last, I was still not impressed at all with this dessert.  While the meal started off well, it slid slowly down hill by the time we were done. The pricing is fine for an establishment like Williams Landing, but in our opinion the food did not add up to the same price point. The overall thought between the two of us is that we will not be returning as it is very overpriced for just mildly adequate. The peppiness of the waitress was just not enough to support the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"After seeing a 2 hour line at Mildred's Temple Kitchen, we decided to have brunch on the 2nd story patio at Williams Landing. There were 4 of us, and we started with an order of calamari (it was closer to lunch than breakfast when we started). Our mains were the landing breakfast, eggs maine, eggs willie, and the jerk chicken sandwich. We also had a glass of white wine, a couple of cups of coffee, and el michelada.  The calamari were a bit over breaded, but cooked well. The dipping sauce was flavourful which resulted in an above average dish overall. I only tried the jerk chicken and eggs maine, both of which were very good. When the benedicts first hit the table, they looked underwhelming as they're served on a croissant, which makes the food look smaller than they should be. However, they were filling and well complimented by the salad. There was a good amount of lobster with the eggs maine, and the eggs were cooked well (I like them runny, and they certainly were!). The croissant was well toasted and buttery. I liked the seeds in the salad as they added both texture and flavour. The dressing was also not overdone, as many restaurants seem to drown their salads.  One of the downsides was the beet salad that my girlfriend upgraded to with her jerk chicken sandwich. We were expecting primarily beets with a little bit of greens. However, we got the opposite. There were only 3-4 pieces of beets in the salad. The entree was redeemed by the sandwich, however, which was juicy and tasty. The bread was also moist with a crunchy crust.  The coffee was not anything special, but the caesar was good, and served in a giant frosted beer glass.   Lastly, the view from the patio was very nice and overlooked Liberty Village. It was a great spot to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"We went to William's Landing a few weeks ago for the first time for dinner.  It's a pretty happening place and I've heard it becomes quite busy later in the evening.  The music was a tad loud for my liking but then again, I might just be getting old, lol!  We sat by a window which was nice.  The edamame and calamari were excellent appetizers.  We both ordered steaks as our main courses.  I usually frown upon of myself for ordering steaks at non-steakhouses and this time, I was right about that.  The steaks were edible but if you're a steak snob like me, they weren't great.  We both asked for our steaks (different cuts) cooked medium.  My steak (the flatiron) arrived very rare but it was already sliced up (the kitchen pre-slices it) so there wasn't much that could be done about it... it's not like they could put it back on the grill.  It also smelled very odd.  I can't put my finger on it, but it was just a strange smell for a steak to have.  My partner's steak (the cab) was quite well done.  Apparently, the kitchen doesn't know rare, medium and well-done.  We ate the steaks nonetheless because we're not complainers unless something is majorly wrong.  They had plenty of other tasty looking items on the menu.  Overall, I felt the prices were a little more $$$ than I would like.    Our server was very nice but a bit distant.  I noticed other servers were much more present and interactive with their guests.    On a side note, I noticed the orange seats in the dining room are quite low to the ground.  I guess this is on purpose?  For someone who's short already, I felt like I needed a booster seat at the table.  As well, I noticed the fabric on these orange seats looks quite worn and I don't think the place has been open that long?  Also, it looks like they have a lovely patio which would be great in the summer."}
{"text":"My rating is based on a great seat on the rooftop patio on a beautiful day with a friend. Assuming a place can bring you some drinks and maybe some food, there's not much that can ruin that type of day. I have been here before, sat inside at a booth for dinner and experienced pretty much what some of the so-so reviews revealed; slow service and food is definitely not orgasmic. But if you sit at the bar, you'll get great service.  However back to a beautiful day on a rook-top patio with the perfect half sun, half shade hi-top and excellent conversation with a friend I hadn't seen in years, (and the CNE airshow interrupting the discussion occasionally), Williams Landing is a great place for all that. We had some burgers, Redemption and Turkey, and they were ok.  If you're going there for a serious meal with quick service and seated inside, you might be disappointed, but for some crazy fun on a rooftop patio with drinks and music, this is the best place to go in the King West area."}
{"text":"Awesome patio and bar. We went there late last night and loved the vibe. Place was crowded, DJ was on pointe, and waiters were cool. Only issue was with 1 bartender who ruined the experience for customers. Other than that venue is really nice."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and very sophisticated. The patio is gorgeous as it looks over liberty and is very airy.   The food is good, but nothing to rave about. The pizzas are fresh, which is nice, the Cobb salad is kind of just a salad (with no blue cheese :[). Overall, food is good, but it kind of feels your average run of the mill chain restaurant.   Come here to drink after work for the views if anything."}
{"text":"UPDATE: DO NOT GET THE NACHOS 19$ THERE DISGUSTING the pickles onions are the worst flavour on nachos ever they lost a star for this  Average pub food:  Kale Caesar salad - my friend had this and loved it, they make there own dr saint and have bacon Lardon bits (not sure how to spell it)  Jerk Taco - my friend had this and said it was just ok I took a bite it was ok I wish it was a bit more jerk flavour but it was sweet due to pineapple jam  Mushroom soup - average mushroom soup decent portion would I get it again no, but it is decent, it's not a cream of mushroom  Crispy cauliflower - THIS IS BOMB the truffle aoli is really good it's lightly battered, we both would defiantly Get this again !"}
{"text":"This place is really good on weekends because of the vibe and the awesome drinks. The foods good and the waiters are okay. It gets really busy especially on weekends where it turns into a social bar- literally- where you can't find a spot anywhere and the patio is open during the summer. Good vibes here!"}
{"text":"I came here about two years ago with friends and returned last month for a friend's birthday. I tried their food this time, which was actually tasty for a place known more for its drinks. We had the prosciutto pizza and carbonara pasta. The pizza was made with a thin crust, seemed to be wood oven baked, full of cheese (mmmm!) and while the ingredients tasted fresh, there wasn't a lot of prosciutto on it. The carbonara pasta was tasty but my husband and I personally love Scaddabush's version of this pasta better.   Reasonable prices that were comparable to other restaurant bars. Nice decor and it was loud at times but you could still carry a conversation with others. Service was also good throughout the night."}
{"text":"If 2.5 was a thing, this would be it. Great location, one of the better/bigger patio options, and the drinks are exactly what you'd expect.   Food is fine. Nothing spectacular or inspired, but for the area the price isn't brutal. We've been here quite a few times cuz I really want to like it, but the service has been what makes it brutal every time.   Slow, rude, inattentive, and often pretentious for no reason at all. It has a Milestones vibe, which is fine, but it seems like they may be trying to go for something else? Better options out there for sure, but not the worst place to enjoy a summer patio."}
{"text":"The busiest bar in the area. The rooftop is a great spot to enjoy the nice weather and drinks with friends. If you're into sports, there's a ton of TV's to watch. We didn't stay long enough to have a drink as we wanted to check out other bars. The crowd is the only part of the experience I wasn't crazy about. There were girls in tight dresses and heels, looking up to par... and then there were girls in flip flops, t-shirts & jeans (the guys were dressed similarly at both extremes). It was a bit confusing as to what kind of bar this place was trying to be But I guess they don't discriminate, so that's good...?"}
{"text":"Pros: - great sports bar (lots of large TVs) - great patio  Cons: - place is pretty small (in winter there will not be too much seating area)  We went there to watch the game 5 of first round of playoffs for blue jays.  We were recommend to go here by the Uber driver since our original destination was already packed (Brazen Head).  Ambiance: (4 stars) When we originally got there the patio was closed off. They had a glass door between the patio and the rest of the bar, which made it hard to actually see the TVs.   We sat at the patio and had view of one of the TVs at an angle and 3 tvs right in front of us was not visible due to the glass doors.     We asked them to open the doors, but got initially rejected due to the cold weather.  After a while they realized that the bar was getting over crowded and that they could use the patio to have people actually order food.   They opened the patio.    Service: (4 stars) The service was pretty good, the reason why I give it 4 stars is because the waitress spilled drinks twice in a span of 5 minutes.  It was crowded so I am deducting only 1 star.  Food: (4 stars) We got 2 orders of wings (4 stars), calamari (4 stars) and sliders (3 stars).   The sliders were very small, and cost 12$ for 3 of them.  I would not recommend this.   For wings in a single portion you get 7 wings.   With 12 beers (tankhouse) and the 4 appetizers the bill came to $150.     I would recommend this place for summer drinks especially when there is a game going on"}
{"text":"By far my favourite lunch place in Liberty Village.  The patio in the summer is to die for - and to burn for - I'm currently nursing a burn, but it was worth it!  I love that you can sit on a patio - catch some rays and not hear a peep of the street below you or the construction around you.    The design is funky and classy and the food is yummy - and always fills me up - sometimes to much.  I don't find this place pricy, but others might- it's CHEAP in comparison to The Brasen Head and has much better food and more of a selection for drinks.  The restaurant is kind of split into the Bar and then the dining area - with all the TV's hanging over the bar - so if you're not there for a Soccer or hockey game, you don't have to watch or listen to it.  The staff (all pretty girls) are nice, but can be a bit ditzy.  Obviously this place caters to the male business man lunch, but that's kind of the area.  I have to say - the day time manager - his name I have yet to learn - is SMOKING HOT!  He's super sweet, always comes over to the table to see how you're doing - if everything is right and if you're just enjoying your time.  It's the little touch that makes this place stand out from other restaurants in the area.  Not matter the size of your party, he comes over.  He even offered me sun block for the burn I'm nursing, but I wasn't fast enough on the witty line of \"if you apply it for me\"....maybe next time :)  A friendly note - it does get busy at lunch - so head over promptly, or go after the rush."}
{"text":"Tacos here were pretty solid.  I was very happy with the quality of food.  What I wasn't expecting was the sub-par level of experience from the bar.  They have some cool cocktails that I wanted to try on the drink menu but when I asked for one the bartender would say that he was too busy to make one.  Why have it on the menu? ........anyway!  Also ordered a Caesar and for the price was expecting some high end vodka or at least clam juice from scratch but no, it was the bottled stuff.  Again, great food but the bar needs to get it together as there is a lot of competition in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper at Williams Landing this evening.  We'd won a $25 gift certificate at a Toronto Marlies game in March on the kiss cam so decided to use it this evening.  We sat on the patio near the railing.  Gord ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese Skillet.  He said it was really good and that they weren't skimpy on the lobster.  He also enjoyed the salad and liked the dressing (it's blue agave).  He'd order this again.  I ordered a salami pizza.  It was really good and I'd get it again.  I gave Gord some and he liked it too!  Jillian was our server and she took good care of us.  She was friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have a few cocktails and appetizers. I would recommend having the fish tacos. The location is great and they have a huge patio. Liberty Village is a nice place to go for a walk after dinner."}
{"text":"We had my girlfriends birthday there on a saturday and it was great great food and service. The only thing I didn't like is that it the atmosphere felt like half elegant lounge and half sports bar. But would differently go again."}
{"text":"Super nice atmosphere. Sandra, the manager was just awesome: busy St Patrick night she still found us a booth in no time and just had the perfect welcoming smile to set the evening right. Overall service was great, look of the place is what's expected for the resto-pub"}
{"text":"Great location if you live in Liberty Village, not worth the trip if you don't. I've been here a few times with friends for drinks, lunch and the occasional dinner. Today I came with my friend for a weekday lunch, I suggested the redemption burger for him as it's a pretty safe choice. I ordered the chicken Cobb salad. It was the saddest salad I've seen for $16. A small sprinkle of feta cheese on a mound of greens was enough to disappoint. I wouldn't come back for the food, given the limited choices in the area, but the staff was friendly. A lot of room for improvement"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to in liberty village because it is quite big and there is usually seats available. There is a nice \"balcony area\" (this place is on the second floor) and the wine list is alright.   The food isn't spectacular though I like their tacos. There aren't too many choices for pizza and pasta but they are usually passable.  The pizza is thin-crusted.   There is usually street parking which is free but the plaza is paid green parking."}
{"text":"The food was excellent (had the Atlantic Salmon...yum), and our waitress MJ was great. The bar staff is also very friendly and attentive. It really starts to hop at around 9pm, so if you want a relatively quiet dinner right after work, this is a great place to come.  The only thing that prevents this place from getting a 4 or 5 stars, is the hostess. Talk about someone that hates her job....I don't think its possible to be less helpful. Seems like she has a totally different take on Customer Service, the customer is there to serve her!  Once that gets straightened out, this place will be amazing!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch n had their lobster mac n cheese with salad n ice tea.  The lobster mac n cheese was delicious. I tried some if it while i was at the mac n cheese festival. The portion seems small but it is filling. There is a lot of lobster with every bite, its creamy n delicious. Still need to expand my venues for lobster mac but this place would be one of my go to places.  The only reason i put 4 stars is coz of the portion. I remember eating in another place (that stopped serving it) had a bigger portion n im trying to find something similar to that."}
{"text":"Just another higher end chain restaurant.   This place looks and feels like a Joey's, Milestones, or something of that calibre. The waitresses are all hot leggy girls in black, the look is clean and modern but unimaginative, and the food is A-ok.   Came here for a post-meeting lunch and beer with friends. Their menu consists of the typical burgers salads, pasta dishes. I didn't see anything that really excited me but I went with the seared tuna salad. Tuna was seared well, but not very flavourful and the smear of sauce was plain mayonnaise... How boring. The salad was good, however, and was packed full of quinoa, edamame, and a tasty dressing. It was much more filling than I thought and couldn't finish, though I did have a beer with lunch. They have a pretty wide beer selection, but most of them are pretty average choices, ranging from MGD to Stella and the like. Surprised to see Kronenbourg blanc so I went with that and it was great.   In the end, the meal cost much more than I would have liked for such an average meal in an average setting. The service, however was prompt and friendly, which can't be said of other chain-like yuppie restaurants. It was a pretty slow lunch hour but I'll give them that. I would have preferred to spend that kind of money on a smaller more independent restaurant which would have been more appetizing. I wouldn't come here again by choice, but no major complaints either."}
{"text":"I love this place! I came down here with the kid and met up with some friends. Staff was very accommodating with the stroller and high chair. We all enjoyed some brunch, enjoyed the view and the sunshine on the patio. While it is a little pricey, with beautiful weather you are getting your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Went with a meetupp group yesterday. We were first seated in the near the bar but it was too loud. Although I loved the music as they were playing 90s hits. Because there were 8 of us, we asked to move to the dining room area and they accommodated us.  I had a glass of red wine. It was good. $6 for 5 oz.   I then ordered the sausage pizza. I was craving pizza and this hit the spot. The sauce was a maple sweet potato puree and on top they had kale, house made pork sausage, black figs, honey & blue cheese sauce. It was so good! Sweet, meaty and salty. I will definitely order this again.  A fellow meetup member raved about the chocolate dim sum so I had a piece. It was good. Fried wontons filled with cheesecake & blueberries served with chocolate fondue and raspberry sauce.   All in all I will definitely go back. The food was good and the waitstaff were attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great on a hot day, watched a lot of the FIFA soccer games there because of the big patio..Food was good and the service was quick. I personally really enjoyed their sliders and pulled pork.   Nice atmosphere, haven't been there for dinner or a late night but during the day when the sun's out and a game is on, nothing beats a nice patio, good food and a couple drinks."}
{"text":"From appetizer to entree was the average, nothing surprising. But dessert was a hit! I saw this dim sum thingy going around the restaurant so I looked for it on the menu. And of course i couldn't find it and had to ask my server because its a dessert!   Its a deep fried blueberry cream cheese filled dumpling served with chocolate sauce and raspberry syrup presented in a dim sum box. Pretty good. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this morning (after not wanting to wait 45 minutes for brunch at Mildred's Temple Kitchen)   I ordered a mimosa and the landing breakfast, which came with scrambled eggs, toast/jam, breakfast potatoes and I substituted bacon for fruit. Everything was delicious!   The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that it is pretty pricey! The mimosa was $9 which I thought was a little steep.   I'd love to come again for dinner and drinks, and I think the atmosphere would also be perfect for a nice date!"}
{"text":"I am fan of their Patio! Food is ok, it would be nice to see more variety though. They smoke they own meat in house"}
{"text":"I am going to give them 4 stars because they have a great upper level patio and good selection of tap and canned beers, and an above average food menu. O.K, the beers are overpriced, but sometimes you pay for the experience. I have been here several times and never had a bad experience with the service, food or drinks. This is a great place to chill with a friend or two and the perfect place to 'people watch' while enjoying a cocktail or two :)"}
{"text":"It's expensive but the service is fantastic and the food is pretty good. Our birthday boy made a reservation for 25 people and they told us we can do separate checks. About 30 people showed up and they kept separate checks for us. And when more people showed up for drinks, they also kept separate checks for those people, despite us all moving around.   There's no better place to hold a birthday."}
{"text":"I wanted to give more than 3 stars ... I really did.  I expected a beautiful layout with big windows overlooking Liberty Village .... I anticipated Moxie's-esque level of hot waitresses . . . and I was open to whatever else WL had.  Overall, aside from the brilliant location, and I'm sure is a hot after work or weekend night spot ... but to jet in for lunch, its just a smidgen above Jack Astor's or Canyon Creek, without the home-i-ness of the Keg, and a little Moxie's thrown in for good measure.  Ho Hum ... yet I'd go back."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Overpriced and underwhelming. It also seems to be suffering from some sort of identity crisis.  I'm not sure what to make of Williams Landing. Upon reaching the top of the steps, you're greeted by their spacious patio before walking past a row of LCD TVs overhanging their sports bar and benches. Then you're brought past a divider and into their sit-down area that's centred with a glass wine cellar. Is it trying to be a sports bar? Is it trying to be a resto-lounge? I don't know, but the blaring alt-rock seems a bit incongruent to either.  We ordered their $47 prix fixe, which I noted was unchanged from Yelpers who dined here over a month ago:  1. roast beef tartlet (delicious bite size) vs. spring roll (better in Chinatown!) 2. garden salad (standard) vs. humus plate (soft pitas and nice dips) 3. fettuccine with various mushrooms (quite good with a good amount of 'shrooms) vs. grilled trout with potatoes (quite dry and the potatoes were overly buttery) 4. chocolate bread pudding (rich and delicious!) vs. raspberry sorbet (standard)  They offered a standard selection of commercial beers and I opted to get try their cocktails instead, which were quite good. Our server was friendly and attentive.  Overall, the food was very \"meh\" - it falls into the \"gourmet\" sports bar food - but at exceedingly high prices. For the same $50, Ruby Watchco offers truly gourmet prix fixes that change on daily basis. For $35-45, Yours Truly offers exceptionally creative and delicious vegetarian and meat prix fixes. For $25, Libretto's dinner prix fixe is a ridiculous value. For $21, the Osgoode Hall Restaurant offers an amazingly delicious and decadent lunch prix fixe. The list goes on and on, and unfortunately, William's Landing doesn't come close to making the cut. Perhaps it would be better if it just remained a sports bar."}
{"text":"do you like a trendy sports bar in liberty village?? why not kill two birds with one stone:bring a date here to impressive her and catch jeremy sen Linational and the new york knicks play ball at the same time.. lots of variety on tap and many screens to watch on. so if basketball isn't your thing there's always crappy leafs hockey or LPGA  drinks are bit on the high side and they have plenty of seating. restaurant is located on the upper floor. The service was very good. i didn't get a chance to eat here but i did glance over the menu. nothing that really yelled out eat me!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the brunch here! Although I have to agree with some of the other reviews that food taste can be a hit or a miss. Close to home so we do swing by once in awhile , it has great atmosphere especially in the summer with the patio."}
{"text":"Great large size patio with cool colors and a modern feel.  Tasty mac & cheese fritters $12 appetizer Burger with a cesar salad was mediocre  $15 Calamari was hit and miss each time  'Q' water is cool to have although just tastes like water.  Service was slower on this holiday Monday.   $45 with tax & tip it was kinda of expensive for the quality yet I return her because of the proximity in Liberty Village"}
{"text":"Good ambiance but slow service. Food is what you'd expect - good but not exceptional. The sticky toffee pudding is worth a trip back for."}
{"text":"The first time I was here, there was a giant black hair in my salad (I had red hair); it was complimentary but there was no way I was eating that. Still, I figured that it deserved a second chance.  The second time I was here, I saw the manager shove his penis into the female server's bum while she was ringing someone out. She looked PETRIFIED. This was in broad daylight over lunch hour! We looked at each other in absolute disgust- it was definitely noticed.   On top of that, it took nearly 20 minutes to pay our bills despite the fact that we were adamant about being in a hurry from the start.   I am never coming back here. I could get past the overly revealing clothing of all the servers, the slow wait time and the mediocre food but the whole sexual harassment in the workplace makes me lose my appetite fast."}
{"text":"Williams Landing is a safe choice for those living and working in Liberty Village. They have a great roof top patio in the summer, perfect for enjoying a drink or meal.   The menu is fine, standard pub fare, seemingly uninspired. Playing it safe. It's not bad by any means, but it is not memorable."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great food, awesome drinks & awesome atmosphere ...there is a bit of a longer wait list for the food, which is great don't get me wrong, but I found it a bit long wait time."}
{"text":"So I should probably start out by saying that I literally created this account to write this review. My personal opinion on reviews is that the only people that write them are the ones that love the place (and/or work there) or absolutely hate it. Sadly I am following into the second group.   This is my third or fourth time at William's and not my first bad experience but by far the worst.  In an effort to be fair I will give both the positives and negatives of the experience and William's, who knows maybe someone out there truly loves horrible service and can look past the airheads that work there (sorry for any employees that are actually intelligent, unfortunately I have only had to deal with idiots).  After sitting down at the bar and ordering a drink my roommate and I waited about 15 minutes before seeing our server/bartender again and thus being able to order food. Oh I forgot to mention that our server gave us the Brunch Menu when it was 5pm and then proceeded to shrug it off by saying, \"The only difference is that there is brunch on it...\", sorry toots but you are also missing the entire list of Entrees. The next 20 minutes were as you'd expect, zero check-ins from the bartender and us having to eventually hail another bartender to order another drink, so I will jump to our meal.  In case anyone is still reading and wondering where the positives are hear is your reward. The Ontario Duck Breast was awesome and according to my roommate so was the Turkey Burger. Now back to the William's Landing Horror Show.  We have now finished eating and when we are able to get the bartenders attention ask for our checks. It isn't 5 minutes later that I see her walking out the front door with a purse on her shoulder. Buckle up because it's about to get worse...  When 5 more minutes has passed with no sign of the bartender we get another ones attention and ask for our checks, also asking what happened with the pervious server. He then replies that she may have gone on break or was having a \"breakdown\". After asking to speak with a manager a woman walks up to the bar, mind you this woman had been flirting with our new bartender all night, and claims that she is the \"off-duty manager\". After a long back and forth about poor service she tries to act her way through as if she is really a manager there, all the while the new bartender is going along with it. (Their chemistry is strong, but their bullshitting skills need work.) After I am finally able to get a \"working manager\" he comes over to inform me that the woman that walked up does not work their at all! During this interaction with the new manager the bartender has the audacity to act as if he had no idea who she was or what BS they were trying to throw at me.   This truly was the most insulting and poor dining experience I have had in my life. My friends had warned me about William's and its poor service but I had always overlooked it because of decent food and a nice setting.   This is the last straw and I will never be going back again. As I started this review I will remind everyone that I am not a regular yelper as most experiences are good or at least decent enough to avoid this. Before going take head and dine cautiously because this is 2 hours and $60 that you will not be able to get back."}
{"text":"Came here before a concert at Budweiser stage. I've been before for other concerts and it's a great spot within walking distance to the venue. Always nice to park in liberty village, grab some food and walk to a show. The food is always great and the patio outside is top notch.   The menu has a fantastic selection and the \"healthy\" options are not only healthy, but taste amazing. I ordered the Salmon and it was great. Nothing worst than ordering a healthy meal to watch your weight and it tastes like crap. Not the case at any of the landings. This one is just great for concerts and pregame!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a Valentines Day dinner with the boo. He ordered the maple chicken which he said was pretty tender and tasty although there was a bunch of very fatty areas and I had the turkey burger which was delicious. We also ordered the fish tacos as our app which the waitress forgot to punch through the ordering system. We reminded the server and they were brought to us after out dinner was served (it's okay, it happens but at this point we were already stuffed). The tacos were really good. I especially liked the jicama slaw on the tacos which I think would make the turkey burger taste even better. =)"}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived here on Monday evening around 8pm. It wasn't busy at all, which was good just due to the fact it was quiet since we had to have a serious talk.   The hostess sat us in the booth which wasn't that comfortable since I'm short. I couldn't put my feet on my floor and it felt like I was sliding off the chair. I wish they had a foot rest type of thing on the leg of the table.   Our server was Katie and I thought she did a good job. She brought us water with lemon right away, which I love.  My friend and I ordered the Liberty Dip and the Warm Black Bean Dip. They were just okay, the black bean dip did taste better in my opinion.   My friend had ordered a Caesar and couldn't even finish it because it was WAY too spicy.   Would I return? Probably."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to hang out with friends and grab some drinks. They have such a great roof top patio. Service is friendly. Food may take a while when it's busy. Food is a OK, not bad but not amazing either. There's a good selection for everyone to choose from.  My only complaints are: 1) music is very loud late in the evening, so loud that it's not enjoyable as you can't even hear the person sitting next to you. 2) for the non-patio sections, AC is a bit lacking. It was hot hot."}
{"text":"Could not have been any better! Our waitress was super nice and friendly, she even let us order an appetizer that wasn't on the menu anymore. Food was absolutely delicious and really hit the spot. Would definitely suggest trying their maple chicken breast! I'd absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing night out to eat."}
{"text":"You. Must. Try. The. Nachos. 10/10 would recommend. Not all Landing locations carry the same menu selection, so if you're ever in the Livery Village area - try!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with my parents that are from out of town. My father can be somewhat of a picky eater, and this menu really gave him a great selection.   Service and food were really good."}
