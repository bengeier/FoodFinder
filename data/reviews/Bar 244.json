{"text":"$3 drinks all night every Friday & Saturday is impossible to argue with on Adelaide. Cover is usually only $5 before 11:00pm and the guestlist is always free and almost always available. The crowd is young, they play ALL KINDS OF MUSIC. Seriously, I heard \"We Them Boys\" and \"Livin' on a Prayer\" in the same night. This is one of my go-to places.  My only complaint is the bouncers, they are super friendly and would totally stand up for anyone with a problem HOWEVER they are easily distracted, usually by hot girls grinding on them or they're talking to each other. They also don't search everyone that enters, which can be a good thing for stoners, but one of my buddies was fresh off work and he made it in with a box-cutter and pliers... right after they searched my other friend because he was wearing a baggy coat. I've never had an issue but enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with $3-$4 drinks. Went there for my birthday got in for free(plus a few friends) because I was on the guestlist and I arrived before 11PM, I think it was.  It's a good mix between bar\club. So if you're not into the club thing entirely, and want to be able to dance without making a scene, it's a good place to go.  However, my friends and I didn't realize there was a dance floor downstairs and were about to leave early because no one upstairs was dancing.  It doesn't get busy 'till about 12-12:30, which I figure is the norm anyways. Drinks are good, staff is friendly. I think my only complaint was the music. it was what I like to call \"crappy club music\""}
{"text":"I went to this bar for a friend's birthday party. I went out for a smoke and wasn't allowed back in. The reason is; I know for a crowded place like this, they want to make more money from people who would buy more drink; not people who already drank. Cheap drinks; but I can't breath in there because there are too many people. The bartender gave me $10 short on my change and yelled at me because I asked for my money (how rude). Well, I just went that one time, never again. I can find better clubs to hangout than this place."}
{"text":"I rarely go to bar but I came to bar 244 for drink specoal.  It is eady to get table before 9pm.  The place  gets busy quickly after 9:30pm"}
{"text":"Not a terrible bar by any means, but certainly far from the best. Drinks were $3 but even a double lacked in strength. Music was kept at an unnecessarily high volume which made talking with others difficult. The bar was clean, the bartender was pleasant and we all managed to have a fun time."}
{"text":"With $3 drinks and a lively crowd, this is a great place to come and party the night away without even breaking the bank.  The club/bar has two main floors. The upper floor has a small selection of tables and chairs for those who might want sit and relax, but the placed was crowded enough that it was difficult to find a free spot.  The upstairs also has a coat check available for $3, just in case you want to stow away your coat and any valuables.  The lower level is one giant dance floor, with a DJ playing a wide variety of music.  I heard everything from Rihanna's current hits to Cotton Eye Joe, and the DJ worked hard to keep the energy high and the music diversified.    The bartenders were extremely polite, and poured the drinks surprisingly strong for $3 each.  The only real flaw was the long line to get in, and how incredibly crowded it once once I made it inside. It's a popular place, but that also brings with it the problems you'd expect, and sometimes I was hard to even find the space to move and dance.   Overall, an excellent establishment.  Bring your fiends, have some cheap drinks, and get lost in the music and crowd!"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere. CHEAP but very watered down drinks. A good pregame bar."}
{"text":"Decent place, though it comes across as a university bar.  There's a small dance floor, which has an intimate feel, and an area near the washrooms which is a little on the bland side.  Wide range of music played, from classic rock to hip hop, which was fun, but sometimes the songs were hard to dance to.  I didn't like that they charged $5 cover before 11 when the website clearly says otherwise.  We got off because we were on guest list, but it looked like the bouncers were trying to pocket a little extra.  Then a friend showed up and was asked to pay $10, which took me by surprise."}
{"text":"This bar is a good place to go if your looking to dance and have a good time with friends but don't intend to spend a lot if money. The drinks are cheep at only 3 bucks for beer cocktails and cover is a measly 5 dollars and  coat check only coming in at 3 as well.   The staff was energetic and the wait times for drinks was next to nothing. The bathrooms were a clean as a bar bathroom gets but that's expected.   The music was good but my only issue was the temperature. It was so hot in the basement where the DJ was it was almost unbearable. Other then that it was a great bar an I recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"Works for me :)  Went to Bar244 last night for the first time as part of a charity pub/bar crawl. This was our last place of the night and a great place to finish up. We had no trouble getting in - the staff were friendly and there were no hassels.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the drinks are cheap ($3-5).  It was Saturday night so the music was Top 40. Although the Spice Girls song playing at 10:30 made me cringe, when a second one came on at about 1 I was more receptive...  The crowd was young/student - reminds me of the student places I used to go to in Kingston, with people dressed up and down as they please.  I would go back with friends for another night of dancing.  The only weird thing was that there weren't any locks on the bathroom doors - don't even bother looking for a stall that locks..."}
{"text":"went there for a friends birthday...it was okay i guess, upstairs deff better then downstairs where the dance floor is. it was so hot down there i dont know how we survived and so packed too...gross. we wanted to put our stuff in coatcheck cuz we wanted to dance but coatcheck wasnt available because its summer..."}
{"text":"Went here last night, had a great time this was my go to since i found out that gravity has been shut down.Bouncers were nice and so was the bartenders, only thing i dislike were the men's acting like complete animals around women."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place when we decided to wing it and feel adventurous. It was a nice cozy place and what you really want to see out of a bar. Friendly staff, cheap prices,  no cover and open late. It is not by any mean a place to have a date or a meeting, as its filled by college kids, but you a get very good bang for your buck.  My only concern is that they did not accept credit cards and debits. (cash only)"}
{"text":"Bar 224 is a great place to go on a Friday night, the service is great and pretty fast, and the crowd is usually nice too (including the bartenders and bouncers). The bar also has a free guest list sign up, which is awesome.   Overall, the drinks are cheap and good (shots, beer, or cocktails for $3); and I recommend bar 224 for a night out in the city. The only con I can think of is that the washrooms are pretty small, so if it's a busy night - it might be quite the wait."}
{"text":"I'm giving this bar a generous 2 stars because a) $3 drinks and b) it's not the worst place I've been.   It is, however, the worst I've ever been treated at any bar/club in Toronto. In actuality, this place does not deserve anything more than 1/2 a star in my books, and sadly, that's mainly because of the staff this bar employs.  We came here to celebrate my birthday last night, a Saturday. Friends of mine highly recommended it saying it was fun and cheap. No bottle service, but I did make a guest list. Here is how the night got progressively sour:   #1:   3 of my friends on my guest list who were ahead of us had to pay $10 cover. They were denied any refund even after explaining they were on guest list.   #2:  When I went to show the bouncer my ID, he literally pushed his finger into my collar bone, suggesting (quite physically) I move back. Couldn't he ask?! No, I wasn't misbehaving, just walked up 'too fast'.  #3:  15 minutes of being inside, and the coat check girl had misplaced my brother's jacket, which held his car keys, and which he had NOT checked in. She *promised* me she did not have it. After almost 40-45 minutes of trying to reason with her, she decided to check for it, found it, and ended up apologizing because yes, she did check it in without his knowledge.   #4:  While I was trying to reason with the coat check girl, my other friend tried to talk to a bouncer (big mistake) about the situation. Needless to say, he was unhelpful. When she asked to speak to someone who COULD help, he shoved her back using his chest and said \"go find someone then!\". My friend got angry but did not get physical or excessively rude, but stated her frustration. His response to this was to grab her arm, which was promptly followed by another bouncer grabbing her other arm. Seriously guys? You need 2 bouncers to hold back a 5'6\" girl who was neither violent nor drunk?!  This was just a few of the things she had to go through with this bouncer. I haven't even stated the rest.   #5   After all of that was sorted out, we tried to get past it with some drinks. About 15 minutes later, my friend gets kicked out because he (rightfully) called the bar \"shit\". He wasn't allowed to even get his jacket and this is Canada in February, people. Power-trip much?!   #6   We still stay, unfortunately. About 20 minutes after that incident, my other friend gets kicked out for being \"too drunk\". She was neither falling, misbehaving or puking. Yes, she was drunk. Drunk enough to be kicked out without a warning at the very least? Definitely not.   #7   While I was standing, waiting for my friends, a bouncer literally shoves me aside with his body because \"I was in the way\".  I have no idea what I was in the way of, and I don't understand why he didn't just ask me to move first.   Those are just a few of the reasons why my night out for my birthday was spoiled by the bouncers of this establishment. I believe they are completely ruining the experience of a bar that would otherwise be decent, albeit a little too crowded.   We decided to make the best of it and went to the lower level (which is actually probably one of the only two pros of this entire bar - avoid the upper level unless you plan on sitting at a table all night - because you'll probably be \"in the way\" if you decide to walk anywhere on that floor), and ended the night having a decent time dancing. Music was nothing special - unmemorable mixes of top 40. Space was okay, nice place to dance, bar was close by. But I had basically lost most of my mood as half of my party was now gone, and the few of us left were still really disgusted with the bouncers' behaviour. We ended up leaving shortly after that.   All in all, this place had a great concept - casual, cheap & quality drinks for the price, bearable music. But it lacks any kind of professionalism in terms of their staff (I have to mention that the bartenders were quite nice). My friends and I feel that the bouncers were rude and rough to the point where we felt violated. I've NEVER been treated this way at any bar or club anywhere, and nothing that any of us in my party did was even remotely close to being bad enough to have to endure the treatment we did - it was actually their mistake on more than one occasion.   Also, there was a couple pretty much doing the dirty on the dance floor downstairs, butt showing and everything (gross). They didn't seem to get kicked out for THAT. Great standards.   This was my first time here, but I would be hard put to be back here if something doesn't change. As of right now, I do not recommend it and encourage anyone to avoid it."}
{"text":"This club/bar is a solid spot for the college crowd because drinks are only $3.00 (even mixed ones) and there's a dance floor with always a good turnout of traffic. Free cover also available with guest list.   Two levels available (no outside patio), with coat check an option. The downstairs is a bit like your friend's basement house party but that's the vibe people expect when they go there. Music is decent, with a lot of top 40. Can be quite a long lineup if you're there on a Friday or Sat around 10:30-11:30pm. I've had some nights here that were more fun than other upscale clubs in the area. Definitely not the spot if you're looking to really dress up in heels or spend an hour doing your hair. The dress code is really casual, some people even in jeans or runners.   Bottom line: if your wallet is running empty but you still want to have a nice night out dancing with drinks and friends, Bar 244 by Adelaide/Duncan will always do the job right. Never had a problem with the bartenders either."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. This is probably the place you want to go to pre-drink before going to the real party. Bottom shelf and domestic beers only. $3 DRINKS!"}
{"text":"Nope... Nope, nope, nope... Never again. This place is so terrible, it'll blow your socks off. My problem isn't with the facility itself, the DJs or the dance floors, it's with the bouncers.   I recently attended a friend's birthday party at Bat 244 on November 23rd. I got in and paid the $10.00 cover (which is the cover for a Saturday night. Don't let anyone there tell you there's no cover or a $3.00 cover which I was told). I got a stamp on my wrist to show that I had paid.   I had a friend text me telling me he was lost, and I went outside to find him. When I got back the bouncer at the front told me I'd had too much to drink and I wasn't allowed back in. It was 11:30pm and I was dead sober. I hadn't even been in the bar long enough to have a drink.   When I insisted that I was fine and spoke to him for five minutes, he kept insisting he go in and get my coat for me so that I could go home. It was freezing cold out and I had really just gone out to get my friend before going back in. The bouncer insisted I wait 30 minutes before going back in, to give myself a chance to \"sober up\". I was shocked by this! 30 minutes?! It was -12 degrees with the windchill and I had no coat.   His response to this? \"Alright... I'll get your coat from coat check for you... but if I do, you're getting in a cab and you're going home.\"   I was FLOORED. So rude! He essentially insisted I suffer if I wanted to get back into the club. They weren't interested in anything other than getting as many cover charges as they could. I wasn't the only one stuck outside. There were several smokers who were in the same circumstance as I was.   Once the line was empty again, I was allowed to go back in, at which point my lips were literally blue from the cold. I found my friends and my boyfriend and explained what happened. My boyfriend isn't really a drinker, and hadn't had anything that night. He walked outside to have a word with the bouncer, and when he did, he got KICKED OUT for trying to defend me. He texted me to tell me he was kicked out and regardless of my friend's party, we got in the cab and went home.   My advice to anyone who plans on going to Bar 244? If you smoke and want to get out at intervals, DO NOT GO! these bouncers will not let you back in without a fight. If you're going to have a few drinks and dance, stick to one floor, otherwise you'll run into the bouncers at the stairs. It's easy enough for them to pull you outside if they don't \"want\" you there... which is clearly what happened to me.   Maybe I wasn't drinking enough... maybe I wasn't the kind of girl they want in their establishment... but this place isn't worth your time. There are a whole bunch of better clubs with better crowds very close by. Don't waste your time, dignity, or money."}
{"text":"A no rules venue with great drink special that has a long history of giving visitors some kind of story that will be with them for life. Impossible to rate when the same person can have an incredible night one weekend and awful the next."}

{"text":"For what it is , bar 244 is a good spot. Very young crowd here, and the music they play in my opinion tailors to that. Nice spot for a fun dance night. Not to mention probably the  best drink deals in toronto. No where else can u find 3 dollar drinks. It's a great location in the dT core."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for cheap drinks and good music, which can both can be found at bar244.  My first time was on a Friday, i had such a good time! There is no cover if you put your name on the guest and you arrive before 11:30pm."}
{"text":"I went here after my birthday dinner. Did not expect to pay $10 cover, as the place wasn't even good other than the cheap drinks.  it was not my type of bar - they played 80-early 90s music. The place felt very grimy.  Don't recommend this place to people unless they really want to save money and just go for the booze."}
{"text":"Gorilla Sprinkles, our party animal friend decided once again to hit up Bar 244 for a night of drinking and dancing.  It has become our go-to spot whenever we want to hit up downtown for a night of fun... Its even better that the post-drinking after parties are held at Smoke's Poutinerie and Burrito Boyz just a short walk away!    The star-rating goes up because the DJ was infinitely better!  I especially loved the throw-back to the 80's... Although I don't know if I responded well to their soca-sized version of Bon Jovi's \"You Give Love a Bad Name.\"    The noise level was especially bad tonight seeing as the mobs of people from the Blue Jays opener took to the bars/clubs, but the drinks were still as cheap and good as I remembered!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Bar 244 every couple months for a few years now. The drinks are cheap, $3 for a domestic beer or basic bar shot/mixed drink. Music is decent. Lineup is usually not too long. Service at the bar is reasonably fast."}
{"text":"Went to Bar 244 to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Friday night. The line was quite long but I waited patiently and was able to enter after about 30 minutes. I found my friend downstairs on the very crowded dance floor. Being on the outside perimeter of the dance floor wasn't ideal, as people were being very careless and just spilling drinks and bumping into you as they pleased. I have been to quite a few clubs in the city, but the guys at Bar 244 are some of the least pleasant. They kept trying to grab at my friend and myself, and had a VERY difficult time understanding no as an answer. The music was pretty decent, but overall, I don't think I would return on account of the clientele."}
{"text":"We went to Bar 244 for a friend's 20th birthday. Got a booth with bottle service for $150. They soon realized we were a small group of 5 and offered to refund some money and gave us a smaller bottle of alcohol. It was quite thoughtful of them. The bar offered cheap drinks, the domestic beers were only $3. The tequila shots were still $6 though, which we drank mostly besides our bottle of vodka. The DJ knew how to mix songs so the transitions were smooth, and the music was generally enjoyable and fun to dance to. The washrooms were small, however, but were clean.   We all went and danced for about 10 minutes only to return to an empty booth. Everything at our booth/table was taken away without our knowledge, even the mixed drinks we had. I guess they thought we finished our bottle and won't be needing the coke...which happened to have a lot of vodka mixed into it...and the cranberry juice too...it was also weird to find strangers sitting at our booth. But I guess that's how clubs are. We do not club very often so we probably just don't understand the rules. Not going to buy bottle service next time though, since we can just sit without buying the bottle service like all the other people and we only bought the booth/bottle service so we could have a seat to sit on when we feel like it.    Other than that, the staff are all very friendly, the security guards are informative and willing to help. One of them found our friend's phone. They also personally escort you out when you appear to be too drunk. Haha, I assume that is how they keep their washrooms so clean and vomit-free.  We will certainly return to this bar/club one of these days just to have the cheap drinks and music."}
{"text":"Absolutely shit. Listen to what I have to say. I went here with a couple of friends and one of my friends got too drunk and went outside. She started puking. I went inside trying to grab her some water and was told to get water from the washroom by the bartender. I was really unhappy and told the bouncer that I needed to get water for my friend. I was again told to go away and get water from the hotdog stand. The frustrating thing is after I did that they would not let me in again! What a shitty place! Its against the law to deny water here, never the less to help someone that was in need of it... really disappointed."}
{"text":"Went last night, coming from Guelph. I didn't expect much, but after last night I really enjoyed the atmosphere and service of the place. Young students can get cheap drinks on a Saturday, and the dance floor is large and hopping. They play hits as well as old favourites like Barbie Girl, Sean Paul, an awesome variety. It's nice to have the bar upstairs and the dance floor downstairs, you can have a couple drinks then head down which is nice. I recommend it if you're looking for a place with a younger crowd that's affordable. It's got a bar/club feel that makes it a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place to pre game with $3 shots and domestic beers, $4 for imports.   4 stars goes to the cheap drinks and awesome bartenders.  Kam was an excellent bartender! He kept drinks in our hands and was very quick to come back to us although the bar was packed.  Two floors with bar on each floor, club-like dance floor on lower level, top level just like a typical bar.  Only thing that bothered me, were most of the rude guys trying to hit on everything and anything that moved. The ratio was maybe 4:1 guys to girls. Showing up as 2 girls, majority of guys were extremely rude and rowdy(I think that's the word). Placing hands on us and wrapping arms around us, just being very touchy in general.  Maybe the majority of guys in Toronto just try very hard. I'm disgusted by how many men were trying so hard with the most pathetic pick-up lines that we've heard a million times that even if we were shit-faced, wouldn't even phase us.  Music was okay, they said they were playing top 40, but to me, I thought I went back in time, since it was mostly top 40s songs of 2010-11."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from the reviews, and the drink prices haha. Really fun for a cheap night out, lots of students and plenty of men sharking for someone to take home. But the music was awesome and we had a great time, in between batting the sharks away :p $10 cover and $3 drinks I couldn't believe it, $3 drinks?! But it's true. Go with very low expectations, and have a surprisingly fun night :D"}
{"text":"Came here after a failed night at orchid. My friend always ends up here, so she suggested we come here for a mixed crowd and good music. I've never lined up for a club in my life and I was not ok when I saw the long line. Thank goodness it moved fast and we got in after 15 minutes.. not before being bothered by a promoter for cake nightclub though- she kept saying \"bar 244 is at capacity and you're not going to get in. Come to cake, come to cake\" and we did the polite \"...lol...ok....\" before ignoring her. My friend told me she's there every time soliciting all the bar 244 customers.   Bouncers were super friendly and did not even check bags, which was a bit surprising. Cover was $10 and coat check was $3. Coat check was huge and the girl working it was super friendly, fast and organized. I was impressed by the layout of this place, it was more like an empty house with different levels/rooms and it had a definitely abandoned house party feel. You can dance anywhere, but the main dance floor is downstairs and it's definitely crowded. Everyone here is super grabby and the rise of sexual assault is not a joke. How many hands did I have to slap away in the span of 5 minutes? The answer is too many. Also, there's broken glass all over the floor. Thank goodness I was wearing shoes with a thick sole because the number of times I had to rub the bottom of my shoes on the wall to get the jagged glass out of shoe was WAY too high. Never had another club have so many hazardous materials on one slippery and disgusting dance floor. Also, to the old asian man that followed my friend and I everywhere- BYE. You're lucky I didn't break a bottle on your head.   The bartenders are efficient and the drinks are cheap af! So definitely a fan of that. It didn't take long for us to grab a beer at all. Cheap beer makes a happy girl. Oh, and re-entry was easy and the bouncers didn't give me a hard time about it.   Overall, a place to go for a cheap and fun night. Don't wear flats here though, or you may end up in the emergency room."}
{"text":"Aug 18, 2012 was the second time I visited Bar 244, my friends and I thought we could give them a second chance after treating us poorly the first time we went there a couple months ago.  We were a group of 12 where 10 of us got in paid cover and started ordering drinks.  After a couple minutes we noticed that the birthday boy and another one of our friends did not get in because the bouncers thought they were too drunk.  As a alcohol selling establishment they are within their right to refuse entry. Naturally as a group we wanted to stay together so we requested that the bouncers return our cover charge and we would be on our way, which we thought was a reasonable request given we had only stayed for 5 minutes.  Almost immediately the bouncers threw the drinks from our hands and shoved us out of the club.  When I tried to reason with them one bouncer told me \"that's just the way it has to be\" and to \"just go with it\".  A number of bouncers surrounded us and started to use unnecessary force.  We ended up leaving after having our drinks taken from us, not having the cover fee returned to us and being treated poorly/abusively.  I would not recommend going to this club as they treat label patrons as thugs and have a throw out and don't ask questions policy.    As I mentioned earlier this was similar to our previous experience where one of our friends was left outside and called a \"sl*t\" by the owner/manager.  When I confronted the manager about this he said, \"she deserves it\".    Our group consists of working engineers and other professional conduct ourselves in a respectful manner and are not deserving of such a treatment.  If you want to have an enjoyable night out on the town then stay clear of this establishment.  Toronto has many more places that will treat you with the respect you deserve."}
{"text":"For $3 drinks it's a great deal!   We signed up for the guest list a few days in advance and got free cover if you go before 11pm. You can sign up for the guest list on their website and do so up until 8:45 pm on the day of.   The bar area opens around 8 and the downstairs dance floor opens at 11pm.  Went on a Friday night and music was decent. Bartenders were also super friendly and washroom was decently clean. There's one near the bar area and another beside the DJ in the basement.   Had a blast and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Uhg. I don't know where to begin. Security is grumpy, bartenders are friendly.  Pipes in the ceiling in the basement leak water everywhere getting you and the floor wet.  Broken glass all over the floors, people were slicing their feet open while dancing.  I legit saw a girl bleeding in the bathroom, blood all over the floor because of the glass.  Only 1 security guard for the entire basement, hard for one guy to keep an eye out on everything.  Fights breaking out, but since there's only one security guard he isn't able to see things happening.  Honestly music wasn't that great either.    Yes $3 drinks, but the cons outweigh the pros. Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"-noteworthy update-  If you find yourself having to park on the main streets please scrutinize for tiny signs stating \"no overnight parking 2am to 6am\".   It's really silly as the entertainment venues close at 3am so lots of people's vehicles get towed while they are dancing pretty, shitty but very much a reality."}
{"text":"Music was alright, but not my style. Your usual R&B, hip hop, crappy radio music. Drink enough and you'll be able to do like me and dance to literally anything using the same moves :)   Best thing about this club (?) -- Friday $3 domestic and $4 import bottles. HOLLLAAAA when $12 gets you 4 beers?!?!?! that's my kinda party.  Crowd was...I can't remember. A lot of dudes though, not sure that that was all about. Nothing special, no fights as far as I can tell.   No dress code per se, just don't look like  you smell. I wore my converse, jeans and a black long sleeve.  Interior is pretty nice, walls are old school looking with brick laid out all around but really who cares, in the dark it all looks the same.   I have nothing special to say about Bar 244...I wish I'd have gone to Crockrock across the street instead. I don't think I'll be back here unless a bunch of my friends are already there and I don't have another concrete"}
{"text":"$3 drinks, crowd-pleasing music and free cover if you sign up on the guest list? Sounds like a fun night to me! Bar 244 is one of my favourite places to get a tad bit wasted upstairs at the bar (how could you no with $3 drinks!) and then have a fun time dancing downstairs only to sober up and repeat the process again. I love this place! I've never had an issue with the bouncers (in fact they've been incredibly pleasant to my friends and I) and the bartenders have never cheaped me out of my shots. I'll certainly come here again!"}
{"text":"I have a theory that cheap drinks can attract sleazy guys and looser women. Females, if you go to bar 244 you can almost guarantee a sketchy guy trying to grind on you and hitting on you with cheesy pickup lines.   That being said, Bar 244 is what you make of it. If you don't go with a fun crowd then you're probably not going to have a good time. Bar 244 is my go to place because you can spend much less to get buzzed and the music there is always consistently easy to dance to. So make a guest list and hit this place up with a good crowd and give it a try."}
{"text":"I don't know if I went to the same place as everyone else who wrote a review.  Maybe we arrived there too early - 10pm on a Friday. Cover was $5. It's essentially a pub with hard wood floors and lots of space for people to move/dance if they like. The music would be songs you'll definitely recognize (I Want It That Way by BSB!?!). It's got the pub crawl vibe which is great if you're planning to drink a lot that night. It reminded me of my university days (which was barely a year ago) and not in a good way.  From what I could gather from the one hour I was there, it's one of those places where to enjoy you a) either pre-drink (a lot) before you go or b) drink incredulously when you're there (the $3 drinks and $4 shots are attractive I have to agree) then go some place else and party really, really hard.   I'll go again in the future at a later hour and maybe I'll like it a bit more."}
{"text":"Pretty boring student crowd. Overflowing dancefloor that is hard to even breathe on. the usual top 40.  But at least it's cheap... DIRT CHEAP."}
{"text":"Cheap shots and good music downstairs. Layout isn't too bad tbh, go with a bunch of friends!"}
{"text":"When it comes to the clubbing experience, I've come to expect that being treated rudely and getting ripped off is the norm. Pay an outrageous cover fee, stand in line forever, make your way past rude bouncers, and pay $8-10 for drinks mixed with only a smidgen of actual alcohol. Our experience at Bar 244 on a Saturday club night was completely absent of these typical negative experiences, and the bar serves as a model for how every bar or club should operate.  Being the cheap guy that I am, half the thrill of this night was how cheap it was. It's Saturday night, when Toronto nightlife is at its busiest and the clubs are ready to hose you more than ever. Not at Bar 244. Signed up on the guest list online for 4 people, we arrive before 11 and get in free. $3 drinks, $4 imports, all night long. THREE DOLLARS! So surely with prices like this, they get stingey in the drink mixing right? Nope! They mix the drinks generously right before your eyes, and my friend said she saw a server adding a bit more booze to the drink after mixing on several occasions. We could actually afford to drink all what we wanted for the night.  The staff are great. Friendliest bouncers I've ever met, fast no nonsense line, and attentive servers.  The music was AMAZING! We couldn't believe how the DJ could consistently play hit after hit and come up with some of the most ingenious mixes.  It was definitely a major highlight of the night.  I'd say the crowd was primarily early to mid 20s. It felt young, but it didn't feel immature. A lot of polite and friendly people, a lack of creepers, and tons of party people ready to have an awesome time on the dance floor. Some people are dressed a bit more casually than others, but everyone looks good. If you want to get decked out, you won't look out of place. I had some nice jeans and a nice collared shirt with a vest.  The upstairs operates as a bar while the downstairs is a dance floor, and it's not a huge place, so of course, the experience is a tad different than a full fledged dance club. But Bar 244 packs the essentials: awesome music, cheap drinks, and people ready to party. You'll have so much fun that the fanciness of the place is the last thing on your mind.  Because the staff are so friendly and the drinks are so cheap, we're coming back very soon with even more friends. Quality service and high value don't seem to be the norm in this industry, but Bar 244 delivers and thus stands above the rest."}
{"text":"I always think it's a good idea until I actually go there...   The $3 drinks tempt me every time! And I do like the idea of a bar setting upstairs, club setting downstairs but that's about it....   Unless you're crazy about top 40s and One Direction remixes, the music is not great. I've made requests to the DJ several times and they were never put in. The DJ would say \"yeah I will play it next\" or \"I've been playing Drake all night\" to wave me off but the music never gets better... this was really the biggest mood killer for me along with the sleazy, grabby guys.   The bar seating area isn't good for big groups- the security broke up our table of friends. Speaking of the staff, for the most part the bartenders, coat check staff and bouncers have been nice. Also just thought I would mention that the washroom is also very cramped so don't bring your friends.   I always end up going to Crocodile Rock afterwards so moral of story: pre-drink at home and go somewhere else ..."}
{"text":"This is a bar that I can somewhat tolerate! I'm typically the DD most nights but I can appreciate cheap drinks for all my friends! We got bottle service and they ushered us into the bottom floor before anyone else. I'm not sure if this was a plus for us since it was really cold and super awkward for a while until it filled up.   We did overhear a bartender telling a girl not to pay with change. I'm not sure what was up with this or what the reasoning is behind it, but last I checked, drinks are super low in price and loonies, toonies, and quarters are still legal tender.   This place gets pretty rammed. Once I was able to meander my way to the back of the room to go to the washroom, I was pleasantly surprised to see the bathroom was in decent shape and had no lineup. The doors had working locks too! Yay!  The DJ isn't amateur by any means, and the music selection isn't my first choice, but I can definitely see the appeal since its mostly Top 40, nostalgic 90's tunes, and EDM bangers near the end of the night.   I'd rather come here to celebrate a friends birthday than a super expensive, super bro-y club. People here love to get wild and have a fun time, no fanciness required."}
{"text":"$3 drinks Friday and Saturday all night. Practically free!   Upstairs is a bar area accompanied with a few tables and stools to sit on. To the left of you is another room with coat check and also plenty of sitting space.   Get you drink and go downstairs and dance your pants off. There's also another room downstairs accompanied with a bar area. Not much sitting space since you're suppose to be dancing. The dance floor isn't large, nor is it small. It's just enough to fit 120-150 people. The DJ plays interesting music but some can be hard to dance to.   Oh and the bathroom? Hella small so go only when you must. But overall pretty good & good crowd. 19-30 I think it's an underground gay club though."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm giving this place 5 stars only because it's one of the cheapest places you can go to buy drinks. It doesn't get better than $3 well drinks and beer!"}
{"text":"$3 drinks all night every Friday and Saturday, cover is $5 before 11pm, all kind of music (mostly rock on friday), Bar 244 is an amazing spot. For some reason, I always end up at this bar during the weekend. The basement dance floor is small, it's always packed with people but who cares, I'm here to have fun so I don't mind at all.   The bartenders are both friendly and nice, even the bouncers! I never see them let anyone cut the line, or let anyone go inside first for money. Love it! Hotdog stand right outside the door is a great place for cheap late dinner as well. And if you don't want hotdog, there is Smoke's Pountinerie few steps away and the line is always ridiculously long.  Its online customer service is amazing too. They helped me to look for a picture I took with a friend in 2012 (they deleted some of the past photo albums to have space for new ones). I described the picture, gave the date and they replied to me the next day. Very impressive!  The only thing I don't like about 244 is its washroom. It's way too small and it's always packed.   Bar 244 never brings me down every time I come back here!"}
{"text":"3$ drinks on friday night but shots n cocktails are 6$. Bouncers kicked 2 of my friends out: my friends were just walking down the stairs n the bouncers kicked out a grouo of unruly guys n thought my friends were part of them. The bouncers didnt want to listen to any explanation. Cheap booze, sure but not really recommended."}
{"text":"We got in via guestlist on a busy Saturday night. Venue was a little bit worn down but drinks were cheap ($3) and staff was friendly. This is a great place for drinks and chat for students on a budget."}
{"text":"You can do better, but no one in this bar can. The rape den downstairs is densely packed and smoldering hot. While the bar tenders are working hard and having fun they are focused on pitting half a shot in those 3 dollar cocktails. The floor is covered in broken class from drunks dropping glass bottle and cups. While the bar back was clearing bottles from ledges the glass on the floor stayed there and multiplied through the night. I stepped on one and this rock of glass was so big I nearly lost my footing. While seeking cooler refuge I pushed my way to the door while having my ass grabbed repeatedly. Upstairs is much cooler and less crowded. The bar tenders even put come drank in your drink, if you catch my drift. However both floors feature the stylings  of a lazy dj who is playing premixed top 40 or some classic 90 ( red hot chilli peppers, spice girls) spliced with dub step. No creative all perdictable and rather out of synced  If you venture here be dangerously drunk with thick shoes on."}
{"text":"My bonehead friend planned her birthday party but sadly did not check to see if the bar she selected was still in buisniess (it had closed down... 2 years ago!) So here we are 10 cold 20-somethings in China town standing in front of what was supposed to be a club looking for a plan B. Than it hit me... Bar 244! Once again no lineups, $5 cover and $3 all night.   The door guy was super sweet, the bartenders were friendly and not only did they play The Spice Girls, they also played Nirvana, Journey, and of course Sir Mix-a-Lot!  It was a great night :-)"}
{"text":"$3 rail and domestic beer, or $4 premium beer. That's really the only reason to come here. There's no real atmosphere and the place was pretty dead until 11 when all the douchey club people showed up at which point you probably don't want to be there anymore anyways.  The bartender was cute and really nice and the bar-back came around frequently to clear our tables of empties.  The drinks are cheap, but there's nothing really special about this place."}
{"text":"Lmao, whenever I think about this place, it always brings a smile to my face. Not because I've always had a great time here but how hilarious the atmosphere is. $3 drinks are fine and dandy but when they mention they have a dress code, they really mean that it's optional. On their website it says \"no baseball hats, track pants, bandanas and no baggy oversized clothes.\" but when I went there, there were these dudes wearing football jerseys and caps. They don't seem to care though which is why this place is magical. It can get pretty rachet downstairs (where the dance floor is)."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout and have cheap drinks. Would have given it 5 stars but the kitchen closes at 7:30 I think and the dance floor seemed too warm for me. Maybe it was because of all those people. Still, I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"Bar244 is a fun small bar. Two floors. On a Friday it's \"Let is rock fridays\" And on Saturday its more top 40 songs. The staff is VERY friendly. Drinks are 3$ and 4$ imports - nothing gets better then this!  5$ Entry after 11pm Fri and Sat. -- BEST DEAL EVER! The downstairs of the bar is a club after 11:30pm and gets packed on saturdays! I do not recommend getting bottle service because it is not a fancy place.. it feels like a small town bar with locals.  The dress is casual but most people do dress for the club. Fancy dresses and guys with dress shoes nice jeans nice shirt. When ever im low on cash me and my friends always party it up here!"}
{"text":"The drinks were really cheap and at first the music was good but then they started playing all rock music. The ladies room was pretty dirty even for a bar, one of the stalls was clogged and the other one was gross."}
{"text":"Went there after work...it was okay i guess, upstairs  was a bit better than downstairs where the dancing is. It was broiling down there, and i dont know how we survived and so packed too...bodies everywhere. Popular place."}
{"text":"This place is a dive bar bar none!  Cheap drinks, shots and easily accessible dancefloor.  It was a fun night for most of us and I prefer the low crowd volume as opposed to other places. Citizen might be the trendy place to be but this bar has everything and better music so why go there and shelf out a bunch of $$ for sub par experience?  Next time you are in the entertainment district come here for a chill night out!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is this place is so grimy and gross!  After having dinner at a nearby restaurant our group decided to go for some drinks. A promoter was standing outside Bar 244 handing out free entry cards to Cake Nightclub. However, some of our friends thought it was for Bar 244 so this is how we got there. I didn't expect to pay $10 cover for a bar but luckily my boyfriend spotted me.   I didn't know if I was in a club or a bar between the loud music and tables around the room. Bar 244 looked very outdated and it definitely needs to fix the place up...especially the bathroom. The women's bathroom was dreadful! There were only two stalls however one of them didn't even have a door on it. The one stall that had a door had graffiti all over it including the back wall.  My friends had a few drinks and said the drinks were pretty cheap but that's the only good thing I heard about this place.   When we left we noticed that there was a lower level with a dance floor. I wouldn't have danced anyways because the music was so old school."}
{"text":"Can you say dive bar?   This place is the definition.   Cheap drinks, grimly floors and tables.  But 3 dollar drinks.  This is the definition of a cheap place to have a couple of drinks and hang out while waiting for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here last month for a friend's birthday, got there fairly early and it was dead - 3 stars solely based on the fact that the drinks were damn cheap.  I can't complain!  It's pretty ugly inside and the women's washroom is not for the claustrophic (also be careful you don't get pelted in the face, as the door swings inwards) but if you're drunk enough does it really matter?  Once it hit about 10 or 11pm the club douches and women in transparent dresses showed up, so we checked out to go elsewhere, but before that I was perfectly content at this place."}
