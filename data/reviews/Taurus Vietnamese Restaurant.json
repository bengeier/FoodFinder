{"text":"We love going to Taurus. The staff is so friendly and they've really come to know us over the past six years. I just love the way they do spring rolls...not too greasy, not too nutty. My husband loves their grilled chicken.

Their menu is very reasonably priced and hasn't changed much over the years. The main items on the menu are appetizers, vermicelli bowls and pho. You can get Vietnamese desserts and drinks as well; I seem to recall that bubble tea was a fairly recent addition. 

This restaurant is not big on atmosphere, but it's definitely big on taste. We enjoy having dinner there before hitting Sobey's next door."}
{"text":"We used to live in this area and came to Taurus quite often.  The staff is excellent and the food is delicious!  Reasonable prices and huge bowls of soup/noodles!  Both of my kids love going there as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten at numerous Vietnamese restaurants and have found PHO TAURUS to be the best!  My family has ordered a variety of their dishes - appetizers, pho soups, noodle soups, bun dishes - and every single one has tasted great. Their satay broth and chicken broth have the best flavors, and the charbroiled meats are delicious. We order the vegetarian spring rolls and chicken chunks appetizers all the time.

Service is wonderful and the food always arrives quickly. The staff are very friendly, polite and efficient. After eating there only a few times, they remembered our preferences. Now, we barely have to say anything because they know what we want.

The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are great. You even get a pot of jasmine tea at no charge. The decor is plain but that's OK, their prices aren't jacked up to pay for extra decor and overhead. PHO TAURUS is a fantastic restaurant that we hope will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Bland, boring and flavorless would be my top descriptors for the Pho my husband just brought home.  If they make their own broth it was seriously underdeveloped, I've seen consume with more color, if they don't then they water the broth they buy down far too much. Cheap, tough beef is not what I expect from a raw beef Pho either. 

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant are extremely rude. I explained that due to an allergy, I was not able to have a particular ingredient and asked if they would be able to check their chicken and beef for it. There was a bit of a language barrier, so after a few seconds, I asked if their meat was bought fresh or processed.  She was still not understanding, so I asked where it was bought from. She rudely responded \"why you asking?\".  She became so snarky and rude and I continue to try to explain.A cook from the back came up front; he was equally unhelpful and rude.  They continued to talk in their language (so I couldn't understand), making me have that uncomfortable feeling where I could tell they were talking about me. It's not unreasonable to expect a restaurant to check for an ingredient. Needless to say, customer service was horrible; they obviously aren't looking for customers!  And sadly I left without the sub I wanted and ended up going to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but felt like it was just a bit overpriced.  Definitely recommended.  The staff is great and always welcoming."}
{"text":"Up a star! Ahhhh Pho Taurus, you have improved! I like you, and you like me!
Today I had a ton of shopping to do in the area and I ran in, craving vermicelli. 
#37.... yum! I still have a trunk load of stuff still in the garage as I rushed in to eat my take out food! Vermicelli noodles with 6 shrimp (tasty!, shredded carrot, extra hot sauce and 3 cut up spring rolls. (average rolls) Service was friendly, quick, portions good this time around (maybe take out is key? and I really liked my dish.
The place is dead mid-day.
$12 for my meal . Not bad."}
{"text":"I came here as I had a wicked viet craving and was going to see a movie in the area. I was already pretty ill that day, so hard to say how this went, as I was drastically sicker after. 

It was decent viet, I always go rice vermicelli with chicken, as it's generally gluten free and safe. I had mango bubble tea, which was way too sweet. 

It was OK, it's viet. There really isn't any bad viet."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of sate beef soup in Calgary. This one didn't cut it. Although the staff was very nice, and the salad rolls were decent (and huge), I came for the pho and wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Quite possibly.. Actually no, it *IS* the worst Vietnamese restaurant I've ever eaten at and I've been to lots. I stopped going here 7 years ago. The only reason I went a few times was by the invites of others.  The few times I've been the hot sauce was watered down, rice dishes had beef burned and was too charred.  The rice noodles in the pho were too soft and they served their fish sauce in mugs?!?  Unfortunately the worst Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary is also the closest to where I live.. Go figure.

I just hope they've turned themselves around in the past 7 years as they are still there."}
