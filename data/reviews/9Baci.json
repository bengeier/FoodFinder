{"text":"Tried this place last week just went in for a coffee & dessert. Restaurant was busy and no hostess at the door, but she eventually decided to show up & seat us! There seem to be only 1 waitress working, poor girl was running from one end of the restaurant to the other. Took forever to place our order & get our order (2 cappuccino's & 1 slice of ricotta cheesecake). I may give this place another shot, the pizza looked great & the ricotta cheesecake although a bit dry was delish!"}
{"text":"Had pizza and pasta for take out. Nothing outstanding. In this Italian community, there are so many choices for Italian restaurants and I do not see the reason to come back here unfortunately. Staff were friendly and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Had a chance to finally check out Baci9. Food was amazing! I went with a group so we got to sample many things on the menu. Deep fried mozzarella sandwich with tomato sauce... Delish. Calamari was  great too. 
I ordered a panzo which was ok. Typical. Nothing to brag about. But... The pear and prosciutto salad was stellar! Very very good. Dressed beautifully! Pizzas were great. That stone bake just what it needed. Awesome variety. 
We had a few ppl order pastas and the mushroom one was the winner. 
Overall... Food was phenomenal. 
The service I must say was very poor. One server. Poor girl was running around the joint like there was a kitchen fire! I almost felt the need to lend a hand. Funny enough... There was another lady just lounging behind the bar!!! Unreal! On her phone too! So sad. Oh yeah... The owner ... Seated at the VIP table by the window... Drinking, eating... Having a ball really. Never once got up!!! 

Food I'd go back for. But the service is horrible. Just a lack of team work. Fixable. 
Hope they get it together cuz they do got something good!"}
{"text":"No doubt the property needed a restaurant like this.   I am happy one is here.  Menu choices are ok.  Its very plain and simple.  I have been 3 times.  Each time I come to conclude this; Foods are prepared in advance with no pizzaz. My pasta's were very al dente and my sauces bland.  I get the feeling that it's been in the fridge for days and someone just warmed it up.  The pizza's are nothing spectacular.  And food is NOT consistent.  One important thing you will determine is that your clothing will smell when you leave as the ventilation is poor.  Sorry guys but this is a great place but I think the owners having kids run the place is not a great idea.  When you spend money on food you want to make sure its quality first.  I'm not getting that feeling when I'm here.

Do Maple a favour.  We don't need a sandwich joint.  Get a great chef and serve food you don't normally eat at home.  

Meatballs?  Calamari? Penne alla vodka?  Seriously you need to redo the menu and hire a chef.  NO KIDS  BEHIND BAR AND KITCHEN.

Some times truth hurts."}
{"text":"Terrible!! How can this restaurant get  anything more than a 1 star? It's not good at all  the menu is boring and simple, opted for the special of the day bad choice! I hated the food, I would never go back  waste of money and time."}
{"text":"After driving by this place numerous times we finally decided to try it 

We started with an order of calamari which was ok but under seasoned.

The kids had penne alla  vodka which was again under seasoned but pasta was cooked well. My wife had the salmon and she said she enjoyed it, the presentation was nice as it came with a verity of veggies 

I myself ordered the pizza, what looked to be a wood oven pizza was gas :( the pizza was a little under cooked 

Overall nothing really stood out over the course of the meal, the waiter was just as average as the food

Many other restaurants in this price range with far better food"}
{"text":"Great service with a smile and good food close to home. If there were issues with the service as I read in a few reviews they must have fixed it. The pizza was great, had the margarita and prosciutto and arugula pizzas, both were very good. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portion size  was fantastic, but the only downfall from giving this restaurant a 4 or 5 was the waiter Frank whom myself and my collegues found very disrespectful and impatient. His tone and attitude was not pleasant or appreciated. We did not allow that to ruin our night but  for next time if we do decide to dine here we will defiantly request another server with a pleasant attitude."}
{"text":"First time I visited 9Baci, was for a friends 30th birthday. With a large group of 15, we sat in 2 different spots due to last minute reservation changes. The wait for food seemed longer than unusual, especially since I ordered a thin crust pizza which shouldn't take more than 2 minutes in a wood burning oven. The waiter seemed overwhelmed, and was sweating profusely. However, he recognized they were slow due to large groups on Saturday evenings, and apologized for the wait on our drinks & food. He kindly brought some bread and oil to tie us down. 

Atmosphere: Spacious & modern. Fit for all ages!
Cleanliness: Clean!
Constructive criticism: N/A
Cuisine: Italian
Facilities: I did not venture.
Food: Good quality, freshness and aroma. The first time I came here, I had the Nduja pizza. I loved it so much, I came back the next weekend with the boyfriend and ordered it again! My boyfriend and I ordered the \"Cesare Salad\" to start. Warm bits of pancetta made it to the salad. The flavor was excellent. Not like any other Cesar salad I've tried. The dressing was generously applied with shaven layers of parmesan and the portion was large! I ordered the Nduja pizza again, only this time, I asked for extra nduja ($2.50). For those who dont know what Nduja is, its a spicy, spreadable pork sausage from Calabria, Italy. It is typically made with parts of the pig such as the shoulder, belly and jowl, as well as tripe, roasted peppers and a mixture of spices. 
Not a fair amount was applied. I was expecting it to be generously covered with nduja. 
The fior di latte which was on my pizza was excellent, warm and gooey.
My boyfriend ordered the \"Melenzane & Soppressata\" pizza. He liked it, but said it lacked a bit of flavor and that mine was better and will definitely be ordering it next time. So yes, there will be a next time! Especially since we didn't get to try desert we were so stuffed!
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Will return, will recommend! I didn't realize there was a hot table at this restaurant, until after walking out and seeing it on the brochure!
Parking: Private
Portion Sizes: average to large. 
Price: fair. 1 salad, 2 pizzas, 3 glasses of wine $70.63 with taxes.
Service: We were greeted at the door in under 1 minute by a warm welcome. This was my second back to back Saturday coming here. Many large parties seem to be a trend on the weekends. Our server Frank, was not pushy with the specials. He was friendly and warm.
Selection: typical Italian menu, however something that makes 9Baci different is there calzone items which is rare these days, I wouldn't mind trying one. They even have Nutella pizza! Also their options for gluten free dough is great!

{"text":"I love this place! I came in for an early dinner and was definitely not disappointed. The service was great, our server was always very attentive and very honest with our questions. We started with the calamari which was okay. Was good, but nothing special. Next we ordered pasta and both dishes were fresh and tasted delicious! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a couple friends and was not disappointed. Maple definitely needed a restaurant like this. Arancini were excellent and made for great appetizers. I had the quattro formaggi pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it. Service, suds and selection all checked out positive in my books."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a friend. Apparently this used to be an old bakery and was somewhat recently revamped into a restaurant. I ordered the soup of the day and I wish I remember what it was called. It had prosciutto and potato in it and was amazing!! (And gluten free!) I also ordered a pizza with arugula, prosciutto, cherry tomatoes and mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and balsamic. Despite having just eaten soup (and having a rather large lunch only three hours earlier) I ate 3/4 of the pizza. It. Was. Amazing!! 
Honestly, the BEST gluten free pizza I've ever had - hands down! The flavors worked so perfectly together, the crust was crispy and tasted like normal pizza! Biggest bonus - didn't get sick at all! They take gfree seriously! Prices are pretty reasonable - especially the prices for the pizzas! 
They also have a gelato bar at the other end. All very yum and the guy working there is great! 
I will be returning again and again and again!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by 9Baci for a quick bite on a Monday night to an empty restaurant. 

The service here was fast and friendly even with the one waitress as there was just another table aside from mine.

Moretti though listed as one of the drafts but it was not available but nicely they have Barking Squirrel from Hop City instead. And they were nice enough to give me extra a pint instead of half pint for the same price.. (smile)

Spaghetti Aglio Olio ($9.50) though the portion was smallish but was cooked perfectly al dente. 

I really wanted to try their Pizza Nutella as dessert or even order a pizza as main. I guess I can try those next visit. 

Yes, there will be a next visit!"}
{"text":"Exciting !Finally a italian restaurant/ take out with some style.  In maple and oh so close to King City.  They offer an extensive take out menu consisting of classic pressed and hot pressed paninis,  A variety of pastas from penne with a fresh tomato sauce, spaghetti with meat sauce, to  cheese stuffed angnelotti in brown butter sage and toasted hazelnuts and more.
A coffee bar serving expresso, lattes, macchiato, hot chocolate and teas and all with style.
Today I came in for take out.  The pizza is prepared exceptionally. Its made from one of the best Italian stone ground soft wheat flour.  Its allowed to slow rise for 48 hrs and let me tell you it is light, fluffy and crispy.  The dough is salted perfectly.  I always order my pizza well done, its just the Southern in me. 
Service was friendly and very accommodating, The sit down looked modern and elegant.  Im going to dine in the sit down area and review the menu shortly so stay tuned."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Maple, this is a weekly spot for my family and it never disappoints.  Some favourites are the calamari, pizza most definitely, penne al la vodka, actually pretty much any of their pastas."}
