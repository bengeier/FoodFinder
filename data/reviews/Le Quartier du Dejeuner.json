{"text":"Great Breakfast/Brunch Restaurant in Pointe Claire  My wife and I recently discovered this wonderful breakfast restaurant.  A friend had mentioned it and we decide to give it a try.  We have visited a total of three times now, and will definitely be making it a regular stop.  Each visit I have tried to order something different, and to date I have not been disappointed.  The portions are generous, and the meals have always been cooked to perfection.  The staff are always smiling and friendly.  Even when it got busy we were able to carry on our conversations with no problem.  The décor is charming, and clean.  A great place for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I have breakfast there often..Food is great..eggs toast and coffee .place is  modern and clean including washrooms...sevice is friendly and efficient...prices are reasonable,,,generous refills on coffee...and the coffee is fresh guess this is why I keep going back..."}
{"text":"Just went this morning again. The toast was burnt - which took 7-8 minutes to replace. Bacon was burnt. Fruit was old. Took forever to get a coffee refill. Just terrible!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but expensive. They charged us $3.75 for sharing a plate but did not inform us when ordering and it is not noted on the menu. Will not return because of this"}
{"text":"Paul cette place est unique dans le west Island pas beaucoup de place qui sert avec un sourire et surtout pour lève tôt quel choit"}
{"text":"The food was perfect! Crepes were amazing and cooked to perfection, eggs were like no other, and fruit was fresh and sweet. Loved it here!"}
{"text":"Really really friendly staff. Cool ambiance. Food was great, however, believe it or not the portions were just WAY to much. At one point we had 5 plates on the table and that was just from the 2 meals my husband and I had ordered. The only reason I gave this resto 4* instead of 5* is, the coffee was really bitter and not very good. Which I think is pretty key for a breakfast resto. But overall great place!"}
{"text":"Great service and great eggs Benedict accompanied with a generous fresh bowl of fruit. Very good experience!"}
{"text":"The food was great! I really enjoyed the small and cozy ambience. It's kids friendly which was a plus since we came with our 13 month old son. The only thing was the slightly long wait to get the food but then again its well worth it since everything was fresh and warm.   I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch and breakfast options!!  They have great options and even many combos named after what's popular in different cities! It's really Cool!  I got the Las Vegas with flavored pancakes! Amazing!   The eggs were really great as well!   Portions are HUGE and the food is outstanding!!!!!  I would definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and big portions,friendly staff. Not too noisy or overcrowded like the other west island bfast joints. Love the fresh & perfectly ripe fruit. Had the Florentine great hollandaise, right consistency and perfectly cooked poached egg. Will be back for sure. Highly recommend for those west island brunchers looking for something new and delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed!!! Came at 1:15pm (LUNCH TIME) Sunday. Not much people. Menu was given right away with Brunch and Lunch option. Waitress came, looks friendly at first but we needed sometime to decide for our order. When we were ready about 4 minutes after, we called the waitress (Asian), we gave her our orders from lunch menu and we were told that they don't serve lunch during weekends. WHATTT??? Why nobody told us? It is not written anywhere and they obviously gave us a menu with Breakfast and Lunch on it! Now, the waitress was a bit irritated, trying to hide it, but it was still obvious, who's fault huh?! So frustrating!   Finally, not so long, we called her again and order from their breakfast menu... ordered 1 chocolate pancake for my kids (sharing 3 & 6 yo - not big eaters), cheeseburger deluxe for my husband, and a plate of 2 poach eggs with asparagus, ham and cheese, with potatoes and fruits for me to share with my mom (senior and not a big eater).  We are use to order like this, not because we don't want to spend more. There were several times that we ordered for each person and ended up wasting the leftovers and that is what we are avoiding. After she took our orders, she told us that there will be a charge of $3.75 (or $3.95) for sharing (OH WELL, THANK YOU FOR TELLING US THIS TIME!).   We strongly disagreed and we asked why there is a charge? She doesn't have any explanation and uttered several times that she could call her boss and we could discuss with her. This waitress doesn't really have patient to talk to us, so fine... She called another staff wherein she clearly told us that we could talk to her boss (huh, so what happened at the back?). So the other older staff cannot explain anything as well and just said \"because the owner said it\"! We were trying to deliver our argument that we disagree for the fee for sharing because they will not add anything on my plate anyway. I am ordering a full meal for me, i wont finish it, so either I take the left over home or share with my mom. We just dont get it!!!   Behind us are other staff that while we were discussing, their heads are shaking from side to side. So we felt very uncomfortable overall and decided to leave.  If you are thinking of coming here, think again! I hope you are not sharing food! I hope you dont get the Filipina or Asian girl! Fyi, I am Filipina too, but I have a decency to execute my job properly regardless of their race and status.  I hope you dont have kids! Oh yes, while we are ordering, I was told by this waitress to tell my 3 yo daughter to take her feet off the chair (she was goofing around - typical 3yo - sitting up and down, while mommy is ordering) but yes of course, I asked my daughter to take off her feet and seat properly which I am actually about to do if she just let me finish telling her my orders first.  At some point, I agree that my daughter should have behaved more and stay seated, but I was never told the same even in fine dining restaurants. Oh well! I guess she is having issue today!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my brunch very much!  Went here with a group of 20 on a Sunday morning and the place was full.  We had a great waiter and everyone was very satisfied.  Huge plates with great food with good coffee.  What else can we ask for!"}
{"text":"Another great west island breakfast spot! Quick service, good food and lots of choices."}
