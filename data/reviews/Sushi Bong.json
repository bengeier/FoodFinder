{"text":"Good price, above avg quality.  Mainly takeout location."}
{"text":"Not the best place to sit in and eat as its very cramped. We had a group of 7 and we pretty much covered more than half the floor space. 

The nigiri/sashimi isn't anything special either but the rolls, my dear lord  the rolls are glorious. One supersized piece of sushi roll at Sushi Bong is probably equivalent to 3 pieces at your typical AYCE. We ordered the largest party tray and it had every single roll stuffed with cucumbers and avocados, on top of the sashimi and tempura of course. I was baffled when my friend who ordered often from here told me that the rolls used to be even bigger.  How is that even possible????

If you are around the area and craving for some quick sushi, this is definitely a place to check out"}
{"text":"Eat here 1-2 times a month. Good sushi for a good price. Not a sit it place as it is very small and not served. Best to get take out and enjoy at home. I like the sushi bong special."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are looking for sushi without the all you can eat guilt. 

Portions are perfect. 

Fresh fish and good service... I am looking forward to their new location at World on Yonge as it is closer to my home."}
{"text":"This place USED to be the best..  Now that they got their customers LOCKED, they jacked up prices by a bit also the rice and salmon has changed to a lower quality,  also the owner is very rude never says anything just walks around and bumps people on shoulders with no apologies."}
{"text":"Okay, the best looking place but hands down you'll want to come back. I've only tried the dynamite roll but holy they are hella huge. When you go you'll have a good time laughing most of the time watching the person you're eating with try to devour the one piece of sushi. To add it's so inexpensive! I want to go right now lol. I gave it a five star because it's just a really good atmosphere. Waiter/waitress is very straight forward. No need to make that shitty small talk unless you want to..."}
{"text":"The Worst customer service ever. Came for takeout at 10:30, and once we paid for our food, they made us wait outside in the cold to clean up. Even though there were still customers inside sitting down, enjoying their food."}
{"text":"Their sushi rolls are gigantic. The dynamite roll, I believe was $7, and was enough to feed two people. Their teriyaki was just so-so. There is only a tiny table so it is better to do takeout here."}
{"text":"Yummy maki rolls - especially the Dynamite, Unagi Special, and Spider. Great value too as you get huge pieces for a great price. They are also super fast. I would call to order and then walk across the street - so less than 10 mins and the order is done.

This our go to place for take out. Would not recommend dine in as the place is tiny and always crowded with people making orders. When there are parties and gatherings their party trays are the best!

It's too bad they don't do delivery and they only take cash."}
{"text":"Huge rolls. Great bang for your buck. Dynamite roll is nice and crunchy. Some of the tuna could be better cut to avoid silver slivers."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal Sushi Bong customer for about a year now after a friend of mine suggested I give them a try because of their huge rolls. The first visit I ordered the Dynamite Roll as take out and it really didn't disappoint. I usually go once a month as I'm in the area and now I've switched to mostly ordering Bong Sashimi as it includes 18 pieces (soo many) and it's always prepared so fresh! Sometimes I even dine in and it's also confortable though it is ideal for take out as it is a fast service and a small ambiance! Looking forward to my October visit in the next few days most likely! I definitely recommend trying Sushi Bong, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one small busy sushi place, there aren't many seats. When I went there to order take their phone were constantly ringing and lots of people were coming in and out. The food is good and popular with people in North York."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI EVER. Love everything they have here especially their dynamite rolls and their spicy tuna/salmon hand roll. Soooo much better then any sushi restaurant. I always grab takeout from here! Their quality is high and ALWAYS fresh. Forgot to mention.. Have you seen their prices? Cheaper but such better quantity and quality."}
{"text":"The only issue with this place is the parking issue.

If you live nearby enough to walk, or if you go with a friend in a car (and your friend is game enough to keep the car idle while you run in), you'll be rewarded with a giant sushi roll for under $10 each (incl tax etc) thats so thick you can barely fit it into your mouth in one piece.

Mr Bong is super friendly, always give him a hello!"}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious sushi. They are fast in take out. If you have a house party or small dinner party with friends and family, definitely get their party set. I wouldn't recommend to sit in as it's pretty crowded and the cashier/server is too busy to look after you. Try calling in first before you pick up your take out, saves so much time !"}
{"text":"I go to this place on a regular basis. Parking is free at the basement of the condo attached to this unit.  Love the price of dynamite rolls and the size of the rolls.  Chirashi is also good in portion & quality as well.  They are sometimes more accomodating by customizing the chirashi toppings for ya.  Just remember to ask for more salmon vs tuna...etc...

Definitely not a sit-down restaurant as the space is limited but this place is more about good price and speedy service."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting and I'm pleased with my sushi. I ordered sushi combo c which has twelve pcs of sushi and spicy salmon roll. It is good if u want a quick sushi fix. The spicy salmon roll doesn't taste like those we used to have, it doesn't have the spicy mayo? The salmon got a greyish colour on the side... i assume the quality is not very high. I'm very pleased with the service cuz its quick.

However while i was waiting i saw the cashier girl cut the cucumbers with her bare hands and touched the screen to take orders then picked up a phone call... then went bk on her cucumbers again without washing her hands...... :/ i wish i didnt see that..."}
{"text":"Came here two weeks ago for an afternoon snack on a Sunday. Luckily they open at 3pm on Sunday's and we got there just when they opened. When we entered the small joint, they had already made a few large platter orders (probably placed the order the day before)! The staff are courteous and make your sushi fast without compromising the quality. 

I ordered the Dynamite Roll ($6.42 for 8pcs) and Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.49 for 8pcs) and both were made in 5 minutes. Both rolls were delicious! In the spicy salmon roll, you can definitely taste the difference in the quality of the salmon compared to an AYCE restaurant. The dynamite roll was really big and had to take multiple bites to finish a piece. I must say that every time I took a bite out of the Dynamite Roll, it didn't fall apart/ingredients stayed in tact to the seaweed so it wasn't very messy! The avocado was super creamy and tasted great with the shrimp tempura in the roll. Both rolls had a good ratio of rice to ingredients - which is a bonus for me because I hate when restaurants add so much rice and you can barely taste what is inside the roll!

It's not an ideal place to sit down as they only have one table for 3 people maximum to sit. Best way to eat is to do take out. 

You will definitely get your money's worth at Sushi Bong. Can't believe I didn't find this place earlier. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The Sushi Bong Special is my favourite.  Very reasonably priced and tasty.
The dining area only has three tables, so take-out is usually your best bet here."}
{"text":"Been to Sushi Bong a couple of times and it's a great place to get take out and also to satisfy my sushi cravings because of their giant portions (  ) the people who work there are nice and the sushi is pretty good but the place is pretty small so it's better just to get take out and go, I also tend to order the moon river which is pretty bomb xD"}
{"text":"Wow, saw some good reviews for this place on google and decided to try it out, we normally don't go for cheap sushi and this is exactly why. 

The sushi was just awful! it was so fishy smelling we threw it away.  Not to mention the cashier who had an attitude when I asked for a side of spicy mayo and charged 1.50 for it!

I would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you feel like getting food poisoning."}
{"text":"Used to be huge portions at a cheaper price. Now they've gotten busy and opened another location at yonge and steeles the fish has gotten super thin and the price has been raised. There's so many sushi places in the area. If you're going for sushi I would recommend Gonoe at yonge and clark. Sushi bong went from four stars to two. Chince portions!!"}
{"text":"We have not been there for a while. It changed s bit... Not sure if the owner tony is still there because the food seems different. 
We ordered Bong's sashami, sushi comb A and spicy tuna roll. 
Sashimi was okay but the tilapia was coarsely chopped and the salmon has the grey edge attached. 

I looked at the spicy tuna ..on,y the middle pieces have tuna in the middle. The other pieces were wrapped half laugh out loud..
I guess that is why they can be so cheap and fast...
But I know that Tony used to check his food well..
Well you get what you paid for: cheap price, fast food and mediocre quality."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The lady and the chefs are nice. Average quality most of the time, sometimes worse. The food aren't too authentic, but for the price you pay, what can you ask for?  

Anyways, one time I ordered this Sushi Bong Special, and everything were pretty okay. Except for the quality for the salmon. They tasted mushy, they looked old and brown. The smell was awful as well."}
{"text":"Raised the price and lowered the quality and quantity of fish. When it's busy and you called they give away your order.  They said first come first serve so there's no point of calling it for takeout."}
{"text":"Ordered the red dragon roll - it was stuffed to the brim with ingredients and very filling! The cut of salmon on top wasn't my favorite, but the texture and taste was still decent."}
{"text":"Not as good as other options in the area. Really bad quality sushi. 

Salmon has skin on the side of it. Dynamite roll has egg? Why egg?

They charged 50 cents for hot sauce? Seriously? Instead of sriratcha sauce for spicy sauce, they use some foul tasting spicy paste. 

What is this? Why are all of the reviews like this? Must be fake"}
{"text":"amazing sushi. amazing prices. fast service. huge rolls. 

literally all you would want. i'm defiantly coming back again and again."}
{"text":"The worst customer service or should I say there is no such thing as customer service in this place. The owner lady was extremely rude today. 
I come here very often (at least twice a week) as I love sushi and their price is reasonable. I had not met the owner lady until today when I went to pick up my order. 
As I walked into the store, the lady did not greet or smile at all. As I was paying, I asked for cho-jang (red pepper paste to be eaten with sashimi). They do charge additional 60 cents for each and I had no problem with it. After I asked for it, I see her squeezing the bottle of cho-jang and puts in a very small amount (more like a dab) into the container, which is not normal for this place. I had asked her for more and she started lecturing me on how that is the normal amount for them and how I should be nicer when asking for such thing. She started to raise her voice and seemed very mad. Umm, it's not like I am asking for free stuff... I was blown away by her response and walked out. 
As much as this location is convenient for me, I certainly do not wish to return, especially when she is there. Apparently, she bad mouths customers in Korean when they complain of stuff as well. This is a small business and I certainly do not wish to hurt them but she really needs to know what customer service is about."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend and have been going ever since. The rolls at this place are huge and definitely a great deal! Their sushi is fresh and their dragon rolls are amazing. The seating is limited but most people get it to go. The location for those who don't have a car isn't very convenient but I drive so it isn't a problem. Definitely recommend this place!
-CY"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been going to this place for a long time and my favorite is Dynamite roll. It is always fresh. The place is small and not have room to sit all the time,  but food is great price is more than reasonable and staff are friendly. One of the best in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"i came here on the recommendation of the excellent Yelp reviews but didn't honestly see what all the hype was. We ordered the spicy salmon, dynamite and the California rolls. The spicy salmon had kimchi on it which we didn't find authentic and the California had hardly any avocado and mostly filled with cucumber. While I like cucumber i found it was way too much as filler instead of avocado and crab stick and so not like the usual California roll you would ordinarily get anywhere else. The highlight of the rolls was the dynamite which were huge but upon biting into them noticed the tempura was soggy. For $30+ dollars after tax, we would've expected more for our money. Would recommend only the dynamite because it is good value for the humongous size but it tasted better the next day after reheating in the toaster oven. May go again if we're in the area but only for the special huge rolls."}
{"text":"Really cheap place for sushi dinner.

The sashimi bong combo is ridiculously large. Also, they serve the fattest sushi rolls I've ever seen. However, my one major downside is that the fish is kind of bland. Nothing some soy sauce won't help.

Will be back if I'm around the area for some cheap after work eats."}
{"text":"Their salmon is so good and they're always accommodating of any dietary restrictions we may have. 

It is also a good value for what you get!! 

Did I mention their rolls are massive?"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to sushi place when I want take out. They always cater to my modifications as I have a lot items I can't eat. 

The salmon is always fresh and melts in your mouth. And the portions are great! The rolls are all massive too. 

I live in Markham but sushi bong is worth the 20-30 minute drive for me."}
{"text":"Came over to Sushi Bong because of Yelp and I am not disappointed. The place is extremely small and the service is decent. They welcomed me and my friend when we entered and it was empty. I got the spicy salmon, dynamite and spicy mayo on the side (50c extra BTW). The spicy salmon was amazing...first of all, the service was incredibly fast and the price was great ($6.20 for 8 pieces). The dynamite was ENORMOUS so I was filled very quickly and it was so good. Everything tasted fresh & I got my food in less than 2 minutes after paying. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I literally have them on speed dial. I've pretty much tried majority of their menu items but completely agree with everyone that said the dynamite roll is by far the best. It did however slightly increase its prices but you still get value for your money. Because this is more of a take out place, I call 5-10 minutes in advance and its always ready by the time I get there."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, fresh, and affordable.  Hands down my favorite sushi place in North York.  Minus one star for limited seating - I'll be sticking to take-out."}
{"text":"This place is SMALL! Nothing in the previous reviews prepared me for this hahha. Originally we opted to stay and eat but realized.. we just wanted to leave. The take out was very fast and cheap and the rolls of course were huge!

I guess it's great for the people who live in this area, if not you can always eat in the car ride home (like I did haha)"}
{"text":"I live close by and go here often for take out. The value is great for what you pay. I would say the sushi is 7 out of 10 and price is 10 out of 10. The portions are HUGE. 
I usually get the dynamite roll (one roll is probably enough for one person) and the sushi bong special and that is more than enough for my wife and I."}
{"text":"BIG portions for what you pay. Taste is good, not amazing, however not bland or \"riceish\" and there is no fish smell, not even remotely as others have posted. The taste is clean and simple. Sure the rolls aren't that neat or tidy, but who cares? You are getting good food for a good price. I always get the california, spicy salmon, and spicy tuna, all extra crunchy. Yum"}
{"text":"small place with only a couple tables. most people take out. the take out is super fast. i don't even bother calling in advance, the takeaway is ready in a minute or two.

the sushi is great and very cheap.

definitely recommend, especially if you live in the area and need a quick take out meal.

when i go alone i get sushi bong special which is great. if you're not alone there are some larger portioned specials with more variety which you can share."}
{"text":"The taste was really terrible. I couldn't handle that taste! I couldn't help but to brush my tooth immediately after I had eaten few makis.
I like free delivery service."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer at Sushi Bong for a good 4 years now and my four favourite things about this place is that the sushi is made at lightning speed (literally like a fast food place), it's very inexpensive when compared to other sushi restaurants, the portions are huge and filling and it's always consistently good (the specials that is). 

With that being said, some of the downsides to this place are that it's very very tiny, so dining-in isn't the best option especially if it's cold/windy outside, because with people constantly coming in and out of the restaurant, the cold/wind will flow through the door and onto you which can get annoying since the door is literally right next to the tables. Another thing that drags this place down for me a bit is the tall female Korean \"waitress\"/cashier who works there. She never smiles, has a slight attitude, seems like she's always in a bad mood and looks as if she doesn't wanna be there, but I put up with it because their sushi makes up for it, thank god. Also, they're very stingy with the wasabi compared to other sushi places which give you a generous amount, so don't even bother asking for extra because they always tend to give you the same as what you would normally get anyways. 

Overall, minus some of the downsides, this is still one of my favourite go-to restaurants for when I need to get my sushi fix! My recommendations are to go for take-out (unless it's warmer outside and you don't mind being enclosed in such a tiny space) and order any of the specials as it's the tastiest and what they're best known for (the dynamite roll special is their most popular order)."}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is amazing they are very quick with orders, amazing food/generous portions and sushi and you can't beat their prices!"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out here a couple of times now and I would have to say the maki rolls are massive.  Sashimi here is only ok but for the price they charge I think it's pretty decent. This place is always busy when I go, I do recommend to call ahead to place your order before dropping by. Overall I give this place a four star."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent for the price. I usually get the Sushi Bong Special, and always to go, so no review for their sit-down.

I would definitely go again, and have no reservations recommending this place to anybody."}
{"text":"This is the place for those sushi cravings. Good quality and at very good prices. I always come here for the rolls. Its take out so call ahead for pick up. Trust me this place gets busy especially on the weekends. But they've added a second location at world on yonge if you don't mind the drive."}
{"text":"Food: 6/5 only downside it's super small and more made for take-out but this is my fave go-to sushi place!! The size of the rolls are huge the dynamite rolls are stuffed with fresh fish, tempura shrimp and veggies topped with a fish of choice and fish roe. It tastes great with a great price. My friends and I mission here from Mississauga when were craving good quality rolls :)"}
{"text":"Really good place to get takeout sushi when you're craving sushi and don't want to spend that much."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sushi take-out place in the North York area. It's a small place with no gimmicks, but the service is fast and the fish quality is really great.
Try the Sushi Bong Special, it's only $10 and pretty delicious. Even a sushi snob will appreciate this place!"}
{"text":"So good. Have been a frequent customer here for many years. Love their dynamite rolls and miso soup. Have only been disappointed once, the avocado in the sushi was old and ruined the whole taste, but whatever that was the one time. I hope they remain true to their taste as their business keeps growing."}
{"text":"Really large and cheap sushi. I always take out from there. But yesterday after eat from them I got food poisoned. Still vomiting today."}
{"text":"All the value! As a student who has a bad sushi addiction, I fully endorse this place. Always get the sushi bong special, excellent size and good quality at an unbeatable price. Must try for those who are a little light in the wallet but who need their sushi fix"}
{"text":"Good portion with very reasonable price, friendly staffs and fast service. I would recommend their Unagi special roll is the best, dynamic roll and spicy salmon are top 2 on my list. The rice portion is Just right In a roll with lots of ingredients which makes the roll super huge. My favorite quick sushi roll place in north York!"}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Bong today for the first time, even though a friend of mine had told me about it over a year ago. I'm usually wary of trying new sushi places (I have my set go-to places), but a craving hit hard and I was looking for a quick fix nearby.

Sushi Bong, like others have said, is a tiny hole-in-the-wall joint in the Northtown Plaza. The staff is really friendly and REALLY quick. I ordered a15-piece sushi combo and a roll and I was out the door in under 5 minutes. Another bonus is that everything, with tax and tip, came to $20. That being said, the speed and price certainly show in the quality of the food - everything was just kind of \"meh\". 

My sushi combo was mostly salmon, certainly reflective of the combo's $10.50 price point, and most of the sushi rice fell apart as I tried to eat it. My one piece of octopus/tako sushi was very tough. The fish was fresh enough, but I have definitely had better elsewhere. The one thing I did appreciate was that my spicy tuna roll was made mostly of tuna, and that it didn't have a mayonnaise-based sauce slathered all over it like at most other places. 

While the price is right, I would much rather pay a few dollars more elsewhere for better variety in a sushi combo and overall better quality.  I may give Sushi Bong another chance someday when in need of a quick fix again, and may try something else on their menu to see how that fares."}
{"text":"Been to this location about 5 times now since it opened and have not been disappointed each time. 

I've had the dynamite roll, spider roll, spicy salmon roll, and an assortment of Maki and sashimi. They are all excellent and fresh without breaking the bank. 

This location is new and seems like not too many people know that it opened yet, it is truly a hidden gem for excellent sushi at great prices!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 10 years now and food quality is the same as day one of not better! I recommend their dynamite and spider rolls. Although not advertised you could substitute the California roll in their sushi bong special for roughly an additional $2. This is a great deal and is definitely perfect when you're feeling sushi on a budget."}
{"text":"Second review for this place.

As per my previous comment, the rolls are huge. Upon dissection, the dinosaur sized rolls may be attributed to the tamago (egg) that is stuffed inside. This eggstra (haw haw) ingredient is not indicated in the menu so, if you have egg allergies, please let them know in advance to omit this or be plagued with blotchy skin and the scent of steroid creams!

They always ask for cash. 

Did not have problems with the sashimi however on TWO separate occasions, the fish in the salmon maki was spoiled...had an eerie colour of Plasticine...the type you played with whilst in kindergarten....tasted like it too...  my friend was peeing out of his butt after one episode."}
{"text":"Too much vinegar in the rice but the price is very competitive. Good place for take outs."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The sushi or sashimi isn't too special in my opinion, but I absolutely love the rolls. Dynamite roll seems to be the most popular item on the menu. Your orders are made lightning fast, and the portions are huge compared to the cheap prices."}
{"text":"Location: On Yonge St just south of Finch on a smaller street. There is very little parking but if you call ahead for take out, idling for a few moments on the road shouldn't be a problem (you're not on the main). If you want to dine-in, there is street parking available. 

Facility: Decor is outdated and space is very cramped. There is a total of three for four tables that seat between 2 - 4. I felt bad for the staff who must work in such tiny quarters the entire day. Definitely run down and kitschy. 

Food Quality & Price: Decent sushi (not the best) but for the price, you can't go wrong. Dinner for $10 is the average. Portions are huge. When going with friends, I might be better to order the amount of dishes per person, but split/share the food so you can have some of everything. As stated in previous reviews, the rolls are humongous. Three bites per piece (and it'll fall apart).  Tea is self-served (beside the cash). You pour it yourself. There is also a water cooler (hot and cold) too. 

Service: Hostess/cashier was sweet. The entire staff (cooks and everything) are super efficient. Take out and dine-in service is fast. She was also very attentive of us while she seamlessly multi-tasked incoming orders on the phone, walk-ins and me asking if I could get another cup. I was very impressed.

Overall: I am generally pleased with the fast food model Sushi Bong has going for it. The staff really know what they're doing. Sushi quality is good, though I don't know WHY the portions need to be so huge. It ends up being such a mess and the staff have to clean up afterward. I'd rather they make two small rolls instead. I deducted points for poor atmosphere and crowds. I don't mind a loud space, but having someone standing a foot next to me while I eat and talk is irritating. Also, they ran out of green tea, so I had to get water instead. I would likely return for take out if I am in the area and hungry for sushi."}
{"text":"Best dynamite rolls ever! filling and delicious and quick service even though its always packed with take outs!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is amazing! I haven't had cheap and delicious sushi in a long long time. Though there is no seating area but because of the location of the restaurant, you can find picnic tables anywhere. They are very friendly and very much accommodating to your taste buds. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had ordered four rolls for takeout-spicy tuna,rainbow,dynamite and spider rolls. One major problem is they all hardly had any fish which was quite generously replaced by avocado sprinkled with cheap tobiko to simulate fish flavour. Rainbow roll had miniscule slices of salmon on top which appeared as an afterthought. Traditionally the contents of the rainbow roll usually wrapped in salmon tissue, kind of an inside out roll. Bottom line - you'll get filled up with a lot of rice and avocado for a hefty forty dollars. This could have been a great deal if they only had some fish, that is what I paid for. Very disappointing! I won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered a Sushi Bong special combo (sushi, california, salmon maki) and the infamous house special Dynamite roll I read so much about. 

The rolls areso large, they're comical.
Presentation is sloppy. Taste, lots of rice. Grade, like a fast food version of sushi/maki.

Not exactly car friendly. It's located on the commercial ground level of a condo complex.  No problem for residents or pedestrians though.

Water or tea is self serve. It's a small place to dine in. Caters to the crowd of 'more is better'. So go in with that expectation.

They accept cash or interac only."}
{"text":"cheap and huge rolls. better to take out bc they dont have many tables and the place is always busy with people coming and going for take out"}
{"text":"The quality of the food from the new location is comparable to the original North York location. The small restaurant is located at the base of the new condo complex on Yonge St., just north of Steeles.

This place is an amazing bang for buck with huge maki and sushi pieces. The place is small, so it's more of a takeout joint. 

The sushi bong special is a must, for $9.50 before tax, you get 5 sushi pieces and a large roll."}
{"text":"Food is good and staff is friendly. Ordered the Hae Dup Bap and the ingredients were fresh and sauce was tasty.

A couple of things that I didn't like. First, some of the end pieces of fish was too chewy. Second, the dish came white tuna. Folks, do not eat white tuna - it's toxic and banned in Japan. For some reason, they allow it in Canada."}
{"text":"For a little over $10 there's no where else in the city I know of that you can get 18 pieces of sashimi! Salmon, white fish, and tuna are the three you typically get which are enormous and will keep you full for a while. Also love the spider roll and sushi bong special. Don't order too much here! It's a tiny place, come just for take out. Don't expect to sit in here. There's free parking through the visitors parking off of Doris st that I always take advantage of rather than paying to park in front.

3 stars for the quality. I'd say come here for the quantity not really quality or service. I mean 
I've never been sick from the food here but have never expected much except large portions."}
{"text":"Great place for quick sushi takeout! The rolls are HUGE though...so it is worth the price I guess, but they are hard to squeeze in your mouth! LOL"}
{"text":"Had one of the party platters... Very fresh sushi and amazing value for money. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for filling rolls and fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"wooooohoooooo i just discovered about this place although i live nearby.

ordered an extra large party tray and a small one and bong sashimi.

first of all, the Bong Sashimi is RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP. 18 pieces for $10.55? Come on!!! and tax included! it tastes quite fresh too!

the sushi here is soo cheap yet sooo gooood (for the price). i ended up walking out with about 160 pieces of sushi and only paid $132 dollars (including the party plastic tray which is around 10-13 dollars extra and tax) which is a VERY GOOD price compared to other sushi places.

tastes are slightly above average. fresh fish and more.

8 pieces california roll for only $4.99

the owner, a korean lady, was kind enough to be willing to take out his car to drive us home because the two of us were planning to carry the three sushi trays by ourselves to yonge and sheppard. 

the only turn down is the place is kinda small...

will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty big if ur hungry, I just wish they have a delivery guy to at least the buildings around them !!"}
{"text":"For what you pay the food is good. This place is a great take out restaurant but if you go when it is busy your guaranteed to get terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Came here a few times already and I will keep coming back again for take out! Their rolls are always fresh, affordable and large! We ordered a sushi bong special - upgraded the Cali roll to dynamite roll, and salmon roll to spicy salmon roll. The dynamite roll was hugeee and so delicious since it was filled with fresh avocado, crispy tempura and what was so unique was the crispy bits and sesame seeds sprinkled on the rice outside! So yum! The spicy salmon was okayyy just a normal salmon roll with a squirt of spicy sauce. I usually like one with spicy mayo sauce and crispy bits w the salmon. :) Their spider roll (which I tried last time) was also delishhhh filled with crispy soft shell crab and surrounded with ample filling! What I like about sushi bong is that they have a lot of filling but its not stuffed or surrounded by a lot of rice like some other places. They really put an effort in presentation and putting just the right amount of everything! :) super convenient, super quick, never disappointed all around great sushi take out place!! :D"}
{"text":"Quite small space so it's better you take out. Quality is not bad. Sashimi is very fresh and the price is reasonable! Recommend that call first then come to pick up, otherwise you need to wait for a while."}
{"text":"The good 'old Sushi Bong.

I love this place.

My friends and I used to frequent this place as much as we could but over the years, our schedules have kept us from reuniting with the deliciousness that is Sushi Bong. This place probably has the best value of food in terms of price and quality. You can get a container full of sushi for merely ~$11 (tax included).

I usually order the Sushi Bong special (5pcs assorted Sushi, 8pcs California Roll, 4pc Salmon Maki). If you're a fan of salmon, this is something you should order. Their California rolls actually have salmon in them which is quite surprising.

Sushi Bong

The ratio of fish to rice is perfect. Although the maki pieces are a little more than a mouthful, it's packed full of filling. The seasoning of the rice is perfect and it still has a bit of warmth (not warm warm but not cold and brittle) to contrast the cold fish. They add wasabi to the sushi pieces (as it should be) so if you're not a fan of wasabi, it would be wise to let them know.

The prices here are real cheap and the quality of service is great. The sushi chefs work great as a team and you can see that each chef knows exactly what they're doing. The restaurant itself is small, with only 3 tables located inside for seating. The busy store usually serves people ordering take out. With the high turnover rate of Sushi Bong orders, the fish stays fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Bong and think they make one of the best Sushis in Town, even my visiting Japanese friend agreed after we've been to Sushi Kaji - which is supposed to be the best Sushi.

Sushi Bong is a small place mainly for take out, there is no ambiance or atmosphere or fancy wooden boats to serve sushi. However sushi themselves are huge, fresh and tasty. The prices are really good too.

I would suggest to always go for their special rolls, my ranking of my favorite rolls over there:
-Rainbow
-Moon River
-Hard Rock
-Beef
-Spider"}
{"text":"came here because of the good reviews and was trulely disappointed. The only bonus is the cheap price but the food quality is poor. We ordered sashimi for 2 person and eel dynamite rolls. The rolls are huge. The rolls arent so bad but we will not return to this place anymore."}
{"text":"The size of the sushi here is enormous! It's a small store underneath a condo building, with very few seats for dine-ins. Most people order take out, and order either the Dynamite Roll or Spider Roll. 

My favourite is the moon river roll - for some reason, they stuff this roll with huge pieces of avocado (yum). There isn't much of a wait time, the chefs make the sushi fairly fast even when there's a huge line. If you ever dine in, please note that everything is self serve. You have to pour yourself water - I realized that only after asking for tea - the waitress pointed me towards the plastic cups on the side. I'm surprised they even have a \"TIPS\" jar by the cashier. 

Overall, the sushi isn't amazing, but it's decent and worth the value. It's convenient for me since I live around the area, but it's definitely worth a try just to see the size of the sushi!"}
{"text":"Still by far my #1 sushi takeout spot!!! Awesome, delicious food at super cheap prices :D Love how their rolls are huge, and not because there's a ton of rice but because they're stuffed with ingredients. The fish on top of the sushi and sashimi are not thinly cut either!

Despite being a tiny place advertising takeout, I could never find fault with the service or ambiance at all. There was only 1 waitress, but she was definitely friendly and professional. Tables were clean and everything from what I could see, and although there's of course very limited seating, the ones available and the overall atmosphere made me feel that eating in the restaurant would be nice too. This is a place I would go out of my way to get to! Would also recommend for all your sushi party needs :)"}
{"text":"After hearing about the cheapness of the sushi here, I had to come check out this place when I was in the area. It exceeded my expectation on all fronts. The Bong Sashimi was fresh, delicious, and expertly prepared and presented (the chef works right in front of you). Food came out in next to no time - I've never had such quick service before. Portion sizes were huge and did not skimp on the thickness of the sashimi slices, which I've noticed at a lot of other restaurants. Even the ambience of this place was better than anticipated - though it is rather small, I didn't find it dirty or messy and you can certainly eat your food there instead of choosing take-out like I did. When I was leaving I saw the waitress coming out with a couple of rolls and they. Were. Humongous.  I'm already planning a trip here again sometime in the extremely close future.

Tl;dr: COME! AN ABSOLUTE MUST-EAT!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Extra Large Party Tray for 10 people and was pretty satisfied. Not gonna lie, the sushi and sashimi portions were a bit on the smaller side, but the rolls were much bigger and more filling. Overall, pretty high quality for a pretty cheap price! My sushi craving was definitely satisfied and I would come again."}
{"text":"There is always a line of people getting take-out when I go to Sushi Bong. People really seem to love this place, but I feel like it must be more for the quantity than the quality...? I find the fish just okay; it's never particularly fresh and sometimes my sushi/sashimi looks like a questionable end piece of the fish.  But the portions are quite large. I always end up over-ordering because I think to myself, \"one roll can't be enough for one person\" but yep, it always is. All the rolls I've ordered are eight large pieces each.  I do particularly like their spider rolls (both quantity AND quality) and the unagi roll.  I think the way to go at Sushi Bong is to order rolls and not sushi/sashimi pieces.

There is no room for seating inside Sushi Bong. Well there are two or three tables, but they are always full and you will never get to sit down, so plan on taking it to go!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to do this, but I'm downgrading from my previous 4-star review from 3 years ago.  Once upon a time things were much fresher and less fast-food style.

That said, the price to value ratio is still excellent, and if you're craving some sushi that won't kill your wallet, it's not a bad take-out option.

Don't love or crave it like I used to, but still a reliable option."}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi place! I just moved into the complex of condos that Sushi Bong is located in and all I can say is that I am a very happy camper. Pretty good sushi for a small price. The portions are huge and less than $20 will fill me and my husband up. Tiny place but great for take out!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend recently and never knew it existed! Boy, were we missing out! This place has huge rolls and it's definitely enough food. The Sushi Bong Special is amazing, so much food for that price... definitely a great deal! The shrimp tempura that we ordered were nice and crispy while also feeling light. The tempura chef did an amazing job because some places drown the shrimp, causing it to soak up the oil which does not make for a delicious treat. I totally recommend Sushi Bong! Although the name made us a bit hesitant, try it out... did not disappoint! 

Seating was very, very limited so I suggest taking out! Our order was placed and received our meal in perhaps 5 min, great service and very quick!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with this place. We were craving sushi and these guys came in on Yelp with astounding reviews. Trusting that, we checked to make sure they were still open (open till 10:30) and walked in at 9:40pm, only to be told by super lazy hostess (keep in mind, there are only three tables in this place), that \"there's not really a lot of time, we close at 10\". Super excited to try this well-rated place, we vowed to be out by 10pm...so we sat. In an effort to be quick, we only ordered three rolls; California and two Dynamite. Impressed by how quick it came out (3-4 minutes later) we dove in. WORST DYNAMITE ROLL EVER. Clearly, they pre rolled it and it sat there for a bit, waiting to be cut...not only was it completely room temperature...the tempura shrimp inside, SHOULD have been crispy but instead, it was chewy...because it was cooked so far in advance. I was gobsmacked...
I understand it's the eve before Canada Day, and the staff just wanted to get out of there, but come on...standby by great quality and your customers (old and new) and pump out a worthy product until you lock the doors!
What a shame...between the lazy service and poor rolls, we won't be heading back here."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and it's definitely a solid place for a quick bite. If you're looking for gourmet sushi this won't be the place for you, however if you're looking for some solid rolls and sushi with really fresh fish than this is the place to be! For two people we ordered two sushi bong specials and one dynamite roll. The rolls were massive and tasty. Price point is decent, I paid about 35 dollars for the two of us.  

The storefront is super tiny and most people came for takeout. There's a self serve tea and water stand that you can help yourself to if you're dining in. They also only take debit and cash. 

Sushi bong is located on Yonge and the bad traffic along the area probably is probably why I won't be returning anytime soon. Parking can be a hassle but there is underground parking available for free."}
{"text":"Wow! I was impressed with the size of the rolls! They were seriously big as you can see in the photo below. 

I got the combo with sashimi, sushi and rolls for $25 and found them to be quite generous with the fish. Also generous with the wasabi.... Lol bit much for me but that's personal preference. 

The girl working there was really nice as well. This place is definitely a good sushi spot but take out. We sat down originally but it was quite cold with the door open so we got it to go. They also have tea and water that you can help yourself with. 

Overall... Recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick and cheap takeout spot, as long as you manage your expectations. The fish selection is small and the quality is what you'd expect from an all-you-can-eat joint. 

Skip the thinly sliced sashimi of \"meh!\" quality and go for the rolls instead. Lots of filling, surrounded by just a little border of rice which of course is much preferred over the reverse ratio. 

Reading other reviews, I knew this place was small but I was still a bit surprised at the size when stepping in to grab some takeout. The entire restaurant is only mildly larger than those convenience stalls on the subway that sell chips and cigarettes. With the constant influx of customers opening the door to get takeout, there isn't a single spot that you can sit in here during the winter without feeling an Elsa-worthy blast."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever had. First of all, the rice is very blant. There's no hint of vinegary or sweetness in it. I ordered a sweet potato roll and red dragon roll, and they gave me a chewy salmon that tasted like it's not supposed to be use for any sushi but for cooking instead, also the tempura shrimp inside the red dragon roll is stale as it can be. The rolls tasted very old all in all, though they give you bigs rolls, because Korean sushi rolls are usually massive. I would never in my life try this place again. It's not cheap at all like other reviewers in yelp says so. Very very disappointed. I suggest you make your own sushi at home instead."}
{"text":"If you want cheap, decent-quality sushi, this is the place to go. I have been coming here for three years, and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews of this place, I finally got a chance to try it. Not impressed. The salmon looked very unfresh. It was pale in colour, and the rice was hard. We got there around 9:30 and they close at 10:30. Maybe it's because they close soon? 

We got: 
Green Dragon Roll
Spicy Salmon Roll
Small Party Platter 
Sushi Bong Special

Nothing special about anything other than the huuuge rolls! The prices are great for what you get. I would go back to try again but i'd make sure to go during the day."}
{"text":"Really good prices and a good option if you don't want to have all you can eat. The portions are quite well sized as in if it says it will feed 2 people it usually does. the rolls are not made with too much rice. 

My friend and I ordered the small sushi combo (feeds 2) and small sashimi combo (feeds 1) and we were way too full and in hindsight could have just got the small sushi combo. We ate in but it is really stuffy and warm inside. Previous experience has always been take out, the dine in experience wasn't bad but service was slow since there was a lot of take out orders the kitchen and staff needed to make. You pour your own water or tea at a mini station. I've seen people go into adjoining \"mall with no open shops\" and eat in the upstairs food court. 

They only accept cash and debit. 

Will probably be back but mostly for take out."}
{"text":"Sushi bong is my fav sushi place. I live walking distance to the original sushi bong at north town but I still like to come here to this new location. It's less busy and more modern and clean. 
This place is fairly new so not a lot of people know about it. It's exact same menu offering dynamite and rainbow rolls at great affordable prices. 
I have come here at least 3 times now. Their sushi quality is great! Whenever I come here I always opt to eat in because it has around 3-4 tables where as the other location only has 1-2. It's more spacious and welcoming to eat in. They have ceramic plates where as the other location has plastic plates. 
The chefs are also very friendly. 
They take debit or cash only. 
There is underground parking (free) available."}
{"text":"My go-to cheap sushi place. I usually stop by to grab take out if I'm on the way home. You get so much food for so little. I always order the dynamite roll- one roll and I'm stuffed"}
{"text":"UPDATed my review from 4 to 3 star. Having been living in the neighbourhood for half year now, been to this place countless times. Sad to say this is no longer my fav sushi place. The portions (fish) in the rolls are getting less generous. Very slim slices of fish in the rolls. Not very impressed. Price is still same and affordable tho! 

It's mostly for take out as there is only 2 tables available howver have sat in on mutiple occasions. Authentic Japanese. 
Very hard to find parking as it is in a condo plaza."}
{"text":"Great little location. Very similar to their original location in North York with the same menu. My favorite and go to order is their sushi bong special. Although I am disappointed in the size decrease the taste and quality remains. Great bargain for the price you pay."}
{"text":"A good & quick sushi fix. This restaurant is very small with only 2-3 tables which can sit approx. 8 people in total (maybe 9). 

-open till late
-cheap
-great deal

cons: parking might be a trouble around Northtown way. Very small round about circle; can find street parking and walk over. Visitor parking from the condo may or may not be possible depending who was the security guard of the day. 

Taste: not bad at all imo for the deal. The quality is actually pretty good compare to other Korean owned sushi restaurant. Of course you cannot use this price and quality and compare to authentic Japanese restaurants. MOST IMPORTANTLY- FRESH ingredients. 

Call ahead and pick up order on-the-go

*CASH OR DEBIT only!!*"}
{"text":"Small place which I chose to line my stomach with before going to a nearby condo party. 

I like it inside being so small and cosy I can imagine a place like this in Japan and I enjoyed sitting there listening to the staff talking Japanese. Chef talks and it always sounds angry although he is probably just saying \"pass me fish\" or \"honey boo boo is a little brat that resembles a pig\".

The value for money is good and I can not remember what the name of the combo was that I ordered but I had to double check the price was right.

For $8 something there was a big selection including two very big pieces of sashimi. 

Totally not being a sushi fan and not knowing good sushi from bad, I did not mind the food but even I was able to tell the difference in quality between here and other better places I have eaten recently.

However for the value I would not expect the most amazing sushi and if this place was near my house then I imagine I would continue to come here but oh well sushi bong bong that will not be the case."}
{"text":"everything is so great like i didnt even expect it from a small restaurant. soo fresh and so yummy. i will definitely go back there ASAP"}
{"text":"If you're looking to squash a sushi craving fast, look no further. Sushi Bong is a very economical  Korean owned sushi shop that pumps out rolls like nobody's business. Yes, there are fancier and higher grade sushi shops out there, but for your dollar, these guys will do the trick. Their sushi bong special is always a good choice. For roughly $10 and change, you get 8 jumbo sized rolls that are basically california rolls but with salmon added, 4 salmon rolls, and 5 nice juicy slabs of assorted sushi. That's a lot of fresh fish for $10! Very filling, this special can be shared by 2. You definitely will get high off sushi from eating here; pun intended."}
{"text":"It's a great little place in the plaza on shops on yonge. If u have never tried sushi from here, u r missing out.  The only problem was it was hard to find when I was in the mall. But once u know where  it is they have an easy to get to outside entrance."}
{"text":"Sushi....wait for it.... BONG! 

Great place when you need sushi, sashimi and roll takeout! The dynamite rolls are ginormous and the ingredients are really fresh. I've ordered over the phone and in store before and they have your takeout ready of the allotted time. They have seats inside but its very limited and take out is your best bet. 

If you want to get a large or extra large party tray, you should BYOT (Bring Your Own Tray) or they will charge you $6 per tray which I thought was not worth it.

Parking can be a pain at this location as there are tons of cars parked throughout the day since it is between two apartment complexes. I usually go with two people as one person can sit in the car while the other person can go in and get the order.

Overall, great place to get sushi, sashimi and rolls takeout."}
{"text":"You can't argue that this place doesn't offer great sushi for a low price. This small, somewhat cramped sushi bar is mostly for takeout orders (although there are three tables for dining in). Sashimi, sushi and maki rolls taste just slightly above par, and the service is always very friendly to customers. A great, inexpensive place if you wanna grab some sushi grub on-the-go."}
{"text":"Nice \"little\" take out place with only 2 tables but that is all that is little here.  The rolls are massive and yummy.  Price is very competitive as well.  Can't go wrong with this place. Looking forward to getting more amazing sushi from here next time. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for cheap take out sushi.

The sushi is always fresh and and ready to go.  I usually order the Sushi Bong special, and they give you lots of salmon in each of the rolls."}
{"text":"Fresh sushis done with care! 
Price for two: $30.
A small joint with only two tables, Great for take out. Service time for take out: 10 to 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Good for takeout, a very small joint. 
Sushis aren't done with care- fall off when held.
Ginormous queues for takeout- so be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"The go-to cheap sushi fix. How can you ever complain or go wrong with $6 dynamite rolls, $5 spicy salmon rolls and $4 cucumber avocado rolls and California rolls? 

Each roll is also easily double and sometimes triple the size of a normal sushi restaurant. 

The dynamite roll and spicy salmon are my go to rolls and they are deliciously huge and stuffed with ingredients. I love that Sushi Bong does not cheap out on the ingredients they stuff inside each roll. I've also had their sushi dinners before and they are okay but I would definitely get the rolls if you're just looking for a quick cheap sushi fix. 

This place only takes cash or debit (they prefer cash) and it's super fast for take out. There is not much parking in the area but if you're taking out, you usually don't even need to park cause they are so fast. 

I usually get 3 rolls (dynamite, spicy salmon/tuna and cucumber avocado) for two people (it is MORE than enough) and it comes to $17 after tax. 

Highly recommend for quick cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's cheap, it's quick, the portions are huge, and I've been there so many times already in a week. Hence it is a go-to place for quick and cheap sushi :)

Tip: Call in ahead and order, it'll be ready when you get there. Also from Friday to Sunday I believe, they don't accept debit card, only cash."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some quick takeout. 

Pros: 
- Well priced 
- Large pieces 

Cons:
- Small space (not much seating area)"}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout for dinner the other night 

Pros 
Large portions 
Very cheap
Quick pickup 

Cons
Wasn't the best sushi I've tried. 3/5 for taste."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the price was very reasonable, it's not great for big groups but it's very good other than that , I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my bf and it's been amazing every time. We always get a dynamite roll and a spicy salmon or tuna roll for take out and it's ready so quickly. The rice proportion is perfect. Not too much not too little. And it's decent $$$. 
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick meal or snack at a decent price!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Bong about 5 times, and overall I am pretty satisfied.  It's a very small place with a few tables, and not a lot of room to move around.  

The service is quick and the food is decent with good sized portions. They have an awesome dynamite roll and tempura.

I will continue to go here :)"}
{"text":"YUMMMY GIGANTIC SUSHI. IDK WHERE ELSE YOU CAN GET THIS SIZED OF A SUSHI.. ANYWHERE ELSE IN MARKHAM,RICHMOND,HILL!... BUT MAN.. i was so happy i found this shrine for my sushi cravings! 
Not only are they BIG... They are cheap also! I came here twice and so far i've tried spicy salmon roll, spider roll, dynamite roll , white tuna roll and they are all so good! i was sharing it with my BF and we still couldn't finish it!  Both times the price came up to around $17 though.  

The bad thing is that i need to drive a bit farther to get it.. Otherwise i would come here every sushi craving  lol :)"}
{"text":"-- My First Experience -- 

I remember when I visited Muncheez 3 months ago, we noticed Sushi Bong and decided we would visit them the next time we were around the area. When we walked in, there were only 3 tables (2 tables for 4 guests and 1 table for 2 guest). The restaurant was very small. Since the tables were not occupied by any guests, we decided to dine in. The environment weren't very pleasant at all. There were a few fruit flies around our booth. Since they have an open-kitchen, I wonder if there's sufficient cleaning. There was no table service for dine in customers. You have to go and get your own water. (I didn't notice until some customers grabbed a styrofoam cup and served themselves). 

-- Food and Drink --

1. Teriyaki Chicken 
- I am not a fan of this dish. Given this price, you can buy a better Chicken teriyaki dish in Markham. The chicken had a weird after taste and it actually made my husband sick after eating it. Chicken wasn't juicy and it was a little bit overcooked. 

2. Red Dragon roll
The portion size for the roll was huge. There were eight pieces of rolls. The diameter of the roll was around 2 inches. I actually had trouble picking it up. When we used chopsticks to hold the rolls, it fell apart. The salmon on top was so thin and didn't taste fresh. I wasn't satisfied with my purchase at all. 

-- Overall --

I don't understand why this place has a high review. I am not a fan of the taste/ hygiene/ service of this place. I've had better sushi rolls elsewhere. I won't come back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm rating 5 stars because it does exactly what it's intended for...cheap, quick, great eats.

Call ahead of time about 5-10 minutes and you don't even have to wait to pick up!  It's the biggest sushi rolls you'll find.  And because they have so much traffic, their stuff is always fresh!

Just don't expect to find a seat inside.  You'll probably rate them lower if you tried to sit there because it will not be comfortable, especially in winter without double doors.  But treat this as a take-out place and you'll never order from anywhere else again!"}
{"text":"I used to live in the building above this gem and got hooked onto it. They value proposition it was hard to beat. Now if I am in the area I make it a point to grab some rolls from their. Their Dynamite and Rainbow Rolls are a great value IMO. Now for the bad part they only accept cash yes not even interac what kind of place does that. The sitting area is tiny with I think 2 tables and the rest bar like area. I would recommend it for take out and not eating in. The Bong Sashimi is good if you are dining alone.  If you are looking for ultimate value combo I suggest getting sashimi from Taro and Pairing them with the rolls from here. I guess my review is a bit biased as we used to get freebees as the owner knew my friends and always treated us well."}
{"text":"Wouldn't expect to find a cheap sushi place in north york. Cant go wrong for the price you pay for your sushi.

The portion size is super big and you get more food than you pay for. I ordered the small sushi which included 20piece sushi and 1 dynamite roll for $20. The salmon was fresh and everything was fresh. We didn't need to wait long for our food. Chirashi was pretty cheap, a good simple portion of salmon, snapper, fish roe and rice was only for $9.

The restaurant size is pretty small, very little seating. As a group of 4 people we were lucky to have an open table."}
{"text":"Really really really bad service. The mid-age cashier was so rude and impatient. When I was trying to pay with my card, she just grabbed it away and shouted out loud, saying that they do not accept credit. I m buying food but not begging food from you. Will never come back again. My friend ended up getting nothing because of their bad attitudes."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi that Canada can offer nothing can beat it. excellent quality for a good and affordable price"}
{"text":"Very large rough  rolls. Waitress always on phone. Super inflated rating, would not eat even if free."}
{"text":"40 pieces of sushi for less than $20?  Get out of here!!  The place is dirty.  It's family owned.  There is not enough seating.  You get your own water and tea but man the sushi is good and CHEAP!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I was craving for sushi and decided to go to Sushi Bong. We passed by the original North York location but decided to go to this newer location to see how it compares with the other one. 

The place is located at the street level of Shops on Yonge and is primarily a takeout place, with three tables to eat there. There was not a lot of above ground parking, with some having twenty minute time limits so we parked underground. There was no wait for our rolls when we went at 9 in the evening.
 
I ordered a spider roll (fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, fish roe) and hardrock & roll (BBQ eel, fish roe with avocado on top) and both were so delicious! The size of the roll was huge and can tell that it is made with fresh ingredients. By the time I finished eating I was stuffed! Overall I would definitely come back here when I want to satisfy my sushi cravings but don't want to go to AYCE."}
{"text":"One u have have it u will be back, every one who I have taken to this spot has been hooked, my best friend was soo hooked that he met his wife there, and now they have been married for almost two years and have a daughter together. 
This isn't no match making restaurant, but the sushi is fresh, as they  have a huge turn over, the price is VERY fair. It a take out spot, don't be going there on a date thinking u will save a few bucks by being cheap, notake out and take out only, there are TWO  tables, but with the number of people coming in for take out orders u don't really want to sit and eat, unless its really off hours. A must have is the sushi bong special at 10.75$ tax in a bit of every thing and much healthier then fast food for about the same price. 

Call ahead!!!! Makes pick up much easier 

Ps don't park right infront of the place, I got a 250$ parking ticket there once while waiting for my food, and I was leaning on my car, the owner told me how they have got over 11 of those tickets."}
{"text":"Their all day specials are great! Full dinner for $10! Amazing!

I have to say the Hae Dup Bab is AMAZING! Love the bean paste sauce. Hungry just writing about it. It's a bed of rice with fish and veggie on top, it comes with a bean sauce that you mix in. It's really good and different from what I've had.

Recommend you call ahead to place your order, there's not much comfortable waiting area.

{"text":"Came back and wanted to try other things on the menu and bought a White Tuna & Green Onion Maki, Hae Du Bap, and a Small Sashimi (36pcs) but there was literally 11pcs of salmon, 11 pcs white tuna/butterfish, 12 pcs tilapia, 2 pcs of hokkigai/surf clam. 

The sashimi was pretty gross mostly because of the giant cuts of tilapia, felt like i was eating cuts of raw tilapia steaks and the salmon tasted a little fishy and the white tuna/butterfish was a whole lot fishier. The texture of the white tuna/buttefish I had was sooo gross ended up not finishing it. The White Tuna roll was good but wasn't great; hope it wasn't the same used in the sashimi.

The Hae Du Bap had like about 80g of chopped up assorted fish in which about 25% of it was chewy salmon yuck. The sauce for it was a generic korean hot bean paste sauce and it had ALOT of cabbage. Imagine about 80% of the box was just cabbage and the other 10% cuccumber, carrot, white onion, masago, and sesame oil, and then the fish ontop.  I mean at least the rice was hot and nice.

Maybe it was just an off day for them? Or I just happened too get all the bad peices in my order ;/ I'll come around one more time to try again I guess because I have hope..."}
{"text":"HUGE sushi rolls, like massive pieces, good prices and AMAAAZING sushi. I tried the yam rolls because I'm not a fan of fish but it was probably the best sushi I've gotten anywhere, my boyfriend got the green dragon and he really enjoyed it as well. You'd probably want to get take out though as the place is quite small and a bit awkward if you're dining in."}
{"text":"The other night my friend ordered take out from here and it was pretty good. We ordered a bunch of different rolls, sushi and sashimi. The rolls were good, considering I'm not able to have any of the delicious sauces that normally go on gourmet style rolls. The ones we ordered were filled with salmon, avocado, cucumber, crab and some had salmon slices on the outside. Allover they were really good. The sushi and sashimi was good as well. For the most part, the sashimi was pretty fresh with a few exceptions where I avoided eating some due to its appearance. 

Allover I was happy with my take-out experience and I would try dining in their restaurant or ordering take-out for an event. I'll just have to get a copy of their menu, since they don't have a website."}
{"text":"CHEAP sushi. This is a tiny take out joint with three tables for dine in... But Be prepared to be eating with people waiting in line right at your table if you choose to stay. The workers here are always eating when preparing your food... And they're not shy to do it right infront of you. It can be a bit nasty if you can't stomach it. 

FOOD QUALITY:
Mediocre sushi but because it's so cheap, it makes it taste a bit better. I recommend ordering their specialty rolls - they're huge! You'll get a good bang for your buck for the moon river roll, and any of the spicy rolls. Not the best cuts of sushi (nor the freshest,), and not the best in variety but for price, it's a decent place for a mid-week take out dinner. 

SERVICE:
Hit or miss. It depends on which girl you get who takes your order. I've only encountered one nice girl... All the others were rude and bitchy. They'll get the job done, but don't expect a pleasant smile when you ask for extra soy sauce. They never give you enough."}
{"text":"Go-to spot to get a quick fix to satisfy sushi cravings but not in the mood to splurge too much money on it. You get what you pay for, but the portions are huge. Can get busy during dinner rush hours, so call ahead to get your order in.

Tip: Upgrade California Roll to Dynamite Roll for a small cost when you get the Sushi bong special. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is always on my mind when I'm around North York because I truly believe it's a hidden gem.  The restaurant is tiny and mostly does take out order, but can still accommodate 10 people at a time.  I usually get the Sushi Bong Special for takeout.  I call them and the order is usually ready within 10 minutes unless they are super busy.  This is a Korean ran restaurant meaning there will be a dab of wasabi in the sushi (which is how sushi is normally served in Japan).  If you don't like wasabi in your sushi, just let them know not to put it in your sushi and to put it on the side instead.  

Sushi Bong Special ($9.50) - 2 pieces of tilapia sushi, 3 pieces of salmon sushi, 4 pieces of salmon maki roll and 8 pieces of special California roll (salmon, avocado, imitation crab meat, fish roe, egg, cucumber).  

Other items I recommend:

Dynamite roll ($6.42) - Shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, fish roe
Spider Roll ($10.60) - Fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, fish roe
Hardrock & roll ($7.88) - BBQ eel, fish roe with avocado on the top

The portions are huge for the price and you will definitely be full.  Some might find it difficult to eat a piece of maki in one bite because the rolls have so much filling.  Fish variety is limited but the quality is very fresh."}
{"text":"The sushi bong special is so so so worth it. You get so many pieces of sushi for such a small price. The maki rolls are huge and the fish to rice ratio is good so you get your money's worth. You'll definitely be full for a small cost. I have yet to try the specialty rolls but I will definitely go back. The cuts of fish are good but once in a while I'll get a piece that isn't the best. Overall they offer fresh tasting sushi and all at a good price."}
{"text":"You get a good amount of sushi for the price! Their beef teriyaki is delicious. Their sashimi is fresh. Other than the fact that the place is tiny and only has like 2 tables-not the greatest dine in spot, its a great place. Rumour has it they are opening a second place but not sure where?? Order ahead of time for quicker pickup"}
{"text":"Very good place for some quick takeout sushi.  Not exactly THE best sushi,  but for the price you get quite a bit and the prices are huge."}
{"text":"The rolls are huge, the price is great for the portion sizes and they surprisingly have so many options! No place to sit inside, so it's primarily a take out sushi place.
Wish they had a veggie combo though but I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Impressive sushi at a great price. The maki rolls are very large and the rice to filling ratio is perfect. I'm amazed by how reasonably priced this restaurant is for generous portions and high quality maki rolls. 
If this place was closer to home, I would be here a few times a week."}
{"text":"This is definitely my to-go place when I'm craving for light meal. Favourite order is dynamite roll. Huge 8 piece sushi, which only cost 6.99! In general, their ingredients are quite fresh and you can't beat this price in Toronto with this decent quality of the food .  Not a fancy sushi place, it is small and lots of take-out customer. I never get disappointed when I come to this place."}

{"text":"Quaint little store nestled away in the corner of the Shops at Yonge plaza. There are only 3 tables and a maximum seating capacity of 10 - they mainly cater to takeout business. The staff here are Korean and the waitress was very polite during my visit.

I was attracted to come here because of the enormous maki rolls that I've seen from fellow Yelpers' photos and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. However, I found that the rolls weren't wrapped very tightly and fell apart easily when picked up. Overall, the quality was pretty standard - nothing special and exactly what you would expect for what you're paying.

This store is located way too far from where I live to offset any gas prices but if I lived closer by, I could see myself frequenting here for quick and affordable takeout!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Around 130pm. Place is quite busy with walk-in orders. Only 3 tables so don't plan on staying (mostly takeout). 

Self-serve water and canned pop. We ordered some veggie rolls, miso soup and veg tempura. The rolls were too big for my liking but the seaweed paper was yummy (no fish taste) and the sesame seeds in the rice were delish. Avocado was very fresh as well. I did not like the veg tempura, batter wasnt my style. 

There appears to be limited parking and the business takes only debit and cash. 
We were stopping in (from Missisauga). The prices were not much better than our local place which is much fancier and has better tempura (yam only option) with neater rolls. I wouldn't go back, mostly because there are better options for similar prices."}
{"text":"Like the Yonge and Finch location, this location is also primarily meant as a take out restaurant, with very limited seating inside (I think there was only 2 tables). The price here is very cheap, and the quantity is good, however the quality of the rolls and fish is just average. For the chirashi bowl, the variety of fish provided is very average (there was the usual tuna, salmon, crab meat, etc. nothing fancy).

I would recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap quick place to have some sushi, and aren't too picky on the quality and type of sashimi you are getting."}
{"text":"korean-run close to yonge-finch.
they're very quick, and the portions are huge and quite tasty - especially the dynamite roll.

the fish isn't always that fresh and not seasoned properly, so i'd avoid the sushi/sashimi and stick with the rolls.

but very good value.  my main criticism is the owner's wife - sometimes she yells uncontrollably and it's not clear who she's yelling at - the customer or the sushi chefs or perhaps she needs psychological evaluation."}
{"text":"Really did not enjoy this place! Horrible experience. Sushi was not fresh and service was poor!"}
{"text":"I recently went here and got the special for $12. THE PORTIONS WERE HUGE! It was a great value for all the sushi you're getting, I highly recommend this place if you're ordering takeout sushi. Not so much for dine in because there is limited seating, but other than that it's a great place to get high quality sushi for cheap in North York! ^_^"}
{"text":"Frequently order from this place and it is also a good bang for your buck!
Portions are huge, the biggest rolls I have ever seen, and the quality ain't bad either.

Usually, just call in and they will make your order in 15-20 minutes for pick up.
They also have small tables, maybe 4 of them, for sit-in customers.  When you sit in, the tea is self serve, and their wasabi is home made.

For their prices, I'd say this is one of my favourite sushi places.

Recommendations: Dynamite Roll is byfar their most popular roll.  We usually order the Rainbow Roll though for variety."}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki wasn't that great. That is my only complaint. 

Our usual sushi place is so far from us, and we have been in the market for a closer sushi restaurant where we can order in from. And we have found it! Value is unbelievable. They roast their sesame seeds which just gives each maki a nice touch. 

Warning: their special rolls are unbelievably large. Consider one order of theirs as 2 anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Sushi lacked variety in combos but quality was okay. It was a little on the drier side and had wasabi in most sushi with fish"}
{"text":"Been coming to Sushi Bong for a few years now and they are usually my go to place for basic sushi rolls. I've dined here once but really this place is designed for quick, cheap, decent takeout. So in other words besides the one time I've been coming here mostly for takeout. My usual order consists of mostly cooked rolls such as Dynamite, Spider and sometimes the Spicy tuna or Salmon Roll. I would skip the Sashimi as I believe raw food should be eaten as fresh as possible but if people insist it's the quality of an AYCE sushi restaurant like KAKA for a pretty decent price. As previous posts has mention the rolls are huge and extremely filling so they are perfect if you are looking for fillers or something to settle down the cravings. The staff are somewhat friendly, but I would advise making too much chit chat as the place is usually swamped with takeout orders. Usually I come here as they are the best bang for your bucks for rolls to supplement Sashimi that I usually pick up elsewhere. In short they are excellent if you are looking for something quick, decent and cheap but I would personally skip the Sashimi.

Will I repeat? Yes for takeout only though with a few exceptions mentioned above."}
{"text":"I must agree with other Yelpers regarding the freshness of their fish; not the greatest.
I'm going to give Sushi Bong 3 stars for quality and 5 stars for value.
I got the Bong Special. Quantity was there,  but quality was lacking.
Hey, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The place is basically takeout only. If you're planning to eat in the restaurant be prepared to get no service. Totally expected in such a small space. But that doesn't matter because the dynamite roll is just absolutely amazing! It's huge and only around $7!!! 

The service is really fast; I usually wait less than 5 minutes for my roll. The only time I've waited longer was when my friend ordered the chicken teriyaki. According to him it didn't taste all that amazing either. 

If you're planning to go, go for takeout and get the dynamite roll! Avoid the non-sushi dishes!"}
{"text":"Got takeout from here on a Saturday, around 7:15 pm. I was not in a rush and closeby, so wanted to see how fast they made the sushi by ordering on the spot. Got the Sushi Bong's Special and it was done in less than 5 mins. The location is mainly a takeout place, with room for 3 or so pairs (there was 1 sitting down at the time, with other tables all holding takeout). Parking was not a challenge and I managed to find a spot on the surface level. 

First impression - wow everything is huge (sushi, california roll, salmon roll). Also packed with ingredients rather than mainly rice and seaweed. I liked the rolls better than the sushi as the sashimi was not the absolute freshest (still decent nonetheless). Nice serving of wasabi and ginger as well. At $12 tax in, the value is quite good, with 17 pieces total across the rolls and sushi. If you're looking for quantity over quality, this is the place!"}
{"text":"4/5

Was craving sushi today and saw that it had pretty good reviews on yelp and one of my friends recommended this place as well. It's a tiny store but seems like its more for take out anyways. Probably could only seat 10-14 people max. 
I ordered the philadelphia roll. The cashier was patient when I was making my decision. The roll was pretty good and came fast. Large in size and even had avocado on top (most places i've been to don't put avocado on top). Only con was that there wasn't much salmon inside the roll itself. It was mostly cucumber. 
My coworkers later ordered the unagi roll and the moon river. Same thing: there was little unagi inside. Other than that, service was great, food was filling and worth the price. 
Will probably return to try the rice bowls."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and it used to be my go-to sushi takeout place! Their prices are great considering the quantity, but I'm sad to say that the quality has gone down quite a bit in recent years. The sushi rolls are not as neat and tightly rolled as before. I usually order their chirashi and I have noticed that the sashimi portions are smaller and they so not give you as many pieces compared to before. Also, I have had tuna sashimi in my chirashi that looked a bit strange and I decided that it was not a good idea to eat it. After a few disappointing takeout experiences, I don't think I will be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times since I started working around the area, and I definitely have to say this place gives you a bang for your buck! The rolls are large and have great rice to ingredient proportions. One set of rolls is definitely more than enough to keep me going through the day. Their chirashi sushi ($11.25) is also quite good with an assortment of white tuna, red snapper, salmon, sweet egg, and imitation crab meat served on a platter of rice.

I definitely believe it is more of a \"take out\" place as there are limited seats in the store. In the warm weather, I like to order take out and bring it to a park bench nearby to eat!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years
Best sushi quality, good portions and really good prices . The only non ayce sushi place I go to and literally CRAVE. 
Their spicy salmon roll is to die for. 
& their dynamite is famous lol huge roll

Their spicy mayo literally completes my life i cant live without it. 

Exact same feedback for the other location. Service is great also, theyre very friendly."}
{"text":"Great value for money. The rolls are ginormous! Got the spider roll (softshell crab), hard rock nroll (bbq eel) and a seaweed salad. Came out to just under $25.

The spider roll was super legit. You could see in each piece of sushi that there were two crab legs along the length of the roll. And you can actually taste the crab meat. (I don't think I'd order it again, cause the crab taste was maybe too authentic for me - which is probably a good thing, but just not my preference!).

Hard rock nroll was delicious. Love the bbq eel and avocado on top. Seaweed salad was also nice but a bit too saucy for my liking.

Would love to try the dynamite roll, sushi bong special, and some of the other rolls next time!

Girl at the cash is not the friendliest, but most people do takeout here anyway."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Sushi Bong despite hearing all about their delicious sushi rolls.  Their original location is at Yonge and Finch.  This location in Thornhill is their second location.  It's located where the World on Yonge Complex is (also where the original Love Me Sweet is).

When we walked in, we were the only dine-in customers.  They only have two tables for dine-in as the majority of their orders are all take-outs.

We ordered the classic Dynamite Roll and an order of Gyoza.  I was really looking forward to trying their sushi rolls since I had heard so much about it.

The Dynamite Roll had fried shrimp and fish, avocado, cucumber, fish roe, and egg.

The Dynamite Roll appeared like a big fuzzy caterpillar!  The rice surrounding the roll was topped with crispy tempura batter bits.  The taste was fine but I wasn't a huge fan of this.  The sushi roll was too big to fit into my mouth to eat properly and the crispy bits were too crispy.  XD  I was disappointed to say the least.

The Gyoza came with six pieces of Japanese style fried vegetable dumplings.  The Gyoza was also not very good.  The batter was too thick.

We surveyed the prices of their large party trays and thought that their prices were very reasonable and cheap for large orders.  Maybe someday I'll try them out again.  With all the surrounding positive feedback on them, I'm willing to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Quickly dropped by one time as I was craving sushi and this place definitely did not disappoint. Ordered takeout and got the Dynamite roll. It was huge, affordable and great quality sushi. And my order came out so fast. Definitely a must try for sushi places. S"}
{"text":"Excellent place for sushi takeout. Their fish is fresh, and their rolls are generously portioned. The place is located in a small strip mall area just 7-10 minute walk south of Yonge and Finch and is a small place. It has 3 tables for dine-in, but majority of the time the people who come in and out are those picking up takeout orders. They cater and you can order over the phone if you'd like takeout. Their prices are extremely affordable (under $5 if you want, or under $10 unless you're getting the bigger platters which would be great for parties) so as a student, I AM A FAN. :) 

Not for sushi snobs or those looking for a good sit-down restaurant experience, but good for takeout or a cheap and quick bite between activities."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the city. 

Talk about value. The rolls are comically HUGE! The pieces end up so big they almost can't be eaten in one bite. 

The recipes aren't eccentric but the quality and value are unmatched. 

Definitely one of the hidden gems in the city."}
{"text":"I live right above this restaurant and have been coming here for 3 years :). In fact, I even live on the same floor as the owner!   

Needless to say,  their sushi aren't authentic, but it's super delicious and the maki are huge.  Not a great spot for dine-in, but it's great for take out.  

Personally, the udon noodle combo and spicy tuna maki is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"My brother introduced me to this place about 5 years ago and we don't go there enough only because the seating is small.  I always eat the dynamite and spider rolls they are so good.  Staff is friendly and is always my go to place for take out sushi!"}
{"text":"Always seen pictures on instagram about sushi bong and since I was in the area... I had to make a pit stop to see what the rave was all about.

When people say sushi here is cheap.. I can definitely vouch the price is good!!!! They have this sashimi special where it's 18 pieces for less than 10 dollars. Their rolls are huge and are priced very fairly.  We had their spider roll and I think that was around 10 and then their spicy salmon which was around 5. We also tried a dragon roll and that was delicious as well.

The restaurant itself is very small and there isn't really room to sit and eat cause people tend to just grab and go. I sat near the chefs as I was waiting and  their practise of cleaning the cutting board after every cut of fish made me comfortable in knowing their sanitary  (esp when working with raw items). 

Will be returning. But make sure you have cash or debit card on you because that's all they take!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for TAKE OUT. I have eaten here once, and it was really crammed. There is always a line up for pick up, so it's best if you call in ahead and place your order. The sushi is quite fresh, and I've never had any problems with it. The rolls are huge, and well priced. 

I can't say it's the best sushi I've have had in Toronto, but for a take out joint you get really good value. 

They do take debit, but always prefer cash!"}
{"text":"Came to Sushi Bong because I live in the area. The venue is very small, they only have three tables. I was lucky to be seated at the very last table available. I ordered Hae Dup Bap and a small party tray. The Hae Dup Bap was very good. They were very generous on the diced raw fish. However, the steamed white rice was a little too hard for me. The majority of the party tray were maki  (I believed there were only 5 or 6 peices of sashimi, which was very disappointing). The maki were poorly made. The rice was falling apart, which effect the presentation of the party tray. Overall, my experience at Sushi Bong was average. Considering their price is on the cheaper side, they are actually giving you decent quality food. I would come again, but I'll try to avoid ordering maki or nigiri."}
{"text":"Rolls are huge and for a great price. Their dynamite roll and spider roll are the size my arm. Even their spicy salmon roll is bigger than most, and they use whole pieces of salmon instead of shredded up goo. 

But keep in mind this isn't a Japanese sushi place. It's a Korean one, so doesn't taste like your traditional Japanese sushi."}
{"text":"We came here after stumbling upon it.  We were heading somewhere else and ended up here.  I recognised it from Yelp, so we stopped by to pick up some food.  I've seen all the reviews on Yelp and how everyone comments on the huge rolls.

We weren't hungry as we were going out to dinner later on, so we only ordered the Bong Special and the smallest sashimi order.  We got the food to go and went home.  The food was all really lovely and fresh, especially the sashimi.  But the rolls are nothing as large as what people have been saying.  They were pretty standard sized to me.  Still the value was good for the price paid.   

Not somewhere I would drive especially to go to but I would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"So I was craving sushi earlier this evening and I remembered reading about sushi bong on yelp. And this location was more closer to me than the other sushi bong. The place is super small and it's more for take out than actually dining in. Although there are two small tables to dine in, my bf and I decided to sit in anyway. We ended up ordering the sushi bong special and the dynamite roll. We placed our order to the server and I swear five minutes after, we got our food! I was so shocked because they were also doing a lot of takeout orders. And I assumed we would have to wait maybe 15-20 minutes. 

The rolls were huge which will definitely fill you up. I find there was an even amount of rice and filling inside. They really don't skimp out on their ingredients. The sashimi tasted fresh, good quality and the rolls were great, it'll definitely satisfy your craving. I have no complaints, they're fast, and also the prices are very decent imo. Great value for what you get. Our bill was just under $20! 

I can predict myself coming back here again, it's seriously a great place!"}
{"text":"The fastest take-out place.
Probably the best bang for your buck sushi. The sushi is still fresh and the portions are insane. A small combo (23$ tax in) will feed 2-3 people and the medium (48$ tax in) will feed 4+. 
I have eaten at the restaurant and there is little to no service. I honestly don't think they are marketing as a dine-in as both locations are small and offer limited seating.

This location offers free parking.

Cash (prefered) or Debit only (fee)"}
{"text":"Used to come here often until last night, boyfriend and I got food poisoning from their food. Fish was definitely not fresh and my stomach has not been feeling well for the last 12 hours...never again."}
{"text":"was introduced to this place by my bro. if i need a quick sushi fix on the way downtown or coming back up ill usually stop by this place because its awesome.

ive heard mixed reviews about their sashimi but i cant comment on that because ive only ever gotten rolls.. and let me tell u they do not disappoint!

the rolls are huge with tons of filling as opposed to places that make rolls with tons of rice and totally gimp out on filling.  they are VERY busy during weekdays so u might hve to wait (prepare yourself).

not a good place to dine in ... i would recommend take-out (they literally have like 2 tables) 

Amazing rolls for a great price (1 spider roll and 1 dynamite roll come to just under $20 but thy are so big that 2 rolls fill up a box)"}
{"text":"Sushi place uptown with minimal sit down area so expect to order for takeout. Since Sushi Bong is located within a residential complex, parking for visitors isn't readily available in the roundabout area so expect to pull one of those moves where you have a friend in the car while you're inside ordering. 

Food here is great and you'll get your bang for the buck with change to spare. In addition, it's next to lots of other food options in the area so my friend and I had a restaurant hopping situ going on. I regret nothing."}
{"text":"Very solid. Big portions. Fresh tasting. Best Cali roll ever with minimal rice. Constant traffic in a tiny tiny location. 
It's a keeper.

Update, went today and the fish had a nasty taste, it wasn't good or fresh."}
{"text":"Have always been here and they have always been good.  Our favorite is the dynamite roll and rainbow roll.  They are really fast too.  The place is small for a sit down meal so we always take out.

You may need to ask for more wasabi since their wasabi isn't that strong.

This location is better than the sushi bong north of Yonge and Steeles because they don't skimp on the fish!"}
{"text":"Dirt cheap sushi that are large in size? Come here. That's what Sushi Bong is about basically.

If you are hungry and want TAKE OUT sushi only then come here. Humongous dynamite rolls that are $7 something (you just really need to order one roll as it seems like it's three).

Deducting one star as sometimes I don't want to have to eat it in the car before a movie at Empress Walk... more than 3 seats would be nice!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for 13 years. The service is friendly, food is delicious with huge portions, and the price is great. The Dynamite Roll and Unagi Donburi are both my top items. Bring cash, and compliment the chef (Tony)."}
{"text":"Great, fresh .. made right in front of you as you order and quick! Can't really eat there, since it is tiny and intended for takeout . Hugely popular with the rich Asian students, so you will often see insane cars outside on the street. Free car show!"}
{"text":"For this price, I'd say it's the best sushi take-out place in the region. I love how I can pick my sushi within 5minutes whenever I'm in a hurry. My personal favourite is dynamite roll."}
{"text":"Tried the spider roll today and it taste great too! But dynamite roll is definitely the best! The crab meat in the roll is real crab meat not crab sticks but I think it would taste even better with crab sticks...

The girl/cashier is really nice. This is only the third time I visited this place but she already remember that I really love their dynamite ;)"}
{"text":"This is a very small store off of Yonge St. just south of Finch. It's almost hidden if you don't look for the street. Only 10 ppl can sit down at a time. Most people order take out. It was Saturday when we arrived around 6pm so it was fairly early. We decided to dine it. This is a CASH ONLY place. The sushi was okay.  The sushi/sashimi platter came with super duper big pieces of maki rolls that almost didn't fit into our mouths. The taste wasn't bad but I wasn't totally like totally wow. The Salmon Nigiri was thinly sliced. The pieces were small. I've had better sushi. Also want to mention you need to pay for parking. It's a circle driveway so space is very limited. There is no washroom in the store you would have to go to Metro supermarket behind the building."}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is definitely one of the best toronto sushi takeout place. A combination of the Price, quality and Size it gives is among of the better deals you will find around North York. 

I've ordered from this place multiple times, and most of the sushi has been great of those times. This time i ordered a Unagi Special, a Spicy Salmon Roll, and a Salmon Skin Roll. 

Of the three rolls the best was the Spicy Salmon roll. which was crunchy and had the right amount of spicy as well salmon was good in it. 

The Unagi Special, although it is large and has a very good price, it is not on eof the finer points simply because it doesn't really have much unagi taste to it. as it is surrounded by a lot of ingredients and you can't really taste the unagi unless you break it apart. Aside from that the roll itself does taste good in the combination.

The Salmon Skin roll is average, it is not bad though again can't really taste the salmon skin.

Overall this is a great place for Take out only, and it has a fair price for the amount that you get. so i would definetely go again, and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! quick, convenient take out that fills you up. the specialty rolls are really big (some times a bit too big to fit in one bite) lots of selection, friendly service. love this place for take out!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING CENTRAL - we ordered 4 party trays from here. Rolls seemed warm and avocado was brown. Every person (7 of us!!!) who ate the sushi was violently ill afterwards! I called them to let them know in case anyone else who had ordered was sick because of it and they REFUSED to take responsibility. This wasn't even a case of wanting my money back, I wanted them to say \"I'm so sorry\" and the \"manager\" refused to do so. BEWARE. DO NOT EAT HERE. Bad sushi and even worse service..."}
{"text":"Great value and fish is always fresh from the high volume they serve. I come here all the time with my wife to eat in but mostly take out since there are only 3 tables. Bring cash, they have debit but really discourage you to use it."}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is basically a meth lab for sushi.  

As a lowly meth(sushi) addict, you use your burner phone to tell your dealer(hostess) how much you want to pickup.  

She quickly relays this info to the drug lords (sushi chefs) in the back, who are synthesizing their meth to perfection.  They ensure that their product is of the purest grade so that their clients get nice, clean hits and become addicted, coming back for more.  It takes about 10 minutes for the drug lords to synthesize your order.

Your dealer is fairly considerate, packaging your meth with a pipe (chopsticks), and needles (soya sauce).

You get home and you smoke, inhale, and inject(eat) the meth(sushi) all within the span of 20 minutes.  It's the best and cheapest meth you've ever had, and you feel nothing but euphoria.  The feeling slowly fades and you pass out (food coma).

You wake up the next morning with your house trashed.  There's random people passed out on your living room floor, shards of glass everywhere, and your carpet is stained with puke and blood.  

Today being a new day, you pay no mind, as you make your way to Sushi Bong, anticipating your next hit."}

{"text":"I've been going to sushi bong ever since it opened many years ago.
The most common comment about their sushi, they are huge. For the price you pay and the quantity you get, sushi bong is well worth it. The service isn't that great but the food overlooks it. This is more of a takeout restaurant so best you call in ahead of time to order. If you are expecting restaurant quality service, you won't get this here. The only negative about this place is that I'm  finding the sushi a little heavy on the MSG, but i still go here anyways.

Recommended sushi rolls: Dynamite, Spider, Moon river, Philadelphia, Hard Rock & Roll, ranging from $7-$10."}
{"text":"Not the finest sushi money can buy but pretty good value for the price. Always satisfies the sushi craving without breaking the bank. A household favourite for non cooking nights. Love that this location is more North than the original."}
{"text":"My first time having sushi in North York. It was great! It was a Friday night, so they were super busy with takeout orders. Yet, within 5 minutes after we ordered (to sit in), they had our food ready. Reasonable fish-to-rice ratio; very tasty.

Prices are very reasonable.

Free hot tea is dispensed off the side, which is nice. A true hole-in-the-wall sushi experience!"}
{"text":"The dynamite roll was really good and the size was really big compared to other sushi places I've been to. For the price (around $7.90) it's really good, I just wish the store had enough room for people to sit at."}
{"text":"They're rolls are pretty good value however after buying the bong sushi special (18) I feel that the pcs were wayyyyy too insufficiently half-assed cut. Like the red snapper barely was a pc. Sort of a small triangle...like what? and the white tuna were in round lil slices? I have never seen this before it was weird. The salmon skin wasn't fully cut off well enough and made biting apart a bit difficult. So won't be buying the sashimi again just because of that fiasco. Will def suggest sticking to the rolls. The price is great and the value is great too. But quality is questionable."}
{"text":"After so long, it's lovely that I finally got to try Sushi Bong. Not the original location, but that's fine. The rolls are still huge. I kinda didn't have a point of comparison when we ordered for five people, so we over-ordered. 

I believe we ordered the large sushi and sashimi platter. It came to about $80 after tax. We picked it up, and got six square boxes of takeout sushi. One of them was sashimi. Two of them were nigiri. Three of them were maki. People were not kidding when they said the maki rolls are huge. Their California rolls are larger than many specialty rolls I've seen/had. The nigiri is pretty impressive as well. The fish to rice ratio is outstanding. The ingredients are also very fresh. My only qualm is that I didn't know what kinds of rolls I was eating before I put them in my mouth. After a while, they all start to taste the same."}
{"text":"Normally good...dunno why?????  Soup was good not sAlty. Unagi perfect, dynamite roll good..."}
{"text":"Best price in the city!
On Sundays, the restaurant opens at 3 pm and closes at 11 pm. There would be a quite long lineup around the dinner time. Most people live in the nearby buildings would pick up a quick dinner.
A great value for a good meal."}
{"text":"Really delicious and high quality sushi!!
I'm a big fan of their Dynamite, Spider and California rolls. The prices are great too, definitately less expensive than other places.
Sushi bong has stopped me from going to All you can eat sushi, due to its freshness and amazing taste. The portion of each roll is very big too (Stuffed too). I recommend this place for takeout, or a casual spot to eat with friends or on your own as there is limited space for seating."}
{"text":"Take Sushi Bong for what it is.  It's a small little family run sushi place who probably does 80% takeout.  They do inexpensive sushi that's, well, inexpensive.  The sushi selection is pretty small, but that do give you a fair bit for under $10.  At under $10 and $6 respectively, their Dynamite and Spider rolls are also a pretty good deal.  

If you are looking for super fresh high end fish or quality over quantity, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge portion for sure but not the best quality. If you care about the quality and how does it looks, maybe not a good choice. This is better for to go place since only 3 small tables are able to sit down and the place is really tiny, Eating inside was not a good idea because this place is busy for to go orders. Doors beside dining table kept opening and closing because of customers to pick you their phone orders. I was not able to avoid the speaking of the waitress's same phone answering on the phone over and over. I would recommend this place for to go only."}
{"text":"Checked out Sushi Bong tonight. AMAZING!!! Huge specialty rolls, super fresh sashimi and all well priced. Made fast and made well, something you don't find that often. We will definitely be picking up from Sushi Bong again very soon!"}
{"text":"Came in and the lights r way too low. 

We had to sit at the table that they leave their take out bags. The light was in the way if you have to sit on the bench. I had to move the light to get into my seat.

Their sushi is always very fresh, but they do lack variety. Their rolls are always so big, so you get your money's worth.Ww"}
{"text":"I am converted! 

I've been craving sushi all day and been pushing to go to AYCE where I can eat my feelings away. However, I am warned and reminded that every time I do go to AYCE, I get only one round and then I'm full to the max. Not worth it for a dinner price, especially!! 

Sushi bong is in the shops at Yonge plaza, where it's easy to find parking. The restaurant is tiny and mostly meant for take out because it can only fit like 5 people comfortably. That's cool, take out is what I'm down for. Ordered 4 rolls and it came to about $28 + a 10% tip. Not bad! If I had done AYCE, it would've been at least $50-60 for 2 people. The lady there was super nice and smiley- always good to have friendly service around hangry people. 

When I got the rolls, I opened them and my jaw immediately hit the floor. They were HUGE. I had to sneak a spicy salmon one before hitting the road. You know a sushi roll is good when it tastes bomb dot com without any soy sauce or wasabi garnish. My stomach was so pleased with me tonight. 

The sushi and fish are amazing quality, freshest of the fresh. I will definitely go here to satisfy all my sushi needs from now on, especially knowing that it will be easy on my wallet."}
{"text":"What happens when you accidentally order takeout from the wrong location? You end up in a busy area with minimal parking, crazy drivers and become 100% done with everything and everyone.

I've been sick this whole week. Sick, to the point where my nostrils are congested, my lungs hurt from breathing, my vision is blurry, my capillary refills.. let's just say they aren't refilling like they are supposed to be. Let's just say, a bartender at a cheap and dingy club refills my drink faster than my capillary refills do their job in my fingertips. You get how sick I am, right? Of course I'm not going to be good. Of course, of COUUUURSE I do not eat plain congee, overdose on nyquil and curl up in a burrito blanket. Of course I don't.

I want sushi. & I want good sushi. 
I call up my favourite sushi place for alacarte, place an order for spicy salmon rolls (yes, I'm horrible), california rolls and some other massive roll they had on their menu. Halfway through driving there, I curse loudly, causing us to swerve on steeles. \"DID I ORDER FROM THE RIGHT PLACE?\" I cry out as the realization begins to sink in. Oh hell na, this sick mess ain't about to dive anywhere near yonge and finch during the busy rush hour. HELL NAH. F***. 

As we pass the cars near the area, I am praying.. just praying that I don't see reckless drivers. I ain't about to kill somebody while I'm on death row here. Yonge and steeles to yonge and sheppard SERIOUSLY gives me anxiety. Thank goodness we make it there and OH MY GOODNESS.. there's a free parking spot in that tiny roundabout for ONCE IN MY LIFE. YASSSSSS!! We're in and out of sushi bong in less than 1 minute, which seriously gives me joy. The store is small, workers are just as nice as the other one, and I am pleased to have my box of sushi resting on my dying body's lap. 

Later when I go home to eat it, or more so, devour it.. I start to realize the quality is definitely not the same as the other sushi bong @ shops on yonge. While the rolls are just as big, the quality cannot compare. I even saw some browning on top of the salmon sashimi on the moon river roll.. and the pieces certainly were not as thick or fatty as the other one. I LIKE FAT FISH AND I CANNOT LIE. To be honest though, the sushi was still better than 90% of other places so it deserves a 3 star.

My stomach was unsettling afterwards but I think it was mostly me being my sick self. With a hint of \"you're not supposed to eat sushi when you're sick, dumbo\" 

Anyways, I definitely will be sticking to the other sushi bong from now on (unless my idiot self decides to call the wrong one again, which I can assure you, will happen)

Sorry for the long and over-detailed review. Someone please tell my 2am sick self to go to sleep."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls!!! I tried their dynamite rolls and it was absolutely one of the best I've had. Prices are great for the amount of sushi rolls you get and they are huge!! Great place for take-out or when you are craving for some great sushi. Service is pretty fast and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"If you're craving sushi and looking for a sushi fix, look no more, because Sushi Bong is a great place for that. The combination of quality, quantity, and value has this place as one of the top takeout options. 

We went with the medium party tray for takeout which included 67 pieces for $43. There's plenty of sushi, sashimi, and rolls, and we were all stuffed after! Don't expect the quality to be amazing, but considering what you're paying for, the quality is more than adequate. The fish is definitely somewhat fresh, although the knife work of the slices of sashimi and sushi leave a lot more to be desired. The rolls are massive and I didn't encounter the rolls falling apart as other Yelpers have said. My favourite roll was their unagi special roll which had an extremely generous amount of eel in the roll. While I did enjoy their sushi and sashimi I think it's best to stick with the rolls here.

What I found interesting was that I could taste gochujang in the spicy salmon roll and one of the other rolls. You could tell as the rolls were slightly dark red in colour. I guess this is their Sriracha-based substitute for the spiciness. It's the first time I've had gochujang in sushi. It works but I'm not sure if I like it as much as a Sriracha based hot sauce. 

I'm not sure if I'll get takeout again as this place is out of my way but if I'm in the area and I'm craving sushi, I'm definitely coming here for a cheap sushi fix."}
{"text":"Used to be much better when Mr. Bong was there to serve us his handmade rolls. Now the rolls shrunk in size. I still come back from time to time, love their spider roll and many other rolls."}

Spider Roll  (soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, egg) 11.95
12 huge pieces. Good tempura flavour but the batter is thicker than the meat."}
{"text":"I work just up the street and have tried many lunch places in the area for the past 7 years. This place has by far the worse service. Calling it \"service\" would do the word  dishonour.

The old lady who works as the wait staff seems to hate her customers. I saw she treat my colleague and other people in the restaurant like idiots. Let me be specific, the tea & water there is self serve but we didn't know that since it was our first time here. So she literally scolded us and points to the tea dispenser and cup area. I don't remember the exact words she used so I don't want to put words in her mouth. But yeah, we were scolded, talked down to like children.

The place would receive 5 stars if it weren't for the absolutely rude service. The only reason she gets to work there is probably because she owns the place.

Otherwise as others have mentioned, the place is efficient and very cheap!"}
{"text":"This place has huge portion sizes at really affordable prices. The spider roll is my favourite $10.60 for 8 gigantic rolls! The small sashimi plate was only $20.35 for 36 pieces! Salmon roll and tuna rolls were $4.99 each w 8 pieces also. The owner was really friendly and attentive. This location being closer and more convenient for me is where I'll go whenever I'm craving sushi from now on!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The portions are huge, and the price is cheap.  Quality of fish is good, but there is not much variety - most of the sushi rolls tasted similar (but still very delicious).  There is not much seating in the restaurant since I think it was designed to be primarily a take-out place.  Also, the party platters are really popular."}
{"text":"First Impressions
=============
Small cozy sushi bar, friendly staff and seems clean. I decided to order some take out after seeing all the good reviews.


Food
====
I ordered a sushi dinner set.  The fish felt \"dried out\" like it has been sitting a round for too long.  The rice was either old or undercooked.  It was actually slightly hard/dried, and did not have much flavour at all.


Would I come back?
===============
It could be that they were having an off day so...maybe? But, I'd rather spend money on places I know are consistently good.

If I'm ever in a situation where it was the only place open and I was craving sushi badly, I may give it one more shot."}
{"text":"Massive rolls at a cheap price! Sushi bong opened up a new location in this plaza. This location is much better since you can park. The new location is still very tiny (about three tables if I remember correctly). 

It is a cozy little place run by Koreans. Service is quick and friendly. Just for the heads up, they only accept cash or debit. Most items on the menu are under $10. I just love their portions as many sushi places don't give you a lot. 

I don't have any complaints about this place. I wish it was closer to downtown so that I could go more often. But whenever I am in this area, I will remember to stop by here. 

Overall, if you want to stuff yourself with rolls, sushi, or sashimi, you can do it here at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Very large rolls, a lot of fish on sushi. We like this place, but depends on your luck - sometimes the rolls are 80% cucumber with a hint of whatever fish they were supposed to be. But if you are more lucky, you get really tasty - and more or less ingredient balanced rolls. 
Sushi - no complaints."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this place and I cannot stop raving about it.  

This place is so AWESOME... wish they had a location closer to  dt Markham because I would go there every day!!!   

Their sushi is great, big and amazing...  and the price is rite! Don't need to pay an arm and leg for good sushi!!!!  

Place is tiny (Maximum 8 spots)...  so better to get takeout but sitting in with 2 to 4 people is ok though it can be cold during the winter with the door being constanly opened all the time due to many walk ins for takeout.  

Their water and tea is self served and their tea is really good.

After you done eating, can take a browse to their new mall and go grocery shopping in the supermarket below and check out the new shops.

The only minus for this was because my friend and I wanted to try something new but not everything was available on the menu.. kind of bummer because we were looking fwd to it. Hopefully they will have it in the summer"}

Just don't ask them to warm it up for you. I get the medium party tray like ALL the time. The dynamite roll is dynamite! Magnifico."}
{"text":"I had been a fan of Sushi Bong for a number of years for their cheap, filling (i.e huge) and decent sushi. On a food quality perspective this place is good take out place. It is extremely rare for me to rate an establishment two star simply based on a service alone - however time after time visiting this establishment, I decided to say enough is enough ..

Let's just say that this is your typical  'successful' take out place that makes you think that your patronage does not seem to worth their slightest effort to provide you with a decent service.  Let me elaborate

Take out service: Even if you had called in advance and make your order - this place would not prepare your order until you arrive and pay (cash only of course). I don't get this. Why? The whole idea of a take-out service is that you save time and get your food in time when you come in instead of waiting in line?

Nickle & Diming: Every time you placed your order, let's say you order 2 sushi rolls - they would ask if you don't mind them being placed in one container (to save them few cents of container cost...). They would also seem to provide 2 packet of soy sauce per Sushi roll order (total 3 teaspoon of soy sauce per sushi roll) that is if they don't mistaken your 2 orders being 1 if they're in the same container. Quick search on Amazon, the soy sauce packet retails for 4 cents per packet.

Personally, I don't consider Sushi Bong to be that cheap and that good. On price point wise, almost all sushi joint charges sub $10 for a roll. On food quality wise, it is just a decent (there are worse / better joints).  I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"You can't order ahead! This location has terrible service where you order in advance and when you arrive they make you wait. I didn't order in advance to wait! Unless you want to wait in line, don't order here."}
{"text":"Located in World On Yonge plaza.

Sushi Bong is a Small place with limited seating, I consider this more of a take out place.
For food we had their Sushi Bong Special
Large variety of pieces of sushi pieces, el presented.
prices are very reasonable for the amount you get and size of sushi.

I must say for a small place the quality is superb, almost like a hidden gem for sushi in the 905."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?

It gets to the point, cuts out the overly indulgent decor, no wait staff, barely a table to dine-in, very small overhead costs.  

Presentation is absent but they make up for it in quick and speedy delivery of food, bundled with overly large rolls stuffed with raw salmon or tuna, or tempura, whatever most sushi lovers desire.

Did I mention very cheap too?  

Sushi Bong is all about value with decent taste to satisfy one's craving for sushi without the bullshit. :)"}
{"text":"edit: Feb 10, 2017 - it appears their Sushi Bong Special went up in price to $12 after tax.

This is not fine Japanese/Korean cuisine by any stretch of the imagination. I am giving them 5 stars for their sheer value. Now, I'm not implying that it's a laundering business, but I wonder how they can offer such great value.  If it's your first time, definitely try their Sushi Bong special. At the time of writing this review, it costs $10.75 after tax, take a look at the Sushi Bong Special pictures on Yelp as many people had posted it already.  Do note, their california roll is not the typical kind. It also contains some raw salmon and egg, which makes is deliciously different. As others had noted, they don't add too much rice to their sushi. Every piece is fresh and tasty. I still can't get over how much quantity and quality you get for that price.

I also tried their dynamite roll, wasn't a fan... but I'll let that go. I doubt I'll try it again. I will try their softshell crab roll in the future. Other than that, I think I'll only order their Sushi Bong special going forward.

Parking is minimal at the front of the plaza. Underground parking is available."}
{"text":"This is one of the few times where i was more than satisfied with the quantity but there was just something off... The rolls are obviously HUGE, as you can see from the pictures - the specialty maki like spider, dragon, dynamite - all those are the size on a small elephant. The regular maki is a bit smaller and i actually liked them more. 

The big rolls are just too damn big...my mouth is quite capable but i can imagine that there are a bunch of people who just wouldn't be able to fit that humongous thing thing theirs...

I got take out and the order was done within 20 min, i got the spider, red dynamite, sushi bong special (5 piece sushi with salmon and white tuna, salmon maki and California. I usually really don't like the California roll because i think it's a waste of space - no raw fish, but this one had salmon!! With a lot of stuffing and very little rice, lots of carrots and avocado. Good job! Also got the shrimp tempura special which comes with 8 pieces, the spicy salmon and spicy white tuna. I think that was it... I ended up getting two spider rolls somehow... ANASTASIYA 1 SUSHI BONG 0!

Service was good, nothing special. They understand me and speak English, and don't rush so I was happeh. 

Unlike some other reviewers unlucky experience, my rolls were NOT stuffed with rice. It was actually so little rice in the dynamite and the spider rolls that i had to figure out a way to pick them up without the stuffing falling out. 

STOP PUTTING SESAME SEEDS ALL OVER EVERYTHING!!! i thought the roll was deep fried because i was covered in this stuff!!! I like sesame but come on, if i wanted to eat it in bulk, i would go to Costco. STOP!

And the rice was a little weird... a little on the grocery-store-sushi side, kinda of sweet and a little harder than i would like. 

The place itself is very small, i wouldn't eat in here - there are maybe 10-14 seats in total? Just get take out. or eat outside of Pizza Nova on the metal tables and enjoy the view of North Korea(town)"}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel the Liberty Suites, decided to walk around the shopping plaza behind the hotel, and came upon Sushi Bong. I was in the mood for sushi, so I stopped inside.

The place is tiny, and I think they cater to more takeout than anything else. However, I dined there, and it was comfortable. I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, a rainbow roll, a california roll, and some seafood udon soup. I was really hungry, but it was a LOT more food than I expected it to be. The soup was really good, and filling. Nice and hot, perfect for a cold winter day. The sushi was decent. They keep the menu relatively simply, and they do it well, at a very reasonable price.

I will definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"OK I'm gonna rate this place 5 stars but with a caveat. This place is amazing for what it is - price, quantity and speed. 

This place is my go to pickup sushi place. The quantity is very good for rolls and sushi. Sometimes there is a lot of rice but it's not to the detriment of the quantity of the other ingredients so the worst case is that you have to leave some rice on the side to get the perfect ratio. In terms of quality, the sushi is always very good and fresh - likely due to the volume that this hole in the wall puts out. 

If you're thinking about eating in - don't. Order about 10mins ahead and take out."}
{"text":"5 star for quantity and price 
1 star for quality of salmon sashimi.  I just don't understand why they don't cut the salmon without hanging skin. Takes so much of the taste. 
3.5 for the rolls and some other stuff."}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is great for takeout sushi. Their chefs are efficient and the rolls are packed with ingredients. They lost stars because I have some doubts about their fish. Quite a few times the raw fish did not look sashimi grade. The taste was definitely off. I know they put in great vegetables like avocados and cucumbers. But honestly each time I eat it I feel like I'm at risk for food poisoning.

If you must eat the sashimi then you should pick ones that are like plain salmon sushi or sashimi. I got the rainbow roll before (that is like a California roll and has pieces of fish on top) and it was all bits and ends of fish. The fish used were definitely the leftovers because they were all different shapes and sizes, it wasn't very fresh at all. At least you get a good deal for the price!"}
{"text":"Ordered four rolls in total, the whole process took under ten minutes. Meanwhile I had to keep an eye on my car parking outside - tight space.
Nothing special, but for that price you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to sit down and eat, this is definitely not the place. It's definitely a very economical take our sushi place. They have 2 table which seats 2 and 4 but it's whoever comes first takes the seats. 

We came here on a friday night for dinner, the place looks empty with only one table, luckily we were able to get a table to sit at. The menu is very limited but with plenty of choices already. You place your order at the cashier and pay first. The 5 mins which I was waiting in line, the amount of take out orders which they had was incredible. I could never imagine a place like this would serve so many take out orders. The phone just kept ringing to place orders, people kept coming in to buy and pick up.

I was worried in the beginning if small Japanese places like this were actually worth a try, but after seeing how much business they have, definitely have my hopes up.

We ordered a spider roll and a hardroll rock. It was around a 10mins wait for the food. If you wanted hot tea or water it's self-serve. When we got our food, I was so suprised by the size of the rolls!! IT WAS HUGE!! The spider roll was so long,  the whole roll could not be fitted across the container but cut in half. They sure did not cheap out of the soft shell crab, every bite had tons of crab in it. The hardroll rock was just average.

I would definitely come back again if I'm looking for deluxe rolls for the cost of $10 approx. and large portion sizes. I wonder if they're sashimi would be as good since variety is limited for what they serve.

**P.S - cash and debit ONLY"}
{"text":"$10 for a box of 18 pieces of sashimi? Sold!

This place is a hidden gem in the Willowdale area and I am so glad that my friend took us here to get some cheap grub. Everything is well priced and the sushi rolls looked huge.

The place is super tiny and incredibly cramped. There are only 3 tables for dine-in...good luck. Take-out is definitely the way to go. They are super fast and efficient but the service can be questionable. It was very busy when we went so the some what rude and go go go rush attitude was reasonable. 

I only tried the Bong's sashimi and the avocado roll while my friends got the Sushi Special A and the Bong's sashimi too.

The avocado roll was standard but the box of sashimi was quite satisfying. I've had better sashimi but with a price like that, you'll be pleased because I certainly was!

This place has definitely become one of my go-to spots for sushi at a great price."}
{"text":"Reasonable price... big portion, good taste and fresh.  This place is going to be my number one choice for takeout or even quick eat-in for a sushi fix...

There are two small dining tables for customers who want to eat in.  I was lucky I got a table two times when I was there.

I'm already planning my next sushi meal there"}
{"text":"There are subtle Korean touches to this Korean run sushi place that take me back to the motherland. First, kleenex instead of napkins. Actually, kleenex over a roll of toilet paper on the table means this is a class joint. In Korea, tissue is tissue. Everything is \"hyoo gee\". If it sops up goop on your mouth, it's good enough. 

Second water is \"self\". In Korea \"self\" or \"sell puh\" means simply self serve. Grab a cup. Pour your own water.

Me and my date shared the small sushi platter. $23 with tax. Adequate. I guess this place is better for take out. Service is a little brusque. No a/c in the place."}
{"text":"Speed Read:
1) Reasonable price for sushi and roll (Great value)
2) Super small dine-in (fit about 10 people total)
3) Short review - I order only 1 roll as a snack.
4) Typical sushi like salmon, tuna, etc.  Don't expect to see premium sushi here.

I stopped by sushi bong for a snack.
Ordered a spider roll (soft shell crab roll). (~$12)

I like the fact the roll is packed with ingredient and very light on rice.  
Individually the ingredient are fresh and the combined flavor is amazing. 
The roll portion size is huge for a single person.

I will definitely return for more takeout later."}
{"text":"So I finally decided to venture out here on a weekday night for cheap cheap sushi. We tried a fair share of the GTA's Japanese restaurants and prefer to stick to sushi a la carte for portion control.  

For ambience, there are only about 4 tables of two and it sort of feels like your Asian grandma's tea room (if you have ever been around one) and so if you are looking for a romantic date night, this might not cut the cake.  This sushi restaurant is a cheap eat and so, you should treat it as such.  Most customers went for the take-out route (CASH ONLY, gosh that is so inconvenient nowadays).  Or else, like a well-practiced act, you might get a scowl face from the female japanese cashier who then, out of frustration, subsequently hands you a debit machine in a covert fashion (I witnessed this many times).  

We ordered spicy salmon, dragon roll (shrimp tempura) and spider roll. The sushi rolls are GINORMOUS, as in 3 inches in diameter (and that might be an understatement).  The sushi chefs have definitely adopted the Texan way of making sushi. 

The spicy salmon everyone raves about is honestly siracha chili sauce packed with salmon sashimi (it was 4.99). Cheap, creative but definitely didn't quite hit the spot and didn't taste the way spicy salmon is done elsewhere in the city. 

The Spider roll was unconventional in that it contained egg, avocado, cucumber, salmon(?), and soft shell crab.  Suffice to say, it was STUFFED and could be considered a meal for two in itself. The dragon roll was equally large. Each maki took two huge jawfuls to chew. As other reviewers had mentioned, if you are eating here, you must prefer quantity over quality. 

I might come back for a cheap bite if I'm in the Yonge/Sheppard/Finch area. I would only recommend it to someone who just feels like filling up on sushi on a dime."}
{"text":"I been to this place couple of times. My favourite sushi is dynamite it was one of the best sushi I had. It kind of got me into sushi after. The place is very nice organized tight clean. The major draw back of the place is the price they make good sushi but u get 8 peaces for like 10 bucks that is what I hated about this place . you can go all you can eat sushi and pay 15 buck and go crazy. But I guess it is a quality place over quantity. If they lower the price of this place I probably will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Everything is reasonably priced. The dynamite roll is probably the best bang for your buck. The tempura is fresh. The sashimi tends to have mostly salmon, but the quality is very good so i don't mind. Sometimes the rolls are cut too big to fit in your mouth.

Edit: Sashimi quality is more hit or miss nowadays, and they seem to be increasing the amount of rice they put on their rolls."}
{"text":"my most recent visit (2016 early March)..... Again I feel the impact the the weakened dollar and pain of price inflation 
So far sushi Bong hasn't jacked up the price, But the restaurant gotta cut costs..... So

Chirashi now has less fish.
Not only did it have fewer pieces of salmon, but some other sashimi also turned from pieces to strips...
It did have one more piece of egg tho..... I guess that's its way of compensation. 
I'm sad :("}
{"text":"For the value you really can't complain.  It was very well priced.  Not my favourite place for sushi and sashimi, but if you want a good or cheap price this is your gold mine!  The food is prepared quickly, neatly, nicely, and the staff is friendly.  For this price I guess they should get 5 stars, but because I prefer better / fresher sashimi I really can't see myself coming back.  For take out it is excellent value and decent food.  You can only do take out here, as there is limited (or next to no) seating."}
{"text":"Ordered take out today. Sushi bong special and hard rock and roll. It was WAY too much food for one person. Loved the hard rock and roll, very delicious. The prices are just right and the staff are very welcoming. Next time I gotta remember just to order one roll or the bong special, each individually are a big portion on its own. I wish they were a bigger restaurant, I'd love to eat there but there's very few tables. 
For the quality, price and speed, I think this place is a great take out joint."}
{"text":"Every so often I get a craving for Sushi Bong, and I've always loved the food, but I just wanted to note that there was a girl working there this weekend who seemed so on edge. She was sort of yelling at our group the whole time we were there. She kept walking back and forth throughout the shop, pushing past customers and yelling EXCUSE ME in our ears. There was a free table that had some delivery items on it, so I asked if we could sit there, and without answering my question, she yelled \"FOR HERE OR TO GO?\" leaving me quite taken aback. Consequently we felt quite unwelcome and ended up eating in a park nearby. 

Nonetheless, I can usually count on Sushi Bong to have great Dynamite or Spicy Salmon rolls. I love coming here in the summer, as it is a cheaper alternative to AYCE restaurants."}
{"text":"Go-to sushi spot before movies nearby at Empress.
This hole-in-the-wall has thriving for 6+ years and for good reason.

There isn't a lot of seating but regulars know that the take-out is what people come here for. 
They're generous with the fish. The rolls are huge. They made three rolls for us in 5 minutes on Christmas Day.

Ordered the dynamite, rainbow & hard rock and enjoyed every last bite!"}
{"text":"Ya not a whole lot to say except this place is a one and done for me.

as in I tried it and I enjoyed as best I could and can cross it off my list. I didn't even know this place existed except for a former colleague who found this place and recommended it to me for a quick lunch.

it has a number of things wrong with it being a dine in restaurant.

first of all its the size of a closet. not the fancy walk in dream closet, but the type you put a janitors supplies in.

second off, for things like tea or water you have to take your Styrofoam cup to a water cooler. Now, usually this means that the food will be amazing. after all if you're running lean on atmosphere and space you must be investing in good fish and have a really good menu. nope. theres like maybe 5 things on the menu and the sushi was definitely forgettable.

lots of rice, no consistency in cuts, and just didn't taste good at all. I lied about how good it tasted to my colleague as they picked it but I can't like to you guys. it was bad. not worth take out either. there's tons of other options around.

Heck go to the Galleria across the way and get something there."}
{"text":"Small place with only 3 tables, mainly for take out. Menu exactly the same as the other location. Recommend all of their rolls! Good price and big portion."}
{"text":"Been coming here for several months now and so far so good. The store is tiny and most of their customers phone in and pick-up. Definitely don't come here for the service but delicious food and good price. (Ordered the Small party combo)"}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck. We order the Sushi Bong Special every time, which is more than enough to feed one person. Dynamite rolls are also tasty, to note. 

Storefront is tiny so it's best to call in and order. We usually call ahead before we leave the house. It's always ready by the time we get there (15 minutes~) and you're in and out of the store in minutes. 

Portions are hefty and they're generous with their salmon. There's even salmon in their California rolls! Honestly a hidden gem. I hope they never raise their prices."}
{"text":"Fastest take out ever.

I went in, ordered my food, and in 5 minutes, they had it ready for us.  I was quite pleased. :)"}
{"text":"The offering at Sushi Bong can be summed up in a few words: fresh fish, low prices, minimum services, mostly for take out and minimum seating.  

We ordered a small sashimi platter and a maki roll (Hard Rock and Roll).  Both were super fresh.  The sashimi was sliced thick and big, so there was a good texture for chewing.  The maki roll was rolled big like Vancouver style.  In fact, Sushi Bong reminds me of a budgeted sushi joint named Momo Sushi House in Vancouver. 

Sushi Bong's menu said \"fresh fish at low price\".  It excels at what it aims to be.  The only thing is I wish the small sashimi platter (36 pieces) has more variety of fish.

Lastly, there are some cooked noodle/udon and rice entrees on menu, should you feel like hot food."}
{"text":"My favourite is the dynamite roll from here. The rolls are huge, filled with ingredients and well priced. I've been a regular here for years now. The only thing I don't like is that the cooked fish is sometimes bitter tasting. Not sure what that's about... But other than that, I do love this place."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap sushi! Mainly a take out restaurants since they have very limited seating. They offer great rolls, fresh sushi and sashimi, party trays, chirashi, sashimi salad and warm dishes like teriyaki and tempura. Everything is good and orders come out quickly. They food is consistent and you get a lot for what you pay. My fave our their rolls!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bong?  More like Sushi Da Bomb.  Sorry that was terrible, just couldn't help myself. 

Net net, this is a family operated hole in the wall north of mid-town and south of the burbs.   This time around, hole in the wall is almost a literal translation.   It is a tiny, tiny place with three tables however, one table is reserved to put takeout orders on so don't try and sit there because you will promptly be told to move. 

I am giving it 5 stars because it is some of (maybe the best?) cheaper sushi I have ever had in TO.  Their rice is amazing, fish fresh, their fish:rice is as it should be and their service is so abrupt and rude that is it somewhat amusing and makes for good lunch time conversation if you are stuck for discussion topics with your companion. 

I would absolutely eat here next time I am anywhere close to this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I live in the same complex and this is always my go to. Super fast service and friendly service! Take to go to be safe due to lack of seating in house!"}
{"text":"I have 2 words for this place \"BEST DEAL\"! I've gone to the location in North York and this one as well and both of them are great.  I got the Sushi Bong Special the past weekend, and they are very generous with their portion.  It came with 8 pieces of California roll, 4 piece salmon maki, and 5 piece sushi all for only $9.50.  The fish was very fresh and fatty as I had expected (just like the North York location).  Their California rolls for this special are a bit different, they have egg, fish roe, and a slither of salmon in it as well as the normal avocado, cucumber and imitation crab meat (I think the extras are definitely a value add).  

In terms of seating, there's 4 tables (but one of them is just for waiting).  It was a bit cold while eating because you would feel the wind breezing through as customers came into the restaurant to order. If you live near this restaurant it might be better to order take out due to the limited amount of space and it can get really cold since you are sitting right next to the door.

The service here is relatively fast as you would expect since their aren't many table.  However, don't expect too much service as it is catered more towards take outs.  You will have to pour your own tea, but that's no biggie. Overall,  I am very satisfied with the value at this place and will be coming back when my sushi craving sneaks up on me again."}
{"text":"The rolls were so big that it was definitely a challenge to fit an entire piece in your mouth. But that's what makes the rolls so awesome!  They were huge and delicious! I loved the hard Rock and roll, black dragon looked really cool, and the sushi bong special was a really good deal for the amount of sushi and sashimi you could get! Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"If your only going to accept cash or debit you should probably let your customers know before they dine or mention this somewhere on the menu."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem while dragging myself back to the hotel with little energy to go food searching too far. I must have passed this place a half dozen times without thinking much of it. All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover. This place serves great sushi at great value with quick and friendly service. It's amazing how fast the chef at this place churns out the orders! 

The restaurant is very small (seats about 10) therefore the majority of the customer flow is for take out orders (suggestion is to call in advance). Parking in front of the complex can get crowded but there is ample free underground parking available.  

Would I return? I already have a bunch of times :). This is pound for pound one of the best quality priced sushi i've had.

Tonight's order - Bong's Sashimi Platter with an avocado roll
Cost - a little under 15$
Big fan of the red dragon roll as well.

FYI - Cash or Debit only"}
{"text":"Price is right
Portion is big
Take out only
Cash or debit

Shared the Small Party Combo (Sushi & Sashimi) between my friend and I. $24 tax included. Soooooooooo filling! Great place if you're starving :)"}
{"text":"Location is small and better for take-out there are only a couple of tables for dine-in.

Sushi is average not amazing but I rather go to other places if I want something more authentic and has more space for dine-in."}
{"text":"Same formula, different results.

The prices were the same and the sizes seem to be the same too. However perhaps the chefs were not as experienced as the one south of Finch since the rolls seemed to be falling apart easily. The avocado was very hard in the bong special that I ordered. 

It was a great value regardless and the girl was a lot nicer than the one south of finch. Hopefully it will improve its quality after a couple more months. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is like a diamond from all those lump of coals! Probably the best a la carte ever! The quality and size of these bad boys are heavenly! The price for these suckers are crazy affordable! The spicy salmon is so good it literally melts and sesame seed with salmon with spicy.... oh my god done. The California roll is gigantic and freaking deeeelicious! Literally can order hundred of these!

The place is quite small which kind of socks.  However it is a takeout place so definitely git it and go! You'll definitely want to eat these so fast it's nuts. Their menu is also quite small but I am going to bet all or most of the items on the menu are bombbbb"}
{"text":"Readers: I recommend take-out only! And driver outside waiting! Parking is limited, call ahead to save time! Dynamite roll and Cali are our regulars off the menu. Spider roll is okay too but I don't like crab. Definitely more of a roll place than sashimi sushi. Good value and decent consistent quality. Don't expect a la carte quality. Perfect for rainy, lazy and/or do not want to cook nights."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I just came on an off day or what but compared to it's North York sister, this place is just okay.  Sushi Bong in Thornhill is a tiny little takeout place with 1-2 tables to sit (similar to its sister) and it is also a place for quick and comfort sushi.  They made our rolls in just 10 minutes and we ended up sitting in to eat.  

Overall, the sushi was just...okay.  I don't really know how to describe it other than the fact that I was very minimally satisfied.  I walked out full and that was really it.  

Definitely go to the one in North York..it's way better!"}
{"text":"If you want down and dirty, simple, nom-tastic sushi, this place is the place to go.  Know that you are by no means getting anything authentic or fancy but it is downright delicious.  If you're a Yasu & Miku-only kinda snob (don't get me wrong...I LOVE Yasu & Miku), then this place isn't for you.  

The sushi gets made really quickly but it is really quite tasty.  They did mess up our order but the chef was really quite apologetic and even gave us another complimentary california roll, which I really appreciated.  

I would definitely come back here.  This is definitely on my top list for comfort sushi's!"}
{"text":"Used to be somewhat descent , but the quality of food had gone down , I think the fish is not as fresh anymore !"}
{"text":"Good priced Sushi combo. This small restaurant is to-go only (there is only one small table though). Portions are humongous!! Taste okay. Cannot complain about the food.
The staff wasn't friendly though. They only take cash or debit, and charges customer the debit transaction fee, which was somewhat embarrassing for such a busy and successful business charging customers transaction fees. Regardless, I would still go and order sushi to take out."}
{"text":"Affordable sushi! If you're looking for quick take-out, wallet friendly and decent sushi, Sushi Bong is the place to be. 

We ordered their Sushi Bong special ($9.50) which had 4 salmon maki, 2 sushi and 8 pieces of stuffed California roll. I wasn't expected salmon in my California roll but it was a great addition! We also ordered their spider roll ($10.50) which was essentially the California roll but with warm soft shelled crab. It was HUGE (10 pieces). This roll satisfied my cravings and expectation but next time... I would avoid ordering combos/rolls that have the same California roll ingredients. It was a bit too much and repetitive. These two orders were way too much, we were stuffed for a bill that's $25 with change after tips and taxes! 

They mainly service take-outs but they do have 3 tables available for a sit down meal. Drinks are self-served! Overall would I come back? YES!"}
{"text":"I have gotten take out from this place twice now and for the price it is awesome. Quick service and pretty big generous portions for sushi. 
Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"The reviews are accurate. It's great value given portion size and what you pay. It's not high quality ingredients either. It is what it is. When you've got a fix for sushi but don't want to eat out, and you prioritize being full over high quality, then get sushi bong. 

It's a reliable take out joint for cheap sushi. 

3.5 stars out of 5.

{"text":"DISGUSTING PLACE. They SHOULD THANK ME FOR GETTING A SINGLE STAR. Let me being by saying this DIRTY. We sat at the 4 personal table and there were SPIDERS ON THE WALL. My friends and i arrived 40 minutes before close, (they close at 11, we got there at 10:20) the \"waitress\" rushed us by standing over us the second we got there. It took her 3 tries to get my TWO roll order right.... after our sushi came which was THROWN onto our table the \"waitress\" gave us approximately 7 minutes to eat the proceed to throw our bills on our table, she messed up by putting the wrong things on the wrong bills and refused to put them on the right bill. Since she only gave us SEVEN minutes to eat we didn't rush to pay the bills as soon as it hit the table due to the fact that we were STILL EATING... she interrupts our conversation to tell us \"you need to pay us now\" let me just say my jaw dropped. Ive been to HUNDREDS ON HUNDREDS OF restaurants in my life and i have NEEEEEVER in my life been treated like such trash. We then told the waitress and some little old lady that came out of no where that they were rushing us to the extreme and were extremely rude and had terrible customer service skill. They then all decided to YELL AT US. The sushi makers and the little old lady threw take out boxes at us. Not to mention they charge $0.50 for spicy mayo that you have to make yourself?! This place overall makes TERRIBLE sushi, the customer service is by far the worst i have ever seen in my life and the restaurant is disgustingly dirty. (And if its -10 degrees outside and you ask them to close the door that they have open for no apparent reason they wont do it) DO NOT BY ANY CIRCUMSTANCE EAT HERE. I would not come back even if it was the last restaurant left on earth."}
{"text":"Used to be a frequent patron throughout the last 4 years. Quality was always decent or good enough for its price but they have belly flopped. Was served stale tempura shrimp and fish that had discoloration due to it going bad. Worst of all it was on Canada day. 

Girl at the register had the worst bitter and apathetic attitude I've ever experienced and witnessed. She cut us off, assumed our order by finishing our sentences followed up with, anything else? She quite literally repeated that three times for the three items I ordered. Not only that, but her tone was agitated and short. Keep in mind there were only two customers ahead of us which placed single orders. Don't understand where the hostility comes from. 

Finally, when she calls for our order, I stick my hand out to receive our food but instead of handing it to me like a decent human being. She drops it at least 10-15cm onto the table. To the point where the boxes bounced and shifted slightly. 

I was dumbfounded. I shook my head, shamed her for being a shitty person. Shibal noma"}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is the opposite of those crazy fancy sushi places, but in the best way. Really friendly, affordable, generous and high quality. I usually get the Bong Sashimi and a couple of rolls. The spider roll is a giant thing, filled with tasty crunchy soft-shell crab :)  Seating is a little limited, but not as limited as the parking in the roundabout. For takeout sushi, it's the only place I ever go anymore :)"}
{"text":"I am a long time fan of the original Sushi Bong at Yonge and Finch area and decided to give this new location a try. The place has 3 tables totalling 10 seats so it's main thing is really take out.

I found the food to be consistent with the original location and actually probably marginally better. You really can't go wrong here - great value and fast service."}
{"text":"Awesome place for reasonably priced, fresh, hand-rolled sushi. Their portions are huge and prices and extremely affordable. Small dining area of three or four tables, but this place is mainly a take-out place with lots of traffic in and out of the small shop from walk-in customers.

I went based on review I read on Yelp and they definitely lived up to my expectations!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love sushi bong. I get my sushi fix at a reasonable price and the quality is consistent. Super happy they opened up one at steeles so you can actually Park down and pick it up without worrying about a parking ticket."}
{"text":"This place is so great for take out sushi. I had the spicy salmon roll and avocado roll. Salmon was super fresh. My only issue was the sesame seeds, felt like they overpowered the rolls but I guess that's just a personal preference. I think next time I go I will just have to ask for no sesame seeds. I wouldn't recommend dining in - the place is pretty run down tbh. But nonetheless, I am definitely coming back! I'm so happy I came across this place."}
{"text":"Good value. Enough said. Big portions. Turnover is large so the fish keeps fresh. Only 2 or 3 tables to dine in and even then its a tight fit. Mainly for takeout only. Had free parking unknown to many - it's a little complicated but the restaurant has photos of how to get to the parking."}

Pros:
Best bang for your buck sushi 

Cons:
Can get very busy (Dining in not recommended)

How I have not reviewed this place is beyond me.  What can I say that would be any different from all the previous reviews of this place?  Sushi Bong is by far and away the best bang for your buck sushi restaurant in Toronto.  It will never be the best, but getting pretty good sushi at an excellent price is never a bad thing.

Sushi Bong is a tiny little place located in a condo complex. There are a few seats, but with the amount of traffic coming in and out getting take out, it will never be a good experience to dine in.  That is about the only thing I can say is bad about this place.  Everything else is terrific!!

Just looking at the menu and the prices should amaze you.  The Bong special is amazing.  You get 5 pieces of sushi, an 8 piece California roll and 4 pieces of salmon maki all for under $10.  The Bong's sashimi is rediculous.  18 pieces of sashimi for $10.40!!! I have not found a place that offers that amount for anything under $15.  If you're a large group those sushi combos are easily $10-30 cheaper than any other sushi place.  You would expect the sushi to be some of the worst for that price point but that is not the case here.  Sushi Bong in my opinion is pretty good.  

I've gone here a ton of times and have never been disappointed.  Dinner for 2 here is about $20-$30.  Sushi Bong will definitely remain my go to place for cheap good sushi.  It's not a place you bring a date or go for a celebration, but for anything else it's an excellent option."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. 

We ordered takeout from here for lunch on a Friday afternoon, 

We ordered the Sushi Bong's Special which was delicious! - I loved that each piece of sushi had a very thin layer of rice. 
We also ordered the spicy salmon roll, which I was slightly disappointed to find out that it was simply a crispy salmon roll with sriracha sauce inside, instead of the spicy mayo drizzled on top lake lots of other sushi restaurants serve. 

Other than that, it was a great experience, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow big sushi!! Very delicious.. i love their rolls.. worth every penny i paid for.. the packed it with so much stuff and their rice is not thick just right"}
{"text":"I've been to the Sushi Bong location in North York a long time ago. However, the parking there was inconvenient so I never went back. I was happy to see that they opened up a more convenient location!

Their sushi is reasonably priced for the portion they gave. I didn't have lunch that day when I visited Sushi Bong and I was about to order 2 dishes. Good thing I only ordered one dish - Sushi Bong's Special ($9.50) - because it was a large portion! Everything tasted fresh.

The next time I go there, I'm going to try their other rolls."}
{"text":"This place serves quantity sushi for a very reasonable price although whenever i go there, I always see the cashier being abused by the manager. It is not professional to yell in front of customers at your employee ( for literally not doing anything ) 

if you're planning on getting the dynamite roll, don't bring your girlfriend because the thing is just massive and makes a mess but also amazing


The food is amazing but the employees deserve to be treated the way employees are legally treated in Canada, not abused. Will come back here again but I'm hoping to not see the employee at the cash always yelled at ( I understand it might be due to culture reasons but they need to adjust to how they talk to each other in front of Canadians like me because it's scary and unprofessional)"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi after a nice Sunday work out. Affordable prices and consistent quality. Fast and efficient sushi take out place. Even with all the non stop phone orders my sushi dinner was ready in less than 5 minutes and I was on my way home. Ordered the dynamite roll and spicy salmon maki. The dynamite roll is super filling and delicious! Just the right amount of heat in the salmon roll. Overall, a good sushi craving fix!"}
{"text":"I prefer this Sushi Bong over the original location. +1 star for the parking lot and location- much more spacious and less hectic. They take only cash/ debit and I'm so glad they don't charge a fee to use debit. The original location charges me a fee every single time I use debit! 

The ingredients are fresher and the portions are more consistent here (though sometimes I still do get tiny sushi and rolls, rare, but it does happen). The staff are friendly and the wait time for take out is normally very short. 

You do get what you pay for, so don't expect the most high quality fish. What you can expect are fresh ingredients, fair portions, quick service and well-priced takeout sushi."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, would give 3.5.
I don't usually enjoy fish too much so I got the tempura sweet potato and California roll.
My boyfriend got the unagi don. We ordered dumplings to share. Sushi portions were great, unagi don is quite tiny.
Food was prompt, overall quality was good. Value was also great, $10 can easily fill me.
I do feel I'd strongly prefer to do take out next time, since a lot of stuff were in styrofoam. I know they mostly do takeaway business but I think if you were to let diners eat there in a restaurant setting where food is served to you, I expect a lil more for the presentation and service."}
{"text":"I've been to the other location in North York before and decided to come try this one (as it is closer to me, approx. 2 blocks apart).

I prefer this location over the other one as it is more accessible. This Sushi Bong location is similarly located underneath large residential high rises but there is a huge underground parking garage for this complex as there is a small mall. The mall includes an Asian supermarket, \"Seasons\" as well as a bunch of small lottery/food court shops inside.

There is not much seating (3 tables, seats 10 people in total) but the food is great at an amazing value.

I ordered the sushi bong special (4 pc salmon maki, 8 pc California roll and 5 pc sushi)... where else can you find massive California rolls that include tamago and salmon sashimi inside?! yum!)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time recently and was impressed how busy they were!

I ordered the small sushi & sashimi tray for two people and there was enough to take some home for later.

We sat down and ate, as we had parked our car at Finch Station and headed downtown for the day. On our way up, decided to try Sushi Bong as many of my friends love this place for value and boy, were they right!

I don't recommend sitting down, as basically you get no service..but sometimes if you live far and are hungry..there is no other choice!

I will definitely come back again to try different rolls, as they were massive. I also noticed that takeout times is incredibly fast, as they are constantly preparing rolls of sushi.

The parking in this area is quite inconvenient but is expected along Yonge St."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sushi Bong's Special for $10.95, and it was a pretty good deal! The staff were friendly, and they're also pretty quick for take out. They put salmon in their HUGE California rolls.. blessed. They're also pretty lenient about changing the types of fishes for your order without charging you extra. Only complaint I have is the minimal parking spots available, and their debit card machine is EXTREMELY SLOW/doesn't always work. Other than that, I like this place since their quality is decent for the price you're paying."}
{"text":"The portions here are great. If you're feeling rolls, this is where to come. You'd definitely be satisfied with a single roll order, and could probably split one roll between two people if you're just looking for a snack or a light meal. This place is definitely more of a takeout place, because there's only one /actual/ table. The service is poor, with dismissive and short workers, but the food itself makes me want to come back. The rolls are a bit on the pricey side, but worth it considering the quantity.

A note about parking: Unfortunately, the parking here is a bit troublesome unless you live in the apartments nearby. You have to park in the lanes for entering/exiting the roundabout, and the plaza itself is difficult to turn into."}
{"text":"I came here by recommendation of a friend of mine.  She said the prices and portions were good here, and boy was she right.  Since I'm a diner on a budget (a.k.a. a student), cheap prices and big portion sizes are what's important for me.  I've only had the Sushi Bong special and, my-oh-my, was it great.  Lots of food for only $10!"}
{"text":"the service is so bad. we take 3 order and then pick up.When we go home find the stuff made the wrong roll and we call back. they told us to bring the whole box back to ckeck instead apologize"}
{"text":"I wish this place had a sit down area but probably how they keep the cost and taste up. I dream of this place in my dreams. Enough said."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little place, and I actually live right across from it, so I go there often. You can't really go there for sit-downs since they literally only has 2-3 tables for about 6 people to sit at, and it gets a little tight in there during rush hours when people who ordered take-out will wait around the door right next to the tables. 

So I usually order take-out. Their sushi is pretty decent, the price is pretty awesome. I usually take the Sashimi order and their Dynamite roll is my favourite. The fish isn't \"melt-in-your-mouth\" kind of awesome-fresh, but it's fresh enough to be good. 

Their speed is usually pretty good, unless you go in during rushs-hours. Then you might have to wait around for a good 5 minutes for the people before you to order up, and then another 10 for your order to be done. I'd suggest phoning them for pick-up, which is what I usually do. It's a lot faster that way. 

All that said, I go there pretty regularly, and the portions and taste is always pretty good :)."}
{"text":"Its steady eddie rolls. I would avoid their dinners as they are not quite competent with a couple dishes i ordered. For rolls they are decent so go nuts. If you want to do it Korean style, pay .50 more and get the cho -jang, korean hot sauce for your rolls."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about sushi bong and finally got a chance to try it at Steeles and Yonge. 
There's only 1 or 2 tables in the restaurant. It's more of a take out spot than dining in. 
That being said, I ordered a spicy sushi roll and a teriyaki chicken rice. 
The size of the rolls are definitely larger than normal for the price. 
The teriyaki chicken was pretty average and the sauce was a little thick and gooey for my liking.
My friends ordered the chirashi and it was definitely a better order than the teriyaki chicken.
Overall, if you're in the area and looking to curb your sushi fix, try this place out. But if you're looking for exceptional sushi, keep looking."}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Bong many times but never got a chance to write a review until now. 

Location:
This small sushi roll place is situated in the small roundabout under all the condos on Northtown way. The problem with this location is that there are VERY limited parking spots (6-8 in total) as you really have to compete with other shops that are nearby. After all, this is more of a take-out place and people don't expect you to stay there for a long time. It really isn't comfortable to sit there to eat anyway. 

Service: 
Since it is primarily a take-out sushi place, they make the orders VERY fast. I usually call ahead to order the stuff I want and when I get there I can just pay, grab and go all within 10 minutes. There are usually 2-3 men behind the counters to work on the sushi and they are all like robots who can probably make every roll without fault. There is usually a young female girl at the cashier to take phone orders, but the girls are ALWAYS so mean. I have been eating at Sushi Bong for a long time now and have seen many girls working there and all of them just don't seem happy. They always sound angry or frustrated on the phone. But since I don't sit in to eat, all I really care about is the food. But when their service on the phone isn't so friendly, it really makes me hesitant to order. I mean, why do I have to support the restaurant when the staff there isn't friendly?

Food:
I always get the Rainbow maki roll ($7.88) and the spider roll ($10.60). They are VERY big. When sliced, eat piece is bigger than what my mouth can handle. It is quite filling if you finish a maki roll by yourself. I love how there is a LOT of filling in the rolls!! I have tried their sashimi and hwe dup bap before but they aren't as good compared to the rolls. The raw fish is cut way too small. Definitely not worth the money. 

This is the place to go if you are craving for some sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sleepy Sunday on a friends recommendation. It's okay for some cheap rolls, but I wouldn't deviate from salmon. The tuna is scary and has a strange texture."}
{"text":"I went here on a date because it was recommended to me by another person. Sadly that person was not properly informed, so I will try to amend that.
Cautionary tale: Do Not Eat Here. The place is small but it's also cold, especially in the winter time. I went here on a date: bad call. Too cold. 
The food came fast, and if I recall I ordered the dragon roll and dynamite, they were large but they did not hold together well, as were tasteless compared to other sushi places, but I only tried the two. 

I think I will probably give it another shot some time in the future..."}
{"text":"Great place ! The portions are awesome for the price. One of the only take out sushi spots I go to that is worth the money. Spider roll is massive and sushi bong special is my go to. Note: limited seating and there is more parking underground."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Bong. Mostly for the price and massive rolls. Yes I know it's full of rice but I don't really care cuz I'm super full after having one. 

I almost always order the dynamite roll ($6.42) - Shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, fish roe. Never disappoints just like the other location. Always fresh and the tempura is crunchy.  

Sushi Bong is located at Doncaster/Yonge where the new condos are and situated in a corner. My GPS was directing me to Glen Cameron/Yonge (a street north) which is incorrect. Good thing a friend had told me where it was. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place as many ppl have asked if I've been b4. I was most impressed w/ the size of the rolls...it was ENORMOUS :D The price isn't bad either! 

I believe parking is a problem...they say there's a parking garage somewhere but that is honestly a little myth.  PLUS theres hardly any seats in there... one table for 6 and another for 3. that's about it. You're better off ordering takeout & picking it up. But wow... great rolls esp the spider roll :D"}
{"text":"The prices here are very reasonable. Tons of parking underground. The restaurant is very tiny with only 3 tables so most people take out. I work close by so I go here often. The service is very friendly. If you eat in, you also get free tea. I recommend the avocado cucumber roll and Yam tempura roll. I didn't like the veggie roll as it is just filled with what seems like a pre-mixed coleslaw or salad. The rolls themselves are quite large as they put in a lot of filling. The only problem with this is that they tend to break apart very easily, making them hard to eat at times, especially if they are larger pieces. I come here 2-3x/month and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Sushi is delicious & affordable priced for the large portions. Beware chef makes large chunks of sushi's so be prepared to open your mouth wide to get a piece in. Was very upset that they gave me spoiled wasabi. It smelled fouly sour. Sad how they don't even make it but just need to refrigerate it. Wish they would have not given me any."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have quality sushi, at a cheap price, and are quick when ordering takeout. The fish quality is great and even though they have a smaller selection of rolls compared to other restaurants, they have most of the popular ones. All around a really great place to get sushi!"}
{"text":"Great for take out - but not meant as a dine in. 
Over all, there's high value at this place, and freshness. 
Where they fall short is on the technical side of the sushi itself."}
{"text":"Favourite hole in the wall for sushi! The prices are really affordable and the sushi is bomb. I think it's the rice that makes the world of a difference here. Their sushi rice is warm and vinegary to perfection. I came here 4 times last month. Lol don't judge"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for take out after work!!! They prepare the food very quick and it's delicious!!! Thumbs up for Dynamite Roll!!!! Suuper yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This is a take out place only, small and cozy.  A hidden gem for quality sushi, good portions for a good price.  I ordered the Small Party tray and it had a good amount of variety and service was really fast.  This place takes cash only.  You can order ahead of time by phone and pick your order up in a few minutes.  Do not expect to have a seat to sit down but if you are looking for take out at great value, this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Great value for decent quality fresh sushi and sashimi. Big portions and very reasonable prices. Even their rolls aren't too packed with rice, so a good rice to fish ratio. We've gotten take out several times from this place, consistent quality and ready when they say (so no waiting). We usually get the Bong's Sashimi with a few rolls. $10.40 for 18 pieces of sashimi is a very good price, a good mix of salmon, tuna, red snapper, white tuna and shrimp. No mackeral tho, which is my favourite. We have also ordered the Extra Large Party ($82.30). I didn't like that they only had small styrofoam containers and not big party platter containers, but it wasn't a big deal at the time. 

Operates best as a take out place. Very little seats. Bad area for parking. No shortage of customers though, with so many surrounding condos and houses."}
{"text":"Quick grab and go sushi. The sushis good portion too! Be careful on placing take out orders there are two locations closed by make sure you are on the right spot."}
{"text":"I was sold after reading reviews based on serving size, and the Bong didn't disappoint. I was not too hungry and had zero sushi cravings, yet my curiosity kicked in and decided to see if this was the new go-to joint as it's very close by. 
Called for take out: red dragon roll and spider roll ($20 cash). GIGANTIC rolls(3 bites per roll) and the standard sized square styrofoam had no room for even a fish egg!!!
My eyes became full at first glance but quickly disappointed after noticing the small serving of ginger and wasabi and 2 soy packets. Too late to go back as Yonge st. during rush hour limits convenience. Wasabi didn't have the eye watering factor and the taste of the sushi itself was very bland. Next time I'll request for spicy mayo. 
Again, I will come back as \"sushi is sushi\" for my 10yr old's appetite and I love the fact that you really do get the bang for your buck! A full meal for her along with leftovers when she's ready for another snack.
Hence more mommy time for me."}
{"text":"Been a few times. You get what you pay for. The sushi bong special is well worth it if you're hungry. I've also had the chicken teriyaki. 4/5 based on quality of food for cost which is very fair considering how expensive sushi places are now. I'd go back again and again. Sadly the price raised by about 11% since last year but I guess that's? what happens with our economy. Solid eat!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for cheap sushi! The portions are huge! I like coming here for take out as they only have 2 small tables for dine in. Whenever I want a no frills quick sushi fix this is my go to! I used to go to the Yonge and finch location but this one is closer also a lot easier to find parking here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for take out sushi! Always ready in 5 minutes, big portions and cheap prices!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever, their sushi are MASSIVE! very filling and worth it for the price. The location is far from where i live but it is worth it. Everything was so fresh and so good! The only bad part is the limited seating. I always get the small party tray and a extra roll like dynamite and it comes to about $30 and it was struggle to finish it cause it's so filling but so good so you just push yourself to finish it.

This will be my go to sushi place or other AYCE cause it's only worth it to eat here. Other sushi joints that are not AYCE are typical smaller and expensive and not filling"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a go-to spot for me whenever I need a quick sushi fix.  $11 all-in for something they call the Sushi Bong special.  You really can't go wrong with this deal.  You get a ginormous serving of rolls and a 4 pieces of sushi.  Yes they pack in the rice here but they also give you generous portions of fish.  I love that they add the wasabi into the sushi already!

The bonus for my recent outing here is that I went in at lunch and saw them receive their delivery of fish.  I saw the chefs inspect it and start using it right away.  For my meal.  Not too shabby if you ask me.

I wouldn't recommend dining in here though.  This location is tiny and every time someone opens the door to come into the restaurant, you're gonna get blasted with the cold/hot air from outside.  But for take out, this location is right on!

Happy eatings everyone!

{"text":"The value is ridiculously good with this place.

I only got the small sashimi platter which came to around $25 and change with tax and it comes with 36 pieces of nice thick pieces of sashimi.

The fish tasted fresh and and the portion was really generous. If I lived around this area, this would be my go-to for sushi takeout. I took a look at the menu and the party platters seem to be a great option for groups. I'd definitely want to go back and try some other items. 

The restaurant isn't much to see, it's tiny, you could maybe fit 4-5 people in there. You can sit down to eat but again, there are only 2 small booths, definitely more of a takeout place. It's clean however and we got our food within 5 minutes of ordering which was great. I expect it takes a bit more time for hot items or special rolls.

Price for quality is amazing, I can only judge this place for its sashimi because that's all I've tried so far. The service was quick and friendly enough. Cash or debit only. Parking is ok, it gets a bit full out front but the plaza has some underground parking if you can't find anything in the main plaza. 

I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area to try other items!"}
{"text":"If you want cheap rolls this is the place to go. I always get the dynamite roll.. Under $8 with tax I think.. All you need is one order and it will fill you up because of the size of it. Quick and efficient lunch for sure and you can even call ahead to place an order to avoid line ups and parking."}
{"text":"Average quality sushi place but with a really good price tag. If you want good sushi at a low price, here is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of money. For two people we ordered the small sushi plater and the sushi was not of good quality. There was no service so don't think tipping was even required. Don't eat here unless you want to waste money."}
{"text":"I suppose you can just
Cut up chunks of fish and call it Sashimi...
Toss fish onto rice and call it Nigiri...
Roll fish into, umm rolls and call it Maki...
Unfortunately, it is not good enough; not near enough.

To be very honest I was expecting a whole other level of sushi experience. Instead, the sashimi looked like trail ends and leftover chunks of scrap (untrimmed with the grey parts intact, and not sliced in 'sashimi fashion' but rather in actual chunks like what you'd feed your dog as scraps).  The nigiri and the rolls were no better.  At best 'bland', at worst 'criminal' for passing it off as sushi.

The worst offense was watching the cashier cut cucumbers and then handle the cash screen, money, people's cards, and then go back to cutting cucumbers WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS!  WTF??

I don't know how all of these great reviews keep popping up - hopefully this was a bad batch, but sorry guys you have to do better - if there is a next time I order a follow up review will appear as well.

Until then, I'm looking for better sushi....which should be very easy."}
{"text":"Super small and hidden little sushi shop in the heart of the Yonge and Finch area.. BUT awesome deals and oh so efficient service (people usually call in and order pick up, unless you want to wait for a long, long period of time). It might also be smarter to use cash as opposed to cc or debit, since their machine is hooked up to their land line, so whenever a call comes in (which is all the time), you'll have to pause and wait for them to finish their call.

The place is small and super busy,  but the service is efficient. Price is also very reasonable with regards to the quality and serving size. It is kind of tricky to park in the area since it's basically a round about outside the place, but if need be, there is underground parking available. There are a couple of tables; I'd say 3 max, but considering the number of people coming in and out for pick ups, it's not that comfortable of a sit in.

Considering the price factor, obviously you're not gonna get Guu style sushi where it's all gourmet and pageant worthy, but you do get better quality than what you paid for - food is still fresh, presentation might be a tad off but I mean it's not all over the place. The rolls are not dainty, but huge...

The place itself is small, but still neat and tidy; just literally packed with people all. the. time. So, make sure you call and if they don't pick up the first time, it's probably just that the girl's on the phone already.

If you're in the area and want a convenient and bang for your buck kind of sushi, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Sushi bong was incredible. Although they don't deliver which is unfortunate. The restaurant itself is extremely small and it's more of a takeout place. The green dragon roll was really great and the avocado was fresh. This sushi was high quality for sure. There's no doubt in my mind that I wouldn't go back here!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Value: 5/5
Atmosphere: 3/5 (must do take out)
Service: 5/5

Sushi is delicious and the takeout is insanely quick. They make your sushi in less time than it takes you to pay. Super small location with no real parking, so probably best suited for takeout, but I frequently go out of my way to get sushi from here.

I recommend the Dynamite roll (it's huge) and their $10 assorted sashimi option.

Also, I liked the vibe of this place. Very tightly packed and the staff working furiously to fulfill orders at shocking speed. Walls are decorated from floor to ceiling. This place feels like something out of a Miyazaki film. And yes I know, Miyazaki is Japanese and this place is run by Koreans, but I feel how I feel!"}
{"text":"I live in the building right across from this small gem. This place is really great and became really popular due to their famous \"Dynamite Roll\" which is given in huge portions (the size of one piece can barely fit in your mouth) in cheap prices.

Anyways, I have been eating here for almost 4 years now and I am never disappointed with their speed of service and quantity. Every time I order I get Dynamite Roll, Chirashi (which is essentially Sashimi on a bed of rice), Spider Roll, and Sushi Bong Special. Their sushi is not the BEST sushi but it is still very tasty and given in big portions. Their Dynamite Roll is huge and very cheap too! One word of suggestion however, there is very limited seating (the place is the equivalent to the size of a study room) and there is only three or four tables to sit at so it is best to order take-out and eat elsewhere. 

If you are looking for quick sushi fix and don't want to spend $15 on a small california roll or a bento box, make sure you check this place out. The sushi here is quick, fantastic and most importantly, CHEAP. Make sure you order the dynamite roll and Chirashi as their portions are gigantic and will actually get you full without emptying your wallets! If you are around this area at all, TRY IT OUT! It's no place to bring a date but it's a nice small comfy sushi location that locals all know about."}
{"text":"This Sushi Bong is an offshoot of the highly successful location at Yonge/Finch. This location features much more seating for eat-in customers, newer decor, and more parking compared to its older sibling. The highlight of Sushi Bong are its generous portions of sushi at really cheap prices. One order of dynamite rolls ($6.99), which are gigantic, is enough for my dinner. My default order is their Sushi Bong Special (~$11), which features California rolls (which can be subbed for other rolls if you're willing to pay extra), sushi, and nigiri. Service is quick and friendly, with orders being ready as soon as 3 minutes after the initial call. All in all, Sushi Bong is a great spot for anyone that wants sushi takeout in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is a small family-run business that has been serving the demand for cheap takeout sushi and enormous rolls in Willowdale for years. As a takeout place at the bottom of a condo near Yonge St, parking is sparse and the interior is dated and cramped, but there are a few tables for those that want to eat in. 

The highlight of Sushi Bong, however, are its generous portions of sushi at really cheap prices. One order of dynamite rolls ($6.99), which are gigantic, is enough for my dinner.

{"text":"Excellent sushi. Fresh fish. Perfect cuts. Always ready when ordering take out. Love all their rolls and sushi combos."}
{"text":"Tldr: Quick service, great value, delicious take-out sushi joint

Sushi bong is legit to the max. My student budget loves this place because it's cheap, and the service is insanely fast. I'm aware that some people have mentioned that the quality of sushi here is not the greatest. However, I personally think that the fish is pretty tasty, and at a decent quality level. For the price that you're paying, it's 100% worth it. This place is also super small, so would recommend as just a take-out joint. 

Whenever I come here I call ahead of time (maybe ~15min before getting there), and my order is always ready for pick-up when I get there  My go-to is the bong special ($12 Tax Included), and honestly you can't really go wrong with this option. It has nigiri, salmon maki, and a roll in it (dopeeeeeee). Their California roll in the bong special also has salmon in it, which is pretty awesome. I'm usually quite full after devouring the special. If i'm not feeling the bong special i'll get the dynamite roll, and homie....this roll is massive. For around $6-7 you'll get a roll the size of your forearm, and I guarantee you'll barely fit a whole piece in your mouth (Unless you got a huge mouth lool). 

Overall, i've had no complaints or problems with Sushi Bong. Their staff may look kinda intimidating but they're super nice and chills. On a side note...I'm pretty sure the lady who works at cash is a robot lol...Her multi-tasking is on point haha. Anyways, 10/10 would recommend to anyone who's down for a quick and filling bite to satisfy their sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"Sushi bong is the perfect place to get cheap sushi, and for its price it is still really good. Their sashimi is fresh, and I love the specials that they offer (sushi bong special and chirashi are my favourites). They've always been very consistent with the sizes and consistent with the quality which makes sushi bong my go to place when I want something quick and cheap. The staff are relatively friendly but again, don't expect much because this is more of a take out place."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place 4 stars not because I really enjoyed the food (it was ok), but because of the value for the money that you get here. This restaurant can accommodate about 10-12 people max. It mainly caters to take-out orders and I'm sure a lot of people who live in those condos in the immediate vicinity order from this place frequently. The quality of fish and rice is average. It's not bad, nor is it phenomenal. It's what you'd expect from a mid-range sushi joint in Toronto. Their menu is deliberately limited with unbeatable prices. The way I'd phrase it is their prices are from 2010 not adjusted for inflation in 2018, giving you a great deal.

As for service, the girl serving us was incredibly nice and friendly. I'd say the service was top notch.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this place given how low their prices are. If you want a quick bite to go on with your day, I say this place is an appropriate choice. If you want to take your partner on a date, maybe not such a great choice. As for take-out, it's a decent choice. If you want premium quality fish, I suggest you pick a more upscale Japanese resturant."}
{"text":"Meals were all beyond the expectation. I've been eating sushi from Japan, Korea, Seattle, and all over the US, but Sushi Bong is by far the best I could have near this price range. You'll never regret!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bong has been a neighbourhood staple for as long as I can remember. The locals even had various (endearing) nicknames for the husband and wife team that opened the restaurant years ago. The formula that makes this place is simple: very large/ chunky rolls at very reasonable prices. What Bong may lack in terms of authenticity, it makes up for in taste and value.

The seating area is tiny, so takeout is the best bet here. Furthermore, I'd say 1 roll/ person is typically enough. The dynamite roll has been my favourite order here for the past decade and I'm amazed by the consistency over the years. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend Sushi Bong for some speedy, fresh and delicious takeout!"}
{"text":"It is the best sushi in town - they have great quality and quantity of sushi for a decent price. Although the place is tiny, and sometimes the services are mildly inadequate, you still get the perfect sushi you want. Beside being fresh and delicious, the sushi here actually fill you up. I have always been a big fan to this place since few years ago - their sushi is just irresistible.
Highly recommend - dynamite rolls, sushi bong special, spicy salmon, rainbow...etc."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go spot whenever I crave sushi. Sashimi tastes fresh, rolls are huge, filling, and tasty, and service is extremely fast and friendly. You've got your basic maki rolls (eg spicy salmon) and special rolls (I  would recommended dynamite, unagi, red/green dragon roll, or anything else on the menu!!). We always order a platter of sashimi to accompany the rolls. What's awesome is that they have different sizes to accommodate the number of people dining and even a small is A LOT. 

Been here more times than I can count on my fingers and never once did I encounter a bad experience! This is predominantly a take out restaurant as there's very limited seating (maybe 10?) but whenever we do choose to dine in there's always a seat available. It's in a plaza so there's free parking available too (if parking a full, there's also free underground parking). 

So if you want cheap and fresh sushi, check out sushi bong!!!"}
{"text":"Gargantuan rolls---literally rolls the size of babies' arms---remarkable value of the North American sushi genre. Are they authentic? Probably not. But their fish is quite fresh and all their rolls are delicious.  Particular favourites include their philly roll and their spider roll, as well as their bong special and party trays. Their hoedapbap is decent too. If I need a cheap fix or to bring in a platter for a get together, this is my top choice. Cash or debit only, extremely limited seating and really geared towards takeaway."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place for a cheap price :) the portions are pretty big for only 10 dollars, so you don't have to worry about leaving with an empty stomach. There are few seats and most people order ahead for takeout."}
{"text":"Your typical family run sushi place. Small, large portions for a cheap price, quality is meh. Their rolls are gigantic and their tempura roll is surprisingly tasty. Don't go for their Udon special, not recommended.

There are only seats for 6 people in this tiny join. one two person table directly in front of the door, and one four seater beside the door. Pick your poison if you get lucky or order take out, which is what most ppl do."}
{"text":"Got the medium party tray (sushi & sashimi). For $48, I dont think it couldve gotten any better. The frustration of whole-in-the-wall (and AYCE) sushi places is that the fish is always too fishy. However, what makes Sushi Bong special is that at such low prices there isnt ANY fishy-ness at all. YAY!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Dynamite Roll ($6.99) and the Bong's Sashimi ($11.50) for lunch on Sunday. They have seating for at most 10 people inside and a table for 2 outside so seating is quite limited. The dynamite roll is ridiculously cheap for its value; you get 8 pieces and they're all larger than the average roll so you get your money's worth. It was a bit cold though and it came out quick, so the shrimp tempura probably did not come straight out of the fryer. You get 18 pieces for the Sashimi platter, without about equal amounts of salmon, white tuna, and red snapper. A couple slices of surf clam were also thrown into the mix. The fish taste fresh and are a nice appetizer to accompany a sushi roll."}
{"text":"First time going to Sushi Bong. I've decided to do a takeout, and I ordered their dynamite roll, spicy salmon roll, and avocado roll. The price was just under $17, food tasted decently great, the portion is a lot! I will be coming here again for another takeout sometime in the future."}
{"text":"A sushi place with great value! This is pretty much a takeout restaurant with only 2 small (and unsightly) tables. Food is decent but doesn't come with anything else i.e. No soup, salad, etc. I recommend the chirashi."}
{"text":"We ordered a spider roll, dragon roll and a salmon roll.  Everything together was under $25, pretty reasonable I thought, till I opened my take out boxes.  HOLY amazing deal!  We got in total 2 large sized square Styrofoam containers.  I thought was a bit strange at first, considering the size of the T&T rolls I normally get, I assumed everything would fit into one single square Styrofoam container.  Turns out that one container held the spider roll.  There were 2 huge rolls in there, for one single order.  
The dragon roll and salmon roll was in the second box.  The hubby normally doesn't comment much on his food.  He just eats.  This time he was like, \"OMG, look at the amount of salmon in this roll!!!  There's so much fish, more than rice!\"  Proportionally, there was definitely more fish than rice.  In all 3 of the rolls, there was definitely more filling than rice."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok so the telephone skills in terms of customer service could use some improvement, but the sushi is fresh, fast and is served in generous portions. 
I took a serving platter that I had over to their stop in shop, ask them which combo would be best and left it in their good hands. For $72, the price of a large combo platter, we got a centerpiece for our appetizer station. Not a single pice was leftover.
Now, go pick up some take out and enjoy"}
{"text":"I'm from Japan (born and raised), and I think the food is great for the price you pay.
The sushi bong special is my go-to (I really like their special California roll that goes with the special), spicy salmon roll has a really nice Korean twist to it, and their Dynamite Roll was. . . massive."}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Bong's North York location and had a so so experience.  And when Sushi Bong opens up in this location, I was a little skeptical. But I decided to give it a try.

I did not order one of those Mega rolls but just something simple: Spicy Tuna Roll ($5.49) was decent. Spiced using Gochujang was right on point, sweet sour and spicy.

Since we were there during late afternoon, there was no wait for our roll. 

Takeout definitely a good option as there is a nice open area right in front of the restaurant which is perfect for a sushi picnic or of course you can also eat that inside the mall."}
{"text":"Luckily I am not here with a date, I think I would never answer his phone/text/email nor going back to Sushi Bong ever again.

I am all for value! But I am not on a feeding frenzy to stuff myself with cheap food just to be full. If that's your goal, maybe Sushi Bong is for you. 

Dynamite Roll is huge since it is stuffed with rice and rolled up in chucks of tenkasu. Great for photos and that's it. The taste is just blah, with no substances.

Sushi Bong Special Combo is just so poorly presented. No effort to make it into something that what Japanese cuisine suppose to..   No effort to have their shari rice probably prepared... But the order is huge for the price.. good if you are hungry.

Please bring cash or your bank card... if not your date might have to even pay for your meal... 

Parking is free at the visitor parking underneath the building, if not there are plenty of meters around if you don't mind paying for parking.

Sushi Bong is not even up to par with some of the AYCE restaurants I been to. I just suggest to give it a pass, since there are a lot of other options in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the best cheap-eats / take-out in North York. Get their spicy salmon roll and dynamite. Dynamite rolls are huge. Very tasty. I would recommend to everyone. 
Not sure about eat-in. Tight space with 3 mini tables. Still 5 stars"}
{"text":"If you want good sushi that is fresh, delicious, and in enormous servings, this is the place to go. For a small restaurant with 2-3 tables dining inside and carry out, this place makes bomb a** sushi. I love that it is cheap and I get such big portions!! They are also very quick to make your sushi so you don't have to wait a long time. Love this place and will always come back!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is a small place where usually people would go for take outs. I personally go there for their dynamite roll. Its quite filling and not expensive at all. Although it doesnt seems to be fresh and pre-made but its none the less delicious."}
{"text":"As a westcoast Vancouver girl, i am used to my sushi, fast, cheap, and plentiful.  It`s been a test to find ``vancouver`` quality sushi here in north york, but ever since me and my friends found ``the bong`` as we affectionately have named it, it`s been our go to for our quick, cheap sushi fixes.  

Sushi Bong is located in a cluster of little apt first level stores, its small, and can sit around, like 12-15 ppl in there, the most, so it`s more of a take out place.  Service is fast, and onto the food, the portions are healthy for sure.  the basics i go with is usually `bong sashimi` which i think is 18 pieces for like 10 bucks or something, it`ll fill up a full square size take out box.  and we usually get a dynamite roll, which from the pictures, you can see, are like small tires, or more accurately, like the girth of a very thick zuccinni.  I love the chrispy tempura bits they put on the rolls, adds a bit of crunch.  and everything is fresh, like, they are always busy, so you can rest assured that what they are using is fresh products.

anyway, i generally just go for the sashimi and sushi.  did try the terriyaki once, and was not a fan at all... as they are run by koreans, the terriyaki type foods are more korean sauce based than japanese, so if you like japanese type terriyaki and are expecting that... just stick with the sashimi and sushi.  oh! but i did have the tempura udon, and that was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Sushi Bong does not sell anything related to bong. Bong is the owner's last name. 

Sushi Bong has the best quality, portion, to price ratio - in other words, best deal in North York. Sushi Bong Special consist of a generous  portion of food -  8 pieces of California roll, 4 piece salmon maki, and 5 piece sushi for $9.50. I typically order spicy salmon roll ($5.49) and yam tempura roll ($5.49), 8 pieces each. It feeds two people comfortably. Extremely reasonable!

I had once sat there and counted the number of orders placed in 30 minutes - 20 patrons with orders ranging from platters, maki and benton. Based on the observation, one can conclude that (1) Sushi Bong makes more than if they were to sell bongs. (2) Food is as fresh as it can get! 

The general rule of thumb is, the faster the turnaround, the fresher the sashimi. I highly recommend Sushi Bong for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"EEEH. Food has gone downhill. Portions are still large, but everything falls apart."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Had take out. It was expensive and the sushi falls apart and the quality of the fish wasn't very high. There are many better options around."}
{"text":"Just know what you are getting. The rolls are generous and fresh.  The price is good. Basically just a takeout place as seating is very limited. Service is quick and they charge extra for everything to keep prices good I suppose."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a different sushi place amongst the slew of sushi restaurants around.  It is indeed cheap and you get what you pay for. I got the sashimi dinner and it was a limited variety - salmon snapper and shrimp.  It was ok - I would rather pay a fee bucks more for more variety.  It's a quick cheap sushi run.  Not rushing to go back - unless broke for the week - LOL."}
{"text":"every time i come the size of the rolls change.  I guess it depends on the sushi chef that day.  in any case, its still very affordable sushi.  Its my go to ala carte.  The take out orders are non stop."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I ordered 1 cucumber roll and 2 avocado cucumber rolls. They were enormous and so delicious! The chefs definitely piled on my veggies very generously and even after sharing my meal, I was very full!
The service was quick; I waited much less than 10 minutes to receive my order. 
I wish I could come here every single day, but alas, this location is 30 minutes out of my way. Until next time, my beloved!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bong is the place to go if you want decent and cheap sushi. You can't beat the quality, quantity, and price of this place. I've only gotten takeout but I do see people eating at the restaurant (it is quite small). The Sushi Bong Special ($9.50) is well worth it as well as the spider roll. They don't skimp out on the ingredients and the fish is decent and fresh. Will definitely go back if I have the craving for some takeout sushi. Good thing it's around my neighbourhood too!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Spicy Salmon Sushi Roll ever, the price aint shabby either. The only downside like everyone says is that the place is kind of small."}
{"text":"I can not even begin to describe how satisfied I was with my meal there.

Location:
This is the second location for sushi bong. It is located in the humongous World on Yonge on the north east Yonge Street and Doncaster, just north of Steeles. There an inside mall but the restaurant is located outside. 

Parking Situation:
I went at 6 on Friday evening. There's limited above ground parking and underground parking.  I parked underground and it was cool. There's a huge Asian grocery store in the P1 level and parking was still cool. Tonnes of spaces. No parking anxiety here! 

The outside:
To be honest, it was as cold as heck and I power walked it to the door. I only remembered there was a lot up sign. 

Decor:
OK. This place is teeny tiny. There's about 8 seats. Tiny. There's not enough room for decor. Oh we had a cabbage thing on our table. I took a picture!

Food:
Omg yum!  

We ordered the sushi special, a spicy salmon roll, and a dynamite roll. 

Colour me shocked when the food came. Huge rolls bursting with fish and vegetables and rice. I initially thought that it was much food  for the two of us. We managed to pack it all in. Fresh sushi and vegetables. What a difference quality makes.

The only complaint - the dynamite roll was so bog o could barely fit it in my mouth. It ended up in pieces on my plate at times. 

They also have 'serve your own self' tea

Service:
We not much to say. They took out order and brought the food. Everyone seemed nice.

Cost: 
$23 for two. Was filled to bursting.

Conclusion:
Two thumbs up. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I came here the other night to satisfy my craving for sushi take out. Success!

I've been to the location in North York, but this one is a little closer to my house so I decided to give it a shot.

I will say, the interior of this location is much nicer and you can totally dine in, there's not many tables and it's a tiny space but it's cute!

The girl who took my order was very sweet. I got two rolls, spicy tuna crunch ($5.49ish) and crab maki ($4.00ish) are you kidding me?!?! That is a steal. I paid just over 9 dollars for both. This will not happen at any other sushi restaurant haha. Usually it's like 10 bucks for one roll. 

On top of that, it's literally ready at the speed of light. Mind you, no one else was there but still! Sushi Bong has their shit together! If you want amazing fresh take out sushi for an extremely low price I highly highly highly recommend this place. Parking is a bit of a pain at the North York one but if you come to this location there's a ton!"}
{"text":"My friend has been raving about this awesome little hole in the wall takeout sushi place near his house for quite sometime now so we decided to head over there last night as we were both starving. 

It was pretty tiny with a couple tables but I was very impressed with the service. 

First of all our rolls were ready at lightening speed and we both ordered 3 different ones.

I got dynamite, spicy tuna and california. They were all great and similar to rolls of those kinds I've had in the past, however I noticed they used a small amount of rice and more ingredients inside the roll which is definitely appreciated.

ALSO, the dynamite rolls were humungous. I was barely able to fit an entire one into my mouth. I was calling them dynamite cookies, they were so big. Also what I really liked about them was they added in some crab and cooked egg. Yum yum!

Also my total was under 20 bucks which is pretty awesome for how much I got.

Will definitely come here again! And maybe get less food next time because I was definitely full."}
{"text":"A compact little space. Most people get take out. There are about 4 tables (8 seats), menu was not overwhelming, simple and reasonably priced. Self-serving water and tea available."}
{"text":"This is our standard office Friday Sushi order-in choice.  And like the other reviewers here... the bang for your buck is significant.  I always opt for the Sushi Bong Special, which is 5 pcs Sushi, 8 pcs California Roll, and 4 pcs Salmon Maki .. for 9.50, and the size of each piece is significant.  I have a hard time fitting the rolls into my mouth.  And after one of those specials, my co-workers and I get really quiet and everyone stares at their monitors with half open eyes from being adequately filled with yummy sushi.  Tastes good... good value for your money....  and close by to my office, which I understand is not a good thing in general, but it is a plus for me.  
Enjoy!  

Note... there is one small table inside, but this is basically for picking up and taking elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Portions are huge and fish seems very fresh! I always crave this place whenever I want to eat some really good and decently priced sushi. There are two locations on Yonge but I like this one better since it is not as crowded as the other one and it is easier to find parking here. This place is generally for take out, but there are a few tables if you are planning on dining in. Orders don't take long either, if you're ordering take out it is usually ready between 10-15 mins. This time we got the small party combo and spicy salmon roll but we also like to get the sushi bong special. I especially like this place because they don't cheap out on ingredients and they also don't include a lot of rice with the sushi or rolls. Although it is a bit far, I would definitely keep coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of my husband and I in the north York area. It is a small sushi joint that is take out and there is very limited seating. Owned by Korean people, they are a friendly group. The sushi rolls are very big with lots of ingredients. We really like the Sushi bong special that includes rolls and sashimi. It costs around $10 and is very filling for one (definitely shareable). We also like their Dynamite roll with Tempura inside. The rolls are all very tasty, rice has just the right amount of vinegar, ingredients very filling and tasty. Would recommend doing take out as it is mainly meant for that. Parking is limited and many ppl get ticketed if you don't check so would recommend having someone else in the car. Also, they do not take credit card. Otherwise, a great place for cheap takeout sushi."}
