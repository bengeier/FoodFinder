{"text":"Morty's is kosher and we went because one of our party eats only kosher. The service, while quite cheerful is also quite slow. While kosher means no mixing of milk and meat, we had to ask for margarine for our rolls. One of our party asked for a coke and was handed a can. No glass. One entree of a rib steak was nice, an entree of brochettes was dry and ended up only half eaten, the marinated chicken was extremely dry, and the accompanying mashed potatoes were cold. When this was pointed out we received a replacement, immediately. Since Morty's is rather pricey we had expected much more than the mediocre meals and were disapointed."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Traveling to a city's \"premier Kosher restaurant\", I expected to pay a lot, but I also expected to have an incredible dining experience.  We started with 'crab' cakes, which mostly tasted like corn fritters. There wasn't much seafood flavor, and I suspect they may have been frozen. I ordered a dry-aged NY strip steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, the wife got a burger with onions and mushrooms.   My steak was fine. Not great, just fine. The sear on the outside was not so flavorful, more of a charred taste; nor was the interior of the meat. The mashed potatoes were a little dry, the vegetables were eh. Not what I expect of a meal costing $49 Canadian. My wife's $19 burger was much better- flavorful and moist. Her fries, though, were cold.  Service was fine, not warm or careful. The food came out quickly, which was good. Ambiance was nice- a good looking room. But if they want to be a gourmet dining experience, the quality of food needs to improve. BTW, this is the first time I ever wanted the Yelper's mythical 1/2 star- Morty's is really more of a 2 1/2, but it's mean to give them only 2 stars in their first review."}
{"text":"The owner of the restaurant was also the owner of El Morocco (of Downtown). This restaurant no longer exists, which is a boon to the Kosher market, since the service was poor and the food was even poorer."}
