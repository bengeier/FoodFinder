{"text":"The only good thing at this place is the friendly staff... The food however is ...terrible. Save your money. I don't know how someone can over cook rice into a mash! The curry was literally just curry no veggies or anything... And I felt like I was drinking curry soup that was much too creamy and not enough spice. Also had the Tom Yum Shrimp soup... Very disappointing it was literally some powder tasting broth with 3 shrimp and a couple mushroom slices... Not a traditional Tom Yum at all. If they had a -1 star I would have put it."}
{"text":"Truly awesome. Great service and great food. We went there twice last month and it was pleasant experience both times"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food. I had the red curry, it was a perfect blend of spices."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. BBQ beef was delicious as well as well as the Peanut Curry. Really clean and service is great.
The cooking videos also keep entertained"}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service and delicious food.  What more can you want???

My husband and I ventured into this little establishment based on a craving for Thai while we were in Vaughan.  After two visits, we tried the spring rolls, pad thai, cashew nut tofu, and sweet and sour tofu (my personal fave).  Everything was delish!  What made it better was that the young woman who is a server as well as kitchen staff explained that they have different sauces for vegetarian or non-vegetarian, which is awesome.  And an extra bonus was that the did not swim in a pool of oil, like some other thai dishes I had at other restos.  This is the real deal: flavor, value, and yummy :)"}
{"text":"They have a delicious sweet & sour tilapia dish! I recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Thai Style Pad Thai... Great flavor and spice without bloat and heaviness.  Sticky mango rice was on point as well!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. It very similar to Bamboo Legend, if you know that place. Their food is really flavorful."}
{"text":"We ordered the Peanut Curry (beef), the Mango Chicken, the Beef with Oyster Sauce, Vegetable Fried Rice and the Pad Thai (chicken) for New Year's Eve dinner.  Pad Thai was quite tasty.  No ketchup in the sauce!  Thank goodness.  Noodles were tasty and tender, not mushy or sour/sweet.  Just right.  The Peanut Curry with beef very flavourful.  Thinly sliced beef with green beans in a fragrant sauce that was not too thick nor too runny.  Just right.  However, the Mango Chicken and the Beef Oyster Sauce had the same veggies (broccoli, carrots, etc).  Other than the sauces & the meats, both looked exactly the same.  Both were also too salty for us to enjoy, even with the rice.  Had to throw both these dishes out after the initial taste.  Best dish was the peanut curry.  Had the leftovers 3 days later and it tasted even better than the first day!  All in all, I probably wouldn't bother taking the drive up to Vaughan Mills to eat at Truly Thai.  If in the area and craving Thai food, however, I'd go here and just know to stick with the Pad Thai and the Peanut Curry."}
{"text":"Went for a late Thursday night dinner. It is better Thai food than others in the area but not excellent. I had Pad Thai and noodles were a little overcooked as well as too mild for my taste (maybe my own fault not asking how mild it will be).

On a positive side service was exceptional and it is always nice to be well taken care of. The search for the best Thai north of Toronto will continue but would return if I am in the area and need a quick fix for Thai craving."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing friendly service, and very reasonable prices. What else do you need?

A clean, fresh smelling washroom says a lot about a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and although I had trouble finding it in the clusterf*** known as vaughan mills plazas, we were pleased we did. (I almost gave up and went to grazie) . I was a bit taken back by the look of it on the outside but inside is very nice, comfortable, quiet and CLEAN. We had the lunch special which is a really good deal. It came with a delicious spring roll.

Appetizers:
- 5/5 Chicken skewers w/curry , were not dry at all, love the sauce
-5/5 Shrimp rolls 5pcs, tasted hot and fresh, lovelovelove

Mains:
-4.5/5 Green thai curry had a kick of spice and lots of flavour
-3/5 Paw sew with beef a little salty but tasty. The noodles were perfect, not too hard not too soft. I hate mushy rice noodles.

I recommend getting a THAI ICED TEA as your drink. tasted amazing. My friend and I each got one and would come back for more.

Atmosphere - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 4/5

Overall I think this is a great place to go for lunch if you're feeling for some thai food. The outside looks small and the sign is rather simple but dont judge it by its extorior appearance it is much nicer inside and I would definitely come back  for lunc or dinner to try more items on the menu and get that thai iced tea again !"}
{"text":"A fair thai restaurant. Fresh rolls could be fresher, and the pad thai could be spicier. Although they didn't skimp on the cashews!

I have had better, but I have had much worse."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken padthai with shrimp for lunch pickup and when i got home i was RELLY disappointed to find ONLY 1 peice of shrimp with 4 peices of chicken with a whole lot of noodles to fill up the the container, called the cashier back and was Shocked to hear the cashier tell me that this is the usuall and no body ever complains with having a single peice of shrimp for their meal. Waiting to hear back from management"}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst take out food ever! I paid over $35 and the food I got was like \"pig food\""}
{"text":"Truly Thai is, by far, one of my favorite Thai Restaurants. 

I absolutely love the Pad Thai, and their Curry dishes are delicious and flavourful. I also really love the Curry Pumpkin Soup. Every time I come here, the food is always consistent. in quality and quantity. The portion sizes are very generous.

The service is great and the wait staff are always friendly and quick.

It is, in my opinion, the best place in Vaughan to grab delicious and authentic tasting Thai food!"}
{"text":"Update: Today the Coke was  only average... there was something not quite right, the ratio of ice in the glass  (which according to most experts should be between 0.36 and 0.39) was only about 0.25 and there was no lime, can you believe it? this just ruined what could have been another day in paradise.

To make matters worse, they still don't take American Express, but they continue to use trip trays with the Amex logo, and the same logo is displayed on the front door, creating chaos and confusion among tourists and locals alike. I tried to pay with my American Express card only to be ridiculed by the staff, then my friend also tried to use my card and he couldn't pay either !!! We both pointed at the Amex logo on the tray while making a very distinctive confused-annoyed facial expression that took the waiter by surprise, so there were a few minutes of awkward silence, after which we proceeded to sigh, then the waiter tried to defuse the bomb by pretending the whole thing was just a misunderstanding.

There is however a more importanter issue here, what's the name of this place??? Is it Truly Thai???? Is it Mai Thai???? Is it both?????  there has been continuous debate about within  the community, but no one seems to have the right answer."}
{"text":"Today we tried to deviate from our favourite restaurant Thai Bamboo.  Sadly it was a miss for us.  Called in to order because we had a flyer saying they offer free delivery.  When we called they said they don't deliver anymore and we would have to pick it up.  There was a group of us so we ordered some pad Thai spring rolls pad see ew and pad wong something (glass vermicelli noodles).  They called us back to say that they could not make the pad see ew... So we changed it to pad Thai.   The only food that tasted good (and fresh) was the vermicelli noodle dishes.  The pad Thai tasted old and seriously lacked flavour.   Tasted like ketchup and noodles.  The spring rolls were also not very fresh and kind of dry.  It was also more pricy then our regular thai place but not worth the extra $$.  Won't be ordering from here again.  Will stick with the tried and true Thai food from Thai bamboo on steeles."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Lunch special is always delicious.  Portion size is just right, won't head back to work feeling sleepy."}
{"text":"Literally tucked away in a corner of the outskirts of a popular mall is this little gem of deliciousness.

Food? Amazing. The curries and Pad Thai noodles are second to none. This stuff is fantastic. Perfectly cooked and full of flavour. piled high on your plate or take-out box for a great price.

Service? Pretty damn good. Waitresses talk to you, guide you through your selections and offer samples every so often as well. That's service that keeps me coming back for more!

Value? Fantastic. The prices are extremely good in most cases. You get a huge portion for your money.

Atmosphere? Simplistic and quiet. If you want to buzz off and get away from everyone to dine in a high end fashion without high end prices, this is the place to go to. 

You are guaranteed to leave stuffed and happy, as I have well close to a dozen times now. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Took the tom yam and pad-tai both were very good.  Lacked a little hot sauce but each with his own flavour."}
{"text":"This was a staple for lunch for me for 2 years as i worked nearby. It was soo good i ocassionaly drove in for dinner/takeout. Freshest ingredients, amazing dishes and great value. I moved away and miss it lots...haven't been able to find anything comparable in the west GTA."}
{"text":"Here for lunch with my friend we had Pad Thai it was pretty good here. The noodles are soft and sticky, green curry had a lots of flavour with tender of chicken breast.
We love to come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Just had their Thai style pad thai and basil chicken- both were great.  The service was also exception. The waitress checked in on us regularity, was very knowledgeable and had great advice!   We would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Went: Sat Oct 3, 8:30 pm (63/100)
We hadn't eat yet and it was getting late so we looked up restaurants in the area that had good reviews and that were open late and this was one of them.
We had trouble finding the place as my girlfriend decided not to wear her glasses so my navigator had limited vision.
The last Thai restaurant we went to was Siamese Thai that got good reviews on TripAdvisor but disappointed us. We were hoping for better and did he that but we'd hope the difference would be greater.
We ordered fried wontons and these fried wontons looked completely different than what I've previously experienced and not in a good way. It tasted like triangular battered chicken breast and had none of the rich flavourful taste of well-prepared wontons. Being deep fried, it tasted heavy too. Not a great start.
The green curry chicken beef had a tasty sauce but the beef was inconsistent being mainly undercooked. After these 2 dishes, we were full and decided not to chance a dessert.
When paying the bill I left a 10 instead of a 20 by mistake short changing them by 10. Perhaps, it was subliminal a manifestation of my disappointment.
Bottom line: we expected much better food. Maybe it was an off night for them, but we won't likely be coming back again."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant because I have a gift card.  The restaurant is located at the corner of the street mall.  If it is not that I have the gift card and call for the location, I will miss it even if I drive through the mall.  It is situated north side of the Vaughan Mills mall across ToysRUs

The first impression is that it is very nicely decorated.  It seems to be a family restaurant.  It is clean and everything in a orderly manner.  I order a satay, Pad Thai and a Green Curry.  The Chicken satay is very tender and juicy and the sauce is good.  Unlike a lot of the restaurants that the Pad Thai is sticky and very soft, this Beef Pad Thai is very good and the time that it is prepared is just right.  The Green Curry is good too although I expect it to be a bit more spicy.

The waitress is absolutely helpful to introduce us what we should try out.  We have the chance to try out one of the drinks before we order.  

I will come back to this restaurant again given the quality of service, food and the location near the Vaughan Mills"}
{"text":"Visited Truly Thai (previously, Mai Thai) with fellow diner a couple of weeks ago as we were in the area and craving Thai food. We got the following:
- Spring Rolls (5/10) - tasted too much like the frozen variety
- Coconut Soup (6/10) - pretty basic flavour with some pieces of broiled chicken. Not the best Thai coconut soup around, to be honest. Portion was quite large, definitely enough for two.
- Pad Thai - (7/10) - large portion, and great flavour. Again, not the best pad thai you'll eat, but pretty decent. 
- Basil Beef (7/10) - again a rather large portion, fresh vegetables and lots of beef in a delicious spicy sauce.

Service was great (9/10)

Pretty good value for the money, so if you're in the area and you're okay with dining at a relatively decent Thai place, give it a try. Wouldn't travel from another part of the city for the food, but a good option if you live around the restaurant. They offer delivery as well."}
{"text":"Okay kind of a Thai restaurant. Nice environment.   Liked their Thai Fried rice and Red chicken curry. Didn't quite like the Thai kalamari or the Thai BBQ beef though."}
{"text":"The lunch special is an incredible deal! I almost felt guilty ordering it because it was such a good value. The food is delicious and fresh and the service is wonderful. The restaurant is clean and beautifully decorated; the travel info on Thailand is a nice touch without being overbearing. 

Oh, and they deliver which is great. 

(I'm not sure why this listing says the dress is \"formal\". It's not, as far as I can tell.)"}
{"text":"I've been once at this place and liked it. Most important is clean place!  Would go again when decide to eat Thai food."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!

This place is my to go Thai restaurant. Not only do their food taste amazing, their staff are amazing and welcoming. The reason for my 4/5 is because I personally everything is great in their restaurant... Except the fact that everything on their menu doesn't taste so great. Stick with the pad Thai and green curry! $6.99 for their lunch special, totally worth it! 

I say.. Give this place a chance, their service won't disappoint you

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best thai food in town!! Their springs rolls are amazing!!,  I can't get enough if them.  I've tried many dishes from the mango chicken, green curry and thai style pad Thai and I have yet to be disappointed.  The food is great!!"}
{"text":"Tom Yam Soup is great. Pad Tai tastes okay and spicy beef does not taste fresh. The waiter is helpfull and nice.
Conclusion, no next time."}
{"text":"We will eat here again! 

Visited Truly Thai last Tuesday evening. Ordered the Pad Thai (Bangkok style) with tofu. The noodles were properly chewy, tangy and had a nice mix of vegetables. Overall, the dish was very tasty and came very close to my all-time favourite Pad Thai from SukhoThai (downtown). 

Word of caution: medium spicy is actually very spicy, and trust me, we like spicy. Next time, we will order mild. 

We also ordered a Green Curry with tofu and vegetables. This dish was good but we felt they could have gone stronger on the flavours/ spices (i.e. lemongrass). 

Overall, this restaurant was very good!

- the food was tasty
- the restaurant was cute and clean
- the washroom was very clean 
- great service (free ice cream for our friend who couldn't handle spice and they did not rush us to leave)

Looking forward to trying other menu items!"}
{"text":"Best thai food outside of Thailand!  (well, in the GTA anyway :) Ordered take out, super flavour, very authentic.  veg friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered take out with lunch special:
Pumpkin soup
Pad Thai
Red curry
Green curry

Everything is absolutely delicious. Fresh veggies, amassing curry flavours. 

Thank you very much for the awesome meal!"}
{"text":"Just passable, and it helps to be very hungry.  Would not come back though.  The Thai Pumpkin soup was okay, as was the Hot and Sour Soup. The calamari appetizer was horrible and not much there for $7.95.  It tasted exactly like they coated the squid with peppery Shake 'n Bake and the squid itself was overcooked and like chewing rubber tires.  Nice sauces with it though.  The Basil Thai Chicken was a total disappointment. The veggies were so raw and undercooked we couldn't eat them.  Just awful raw carrot, broccoli, raw onions and green beans - ugh - and very hot and spicy despite it being shown as only 2 chillies on the menu.  The Pad Thai was pretty good, but VERY fine noodles and they were overcooked.  The mango ice cream for dessert tasted like it was six months plus sitting in the freezer.   Just barely okay and a disappointing meal considering the good reviews this place got.  We don't get to Toronto often, so it's a real disappointment when we choose the wrong place to eat.  Decor is dated but service was great.  The food came so fast it had to have been at least partially precooked, except for those inedible vegetables!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty-a bit on the expensive side for Thai food. The service was ok. Waiter took my food away without asking if I was done (which I wasn't)! He seemed like he wanted us to rush our meal and get out of there. Ambiance is average. I don't think I would go back just because of the service."}
{"text":"I came here in particular for their Tom Yum Soup but I wasn't too impressed. It didn't taste as good as other restaurants (Pho 88, Ginza & Spring Roll) and I felt like it was missing flavour. I would give the Tom Yum Soup a 2. My friend ordered some meats and he said it was okay. However, I found the meat to be a little fatty. 

Allover I would give them a three."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a weekday as i had a craving for pad kra pow and saw pictures of it in yelp. The service was good. The pad kra pow was okay. The meat was tasty. The portion was generous. My only complaint was the rice which had some dried hard parts. I also ordered mild but it came out medium. I tried the pad thai under lunch specials and it seemed like a fastfood pad thai to me. Next time i will just order the regular portion as it might have more stuff included. I still like Siamese Thai in Woodbridge for thai within the area."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my brother, best fresh rolls one ever had. Pad Thai and spicy beef were also both really good!"}
{"text":"My parents and I had lunch here recently and we loved it.

They have a lunch special from 11am to 3pm.  For $8.99 you get your choice of main course and either a spring roll or the soup of the day.  We all had the lunch special.

I had the Peanut Curry Beef with rice, my dad had the Spicy Beef with rice and my mom had the Pad Thai.  My parents had the spring roll and I had the hot and sour soup.

The Peanut Curry Beef was one of the best I've ever had.  There were many slices of tender beef, with green beans and broccoli in the most delicious peanut curry sauce.  It was so flavourful and a little bit spicy.  I poured the sauce over the steamed rice and eat every last drop of it!  The only thing that would have made this peanut curry even better was if it contained some straw mushrooms (I once had this peanut curry in Montreal and it had straw mushrooms and let's just say it was 15 years ago but I still dream of that peanut curry - I don't remember the name of the restaurant, it was on St. Laurent, but it doesn't really matter because it closed down 15 years ago...but I digress...).

The Pad Thai was also excellent.  It had lots of chicken, egg and tofu.  It only had 1 shrimp though :(  The sauce was tangy and the noodles were not over cooked.  

The Spicy Beef was just ordinary.  It was not that spicy and there was nothing that really stood out for me with this dish.  It also came with lots of vegetables: red and green peppers, carrots, onion and broccoli.  

The hot and sour soup was more broth than I'm used to.  It also had way too much bamboo compared to the other ingredients.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  It was sour, but not all that hot (spicy).  

My parents said their spring rolls were crispy and pretty good.  The spring rolls are vegetarian with mostly cabbage, carrots and onions inside.  

I also had a Thai Iced Tea ($3).  It was a little sweeter than I like, but it was creamy and delicious nonetheless.  

The server was really nice.  The restaurant is clean (so are the washrooms).  It's not a large place, but they've done well with the space they have.

This place is in the strip mall that's across the parking lot from Vaughan Mills Mall.  When I go to Vaughan Mills Mall I don't eat at their food court anymore, I go across the parking lot to one of the small restaurants like Truly Thai (so much yummier in my opinion).  

I would definitely come back for the peanut curry!!!"}
{"text":"Good golly miss molly, this is some great food!

I came here and ordered the Thai-style Pad Thai. I asked for it to be spicy, and he said \"mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy?\" I said medium and he cautioned me that their spicy is pretty spicy. No problems.

I got the dish, a very pretty plate of noodles with a mess of tangled carrot threads on top, bean sprouts, lime and an orange slice on the side. I squirted the lime and began mixing the bean sprouts in. The aroma of the dish made me say \"oh my god\" out loud, despite dining alone. It smelled so fresh, aromatic and REAL. No premade sauces, no cheats. Just REAL. And it tasted just as great as it smelled. He wasn't kidding about the spiciness. Their medium is hotter than most other places' hot, and it was EXACTLY what I wanted.

At the end of the meal, he brought me a deep fried banana dessert, which was HOT, crispy and perfect.

Service was absolutely excellent (there was a bit of a language barrier. Maybe that dessert had dairy in it, who knows, who cares). The restaurant is clean and the booths were comfortable. 

Definitely worth the drive up. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We stop by after looking for asian food in vaughan and reading the reviews. We were pleasantly surpirsed at the quality of the food. Ordered cashew chicken and curry duck with perfect spicy level which we requested. Have to say the quality was as good as thai basil. Small complaint the portion was a little small.  But still would come back again"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken pad Thai and friendly service! :) will definitely return. Highly recommend! thank you"}
{"text":"Hidden little Thai treasure (was not easy to find - it is in the inside corner).

Delicious Thai Tea.  Wonderful, courteous service. Food is extremely enjoyable.  Pleasant, clean, classy decor.  

The thing to note, is this is a little restaurant - so they do not have a lot of staff.  The gentleman who served us, served every table in the place, and did so with a smile.  

I would also like to thank Yelp - for helping us find this place!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic service and delicious Thai food.  We were in a rush but had quick, well presented and flavourful meal.  I went for the classic chicken and shrimp pad thai and it had a well balanced flavour and nice garnish.  My husband went for the rice noodle stirfry with broccoli and chinese broccoli with chicken and that was also mouth watering.

They even gave us a complimentary small deep fried banana dessert taster at the end of the meal!  Ginger tea also relaxing...  will definitely be back. 

I found this place via yelp reviews and it definitely did not let me down!  It is a small restaurant but really reminded me of the hospitality and culture of Thailand. :)

Keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"Had 4 different dishes and they contained too much sodium. 

Food was cooked well though, the squid in curry was very tender. 
But didn't impress us enough to go visit again.  Considering the basic take-out style atmosphere, price seemed high. 

Tea in a coffee mug and stainless pot don't really match the name \"Truly Thai\"."}
{"text":"Family of 4' Saturday lunch. It's a hidden gem in Vaughan, owner is from Thailand.  Service a little slow but we did not mind the wait. Must try -Green curry / tom yum soup / mango sweet rice dessert !! 

Highly recommend- food very authentic"}
{"text":"The food tastes really good here, I've tried the basil fried rice , tofu stir fry, red curry and all of it tastes really good. The price point vs quantity vs location don't add up for me. The only reason I dropped couple of star is because I went there at 9pm (restaurant closes at 10pm) after shopping at the outlet and I guess that's when the lady also cleans and wraps up everything for the day..I was shocked to see her switch from mop to serving food without washing hands. If you go during the day or anytime early you probably would not have to witness this. I like street food and not that fussy at all  but bathroom cleaning to serving ina restaurant is not ok with me."}
{"text":"Lunch Special #8 ($6.99)
Peanut Curry Beef with Rice
[Red Curry Sauce w/ Green Beans, Lime Leaves & Ground Peanut]

Hints of mild spicy within the Curry Sauce while the Ground Peanut, Lime Leaves combination mixed within the Thai Thick Curry makes the dish quite satisfying and flavourful while Beef slices Tender.  Dish reminds me of Dan Dan Noodle(Peanut version) but went well with Steamed Rice too.   3.5'd -upgrade-

While Food is enjoyable the lone waitress handling a handful of tables took her some time to coordinate meaning expect more leisurely Lunch than coming when you're in a mad rush.  Lunch portion size is not the biggest but quite reasonable for money paid and ingredients used.

Thai Iced Tea($3.00), Yeah
Man, I need longer Lunch Breaks!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Always have their mango sticky rice for dessert, always! (This should be a rule when you go to any Thai restaurant anyway :P)

Truly Thai is a great little spot in the corner of the plaza right beside Vaughan mills. I've been here twice and both times the food tasted great. Both visits I ordered vegetable green curry (it's vegan friendly!) and it's very delicious. The curry is creamy and flavourful with the right amount of spice. If you like extra spice, ask them for some of there hot sauce- that stuff made my lips feel like they were on fire- I caution you to use it sparingly. 

The interior has many colourful posters of Thailand that add a nice touch. Waitresses are always friendly and are very knowledgable of the ingredients in the dishes (they said they don't use any dairy in their dishes- how amazing is that?!). Overall, I recommend this place for a decent Thai meal."}
{"text":"My uncle and aunt took me here for lunch and quickly found out that CAN$6.99 sure gives you a lot.  Their lunch special has a dozen choices and includes a spring roll or soup of the day.  You can also get both and order extra meat/veggie for an extra charge.  The soup of the day was a lemon-grass type soup, and since I ordered the \"Tom Yum Noodles Soup with Chicken,\" I opted to get the spring roll.  The roll was good, crispy and non-greasy while the Tom Yum enticed my taste buds with the right amount of flavor and spice.  For someone who can't eat anything spicy, I'm always down for Tom Yum and Truly Thai's passed my test.  It was a delightful first meal in Canada.."}
{"text":"This is my first review.  And this place deserves it.   I'm a pretty big foodie,  and seeing the size and hidden location of this place made it seem sketchy at first. 

FOOD IS INCREDIBLE. Service is great and the lady working there is friendly. 

Golden curry chicken -  great!
Thai iced tea (with milk) - UNREAL!
Basil shrimp - good.  

This place deserves this review.  Check
It out.  4 peppers is SPICY!  Teared me
Up got my nose leaking!

Great place.  Def going back soon."}
{"text":"The red curry and green curry for me are one of the best compared to other thai restaurants i have. Always done take out so cannot comment on service. Food is definitely delicious."}
{"text":"Had the peanut curry with beef, shrimp pad thai, and mango sticky rice.  Everything tasted great and the service and price was great (I think this place should have only one '$').  I wish the rice that came with the curry was softer and less dry - though the sticky rice that came with the mango was awesome.  We will come back again."}
{"text":"Time & Date of visit: Sunday, October 11, 2015
Atmosphere: quiet, small, cozy
Cleanliness: Tables & utensils were clean. The restaurant is clean all around.
Constructive criticism: Wishing the dining space inside was a bit more spacious, wishing the soups had size options i.e. cup or bowl.
Cuisine: Thai
Facilities: I did not venture.
Food: My boyfriend and I had never been to this restaurant, and this was our first time going for Thai food. What we ordered: Thai Veggie Spring Rolls (2) for $2.95. These rolls were fresh and just made the very same day. They were crunchy, and came with a sweet & sour sauce for dipping. What I ordered: Coconut Soup (Tom Kha Soup) $4.95 - inside the soup was Lemongrass, galanga, lime leaves, chili, and mushrooms. I ordered this soup in Veggie, but you can have the option of Chicken, Seafood, Shrimp or Salmon. This was delicious and it had the perfect balance of citrus and creamy coconut. For my entrée, I ordered the Green Curry $10.95 with a Medium spice rating. Inside the green curry was a traditional green curry paste cooked in coconut milk, pepper, basil leaves, green beans, bamboo shoots & carrots. I ordered mine on chicken. You can have the option of ordering green curry on Veggies, Tiger Shrimp, Beef or seafood. Although this was medium in the heat rating, it got my sinus' to open, and definitely cause a runny nose. LOL. However, it was fantastic. If you love basil, this dish excels in the flavor factor. A generous amount of chicken was used for this dish. I coupled it with a side cup of coconut rice. (yes, I love my coconut). The boyfriend ordered Green Mango Salad. A generous portion of mango used in this dish. Not for a small appetite as this dish is rather large. Full of flavor, just wish we had paid attention more to the fixings since it came with onions. (boooooo). The addition of peanuts and cashews used were outstanding! This dish was a whopping $7.95, but very worth it! For his entrée, he ordered Spicy Beef $10.50. This dish came with Stir-fried sliced tender beef with red curry sauce, basil leaves, green beans, bamboo shoots, red peppers & carrots. Although medium heat was used on this dish, beware of pieces of chili peppers making their way in. Not for the weak! I had a ginger ale to drink, he had a Singha Beer. 
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Will return, Will recommend!
Parking: Private 
Portion Sizes: Medium to Large. come with an appetite!
Price: Fair to Average. Our total came out to just under  $60 not including tip.
Service: Since we were the only patrons inside, lol - we had excellent service. Very warm & friendly.
Selection: There are many items on the menu to choose from. All homemade in house, and very tasty! 
What makes this restaurant stand out from the others: Its local! It also has a summertime patio!
Hours of Operation: Although closed on Monday's, Long weekend Monday's they are open. Tuesday to Thursday - 11:00am - 9:30pm. Friday to Saturday - 11:00am - to 10:00pm. Sunday 12:30pm - 8:30pm.

Warning: Not for the peanut allergen sufferer. This place has tons of peanuts used in their cuisine."}
{"text":"Truly.  Thai.  Want to see how they make such delicious dishes?  Watch it on TV!  I stopped in for lunch with one of my employees, since it was close to Chatime (my usual excuse).  I have eaten at almost all of the restaurants in this wing of the complex, but this was my first time at Truly Thai.  I looked through the menu and selected the Basil Fried Rice with Shrimp for $11.50.  What a deal for some really good, fresh food!  

And then I noticed that the TV on the wall was not showing \"You Gotta Eat Here\" or \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives\", but was showing how the chef makes the dishes on the menu.  How unique is that?  I'm sure that the majority of restaurants and probably all chain restaurants would not want to show you what goes into their dishes.  But there it was, a fast video segment showing the artistry in the dishes.  I gained two things from that:  1) confidence in the quality of food I was eating, and 2) the inside scoop on how to make the dish myself (next time I have the time and motivation).

You know, forget that.  I'll just come back here and get served instead of attempting the DIY on this!"}

{"text":"first review on Yelp and this place deserves all the good words! Extremely friendly service and good food!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. Ordered the truly thao pad Thai (no ketchup) and it was sooo yummy.  Also ordered the spicy beef, the beef was a little tough and the curry did not have a lot of flavour,  but it was still delicious.  Ended up too full to try the sticky mango rice but will definitely come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"We arrived at Truly Thai at around 1pm, and the restaurant itself is hidden right at the corner beside a huge walkway. We walked in with only one table full but was welcomed by a server quickly. The lunch set includes a dish and soup of the day, which was pumpkin soup. We ordered a Pad Thai Chicken & Shrimp, Pad See Ew (Beef), and a Green Curry with Rice (Mild). The portions were small but for the price of $8.99, it was decent. The curry was delicious with hint of coconut milk, the chicken was a little dry. The pad thai was a little bigger in size and the noodles were cooked well and not too mushy. Surprisingly the best dish was the Pad Ew See. Even the veggies were full of flavor and the beef were very tender. We finished off our meal with their most popular dessert, the Mango Sticky Rice ($6.99).  The glutinous rice was warm with a sweet, coconut sauce, topped off with a few sesame seeds. The rice was surrounded by slices of cold mangos. The two together was fantastic and is definitely better than the ones we've tried downtown. We will definitely be back when we are around the Vaughan Mills area!"}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch.  First of all, it's not easy to find.  It's tucked away in the corner of the plaza.

Once here, it's worth the visit.  I had the lunch special ~ for $7.99, and added a daily soup and spring roll for $1.  There are about 10 lunch options at this price, valid from 11 to 3?  I had the peanut curry beef.  It tasted like a red curry to me.

I was tasty and good value from my perspective.  Check it out if you're in the hood."}
{"text":"Restaurant is hidden away in the corner of one of the outdoor plazas on the North side of the Vaughan Mills complex. It is small and likely holds no more than 40 patrons indoor. There is also an outdoor patio.

We found the food to be very tasty with ample portions. We enjoyed the mango salad, a shrimp vegetable dish (with ample shrimp) and a eggplant basil dish. Tried Thai ice tea for the first time and really liked it.

The server was very friendly, accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. 

Prices are reasonable.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had duck curry, coconut rice and Thai style pad Thai. As big fans of Thai cuisine, my wife and I agree this has to be the best tasting Thai we've had in a long time!  Simple, good value, and AMAZING taste and quality. Good service too. 
We will definitely be back, even if it means making the extra trip."}
{"text":"Found this Thai restaurant on Yelp after shopping at Vaughn Mills with my girlfriend on a Saturday night.

We walked in at 9pm and the place was total empty.  We almost thought that the place was closing.  We were hesitated and asked but the only person on the service floor said no and was welcoming us in.  After we sat down, more people walked in probably from finished shopping at Vaughn Mills.  We finally did not feel as lonely lol.

We were so hungry and ordered the food right away noticing the restaurant would be closed at 10pm.  We had pad Thai, mango salad and shrimp spring rolls.  The food came fast and were all fresh and hot.  The pad Thai was very good serving with tiger shrimps.  The mango salad came with a sizeable portion and the ingredients were fresh. The shrimp spring rolls were freshly deep fried.  They stayed boiling hot for quite a while, but they are so crispy and yummy.

The restaurant has very outdated decoration but tidy and clean.  With the Thai music background, Thai food and drinks, I felt like I was in Thailand!

I will try this place again for sure when I am in the area.  I enjoyed the food and the welcoming service there:)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the hubby last night (Sat) at 6:45pm and it wasn't busy at all. However it quickly got busy as we brought a crowd with us! This wasn't our first time here. We've been coming here many times for the past year or so, dine-in and take out, and we are never disappointed. Food is authentic as it gets! We love the fresh rolls to start off paired with the sauces. This time we ordered the pad thai (non tomato) and ginger beef. Love the thinly sliced beef and flavour. Ambiance is simple and comfortable. Service is pleasant. Will definitely be back again to try the other menu items!"}
{"text":"We arrived there randomely. Beef, steam rice and eggplant. A bit more than 20$ for 2. We got full and the food was REALLY GOOD. i did enjoy the basil beef. Sweet and salty, but really good. Food service. Glass always full and food came after max 10 mins. For a quick lunch, really recommand it."}
{"text":"After a hard day snowboarding now time for some great Thai food! This place has the best!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this gem - the reviews don't lie! We ordered the veggie fresh rolls, Green Curry & Thai Spaghetti. Can I say for $25 we ate like royalty? The flavour are so fresh and authentic, and the staff is super nice! Finally we found a Thai take out place that delivers authentic flavours & ingredients instead of the usual doctored Canadianized version of Thai that most places tend to offer."}
{"text":"Last week, I went shopping at Vaughan mill and found this amazing Thai restaurant. It locates in a small plaza, front of the Vaughan mill, cross the parking lots from Tommy. 

The food is great, the price is reasonable, the portion is generous and the plating looks cool. 

I ordered Pineapple Fried rice and I love it. My sister ordered golden chicken curry. I'm not a curry fan but I found it delicious. The shrimp is also great, crispy outside and moist inside."}
{"text":"Delicious pad thai and papaya salad. Went for the lunch special so it came with a free spring roll. Food here is why the reviews are so high for this place. Its in the corner of a plaza in front of Vaughan Mills. Very small resto but enough tables for the amount of people going by. There was only one table besides us on a weekend lunch....
I would highly recommend this place as its price are fair, portion size is great and the food is simply delicious. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"My coworker comes twice a week and recommend this place to me this place is pretty good where does show Authenti  Thai food."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday afternoon and it was not busy inside. Place was pretty clean and our food came quickly.  Taste was good but I have had more authentic tasting Thai food at Lili Thai restaurant. Portions are also a bit better at Lily Thai locations."}
{"text":"Tried their pad Thai special. Nothing special just a regular pad Thai. Felt there could be more veggies and sauce with it. I've had better."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on sat after shopping at Vaughan mills.  Restaurant is located right across the mall.  We got the rad sar seafood and golden curry. The curry was very tasty.  Great service and reasonable price - would definitely return."}
{"text":"It's great to have an authentic Thai restaurant in the neighbourhood (unlike the rest of them that are essentially Thai fusion or Viet/Thai restaurants). Yes, the people running the resto are actually Thai!

Small cozy little place tucked away in the corner of the plaza, had trouble locating it. There was only one server covering the whole restaurant -- between 8-10 tables if I recall correctly. He was busy and service was at times slow, but he was so courteous I couldn't believe it! Such a nice friendly man that I wasn't sure if he was human. 

We had some fresh rolls, pineapple salad, a pad sew, and a curry. Overall the food is well-prepared and presented. Apart from the curry, flavours tended to be more towards the lighter side. Fresh rolls were pretty standard, nothing special. Pineapple salad did not impress me as anything uniquely flavourful. All in all, I didn't quite find the food all that memorable, just decent.

It's an OK option if you're in the area looking for something different. It's not a place I'd frequent personally, but I may drop by again to try some other dishes to see if I just picked a bad sample of dishes on my first experience."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! It's easy to miss because it's kind of hidden in a corner but decided to come here based on previous review. The lunch specials are from 11am-3pm. We got garlic shrimp with rice which was very flavourful. Portion seemed small but was perfect for the amount of rice given. I don't eat too much so it filled me up. They also give you an appetizer (springroll or soup). We also got pad Thai and Thai iced tea which was very good as well. Didn't get a chance to try the mango sticky rice dessert, but definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"My quest for really good Thai food outside of downtown continues.  Visited here based on Yelp reviews.  It is a little storefront in the corner of one of Vaughan Mills' \"outbuildings\" with only 11 tables.  Service was very friendly and pleasant; ambience was mundane but not problematic.

Unfortunately I can't really rate all of the food that highly.  The fresh rolls were the best item, very tasty and served with two dips.  Fried squid was good but suffered from overly large pieces which rendered some of them a bit tough.  The soup and main courses were more problematic.  Tom Kha Kai was way to sugary and salty at the same time, as was the pad khee mao over spaghetti type noodles that another member of the party ordered.  My green curry was not so bad lacked kick (toned down for suburbanites, perhaps?).  Surprisingly,  a dessert order - of all things, creme brulee -- was actually very good and much better than the Thai food."}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars after my first visit, but I went back once more and I'm bumping them up to a five. I've now had 10 different and consistently good or very good dishes here, from very flavorful for the adults (golden curry!) to plainer stuff for the kids (glass noodles). Even the wonton soup was good and I hate wonton soup."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is really good.  One of the better ones I've had for a while.  

Basil chicken was 'ok' but nothing to get too excited, ditto with the mango chicken which is sweeter than most I've had.

Service was pretty bad tho, could definitely use an upgrade in restaurant courtesy"}
{"text":"After some shopping at Vaughn Mills Mall we got a bit of a hunger. We came at a weird time though at around 4:30pm so the place was empty. 

Shrimp rolls $6.50 - comes with five deep fried shrimp spring rolls. Served with a sweet and sour vinaigrette type sauce. Tasted amazing. Wish I didn't have to share them.   

Red curry beef $10.95 +$1 for rice - a hint of sweetness with the coconut milk added to the curry sauce. There were lots of thinly sliced beef and fresh veggies. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. 

Coconut sticky rice with ice cream dessert $4.95 - three words to describe this dessert. ITS THE BOMB. Soft sticky rice which is chilled and topped with a layer of amazingness. The best way to describe the layer of amazingness on top is coconut flavoured condensed milk. It comes with a scoop of ice cream of your choice. We got mango flavour. When you combine the ice cream and the sticky rice together its just heaven in your mouth. Trust me. You will not regret ordering this dessert. Wish I didn't have to share this dessert either. I could have Nom Nom Nom one of these for myself easily since its such a light dessert."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars. Came here looking for a quick bite on a really hot day. When my gf and I arrived, there was no A/C running and the doors were left open. I have no problem with not turning on the A/C but at least have some electric fans or some sort of alternative in order to keep your customers cool. It was so hot in there but we ultimately decided to stay since we were craving Thai food. 

We started with the crispy wontons which were crispy and had a decent amount of filling in each. It was good but next time I would probably try something else like their mango salad. My gf ordered the golden chicken curry with coconut rice for her entree and I ordered the Bangkok-style Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. While the pad thai tasted good, it did not stand out from the others I have tried. I did enjoy the golden curry more as I found it to be more flavourful and satisfying. 

Overall, a solid restaurant if you are looking for Thai food with a variety to choose from. Hopefully next time they are more considerate towards the comfort of their customers especially on a summer day."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend thanks to yelp. The two of us finished some shopping at vaughan mills and was hungry. When I drove here, I thought this was a sketchy restaurant not suitable for a date and we decided to try the popular pizzaria restaurant nearby. However since the wait was so long, we decided to walk over to here for a closer look.

It looked welcoming inside surprisingly and but there was only another couple inside. Nonetheless we came in and tried the Green coconut curry chicken, BBQ beef and coconut fried ice cream. 

The BBQ beef came on a bed of crunchy chip-things which I found amusing to eat and she enjoyed it too. The coleslaw was a nice touch on the side of the dish as well. The coconut curry was delicious but had a bit too much carrots. My girlfriend was laughing at me when I began to eat strings of carrots like it was noodles or something lol....

The fried ice cream is really good! Normally the fried ice creams I have tried were soggy and wet but the outer layer of this was crispy and warm while the inside were nice and cold. It is presented nicely on a plate and I recommend it!

Come here with a date or family. But remember to close the door as you come in (the waiter gets kind of mad when you walk right in.....)"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Truly Thai is located in the plaza conglomerate outside Vaughan Mills, and yes it is quite hard to find. The map in their website does its good of a job as it can  for you finding the location, so do take that handy.

I came here for an early lunch, and I was happy I did; as my food arrived, a huge gathering of customers arrived, and the seats were filled in a span of 5 minutes on a Friday.

I ordered the pad thai with chicken, and opted for the spring roll as my appetizer. I had the choice between the spring roll and the hot and sour soup, and personally if I were to come back I would go for the soup...the spring roll was crispy but the ingredients inside lacked. The pad thai with chicken, on the other hand, didn't have the artful presentation you usually get in Pai/Khao San/Sukho, but the quality definitely made up for it. The noodles were a little chewy, which I prefer in pad thai dishes; if you like it more cooked, you might have to request to the waitress for that.

Service was excellent and the waitresses were very attentive of everyone, busy or not. My water was refilled every time it was under half full, and I didn't need to ask the waitress for the bill (some might not like that, but if it's lunch service with a party of 1-2, it's kinda obvious we want to be out ASAP)."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to \"Truly Thai Cuisine\"

It's located in the Vaughan Mills Plaza on Rutherford near the bass pro mills.

We had the ginger beef, bar-b-q beef, spring rolls, soup, and their eggplant dish.

The best of all of the dishes was the eggplant.  It was made with baby eggplant, was soft and velvety, and had an excellent flavour.

We enjoyed all of the dishes.  The best part for me was that they were able to make so many dishes gluten free.  I must maintain a gluten free diet because of health concerns.

My associate thought that the wonton soup and spring rolls that he had were top notch.  I had the coconut chicken soup, and it was quite delicious as well.  

The restaurant was clean, the staff was very friendly.  The presentation was quite nice, and the restaurant was well laid out.

I enjoy good Thai food, and the food was very good."}
{"text":"Once you eat at Khao San Road you will understand why the food here is underwhelming. Service was friendly. Weird location in a strip mall but the area was busy. I guess this is where people in the suburbs eat. Not real Thai food, but a good try. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Located in the little corner of the plaza beside Vaughan Mills Mall, easy to miss if you don't look for it.

Look for it!

Ordered-
Pad Thai: fairly standard
Green Curry: just a bit of a spicy kick - even my friend who couldn't normally take spicy enjoyed it
Mango Chicken: if you have a sweet spot this would hit it :P 
& Coconut Rice: rice blobs shaped into a star that's definitely too cute to eat

Neighbouring tables also looked to have fancy specialty drinks which I'd try my next time there."}
{"text":"FYI.  Restaurant is now called \"Truly Thai\" and is owned by the former owner and one new owner who's a staff member there.

I've been coming here for a few years when I moved into area due to the convenience, but haven't been going for a while.  I usually order the same type of dishes.  My regular dishes were okay, but sometimes taste/quality isn't consistent.  Service is crap if the female owner or tall man served you (both never smile or show appreciation for business).

Today, I was upset when I called and told her I was making a complaint about a ling hair found in my food, she never apologized and just said \"its not my hair because I have short hair (as in not her) \".  Then she told me she will ask the manager and call me back and when she did, she said no need to show them the hair/food and next time I can have a free side mango salad.  I told her that the salad is worth less than my $11.80 fried rice and the money wasn't the point and that they should apologize and not expect me to eat rice with hair in it.  This woman is new and didn't apologize even when I told her on phone and in person.  I was so upset that I got dressed and walked all the way to return the hair infested food!

Btw, when I went to buy food and I initially said that I'll pay cash for 10% pickup discount and the woman she said there's no such discount and when she called me back about the \"hair\", she started off saying there's no 10% discount and that staff pocket the cash and I told her didn't ask further on the discount after she said no discount, and the fraud has nothing to do with me.  She also didn't believe me when I said the 10% pickup discount was \"printed on the old menu\"."}
{"text":"The location is near the mall and kind of hidden in a corner. Both times I went, there were only a few tables full. This place definitely deserves more popularity. 

I tried the green and red curry here and both times they were delicious. Rice to go with the curry is extra and costs $1 for a bowl. I usually still have curry left over enough for another meal to take home. Highly recommended place to try."}
{"text":"We had lunch here. The food is very solid authentic Thai at reasonable prices. 

Dishes worth mentioning:  

The drunken noodle (beef) was excellent. Strong flavor but not too spicy with great noodles. 

The fried tofu was super. Great texture and flavor. 

The authentic pad Thai was solid. Perhaps more sweet than I am used to."}
{"text":"When shop at Vaughan Mills, drop at truly Thai! 
Its a small hidden gem!

I have tried their green curry, fried rice, lychee martini, Thai Iced Tea, Pad Thai and many more dishes, I loved them all. Thai Iced Tea is not to be missed; But please beware while ordering spicy!!! First timers stick to regular spice level. 
My love to this place is more as it has many vegan/vegetarian options !

The only cons: One of the servers is really pushy, sarcastic. She would always push you to order more n more, like sarcastic smile if you don't order drinks or appetizers."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Ordered the basil roasted duck which had very little duck; Thai style pad Thai which was ok. It was spicy but nothing else and the chicken was bland; Thai style eggplant which was nice and tasty and fish cake, which was tasty too. Disappointed after reading the reviews. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were here for an extremely late lunch and were the only people there at the time. We came in to check whether they had gluten free options and did they! We ordered the Thai hot and sour soup, basil chicken and green curry chicken and they made our complete order Gluten-Free!  Also there were only two people we could see working at the time but both were extremely pleasant and kept checking in with us but not too much as well. We had a baby with us as well and they had baby utensils at the ready so we didn't have to worry about that. 

The soup was great, the basil chicken was amazing and the green curry , although different from what we've had before, was great as well. Would definitely go back whenever we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I going to stay this first. This place is hard to find among all the other restaurants and shops outside Vaughan Mills parking lot. It's the last business on the left sidestrip tucked in the corner. Beside the Indian store Gagan and a Caribbean lounge.

The resto was clean and the service was friendly. There is lots of seating. Great for families. The food tasted very good and you can get it as spicy as you would like. 

We had chicken pad thai and golden spicy chicken curry which white rice. The food was pretty good! Lots of flavor and spice. I'll be going back and maybe even do take out!"}
{"text":"Great  and friendly service! 

The star-shaped coconut rice was cute! We ordered the pad thai, green curry, and mango chicken - not bad."}
{"text":"I've been trying to try food at this place for a long time, but for some reason I always get a craving when they're closed. I finally had the chance this Thursday, so I ordered some takeout!

I decided to get their Penang chicken curry. I actually asked them to substitue the lunch beef Penang option for chicken and they gladly did it for me. The lunch option comes with a choice of wonton soup or spring rolls. I opted for the soup and got a side of fresh shrimp rolls (each order comes with 3). 

The lunch curry portion is actually quite large and comes with rice. I was barely able to finish it, but pushed myself to do it. The curry tastes really nice and there was a lot of chicken! I still had to add some chilli oil to get it to my spicyness level, but it wasn't much. To be honest, I didn't really like their chilli oil...it gave an odd kind of taste to the food. So, I would stay away from it and just ask them to make it spicier next time.

The side of soup was kind of funny. It was small, which is okay...but there was legitimately 1 wonton. That single wonton tasted quite good, so I was sad there were no more. The fresh springs rolls come with two sauces, the chilli one was good and the brown one was a bit strong. The rolls weren't spectacular, but I've had worse and I've had better. 

Overall, the amount of food I got for the 8.99$ lunch special and the side of rolls was very good. The taste of the food was also very good. I'll definitely try their food in the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"So happy to have found real Thai food in Canada.  I'm from NYC and get great Thai and this place rivaled.  The Tom Kha Gai was perfectly balanced.  The fish cakes tasty- and I loved the sliced cukes.  Crispy Duck ( not so crispy) and Mango Chicken rounded out the meal.  Excellent Mango Sticky Rice with ice cream was the final treat!"}
{"text":"Got one of their lunch special beef dish and it tasted dry and bland. I think they may have just reheated the beef. Rice and veggies were okay. Lemongrass soup that came with the dish tasted meh. 

Pad thai looked good, get pad thai.  

This place is located on the upper floor of a building, so it feels somewhat nicer and there is some Thai music playing in the background."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of one of the strip plaza's skirting Vaughan Mills is Truly Thai Cuisine. They have the end unit with a fenced in outdoor patio within the walkway of the plaza. Party shaded by the walkway tunnel, partly exposed, it's the perfect patio, sun if you want it, shade if you don't. Plenty of free parking is also available out front.

We arrived before the restaurant was open, so we went to the Starbucks in the same plaza to kill time. When we returned, we were the first inside and we were almost rejected for a table (in an empty restaurant!) because they had bookings for lunch... so my tip is: make a reservation!

Inside, the place is small with seating for about 30. If you call ahead and make a reservation, they can accommodate large groups by moving the tables around. The decor consists of golds, deep wine reds, and greens. Pictures depicting Thai culture and dimmer lighting add to soften the tones and create the ambiance. Booths line one side and tables the other. The patio only had about 5 tables of four out, but can easily accommodate twice as many tables.

The menu is quite extensive and covers the full gambit of Thai cuisine, rice, noodles, curries, seafood, stir fry's, vegetarian, appetizers (small plates), soups, salads, and desserts. The menu had all my favourites! But what really caught my eye was the item not on the menu. On the table there was a card advertising a plate that showed a picture of rice in a bamboo steamer with chicken and mango salad that I just had to get! Of course, I also had to try the staples, on the card was also a Pad Thai, Fried Rice, two Curry's, and Salad. For dessert, Deep Fried Banana, Fried Ice Cream, and Ice Cream Mango and Sticky Rice (Also not on menu, but table card).

Pineapple Fried Rice. Made the way I know it, with eggs, shrimp, chicken, onions, pineapple, peas, and carrots. Topped with cashews and garnished with tomato, lime, orange, cucumber, and cilantro. The rice was Thai Jasmine and the dish was slightly wet as it should be. The flavours didn't POP out at me like I expected them to. 3,5 stars.

Pad Thai. Better than most places, the noodles were not overly wet. Shrimp, chicken, tofu are the proteins. We order the Thai Style (with tamarind) which gave it an extra zing; subtle, but noticeable and enhanced the dish. There was a greater ratio of bean sprouts to noodle than most other places, but IMO it improved the dish. I'm generally not a fan of Pad Thai, but if I had to eat it, I'd come here for it. 4 stars.

BBQ Beef. Probably the weakest of the dishes we ordered. Despite the use of starch, the beef was still not as tender as I expected it to be. The Thai spices were on the milder side (not sure if it's to cater to the locals or not), and the sauce was what saved the dish IMO. 2,5 stars.

Peanut (Red) curry. This dish comes with steamed rice. The curry carried a nice peanut flavour with little heat. The lime leaves added a nice fresh burst of flavour. Great for kids. 4,5 stars.

Green curry. The classic Thai Curry. They threw in the kitchen sink here. A symphony of salty, sweet, spicy, and sour! It's quite salty but that's how it should be. The spice creeps up on you, and there's a fair amount of it! The coconut milk wasn't as noticeable, but I knew it was there from the sweetness. Bamboo shoots flavour were also prominent. 4,5 stars.

Som Tum Gai Yang Khao Neuw (on table card, not menu). This dish was absolutely FANTASTIC! Sticky Rice, Chicken, and Papaya Salad. The chicken was well seasoned, and grilled. The fish sauce was well balanced and not overbearing with fishiness. Thai dipping sauce was the same one that came with the beef. Papaya salad was your classic and it was spot on. 5 stars. 

Desserts will be curt due to space constraint.

Deep fried Banana. Ordered with coconut ice cream and condensed milk. The combination is explosive and absolutely delicious! Firing all cylinders on the tongue. Salty, deep fried, sweet. 4 stars.

Fried ice cream. We got the last of the coconut ice cream with the deep fried banana, so we opted for the mango ice cream. The batter was the same as fried Banana. 4 stars. The mango ice cream was your typical fare found anywhere. 3 stars. I think this would have been much better with the Coconut ice cream.

Ice cream, mango & sticky rice. On their own the mango ice cream and sticky rice was not so good; however, the coconut milk with the rice was enough to tow the line for the dish. The real pieces of mango is a nice touch. 3 stars.
 
The place is a true Mom and Pop. The staff of two did everything from cooking to serving. They were very pleasant and accommodating. Is the food authentic? IMO, yes! They live up to their name 100% and are \"Truly Thai\".

4 stars overall, but so far they're as good as it gets for the area, and for that, I'm giving them an honorary 5 stars!

If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Great menu. Great price. Good service. Authentic Thai. Recommend any day. I had the spring rolls and the pineapple curry with rice. More than enough portion size for the price.

Edit: decided to get the coconut rice and mango too! It was delicious."}
{"text":"Truly Thai is one of my absolute favourite Thai restaurants in Vaughan. The servers and owners there are incredibly sweet and you can tell they put a lot of time and effort in preparing each dish. It's in a good location with ample parking space, so if you're shopping around Vaughan Mills and having the cravings for some good traditional thai food then you should definitely check this place out!

Service and Environment:
I've been here quite a few times and have never had to wait to be seated, even though the restaurant is kind of small. It's a nice, quiet and homey environment with good, soft Thai music. I always feel at ease and peaceful while eating here. Service here is really quick whether you are dining in or doing take out. 

Food:
Thai Iced Tea - This is the first thing I order the moment I sit down. I personally think they have the best Thai Iced Tea here. So if you're a huge Thai Iced Tea fan like me, you should definitely give theirs a try.

Chicken Pad Thai - Their pad thai noodles are perfectly balanced with the right amount of sauce, noodles to meat ratio and vegetables. It's very flavourful and I love how you can choose how much chilli peppers to put in.

Golden Chicken Curry and Coconut Rice - A recent favourite of mine. Their curry is not too spicy, it's nice and creamy and they add in lots of chicken and potatoes yum. Coconut rice is cooked perfectly with a good amount of coconut flavouring. 

Mango Sticky Rice - One of my favourite dessert dishes to order here! However there can be times where they won't offer this menu item because either their mangos are just not ready or they run out."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh, such good noodles.
If your ever nearby or just shopping at the mall, you can't miss this. The people there are so welcoming and yes, there is free wifi.
I got their Thai style pad thai, and woo hoo, it was the bomb. The restaurant is hidden in like a corner so good luck finding it."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for Truly Thai Cuisine based on their Lunch Specials!

$6.99 for a lunch with either a spring roll or soup of the day! There are different items to choose from.. curry, noodle, rice dishes! That is just awesome. Plus you can pay $1 extra to get both the soup and spring roll.. trust me you won't regret that!

Soup of the Day - Pumpkin Soup
- Can I say I consider Pumpkin Soup as a dessert? Especially Truly Thai versioin.. the soup is so thick with tons of fresh pumpkin puree... Though I did not order that, I do have an urge to eat the whole thing by myself after 1 taste... :) 

Spring Roll
- Love how it is fresh fried! So steamy hot inside filled with Mushrooms, carrot, cabbages, onions, and glass noodle... oh yummmy..
BTW, I hate those supermarket packaged type where a lot of places served

Pad Thai Woon Sen 
- Stir-fried glass noodles with mix vegetables, eggs, onions, mushrooms in Thai special sauce with tiger shrimp and chicken breast 
- nice big shrimps, really good value as a lunch special
- glass noodle to cramped together... I would suggest just order their pad thai noodle version will be a better choice

Spicy Beef with Rice
-  Stir-fried sliced tender beef with red curry sauce, basil leaves, bamboo shoots, green beans, red peppers, carrots. 
- Right level of spiciness and the red curry sauce goes really well with the rice! 
- The star shaped rice ball so cute! The dish so nicely presented!

Interior are nicely decorated with good dim lighting and dark wooden colour furnitures... and nice touch with the fresh flowers on the tables!

Great value for lunch! Nice friendly service! A to go place if you are in the area working or shopping! :)"}
{"text":"There isn't much to add in addition to the 30+ previous reviews.  Truly Thai is a good independent restaurant that is an asset to the culinary scene of Vaughan.  We ordered a Vegetarian Red Curry ($10) and a Seafood Fried Rice ($11) for dinner.  The curry was spicy but not torturing (we ordered medium level of spiciness) with a decent level of creaminess.  I recommend it.  The Seafood Fried Rice was okay/forgettable.  

The venue is pleasantly decorated but not extravagant.  Services was fast and friendly.  They played pop culture Thai songs as background music during our stay.  Credit card machine is at the counter.  The waitress graciously assists you at the table if pay by cash."}
{"text":"I took a sip of the lemongrass soup and decided not to take another one, but maybe that was what lemongrass soup is supposed to taste like. But the pad thai was pretty decent. It tasted kind of like what they serve at thai express, which isn't a bad thing really. The inside is pretty basic but then again so are the prices! All in all not a bad place to have a quick, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 5 times and the food is excellent. Started going because of the lunch specials but have enjoyed the food so much that we've gone back for dinner as well.
Lunch specials are excellent value for the price. Dinner is more \" a la carte\" so you can order what you want.
Cashew chicken, basil beef, pad thai, etc is all excellent...have't found a dish I wouldn't recommend.
Only complaint is the cheesy tv ad that constantly runs from tourism Thailand...it's the only thing they show on the tv. To be honest, the tv is not needed in this type of restaurant...."}
{"text":"first off, yes they are truly thai.   The owner and chef was clearly thai which already means alot.  

The outside banner is not the best.  Its not exactly an easy to find location.  tucked in the corner with a sign that says \"truly thai\" that looks like a massage parlour sign (really bad font)

But now the good part. The food.  

The food was legit. very flavourful... and unlike the new Thai \"Hip\" places such as Pai, Kub Khao, Jatujak, Sukothai etc... The prices at Truly Thai Cuisine are more reasonable.  

If you have been to thailand you would know.. Pad Thai is CHEAP.. im talking 2-4 dollars canadian.. But with those new Thai places.. 16 dollars a pad thai?!  get out!  the ingredients are not much more than your typical cantonese rice noodle dish which may cost only 5-6 dollars at a food court.   

anyways.. prices are more reasonable here.. and food taste just as good.  most of the noodle dishes are about 10-12 dollar range.. which already beats the competitors by 4 dollars easily.  

i think this will be my new go to place when i visit vaughan mills.

nice gem here."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Possibly the best Pad Sew I've ever had. I got it with chicken and it was delicious- ate it so fast I didn't even have a chance to snap a picture. For anyone looking for it, it's a corner unit and a bit hidden away. Worth the search though! The staff are friendly and the service is quick (which is great when you're starving!)."}
{"text":"Bless previous reviewers for indicating that this place is located at the very corner of the plaza. I would not have found it otherwise.

I'm super excited to have finally found a Thai restaurant in Vaughan! I came in on Tuesday for lunch around 1pm. There were four tables occupied inside when I arrived, and during my dining experience, one person came in to pick up take out. I was allowed to seat wherever I wanted because it wasn't full. I knew from the raving reviews that I HAD to try the Shrimp Rolls ($6.50). I then ordered from their lunch special menu, as well as my friend. I got the Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai for $8.99, and my friend got the Tom Yum Noodles, also for $8.99. The lunch special came with a choice of either the soup of the day, or a spring roll. My friend opted for the soup of the day, which was hot and sour soup, while I got the spring roll. We got those small dishes first. Must I say, I definitely regret not going for the soup. I enjoyed it so much, I wanted to trade my spring roll just for leftovers of that soup...it was one of those soups so well made, that it made me feel like home. My spring roll was okay. It had vegetarian stuffing inside. The Shrimp Rolls came next. It was plated very nicely in what seemed like a cocktail cup. If you like tempura shrimp, you should definitely have a go at these shrimp rolls! They taste better, in my opinion. 

My Pad Thai came next, while my friend got her Tom Yum Noodles. She said it wasn't as good as her side dish, interestingly. \"It isn't spicy at all,\" is what she relayed. My dish, on the other hand, was quite enjoyable. It tasted similar to Pad Thai I've had elsewhere. My noodles were more cooked than I would have liked though; I prefer it a bit chewier. Plus, while my dish is called Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai, I only had one shrimp in my plate. I was a bit sad. 

Service was quick and attentive. They came over a few times asking us how we found things. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had the green curry chicken and a tom yum soup which was great! Just like on our trip to Thailand. My wife had the roasted basil duck and wonton soup. She wasn't as thrilled simply because she was expecting a richer piece of duck, it was a bit bland. Otherwise it was great. Would go back."}
{"text":"Although this Thai place was pretty small (and old) the food here is pretty decent. Location is in the plaza right across Vaughan Mills. We ordered several dishes and decided to all share. What I found funny though was that all the dishes had the EXACT same garnishes... some carrot shreds, cilantro, maybe some carrot SLICES if we're feeling fancy. It felt like I was eating the same thing since they all looked similar lol. I've been to other Thai restaurants (not gonna name names) but whenever I order pineapple fried rice it always comes inside an actual pineapple, but this one doesn't. Maybe that is one of the reasons why the prices are lower than other places?? We shared it amongst five people and the total came up to less than $15 including tip. Next time if I am ever close to the Vaughan Mills area, I might consider eating here again."}
