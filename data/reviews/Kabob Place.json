{"text":"Happy to have a \"casual\" Indian restaurant close by!  I really like Indian food, but don't always want the \"fancy\" treatment that so many Indian establishments have.  Kabob Place's \"Casual Dining\" is a great idea.  Menu isn't gigantic but still offers lots of options. We tried the Afghani Chicken and the Beef Kafta kabobs, and had an order of the plain Naan bread. Naan was unlike others I've had - crispy and delicious! The meat was super juicy and tender, and was served with some very nice, softly-flavored fragrant rice.   I'll definitely be incorporating this place into my dinner-out options, so glad I found it!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and was missing my regular Indian restaurant. My grandparents took me here, as they had been wanting to try it out as well. When we walked in, I thought the atmosphere was very interesting for an Indian restaurant, it was \"casual  dining\". I thought this was a great idea! We went up to the counter to order, and could eat at our own pace without having to feel too formal.  The food was very good. I ordered the Vegetable Byriani, which I think was a special for the night. I loved it! The flavors were great! We also ordered Vegetable Samosa,  Alu Tikka, Okra Bhindi (also on special), Dal, and Lamb Chops. Everything was delicious! I love Vegetable Samosa almost everywhere I go, and this was no exception.  Overall, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and took our son and his two college friends to the place for dinner. The food was really good, authentic Pakistani. The Dhaba chicken karahi and the mixed grill were amazing and tasted great with the hot naans. We ended with some ras malai and chai which was great. Will definitely go there again on our next trip."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is so tasty! I've tried the naan, veggie kabobs, and afghani chicken - all were extremely fresh and flavorful. I work nearby and LOVE that we now have another place that delivers. I highly suggest checking this place out! Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Finally! Edible, spicy Indian food on the westside! I've missed you delicious Indian food. An app and an entree is enough for two meals, and the price was very reasonable compared with the other bland and tasteless option in Westlake. We loved all of it. I watched them pull our naan out of the oven. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Their goat dishes are as good as the ones I have eaten at restaurants in Delhi. The naan is really something, and even the raita is on point! The best \"Indian\" restaurant in NE Ohio. Make sure to order off the menu."}
{"text":"They did not have more than half of items on their menu. People working had no clue how to run the business. Apparently management has changed. No customer in the restaurant . Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"delicious quick and cheap  want Indian/middle eastern in the time it takes to read this...  They did it  staff was kind.   naan was tasty afghan chicken wrap well spiced.  I will be returning to this establishment"}
{"text":"They place is over price for the service and quality. The buffet can also be considered overpriced given they have very limited options, but the food taste good and they serve real fresh naan. The kitchen seems very clean after seeing it through the service window, which is not much seen for similar Indian/Pak restaurants and definitely a plus. After few disappointments with their prices, I am forced to go to restaurants who have more options for similar food while charging way less."}
{"text":"We had the Lamb kefta's for lunch and  they were good. But I have to admit the Nann bread and the Falafel were the best. Had a Groupon so the price was great, but we would go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I never got a chance to eat this food.  My family and I attempted to try this location for the first time today.  When we went in the restaurant, they were completely empty.  It was a very casual restaurant, so we decided to order our food as take out.  Assuming there were no other orders they were working on, our food should have been ready fairly quickly.  We sat there waiting, and about 5 minutes later, two other couples came in to order.  I'm not sure what the problem was in the kitchen, but after 40 minutes, all of us (my family and the other 2 parties) were still sitting there waiting.  My husband went to the counter to express his displeasure with the long wait.  The guy at the counter ran into the kitchen to help, and he bagged up our order within a couple of minutes.  We took our food home, only to find 2 out of the 3 meals missing.  I was extremely disappointed to say the least.  My husband returned to the restaurant to show them what they had given us and ask for a refund.  Instead of apologizing, they tried to give us the missing food that had been sitting there for the last 15 minutes.  Everything was horribly cold at that point, so why would we want any of it?  Guess I won't be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Great place. It was very clean and the staff was great. Had some veggie samosas and Kabob sandwiches wrapped with Naan.  Great for eating in or take out. My wife and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife were looking around for good falafel and chicken wraps around North Olmsted mall and stumbled upon this awesome place! The food is fantastic! Their afghani chicken wrap was amazing. Portion size was perfect for me and prices are very reasonable... Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Update on my initial review. What started as a specialty restaurant with kababs and wraps and seasonal fresh curries has now turned into a usual Indian restaurant with 4 page menu and 30+ curries on the menu.   Prices have also gone up.  Daily special curries around $7.49 are now all around $8.49 or higher.  Paneer curries are close to $11. He is now charging prices of a full service restaurant in a place with no table service!! The buffet prices have come down to other restaurant levels. The flavor profile is still there.....but my paneer tikka masala was flavorful but was watery (consistency was too thin).   Veg jalfrezi was too oily.  Side of rice as well - well seasoned and nice cumin flavor (jeera rice) but was oily. I graded from 4 to 3 stars.  Hopefully they can earn it back with good food again."}
{"text":"This.  Takes. The. BESTOFAWARD! Seriously my new favorite Indian and now trumps Cafe Tandor.  We tried and foodgasmed: garlic naan, the house rice, the samosas w/chutnies, butter chicken, malai kofta, lamb kabob served with pickled red cabbage salad, kids chicken kabob w/fries (which was STILL amazing), and the kids chicken sammie..... Uh. So good. One of the best spontaneous dinner choices ever!  **Please note this is set up like a takeout/Chipotle-style place and there is lots of seating for you to grab a drink and eat in house.  **Have some patience and leave the fast-food mentality at the door as the TWO workers prepare your amazingly-fresh food...especially if you're walking in to order. It's not terribly long,  but not sitting-under-a-hot-lamp fast.    Now that the staples are amazing, I'm looking forward to going back and trying their more specialized dishes.  The best parts besides the amazing food...stopping at the Indian grocery next door for some spices and lentils....and then stopping in two doors down to look at musical instruments. Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"Slowly getting into Indian food. This place is not fancy by any means but what matters is the food. They have a small buffet during lunch hours but it is limited to just a couple choices. Order off the main menu and I would recommend the chicken tika wrap. Very basic but good flavors. Their homemade pita bread was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This was not a very good experience. The reviews we read don't really align with the actual experience in the restaurant. We walked in and there was a menu posted on the wall, behind the counter, and some pictures posted on the wall of menu options. The pictures were deceiving as the young man wearing flip flops, taking our order, informed us that several selections we made were not available. Once we finally found some options that were available, we grabbed a Tupperware pitcher of water from the cooler and 2 styrofoam cups, and grabbed some silverware and the 1 napkin that was laying on the table near the counter.  We ordered some hummus as an app, side salads,  and some traditional dishes from the menu. We waited 23 minutes for our hummus that was freshly microwaved (you can see into the kitchen). The hummus was chunky, lacked flavor, and was served with some flimsy pita pockets that looked like they came from Save A Lot.  Another 10 minutes in and we received our food. It was well prepared, hefty portions, and the taste was satisfactory. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was great, we were starving by the time it arrived, and would've settled for nearly anything.  After we bussed our own table, we paid our bill, and I was stunned that the total came to 39.98!  We should have gone to Aladdin's!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today after reading about it on yelp. The tandoori shrimp I ordered came with about 5 or 6 *huge* (I MEAN HUGE) shrimp cooked to a perfect hue of red, served on a bed of rice, along with grilled onions and red peppers ($14.95). I had the sweet lassi to drink ($2.99), which was excellent. To expound on the lassi--I learned that it was not made with rosewater, as I had previously assumed these types of drinks were, but rather with cardamom. To further expound, some lassis are indeed made with rosewater (as I discovered later online), but at Kabob Place, they happen to be made with cardamom instead. I chose not to get the lunch buffet (8.95 weekdays) because I'm not crazy about lentils and a few of the other offerings included in that deal. They also have a bunch of other to-go lunch deals ranging in price from $2 for 2 samosas to $7.99 for a chicken kabob."}
{"text":"We went here this past Sunday night. I had seen a Groupon for them and we decided to try the place. They had good reviews on here and Groupon, and we love Indian and Mediterranean style restaurants.  When we got there it was dead. The guy behind the counter had no personality and seemed like he was pissed that we were even there. We ordered our food I got a shrimp kabob and my boyfriend got some lamb patty like meal,we also got garlic naan and a mango lassi. We didn't even tell them we had a Groupon right up front. The guy told us to sit anywhere and he proceeded to turn in our food ticket. There was one guy in the back cooking. Now I saw some take out food coming up in the window and I have worked In the restaurant industry but 30 minutes waiting for our food and drink was a little much. The one guy behind the counter went to help maybe twice and still it was taking forever! Finally our meals came out. Not the mango lassi drink or naan yet. The food was pretty terrible and when the lassi came out about 5 minutes later that was horrible also. When we had finished pretty much with our meals the naan came out. That was the only semi decent thing with our meal. After the Groupon the meal was about 13 dollars I think that was to much even to pay. The guy never said he was sorry for how long the food took or anything. He pretty much the whole time was pissed off at the world. Needless to say we won't ever go back."}
{"text":"This place has excellent Indian food that is very fresh with large portions too. More importantly, the prices are very fair compared to other Indian places in the area. For example, Chicken Tikka Masala, garlic naan, and rice will run you about $10-11 here. If you were at Cafe Tandoor the same meal would easily be over $20.   I've been here around 4 times now and will continue to come back! Definitely worth a try if you are craving some Indian Food!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for Indian good. It is probably the best place in the area but not many people know about is existence. Try it out and you will be a fan."}
{"text":"We tried The Kabob Place for the first time this weekend! First advice- please dine in only if you have a lot of time to kill and wait! Secondly - pref order the kababs and don't experiment much with the menu! We tried the kabab combination #3 and the chicken chargha which is listed in the signature dishes! The kababs were amazing - succulent, juicy, aromatic and yumm! The chargha was a tad disappointing cos although it said fried chicken marinated in  yogurt n spices - I was looking for something that would be similar to the kababs except that it was fried n not smoked in tandoor! But the chargha was oily, dry and was accompanied with just fries no sauces or even raita that could compensate for the lack of masalas inside the chicken! And the worst part was we had to wait for almost 1.30 hrs for our food! Overall the experience of the kabob place is ok, the chargha was bad but the naans and kababs are the best highlight of the place! I'd like to try their weekend buffet sometime!"}
{"text":"Loved the place. We ordered off the menu, and the garlic Naan and hummus was amazing. Everything we ordered was made fresh and was very flavorful."}
{"text":"I never had Indian food before but I've always wanted to try it. After reading reviews for multiple Indian restaurants, I've decided that I wanted to check out Kabob Place with my boyfriend for a low key birthday lunch.   We were greeted as soon as we came through the door. The restaurant is a no frills type of place which I don't mind. The restaurant was VERY clean. They had a lunch buffet & that's what I wanted to try. They didn't have many dishes, it's a small buffet. They had butter chicken, chicken curry, rice, lentils, naan, & a couple of other dishes. They butter chicken was delicious!! The chicken was all white meat smothered in a creamy tomato sauce. It had just a slight kick to it but it wasn't spicy. I dipped the naan in the sauce when I ate up all the chicken. My boyfriend really like the curry chicken & the butter chicken as well. The lunch buffet was only $8.95 which is a super inexpensive price for the quality of food that is offered at a buffet!"}
{"text":"The kabab tasted like it was previously frozen, and curries were mainly sauce and no meat. We thought the wraps were very thin, and there were better kabab sandwiches elsewhere. The vegetable biryani had a lot of flavor and was a very generous portion, so no complaints there. The place was kind of cold and bare, not really very welcoming."}
{"text":"Run like a mall food court store. Place is dirty. Food was so so. It felt like old food warmed up.  Dessert came from the front fridge with plastic spoons. The restaurant was swept while we ate and the trash thrown right next to us into a garbage can. Been looking for a good Pakistani restaurant. This is not it."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious food on their buffet. Great variety of vegetarian and meat dishes as well as the degree of spiciness. We stumbled upon this place but we will definitely make a point of going back again."}
{"text":"We were surprised to find a good pakistani restaurant in Cleveland. The samosas were fresh, chicken tikka Kebob was very tender, and Karahi chicken was a bit spicy but had good flavor. Will definite be back!"}
{"text":"The food is really bad here. As someone who lives in Westlake, I was really hoping it wasn't. But I ordered a few dishes and noted that they added a generic sauce to Kadahi chicken (that is usually cooked with fresh vegetables), their mint chutney was stale, chappli kabob was stale and seemed like it was just heated up.  The only good news here are the naan's!"}
{"text":"So we were not planning on going to this place, but our original destination was closed. So we opened our handy Yelp app and this was the closest location...AND WE WERE BLOWN AWAY!  This place has an indian food buffet all weekend long! We ordered hummus as an appetizer and they chef made us a fresh batch. We were also made naan fresh whenever we wanted!  My friend had been looking for an indian dessert called Carrot Halwa and low and behold, they served it, and it was amazing!  This place was an amazing find and I loved that they served all different types of mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"I'm deferring to my wife on this rating. Stopped for lunch on a weekday and both got their buffet. It is quite limited, with beautifully prepared rice, naan plain and decked out, \"kabob\" chicken, a chickpea dish, a mixed vegetable slurry, a curried chicken and another chicken dish in a red sauce. That's it! Both the rice and the naan were as good as I've had.  The chickpea dish I found kinda boring, just kinda bland to me. For some reason, when I think kabob, I think nicely trimmed choice chunks of boneless/skinless protein of some kind on a skewer.  My picture and theirs blur somewhat when compared. No skewer, but on a buffet that makes sense. The chicken was small chunks some of which had random bones, including thigh bone and breastplate bones and tiny hard-to-remove-demurely random shard-like bits. Definitely not date-night material if not choking, or looking cool or even marginally refined are on your personal menu. Happily the two sauced dishes featured boneless bits. The sauces were both fine, but more suited to less adventurous palates, no zip at all to the curry. The mixed vegetables had insufficient eye-appeal to find their way onto either of our plates, but they had to taste better than they looked. Beverages are picked from a limited selection of cans and bottles, and it's bus yourself, so your date won't be impressed by the service unless you're doing the providing."}
{"text":"Not a expert on Indian cuisine but wanted to try something different and had a mixed grill everything was delicious...... You order your food and then sit down they do not serve you but it is definitely worth it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I always wonder why it was always so empty because I think the food is very good. I've ordered take out here twice and every time I enjoyed my meal. First time I ordered Falafel, a Spicy Lamb Curry, and Garlic Naan. Second time I ordered Samosas, Spicy Bone-In Goat Biryani, and a Kefta Kabob. The main entrees had a good spicy kick, but it wasn't burning my tongue. The Falafel and the Samosas were very filling and would definitely recommend the Biryani if you like savory rice pilaf. Will come back when I'm craving Indian/Afghan food."}
{"text":"Fabulous food for a very reasonable price. Even my husband who doesn't like this cuisine,  LOVE the Butter Chicken and Nan! My Lamb Kabobs were cooked perfectly, and the red cabbage salad was delicious.  I will order a large side of the salad next time to take home.  The only down side is the dining room. It is spartan and I can foresee issues when they get busy, as they prefer to have you order at the front. That said, we got table side service for our group of four adults and two children. The dining room actually worked out well for us with the kids!   We will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"I liked the food but Jst wish it was a sit down reasturant did not like the cafetiera feeling.  Also they could work on decorations feeling more comfotable and homey instead of a mall feeling"}
{"text":"best kabobs in town/state . So juice and delicious I love the Chicken tikka Kabob little spicy & afghani kabob which is super lite mild & the chickpea curry is off the roof too & naan is super fluffy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst kebabs that I've ever tasted.   The kofta is no better (actually, not even as good as) a White Castle burger.   The tandoori kebabs aren't spiced well and it didn't taste like it came from a real tandoor oven.   The afghan kebab was almost... Soapy.   Mint chutney? Awful.   The service was slow - the staff almost seemed ashamed to work there.   The rice was the only palatable dish.   A true Hole in the wall, but not in a good way."}
{"text":"Not bad, not the best ever. I've been here a couple times since I came for a work function and I've always been satisfied with what I've ordered, but always disliked the amount of my bill. I think after coming here a few times I've decided that the price is not worth what you get. Which is disappointing because the service is nice. But I just feel that the cost vs. quality/experience you get is not worth it. :("}
{"text":"I went here late, around 8pm on a Sunday. It was crowded! The lamb was gone, awww but oh my the kabobs are fantastic. Moist!! Flavorful!! I ordered 3 different combos for take out. Chicken Makhani, Chicken Tikka, Kabob & chicken plate. The red slaw as well as the yogurt sauce accompaniments  were nice. All came with rice. For Makhani it's all about the sauce with bread to dip(for me). You meat eaters may find the chicken was a little sparse although very tasty. Add 3 extra naan, Mango Lassi (delicious), Carrot Halwa (taste very much like the filling of a sweet potato pie), a $46. price tag that fed 5.   God Willing I'll be back for the lamb, ras malai, more kabobs and saag(spinach)w/ paneer."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating indain food and i was impressed!! Everything was so fresh and flavorful, and delicious. We order Dahi bataa puri which is now my favorite appitizer! we also order chicken tikka and afgahani kabob, loved it. we dovoured it all and was competely satisfied. Definitly reccommend this place for good tasty indain and a mix of middle eastern kabobs!"}
{"text":"Great little place serving fast-casual Indian and Middle Eastern food.  It's located in a small plaza off Center Ridge. You walk up to the counter and order from the menu boards. They have ample seating inside, but it's nothing fancy. They used to have a lunch buffet 7 days a week, but now it's only M-F. :(   The first time I stopped in with my sister, we each ordered entrees from the kabob menu and a side of Naan.  Wow, the food was fantastic!  I ordered the lamb kabob and my sister had chicken. The meat was perfectly tender and flavorful and the Naan was super airy and soft...perfect!  The second time, I ordered Butter Chicken and a side of naan from the Indian menu.  The flavor of the sauce was spot on, but the chicken tasted a bit overdone and maybe like it was reheated from last night?  The rice that came with it seemed like some Uncle Bens microwaved instant rice..no fluffiness at all...lacking gluten. Not acceptable! Definitely different from the basmati rice I had the first time.  My meal would've been perfect had they fixed the chicken and the rice.  Overall, it's a good place. I just bought a Groupon for Kabob Place. We'll see how my next visit goes."}
