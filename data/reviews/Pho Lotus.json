{"text":"I've been here twice and food has been excellent! I had the same server as well and is such a sweet, attentive guy. The Phò broth is perfect, the salad was fresh and so yummy. They also have superb fresh rolls, I can't wait to come back to try more. The restaurant is also very clean."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review as I enjoy seeing small Mom and pop places flourish.  My wife and I both ordered grilled pork bahn mi's and then an order of the pork and egg roll vermicelli.  The bahn mi's were very bland and had very little ingredients in them especially for the $7 price. The bread was not the right kind and tasted stale.  The vermicelli came with a very small amount of nuoc mam to give the noodles flavor, the egg roll tasted freezer burned and the pork was all fat. I was so disappointed as I truly enjoy Vietnamese food and have visited Vietnam 3 times. I was hoping to like this place because it was so close to my house but unfortunately will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that they opened in this part of Gilbert. I used to drive 25 mins each way to get good Pho in Chandler. The chicken pho here is awesome. Lean white meat, fresh herbs and jalapeños and the broth was simply perfect. Won't have to drive to Chandler anymore! Highly recommend the chicken pho. Hubby got the vegetable fried rice and it had large chunks of perfectly cooked vegetables and a mild fried rice - he ate the whole thing and said he would want it again. These are the only two dishes we tried and I highly recommend both. I ordered it take out but was in the dining room waiting, it's nicely lit and there is a tv so you could watch a game, etc. It was clean and has plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This is a really awesome pho spot. Went in for the first time tonight with my toddler about 8 pm, it wasn't busy. Sat down and was greeted right away and got drinks. I ordered spring rolls and seafood pho, and orange chicken for my little one. About halfway through the spring rolls (which were awesome) my tiny human started to show signs of an eminent meltdown, so i asked for a box, our server came back with the box quickly and let us know that he'd get the kitchen to put the rest of our meal in to-go containers so we could split. This is just, so nice. I think all parents can share my appreciation for little things like this when our kids are not on their best behavior . Now, happily eating at home, this seafood pho is the best I've ever had. It's a really generous portion and my 3 year old hi-jacked it from me. I'll definitely be back and keep it bookmarked as a go-to Uber Eats fav."}
{"text":"A few hiccups to start off:  We walked in on a Sat at 5:30, no one greeted us. Looked like the place was empty. We waited for a few minutes until I finally just called the place while I was sitting in their restaurant. Someone finally walked off of the kitchen and I hung up. Lol. That's one way of getting their attention.  Secondly when we got our spring rolls the extre dinner plates they gave us was dirty, which they were apologetic about.   Anyway the food came out and everything was amazing.  We had: Seafood pho  Chicken pho Orange chicken Shrimp spring rolls Crab wantons.  All amazing!  Few things to improve upon for enhancing restaurant experience:  1) turn off \"Friends\" on tv and instead play authentic vientnamese music or Asian music. Better than \"Friends\"  2) minor stuff...no hand towels on the bathroom and clocks not working.  Overall great food and will be back again."}
{"text":"Good pho for the price. I ordered pick up, I got the meatball pho and an order of the crab wontons. The crab wontons were more on the salty side and the dipping sauce provided was a fish based sauce. The wontons would have been perfect if it was paired with a sweet n sour sauce as it would have complemented the saltiness in the wontons. The meatball pho was very delicious! They give you a good portion of meatballs and garnishes. Broth was great, not overly fatty just the right balance of flavor and lightness. I wouldn't order the wontons again and suggest asking for extra plum and hot sauce if you get pho! Giving this place 4 stars despite  no one answering when I called right when they opened... I tried multiple times in the first half hour and just ended up calling back later in the afternoon. I also was told 15 minutes for my order to be ready and it took me 30 minutes to get there. They hadn't begun making my order yet so I had to wait another 10 minutes... feeling generous with my review since this place is also brand new."}
{"text":"After a night of heavy drinking and waking up with a top 3 hangover the fiancee and I decided on pho. We also decided we weren't leaving the house to get it. I located pho lotus on Uber eats, but has never heard of them. It arrived quick. It was delicious. I was instantly revived by the pho soup. The broth was perfectly seasoned. The portion size was good. I no longer have to drive to West Mesa to find good pho."}
{"text":"Great food! Large dishes at a good price. Average $8-$10 per dish. The sandwiches are delcious. Also had the Duong Chau fried rice now my new favorite fried rice.  I particularly love bread roll the sandwich comes on, sweet and chewy inside, crunchy on the outside. Just overall great. Quick and attentive service."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good.  Had the spring rolls, crab wontons, and a vermicelli bowl. Service was good only complaint was there needed to be a bit more ventilation in the place.  Customer service was good and we will be back"}
{"text":"Go to take out food. Usually get pad Thai and Pho. Both are large portions (I can eat the Pho for about three days) and I generally just crave the broth some days. You can add veggies which make it more filling. Love this place!    Pho is the perfect sick/hungover food, just for the record."}
{"text":"Finally found a Pho place in Gilbert that is great! My roommate and I go about once a week to get pho and so glad we don't have to drive far to get something with great spring rolls, pho ga, pho tai nam, and iced thai tea. Server usually by himself but gets everything out and very attentive. Even ordered togo (postmates) when I was sick and Great togo, had everything I needed."}
{"text":"Pho was great. Very nice server. He was very attentive and great with my kids. Spring rolls were very good. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this joint, and my wife and I are so very excited that we are only a few minutes walk away. We plan on eating here often. my wife had the chicken pho and I had the brisket pho, they where both packed full of flavor. Great portions and the service was very pleasant. Definitely plan on sampling there whole menu. Day by day!! Lol."}
{"text":"I just watched the owner chew out one waitress in front of the customers asking a simple question. It was beyond awkward and embarrassing for the entire room. Perhaps the owner should learn how to treat people with respect and dignity while understanding how unprofessional her behavior was.   I won't support a business that treats staff this way and neither should you."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, once in restaurant and the other time was take-out. I have nothing bad to say about the food! I wouldn't consider myself the most knowledgeable about pho/Vietnamese food, but everything I've tried I've enjoyed. It tastes fresh and it's affordable, what more could you want? The service is horribly slow, and both times there has been an issue with my order. The staff is so friendly and I'd hate to leave a bad review, but honestly if it wasn't for the food I'd probably give it 3 stars. I'm hoping the lackluster service is because they're new and still staffing. I'll definitely be eating here again, but I might be sticking to their take-out for now."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often but after reading these previous reviews I didn't think it fair not share our positive experience. My husband and I went about a week ago to try the pho during their 50% off special. We started with edamame then I got the brisket pho which was good and husband got vegetable fried rice. Besides the edamame not being hot, the food was good and service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable, nice and everything was timely. I definitely recommend giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Came here after the gym. As it's right next to the gym. Convenience wise good for me. I did not try the pho over here, but I tried the traditional rice dish with pork slices. I would say it's pretty good and would probably eat it again if I had a craving. Lots of flavor in the pork and they have fish sauce and a spicy sauce that made it even better. Pretty good amount to fill you up after working out. Pricing was on the higher side, might have been around $9.  Cashier was friendly. Parking is not an issue.   Main issue is you might have to wait a little bit, so maybe try ordering ahead of time before coming here if you want to pick up. Took around 25 to 30 minutes waiting to get my food.  I would come here just because of the convenience, location, and the food with regards to the rice dish is actually decent. I would wish the price would be cheaper and the wait time would be faster. Solve the wait time by ordering earlier."}
{"text":"Saw their page on Facebook and it had a 4.8 review, which I'm starting to think they're just friends with the owners.  We went to try this place out on Sunday while their 50% deal was still going on, unfortunately we were misinformed, it was only 50% off PHO entrées only. We ordered spring rolls, egg rolls, Tom yum soup, and two beef combo phosphorus, as well as a lemonade and two waters.  PROS: BRISKET, TENDONS, AND PHO NOODLES WERE GOOD. LEMONGRASS TOM YUM SOUP was also good. I think it was the owner who came out and asked us how everything was and she had a little chat with me about that was in the Tom yum soup to make it so delicious.    CONS:  -service was slow even though we were the only people there, and our server didn't know the menu (it was her second day) but she should have been trained better...  -egg rolls were not what we were use to, it had a different texture and taste, not meaty with glass noodles in it like I'm use to, theirs had like daikon and other veggies with almost no pork in it?  -spring rolls, rice paper were really dry and found an eyelash stuck to it on the inside, also really small.  -I asked if mushrooms were in the Tom yum and they said yes, but then they ran out? -pho broth was also not something I was use to, it had like a nutmeg/Saigon cinnamon flavor to it, for me it was bitter and I didn't care for it. - all of our dishes and plates had alot of wear and tear, the white plates had black smudges all over them? Maybe they got the plates from the last owners of the place, but they definitely weren't new.  So all in all, I don't think we will come back, definitely wasn't our cup of tea. But I wish them the best."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing! Delicious home cooking that I can eat everyday!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Shaker Beef sandwich for lunch.The roll was freshly baked and tasty.The overall taste was very flavorful with the exception of the uber-hot sauce slathered on the sandwich.The beef however is another story.The morsels of beef were incredibly tough and chewy!In fact I have never come across a cut of meat so tough since I under-cooked some stew meat years ago.And when I got home I was in for another shock! I viewed my transaction on line and discovered that my server had added on a 2 dollar plus \"tip\" on my to go order.That I did not authorize.I might have given them a second chance for poor food but not for ripping me off! You lost a customer and any possible future recommendations for two lousy bucks?"}
{"text":"The pho and Ch giò were both very good. I had it delivered by Postmates and it was very fresh. I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pho restaurants that I've been to. Not crowded, but I think that's only because it's brand new. They still have a grand opening sign in front. Once the word gets around, this place will be crowded. Service was great - prompt and very friendly. We had Fried tofu, coconut lemongrass and chicken soup and chicken Pho - all delicious. And we saw a couple of repeat customers come in go while we were there. You can tell they are repeat customers because they knew the owners names. There's a gym a couple doors down and they all look like they just finished a workout and came over for some healthy food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on 11/29, I'm not sure what was here before but it didn't look like a new restaurant. The booths and tables were old and every time I leaned on the table even a little it creaked like it was about to collapse. ANYWAYS, I give my 2 stars to the male who was running the entire front of house, I heard him stating something about them being short staffed and he had to work the front. He was solo, and worked his tail off. Everyone has their own opinions of pho obviously, this one fell severely short for me. The broth smelled of anise (which I don't really care for) but tasted literally like hot water. The meat was grey and I couldn't even stomach eating it. I added my usual fixings and it was just hot sriracha water at that point. I was so looking forward to pho that night as I usually eat it weekly, and I left still hungry. The dumplings and egg rolls were mediocre. But to some they may love them! Just not my cup of tea or pho, shall I say."}
{"text":"Great spring rolls and INCREDIBLE service. DECENT PRICES AND very nice PHO!!!  Love it for being so close! Would define y recommend and comeback."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had. Sandwiches are amazing also! I don't normally write reviews but this place is too good not to share."}
{"text":"I got well done beef pho and it was very tasty I took it home and ate it 20 minutes later and it was still hot she gave me extra basil and lime as asked. My food was ready earlier than I originally was told. My only bad feedback is the restaurant itself is nothing fancy. It's definitely a family-owned business they probably make really good food and don't spend much money or time into Aesthetics. I did use the bathroom and I will say the toilets and the floor was not clean. I would say this is a great place for takeout and while I was there there were five other people getting take out so that tends to be the vibe. The guy was really nice and the cute older ladies that were cooking in the kitchen seemed nice as well."}
{"text":"First time here it was pretty good service was a little slow but I could see there was only one person. I like that they offer more than just pho like sandwiches which I will try next time. I got spring rolls and I loved the peanut sauce. Got the one cold Vermicelli noodles with beef shrimp and egg rolls. I think they threw pork in or the chicken was really overcooked. It was good portions for the price"}
{"text":"Service was great. Server was attentive and welcoming. Food is delicious, however it does not taste authentic. Doesn't mean that it taste bad, but it doesn't taste truly like Vietnamese Pho. Price for what you get is fair, haven't tried other food yet, but overall, it seems like a very good place to eat. Ate here 3 times and never once I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here twice now and it's been fantastic both times.   The broth is steaming hot, the ingredients nicely packaged for to go.   We've tried the shrimp pho and the rare steak pho, both great!"}
{"text":"Had to interrupt my meal to write this. Was not expecting this to be so good. The beef special Pho is perfect. Noodles are plenty and good generous with the meats. Tripe is cooked just right. The flank is nice and tender and the meatballs are dense and tasty [and yes I'm talking about the food food].   Not a destination, since it's in a strip mall in Gilbert AZ but if you happen to be here or near give it a shot. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, and the vegetable Pho w/vegan broth was super yummy!! Definitely bringing my kids with me next time..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery & the 50% first week opening discount didn't count. They said it would take 45 minutes to an hour, ended up taking almost 2 hours to be delivered. I ordered vegetable pho & didn't receive much vegetables. I asked for extra sauce & they gave me very little. The soup for the pho was interesting, it almost tasted minty & the noodles were hard. Probably won't be eating from here again. It'll be more worth it to drive a little farther to other pho places"}
{"text":"Here from Cali. Thought I'd stop in for some good ol' Vietnamese food. Wish I would've picked somewhere else. Feel like I wasted my money. Service was good but food was nothing to come back for. Luckily, I'm going back to Cali tomorrow so I won't have."}
{"text":"Ordered on my way out the door from my work in downtown Phoenix. Prepaid with 20% tip as incentive to provide good service. Arrived home an hour later. Waited another hour for delivery. Contacted Eat24 twice to get status. Food arrived in cool to warm condition. Taste was not appealing. Threw out the majority of the food.   Delivery time: 1 star Taste: 1 star Condition of food: 1 star Price: overly priced for taste and service  Friendliness of driver: 4 stars Service: 1 star Overall experience: Not well. Will not order again and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Very good pho and they deliver which is nice. It doesn't get much better than delicious pho delivered to your door on a cold evening. Order with confidence!"}
{"text":"This is my partner and I's favorite date spot. Not really the most romantic atmosphere, but a great place to people judge *cough cough* I mean, watch.  The staff Is fantastic, service is always speedy and nice, prices are more than reasonable, and the food is varied and suuuuper tasty. Meatball and rare-stake pho, get in my belly. Now."}
{"text":"Newly opened mid October 17.  Located behind the Chevron.  Slow to serve our food.  Courteous and polite.  Chili paste container look like it had not been cleaning maybe a week or two.  The basil was brown in places, no one took the time to make sure that what was being put on the table looked fresh.    Broth was salty, my guess is MSG in the broth.   I thought the PHO was fair.  We also had the fresh Spring Rolls.  They were pretty good, small.   JOhn was our server.   50% off promo running In this first week of their grand opening."}
{"text":"So excited to have a great Vietnamese place in this corner of the valley! My vermicelli bowl was delicious! Fresh and flavorful with a great range of textures and flavors. Can't wait to try the pho and bahn mi sandwiches. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best crab wontons I have ever had!! Good service better food! Had the pineapple fried rice. It came with a lot of celantro on top and at first that scared me, but I mixed it in and it wasn't too powerful. Very good experience!"}
