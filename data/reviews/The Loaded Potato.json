{"text":"I came right when they opened at 11am. There was 2 people already in line in front of me. The sweetest lady ever greeted me and asked if I came in from the news (I guess they had a segment earlier this morning). I explained I work close by and had been wanting to try the place out. I ordered my food, which took way too long for my liking. I could definitely tell Ms.Dee normally doesn't do the ordering/ringing up. Then sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for my food. 45 minutes later I receive my food, and they are missing 1 item... so I wait some more. At last, my order is ready! Then I go to pay after I get my food (which is the strangest thing) they would of let me walk out if I hadn't mentioned I never paid yet. Great food, great people, but they need a lot more help in the back. 1 person to cook and 1 person to take orders obviously isn't cutting it. The people ahead of me actually walked out without getting their food. I mean a 45 minute wait when I was the 3rd person in line for a baked potato seems a little strange to me."}
{"text":"The potato was good size, expected garnishes, but really nothing special in that regard.  But, the sweet potatoe biscuit? was different and good."}
{"text":"I just went in after getting my hair cut.  Man this was a place of comfort! I got loaded fries with brisket and French onion crisp,  if this isn't the best place for a baked potato idk what is.  If you get a chance at all come by and enjoy the great comfort food!!!"}
{"text":"OK, I came here after reading reviews from Yelp and decided to give it a try.

First the good, everything said about Ms. Dee is Right, she is very sweet, like a mom. I called in my order on my break, she took it and helped me with her menu. I was hoping the prices would be online, but had to trust her in giving them to me.
When I got there, there were other patrons (about 3) waiting. There was this young woman, seem nice, that rung up my order. I asked about a menu, she said ask Ms. Dee. Ms. Dee brought my food, thanked me and we even talked a bit about where she came from( Arkansas) and her celebration of one year in business. It was a great experience. 

Driving back, my food smelled so good. The taste of my potato(BBQ brisket, fully loaded) was good, not great(had to add some salt). 

The sweet potato pie I had to order was THE meal for me. Only my mom's is better.

The bad, as mentioned, I had to add salt, which was not in the bag. For a loaded potato with brisket that was not really bbq'd, I think the price was very high. 4.50 for a medium potato and 4.75 for brisket felt high. The pie was 1.75, I would pay 2.00 for that. I didn't felt full afterwards which spending 13.00 for felt worse. I believe I was overcharged as my receipt showed three items when I left with two, also not good.

Final thoughts,  if I had to rate my experience, this would be it: out of 1to 5(5 being best), customer service 5, taste of food, potato 4, pie 5, value of food to cost 3.

In the end, The Loaded Potato is a nice place but beware of the cost to value. I still felt I was robbed a buck (forced tip?), and hope if Ms. Dee is reading this she would make that right some how. I wish her well, just not sure if I would return. Even for the pie."}
{"text":"If one good thing can be said about chain restaurants it's that the people who work there generally exhibit a sense of urgency. This place was a waste of time."}
{"text":"We didn't realize this was aimed at take-out orders when we first went and waited quite a long time... TOTALLY worth it! The food is ridiculously good! We ordered jerk chicken on sweet potato and jambalaya on regular potato for dinner and strawberry sweet potato and marshmallow sweet potato for desserts, as well as some wings. Not a mediocre food in the lot. And the staff are so friendly! This is the perfect example of the mom and pop local shops we love to explore and support. They even went through the extra trouble of accommodating several food allergies, finding us dishes we could have or ways we could alter existing dishes to be safe. We will definitely be back next weekend to try more dishes, although we will put our order in ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after seeing on Yelp and it is the bomb! Huge potato with brisket and the works. I am so happy I stopped here. I got a jumbo and I will probably take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"A-MA-ZING!!! Love love love Ms. Delores (owner) potatoes.  She is the potatoe queen. Family owned and operated, the best. A must try."}
{"text":"Amazing concept !! Try the jerk chicken fully loaded / fried onions and fried Jalapenos"}
{"text":"Great service wonderful cashier name mariah that I am so proud of ....overall best loaded potatoes in the valley..."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to go to not only get good food but excellent customer service and a feeling of warmth and welcoming!! Ironically, I remember the owner, miss Dee from having a candy store in the neighborhood way back when I was a young kid in junior high school!!! She had the best hot wings ever!!! To see her flourishing with her own business is an amazing sight. Don't think about it just go, you won't regret the decision!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is great here from the people to the service. Mrs. Dee took time to cook for me even though it was about to close. Support her and her family eat there you will love it"}
{"text":"Im hooked,  my loaded baked potato with chili and crispy jalapeños was to die for. There are so many options it will take me 10 more visits to get through half of the menu.

I have already planned my next visit. Fish Friday from 4pm to 8pm."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times and Ms Dee never disappoints!! We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I think it's fair to say this is fast food.  Really Good fast food!  I had a large potato with the Jambalaya as my meat choice, monterey jack cheese, and fried onions on top (and all the \"fully loaded\" options).  It was delicious!  It was also very filling.  It did turn out to be a little oily by the end and I also discovered that while I had ordered a sweet potato, I had received a regular potato.  My wife had the fully loaded potato with no meat or cheese, which she also really enjoyed.

It is take-out only and the folks here are really nice.  Miss D greeted me when I came in and waved goodbye when I left.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesomeness in a potato! Very friendly and personal! Don't usually do reviews but this place deserves it. Will definitely be one of my regular spots!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal with great staff! My friend even got the \"fake\" potatoes and it was so good, you would never know! We will be back. One thing to note - no soups in summer..."}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about this little gem of a place and had to try it for myself. I was greeted with \"We've been waiting for you\" I was so pleasantly surprised with the friendliness. I was amazed at the amount of food you get for the price besides the fact that it was DELICIOUS!! 
The variety of toppings, meats and the diverse choices of ethnic flavor options will keep this place open for a long, long time. 
I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about the food here?  Scrumptious, delectable, ravishing.  My husband's employer, Liberty Mutual, offered us coupons for this place through Restaurant.com.  Spend $20, and you get $10 off.  Good deal to me.

He went to pick it up and brought it back home.  First, I have never seen a potato this large in my life.  Second, the quality of the potato was second to none.  (I have no idea where they got this potato, but it sure as hell beats the ones you buy in the store.)  Third, the quality of the toppings was stellar, too.  Put it all together, and you have a supreme delight that you can't put down.  I know I didn't.

Even after a 15-minute drive to bring it home to me, the potato was still great.  In fact, all the juices had marinated, allowing flavor to seep all the way through.  This worked out well, actually, because the size of the potato naturally would mean that after you get through the toppings, you'll have nothing but starch left over.

Although I didn't experience it, my husband said that the owner's customer service was remarkable.  Apparently, she came and sat down with him in the lobby and explained all the different options.  She wasn't pushy; he actually said she made it seem like she was inviting him into her home.

The food and experience were so good that we plan to go back and will happily pay full price.  I plan to do what I can to help get the word out, because I am sure if more people know about this hole-in-the-wall place, it'd be bringing in a boatload of cash."}
{"text":"Ms. Dee was very accommodating and explained to me the best way to load my potatoes. I tried their loaded potatoes with brisket and was it was amazing. But the star of the show is the baked potato pie. It was heavenly! Comfort food for me at its best with a gracious hostess and a little kid that kept me entertained while waiting!"}
{"text":"My mom just bought me a potato from here & I start to eat it ... The potato has not been cooked all the way & the meat (curry) isn't season well. Totally waste of money. My 5 yr old spit out his pepperoni pizza potato ... Now we have to find something else for dinner"}
{"text":"Don't pass this place up!!! Took a chance on this tiny, locally owned spot after finding great reviews on yelp. I have to admit that seeing the little shopping center it was in, I almost didn't go but I at least have to try something once. And I'm so glad I did! The little shop was clean inside, the staff was so friendly. And best of all, the potatoes were amazing! For a decent price, you get so much food and everything was so good! You can get 4 different sizes of potatoes filled with your choice of toppings. I got the medium sized potato and with the toppings I was only able to eat half of it. It was huge! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the positive reviews, a bit disappointed I didn't get to try this place. Why?!? - because this place isn't open. It's Saturday 12:45, gave it about 15 mins to see if someone showed up. I'm totally wasting my time. Hours of operation clearly say Saturday 10:00 am to 9:00 pm. God forbid maybe an emergency happened."}
{"text":"I first have to say that I love Miss D. She is so sweet with a little sassiness! Very pleasant person.  The two negatives about this restaurant are price and wait time. I got the small potato with bbq chicken and veggies at the tune of $12.  Wow!  And the wait?........................waiting......waiting.....waiting....30 minutes later......LOL
The potato was good but I'm not sure I will return due to the wait and price."}
{"text":"I don't take the time very often to write a review of a place I've eaten, I'll make the exception for The Loaded Potato.

I had the jambalaya loaded potato, she was out of the batch she made, so she made it fresh for me. I didn't have time to speak while I was eating this thing, absolutely delicious.

My wife had the pulled pork with coleslaw, it was every bit as good as mine if not better. The collection of flavors of both were amazing.

This place is fairly new, they said they are planning on getting a better sign, but for now look for it carefully. You don't want to miss out on this gem hidden in the sand."}
{"text":"I've been there twice. The first time, there was a few people in front of me,  the order took a little longer than I think they expected and I expected. but the food was delicious, so I went back again.  I wanted to have the same thing but she recommended that I try something else. I was reluctant so she suggested I try half brisket and half pulled  pork, and what a great recommendation. The food was out in a timely manner and the food is really good. Bottom line if you're in a hurry go to a fast food restaurant, but if you have just a little time it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, Ms Dee made our potatoes and she was just so sweet and personable!"}
{"text":"Sweetest, most welcoming woman ever!  I don't mind eating in a dive provided the food is good snd this is where Miss Dee missed.  10 bucks was more food and drink than I could consume but there are better values for the dollar nearby.  My biggest complaint was how little was honemade.  The jerk chicken I ordered was freshly cooked chicken breast seasoned with a factory made seasoning blend as was the sauce.  The fried jalapeños were the same crud McDonald's uses.  I would really like to see her cook, I bet it would be incredible."}
{"text":"Hey Everybody just a note to update:

 Miss Dee said The Loaded potato website is being updated so please keep trying back should be done soon. 
 Just want to say Thank you Miss Dee was for calling our office this afternoon when we were unable to reach her to place our order.
 My loaded Buffalo Chicken was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time at Loaded Potato. I came here three times before but they were closed.  After talking with Dee, she said they are closed Sunday's and Monday's and open up a bit later on Saturday's, so that contributed to my problem. The neighborhood BTW, is horrible. 

I arrived at 6 PM on a Wednesday and it was empty. Dee took care of me, tho, when she saw me wandering the lobby. It was a bit confusing until she got me straightened out. I ordered a large potato which is about 6\" long. The jumbo is at least 8-9\". The potatoes come with a lot of toppings, including one protein. I chose brisket and it came to $11.37. 

Soulful Pandora music like Mary J Blige played on the TV while I waited. It took about 10 minutes to build my dinner. 

The potato was fluffy and cooked just right. The brisket very flavorful as were the rest of the toppings. I really couldn't improve on it if I tried, so I'll come back."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I all agree that this was the best baked potato we had ever had! I recommend the bbq brisket and the maple sweet potatoe cheesecake! Enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"Such a fun alternative to the usual eateries! Ms. Dee is the most fun & friendly personality. It was my first time, and she will walk you through everything. The customer service here is outstanding. 

With any small, hole-in-the-wall eatery, don't expect to be in & out quickly. They make everything FRESH. And make it as ordered. So you know you are going to get exactly what you ordered and it will be 100% freshly prepared. This is a very small place, so the inside dining area is limited & very crowded, but I ordered mine to go. So that was not an issue. This is a place I will continue to visit. Can't beat some good comfort food & more than pleasant service."}
{"text":"This is seriously a good potato!  I chose the brisq, loaded. Love it. The people are super friendly."}
{"text":"Just get the gigantic potato (if you want to get full) and let Miss D tell you how to order.   I had the BBQ brisket loaded with everything and fried onions.  SOOOO GOOD!  No place to sit down and eat so make this a call-in, to-go or a Grub Hub meal.  This is the hood y'all, but you won't regret your trek here.  Next time I will make sure to try one of the dessert sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Random find on my phone. I'll def be back for lunch again. Ms Dee is very nice!"}
{"text":"Found this little divey place on Yelp and after reading a few reviews I had to try it out. The ladies/ owner there were super friendly and we shared a buffalo chicken loaded potato that was awesome and a philly sandwich that was great too. My daughter loved the broccoli cheese spud and would surely go back:) well done ladies. Like your style;)"}
{"text":"This place was very good. Definitely give it a try. The owner Ms. D was wonderful and cooked everything to order. I had the jambalaya potato and it was chocked full of sausage, chicken, and shrimp. Really good."}
{"text":"I had the loaded jambalaya and the food was phenomenal, miss d was great too. The seating was minimal which is the only reason for four stars instead of five."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and honestly it was okay.. Service was a little delayed waited at least 15 extra minutes after calling in my order. Ordered the bbq brisket and there was so much fat on the brisket I like my brisket shredded and the potatoes itself was hard. Good concept I don't think ill come back any time soon. Stomach is still upset from the fat on meat. Need more employees then just two doing everything."}
{"text":"Stopped in the Phoenix area and looked up places to eat. Found this spot and I'm always a sucker for loaded baked potatoes. Stopped by and was greeted by the very friendly Miss \"D\". Lots of ways to load up your spud and from the smells that were coming from the kitchen I was looking forward to my order. Ordered a Jumbo with pulled pork. Miss \"D\" helped make some suggestions, and I wasn't disappointed. A lot of times I get a baked potato and I always feel the toppings are skimped on. Not here, great topping to spud ratio. The interior is pretty bare, more for a takeout spot and you could easily drive by it, but stop in and try it out."}
{"text":"I've had the jerk chicken and Buffalo chicken so far and they were absolutley amazing! The Buffalo chicken baked potato with all types of fixings was THEE best baked potato I've Ever had in my life! This place is a must try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"These potatoes are truly made from love!!! I ordered the jerk chicken fully loaded potato...BOMB.com!! No skimpy toppings, full of chicken and flavor! Oh and the kool-aid is on point too"}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming store.  I got a loaded potato with pulled pork, nacho cheese,  and fried wontons.  It was really delicious and every bite was a trip!"}
{"text":"I went here based on the Yelp reviews....... I'm guessing I just got a bad meal, probably the exception, but this was case.....

I waited for 35 to 40 minutes on my food, that was tough for me, I work a lot of hours and every minute waiting at lunch is that much later I leave for home at night. Also, while waiting in the lobby, there were children there which is no big deal except that one of them in particular kept yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs in an echo chamber of a room, that alone will usually mean that I won't return.

So, I got a jumbo potato with pulled pork.
When I got it, it had a bit of a funny smell, but being a new place and a lot of items were on it, I thought nothing of it. Ate half of it for lunch, it was OK, not great, not bad.....But, I felt ill about an hour later and ended up pretty sick the rest of the evening. (out both ends, I know TMI)

The next day when I got to work I pulled the other half out of the fridge, opened the box and a RANCID stench came running out at full speed smacking me right in both nostrils... Nearly made me throw up again for the 6th or 7th time. I believe the pork was not just bad, but rotten. So, so nasty the next day.... good food will not smell rancid 24 hours later in the refrigerator.....

Miss D was a very nice lady and I do wish her the best, but there are times when I cannot give a place a second try, this is one of those times.

Based on the other reviews, you might want to try it out, I hope you have better luck than I did...."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today and it was fantastic...I had the pulled pork loaded potato and was spot on.  I wanted the brisket but she didn't have it until tomorrow...Miss Dee is the owner and one gracious woman..She is very funny and down to earth.. I got the medium potato and was more than enough to eat. You have got to go..."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers mentioned this little spot he heard about not too far from work. So today for lunch a few of us decided to check it out. My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!  Will definitely be a return customer to try out other various customizations on my loaded potato!"}
{"text":"Saw the article on the New Times today and so glad I ran across that.  As potato lovers we Had to visit this little whole in the wall in south Phoenix! Ms. Dee is a friendly and smart business owner with delicious food to offer.  My husband had the steak, my nephew had the buffalo chicken, and I had the brisket and I can't even say which one was the best out of the three ! Great flavors and there are three different sizes to choose from!  Definitely going back because there was a lot to choose from! #loadedpotato #southphx"}
{"text":"Good sized potatoes.  Staff is real friendly.  Give this place a try when in the area."}
{"text":"Got the loaded buffalo chicken fake cauliflower potatoe! Sooooooooo good. Can't wait to go back for Philly cheesesteak next time! Glad had the option to choose from regular potatoe, sweet potatoe or cauliflower !"}
{"text":"This place gives you exactly what you would want from a place named the loaded potato! There are so many options to choose from, the possibilities are endless and they are starting to do breakfast too! The best part, aside from the kind staff, is that the deliver!!!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers recommended this place to me and I must say these are the BEST baked potatoes I've ever had. The pricing is reasonable. They also have the best creation ever.. Maple Sweet Potatoe Cheesecake!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! The only downfall they have is they take a little longer than usual to make the food. It takes roughly 30 minutes. I personally feel that is a long wait time but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"The Loaded Potato has THE BEST baked potato in PHOENIX bar NONE!  My wife and I had seen this place on Yelp and thought we were in the area, let's try it. When we arrived, we were met very cheerfully by Ms Roslyn. When I told her it was our first time there, she got all excited and decided she was going to explain the menu. I ordered the Large potato LOADED w/Chili meat, Cheddar/Monterrey Jack cheeses, Butter, Sour Cream and Fried Jalapenos on top.  My wife got the same, w/fried onions instead of Jalapenos.  When we got home to eat and bit into our taters, I SWEAR I thought I was in Tater heaven!  It was the BEST baked potato I'd EVER tasted. Plus it was HUGE!

While we were waiting for our food, we met Lois (Ms D) and talked about how GREAT a concept \"The Loaded Potato\" is and how, they need to get the word out. Roslyn's the cook and these people are not only GREAT cooks and entrepreneurs. They're BETTER people! We will definitely come back to \"The Loaded Potato\" and I suggest YOU try it as well.  We will be driving over there from Ahwatukee and will definitely make the trip AGAIN. So if you're in the area, STOP HERE FOR LUNCH OR DINNER,  you will do yourself a disservice if you skip \"The Loaded Potato\".

***UPDATE***
2/26/15

Stopped here for the FIFTH time in 3 weeks!  I've become ADDICTED to the Loaded Potato!  If you're hungry, I highly suggest you make the trip to the \"Loaded Potato\".  I GUARANTEE you, you'll go BACK!"}
{"text":"Growing up, my mom made a huge deal about how often I would eat potatoes.  10 years later, drinking more water and eating more fruits has her thinking I've changed my eating habits.  Ohhh...

This place was everything I have been looking for in \"fast food.\"  Wendy's has nothing on this potato.

I got my spud Loaded with Sesame chicken with vegetable.  It was awesome. Miss D came out to greet me and introduced me to herself and Miss Charlotte.  It got a little shy, I'll admit.  How often does the cook come out to introduce themselves?  This place has a welcoming feel, which is good.  It is comfort food, after all.  

My only cons about this place:
-It gets slightly uncomfortably hot during the day in the summer, even with the fans going. It's not unbearable, but it's definitely noticeable.
-There's only \"bar\"-style seating, so you'll most likely want to get everything for pick up.
-The place is easily missed; the sign is hard to see from the street.

But if all you care about is the quality of the food and the service, well.  The food is great and the ladies are very hospitable.  One thing that really got me about this place is the set of little fliers on the wall next to the cashier window.  \"____ and Bud paid it forward so ____ could get loaded.\"  I think that's really neat.  You can pay for the next random person or for someone you reccomend to come in.

For a place that's only been open since December, they seem to be doing well.  I will be back, and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Ms. Dee makes the best loaded potatoes anywhere!  I had the jerked chicken and the flavor was very good with some spice.  I recommend take out as there isn't really a dining area.  Don't be put off by the location.  It's a local secret."}
{"text":"Been here twice and planning to come back again and again. 

First time around I got the steak with fried onions on a loaded medium potato...I was hooked from the first bite. The baked potato was so soft it was on its way to being mashed potatoes and the steak had a delicious sauce that took it over the top. 

Then there was dessert. The pecan sweet potato pie. My two favorite pies combined and it was to die for. Soft sweet potato topped with a pecan pie top and yummy crust. Drooling all over again.

You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a coworker...I had the jerk chicken potato...YUMMY...Ms Dee loves to welcome people into her place and make them the best baked potato ever..,I will be back..,it's good to see small places like this showing up in the neighborhood..I'm all about supporting the locals over the chains...Ms Dee I'll be back"}
{"text":"This shop is set inside a tiny little strip mall and is an equally small space. When we entered we were greeted warmly by the cashier but while we browsed through the menu she disappeared somewhere in the back and we had to wait a long time for her to actually come back to the front. 

You have many options for your potato. First of all, the actual potato. You can have your standard Russet, sweet potato, or cauliflower if you are going low carb. You also have your choice of sizes (Medium, large, and extra large) with sample sizes in the glass case at the counter. There are various hearty toppings and meats for your potato and there is also a mixed vegetable topping option.

We decided on a large size jambalaya and Buffalo chicken potato, with mixed cheese (Monterey jack and cheddar) loaded style (Bacon bits, green onion, sour cream, butter) with fried jalapeños. They both tasted delicious. The jambalaya had a perfectly cooked mixture of shrimp, chicken and sausage, and the Buffalo chicken sauce had the right amount of vinegary tangy flavor. Both were loaded with a hefty amount of toppings and meat, and the combination of textures and flavors was balanced.

The real downfall of this place is the waiting time. This is definitely not fast food as it took 45 minutes for 2 potatoes to be made. I was famished when I got here and had I known it would take so long I probably would have gone somewhere else for a quicker meal. 

Since the space is so miniscule and there isn't a lot of air conditioning when it's warm, your best bet is to place an order ahead of time and get it to go. Overall the potatoes were great but the wait time really killed it for me."}
{"text":"DELISH!! Miss D whips up some delicious and tasty recipes for potatoes!!! Such a great idea. Loaded potatoes with all your favorite toppings. You can't go wrong here. I tried the loaded potato with everything on it, buffalo chicken and fried onions. We will definitely be coming back here! Very friendly and excellent customer service. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I had the loaded baked potato with pulled pork and it was so freaking good! Every bite was delicious and the stuffing was portioned correctly on top of the potato. It wasn't too much of one thing or the other. The ladies at the restaurant were amazing as well. Very accommodating and friendly. I loved the vibes they brought as soon as I entered through the door. :D"}
{"text":"Who would have thought a potato could be so tasty. The ladies taking my order were very sweet and guided me to the brisket which filled the plate. The bbq sauce, cheese were great. The sweet potato pie was worth the trip alone. When I am back in the area I will definately stop in."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place that specializes in BIG flavor. And Mama D is awesome! So much fun to talk to. She makes sure to introduce herself to every customer because \"a girl's got to know who she's gettin' loaded with.\" I had her medium loaded potato with chili and tortilla strips. OMG. So. GOOD! And totally filling! Not only was the food great, the company was stellar. Mama D hung out and chatted with us while we ate. We felt like we were having dinner at her home. I can't wait to go back. This time I'll be sure to save room for dessert. Thanks for a great experience, Mama D! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for take-out. The owner was super nice. Had the pulled pork potato and the New York Cheese Cake sweet potato. Both were amazing."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time today. I was amazed by how much Ms. Dee, Ms. Charlotte and Ms. Roslin loved to make people welcome. Three fun and beautiful women. The food is awesome.  I had a pulled pork/ monerey jack / loaded with fried jalapeños. I will be back again and again. Neighborhood joints like this need all of our support in order to thrive. I hope to see it here for years to come."}
{"text":"Really delicious. I ordered a 50/50 pulled pork and philly cheese steak. They were out of brisket. It was over 17 bucks for a jumbo potato loaded and a coke.  We ordered 3 potatoes and it took 40 minutes total to order and get the food. Very good but kinda pricey."}
{"text":"Miss Dee was sweetheart. The brisket loaded potato was great. I went with the gravy. And red kool-aid. Only thing is if you have a half hour lunch break call in your order."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars and not 5 is because of the wait time. I've been here a handful of times and it's label on Yelp as \"fast food\" is just a down right lie. Be ready to wait at least 20 minutes. But I have to say, the wait time is pretty worth it. The food is delicious."}
