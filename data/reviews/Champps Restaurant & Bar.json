{"text":"Excellent food...fast and curtious wait staff. Enjoy going back time after time."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here every Friday night for free trivia. It's usually very busy and the wait time for food could be a little long, but I've never been disappointed. Prices are kind of high but after 10PM appetizers are $5.  P.S. - Sit in Debbie's section, you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"I for one always enjoy dinning here. The potato skins and season sour cream is the best. You also can see UFC events there as a bonus."}
{"text":"Poor management means a poor experience. We waited for 90 minutes for food tonight. After being told the manager would \"be right over\" 4 times a supervisor finally showed up. He apologized for the wait and said he would handle it. We waited more than 30 minutes after that for the last of our food to arrive. We ordered 2 burgers, a pasta dish, 2 kids pasta meals, and a chicken pot pie. Nothing that should take 30 minutes especially with a supervisor \"taking care of it\". I assumed the manager would deliver the last dish so he could apologize for the wait personally and assure us this was not how his restaurant usually runs and do the normal manager fixing a complaint thing. In other words give me a reason to come back to his restaurant. Our server informed us he was in the kitchen and was to busy to come talk to us. I think from now on when I'm in that neighborhood I will be to busy eating at Quaker Steak to go back to Champps. To bad too cause they have a great happy hour. One more thing, why display the name of your general manager on the front door and not provide a way to contact him?  I have looked everywhere I can think of for an email or phone number for the person listed on the front door and can only find a feedback form on Champp's web site.  I would love to talk to some one in management at Champp's about my experience there tonight, because that is where my problem was, with management.  I appreciate they comped the meal, and I'm sure that's what the negative response on their feedback form will provide is a \"gift certificate to come back and try again on us\". What they were missing tonight was a human face saying \"I'm sorry, we messed up, we can do better, and we appreciate your business.\" A gift certificate doesn't fix that, that's a managers job."}
{"text":"I've been here  quite a few times and each time I say that I'm never going back!  It's next to the Valleyview Cinema so it's convenient but not worth the time, money or eating experience.  If you like really loud noise and you're ADD this is the place for you to eat!  There are huge TV screens everywhere and no sound barriers between customers so you hear everything.  The service is ok and the food is just terrible.  We ordered a Champs burger and we wondered if it was real meat (it looked a tad thicker than a McDonalds burger).  It was hidden by gobs of mayo, lettuce, onions and a really thick bun.  I'm saying it again.  I'm never going back!"}
{"text":"Really wasn't impressed with the service nor the food. We waited for each beverage we ordered for a good bit of time. lame. Our waitress seemed rushed to get the heck off and wasn't very friendly or attentive. She didn't know the soup of the day, which to me is ridiculous, but I digress.   As for the food, my boyfriend and I split this Mediterranean salmon dish, potato soup, and a salad. The salmon was over cooked, looked old and wasn't worth the $16 we paid for it. The veggies it was served on top of we're extremely over seasoned with I don't know what. I'm usually not one to complain about flavor, but holy moly was this a smorgasbord of a dish. No thank you!  I don't recommend this place. Sorry, not my cup of tea. I did however like the mojito very much...the one I finally did get..."}
{"text":"I go here every few months to meet up with a group of friends before going to a movie.  The location is very convenient, and the inside of the restaurant is large and nicely designed.  The fireplace is awesome in winter.  The food is fine, but boring and very overpriced.  They really could use more healthy options.  The beer selection has room for improvement, and is even more overpriced than the food.  I would never choose to go here if it wasn't close to the movie theater.  The service is usually good, but the bathrooms are usually in need of attention."}
{"text":"Meh. Look, if you're friends with a picky eater who will only eat standard American fare, this place will work for you. Otherwise, I'd go somewhere else.  This was the second Champps I've been to - I went to the one in Westlake to watch a basketball game with other alums from my college. I hadn't been impressed, but signed up for the Chammps card - earning myself a free cheeseburger.  Well, the lure of free food was enough to convince me to drive down to this Champps. The deal is legitimate - you get one free cheeseburger, although if you want to upgrade your burger, you have to pay the difference. I ordered a Firehouse Burger with a side of potato soup, and with my discount, only paid $4 (plus tip). This is probably the last $4 Champps will get from me, though.  The Firehouse burger is supposed to be full of heat - both peppers and sauces. I ordered mine medium rare and was excited for the jalapenos - but was pretty disappointed when my burger came out. The meat was flat and grey, with not even a touch of pink (maybe my waiter thought I said medium well? I can only hope this was the issue). The bun was also soaked with sauce - to the point where it was difficult to pick up and I was a little concerned it'd fall apart. There were way too many peppers (and not the hot kind, just bell peppers) on the sandwich, although I'm not faulting Chammps for this - easy enough to take off, and I'd rather have too many than too few. However, this burger was NOT hot and spicy. It really was just a burger with peppers and some watered down hot sauce - I was pretty disappointed.   The waffle fries that came with it were good, and my chunky potato soup was delicious. It came with cheese and bacon in it, as well as croutons. The croutons were NOT good at all, I wish I hadn't bit them, but the rest of the soup was good.  Overall, I will not be returning to Champps unless I somehow score more \"free\" food. It's fine, it's not BAD, I just wasn't impressed and would rather take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Next to the movie theater and decent parking but the food is just not the same as it use to be. It is American style cuisine but at a C rating. The service was good but the atmosphere was dull. There are 13 TVs in the restaurant but  not one had the Cavs game on. I know I know it is the Cavs but for a sports bar I thought that should have been on at least on one TV. If you are looking for a quick bit before the movies stick to something simple.  Happy Hour specials looked good. i would go back to try out the martinis on ladies night (Fridays)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is going down hill. Started with a cup of burnt old coffee. Then we both had a Kobe beef burger. The burger had way too much cheese on it and was very greasy. It was the worst Kobe beef burger I have ever had.  The service was good but that doesn't make up for the poor food. This restaurant chain is turning into the next Applebee's type restaurant."}
{"text":"A big sports bar with big TVs, a big bar, and big sandwiches and appetizers.  Karaoke nights with prizes and sometimes even live music.  Pretty generic, but there is nothing bad about this place."}
{"text":"It has it's pros and cons. The waiter we had was very friendly and timely. And it is a very large and nice place. There are pretty good draft choices too. But we asked for guacamole with our nachos and didn't get it so had to ask again. Also asked for beef on them and got both chicken and beef (not a big deal) and then the guacamole they gave us was a tiny little ramekin of it and not the real guacamole. More like the flavored stuff. The nachos were pretty good though. This is when I wish the rating system here on Yelp was out of 10 stars or else a rating that was specified as for a chain. For a chain this is a good restaurant. Not unique or comparable to non-chains though."}
{"text":"This place was almost too big for a sports bar.  We were a party of 12 and were seated by a wall and the only TVs I could watch a game on was the large projected screen.  The flat screens on the other walls in the place were just too far away.  So, keep that in mind when you are seated.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food and drink on the menu. Indulged in a blackberry margarita that hit the spot and enjoyed the fish and chips.  Everyone in the party seemed to like the food they ordered, from the kung pow chicken to the mahi-mahi salad.  With the food, the only blemish was the flat bread appetizer that was just too dry.  Overall though an enjoyable meal for everyone."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sports lounge kind of guy but if that's what you are looking for than Champps is a great place to be. The food was actually quite good for a place like this (although a bit expensive) and the atmosphere was good. It didn't feel to loud or boisterous.  Its a great place to watch pay-per-view events such as the UFC fights. That's the reason I went and they turn all of the massive TVs to it and turn the sound up nice and loud. There is a $10 minimum order on fight nights but that is probably less than you'd be spending to order the fight yourself so I was willing to suck it up.  I certainly wouldn't recommend Champps for an everyday type of dining venue but for watching the game, it is perfect."}
{"text":"To be fair, this place just isn't for me. I knew that and I don't know why we stopped anyways.   Service was fine, if not a little strange, but nice overall.   The food was just... how do I put this nicely? Well, I wasn't very hungry and I ordered a side salad with a cup of their potato soup. I'm sure there are way better options on the menu that I could have tried. But these two simple items were a total flop. The soup was grainy, bland and unimpressive. Could I eat it? Yes, but it just wasn't good. The salad was lazy with plenty of short cuts. The funny part? Why the shortcuts when your restaurant is borderline empty? You'd think they'd put more time and care into their dishes when it's not busy.   Typical chain restaurant everything. Saving grace? A pretty great happy hour."}
{"text":"Awful service. Third times a charm & I won't be returning again.  We were sat and waited over 10 minutes and no one came over.  Opening night for the Avengers and we waited and waited.  Finally at about 15 minutes...we got up and left."}
{"text":"The hostesses were very nice, but the food needs work.  Some of the appetizers and soups are ok, but the actual entrees/burgers/sandwiches need work.  Hopefully the chefs will work on improving the quality of the food served."}
{"text":"Welcome to Generic Town U.S.A.   That's pretty much my review of this location.  I went to Champps for the first time about a week ago and hoped to find something interesting, however found the normal corporate sports bar/resturant setup.  Overpriced Food, overpriced Drinks, and underserving staff.    I would prefer to go to Applebees over this place."}
{"text":"Always a great time. Kelly is the best. Appetizer did not actually come out so we got a free desert."}
{"text":"Great food for a bar. For a bar, their menu is huge and they sure have a ton of different selections. I got their pasta lunch special and really enjoyed my caesar's salad and the seaside pasta (although I felt like it was a pretty small plate).  Overall, it's a 4.0 for a bar standards."}
{"text":"Went in today with a party of 7 at noon. Was seated as soon as we came in. Food is always good here and al much to choose from its hard to make up your mind. The pulled pork is pretty tasty. Last bout not least Jodie is one very good waitress, never missing a beat."}
{"text":"Champs has always been a good spot.  Close to the theatre and around a few other choices for dining.  Champs stands out to me because of the versatile menu including modern Americana and some tasty pasta dishes as well.  It is the kind of place you go with so many choices it is hard to choose.  To me this is better than too few choices.  I don't come here often, but when I do, it's a pretty safe bet on a good meal."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night by accident... The place next door hadn't officially opened yet.   The two hostesses were completely rude and snobby... They acted as if they were doing us a favor. About 8 empty four-tops and they told the three of us twenty minutes in a \"matter of fact\" way... When I asked \"really?\"... They looked back and said \"20 minutes\". Almost left.   Went to the bar to wait it out.... Two tall drafts and a short one.... Twenty bucks?! (+ tip).  Later sat down. Waitress was very good, as was the food. She told us that the apps were $5 and we ordered, ate and left feeling much better.   Had a terrible experience at their Lyndhurst location about 13 years ago that left us disgusted and never returned to any Champps. Last night started poorly and ended well.   BTW... The new restaurant next door is Oak Barrel. Looks awesome. Menu was cool. Place was spotless. Great big, heated cigar friendly patio, fire-pit, 30 drafts, 200+ bottles of beer and 150 types of whiskey!  Can hardly wait!  Maybe the wait at Champps will be less when people have another option forty yards away."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Damon's, this place sort of reminds me of it.  They have typical American food, with a twist.  For example: I got the Bacon BBQ burger (or something like that); it had fresh pulled pork on it and chipotle mayo.  They take typical burgers/other American things and put a twist onto it.  The service was great, but the food came out a little slow (I was in a big party, so I didn't really care about that).  It was a little cold in there, but that might be just a one-time thing.  Their food is more expensive than it actually is (about $10-12 a burger), which is a little outrageous.  Overall, it takes average American food and adds a little oomph to it to make it good.  However, restaurants like this have been pretty overdone in this area, and it would be nice to see something else.  Think of Applebees, Rocknes, or any other burger chain and add a little bit of quality."}
{"text":"Even though this place is frequently packed and loud, it's not a bad place to go to hang out with your best of friends. The food is very good, I would go with the appetizers for they are quite large themselves. Also, if I'm correct, they still do trivia on Friday nights. Definitely worth going at around 10pm, somewhat challenging but the prizes are decent."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for a sports bar.  The server had no knowledge of the daily specials that were posted on the \"special menu\" which was sitting directly on our table.  When I pointed to the menu, she indicated that the menu was really outdated.  She was never available for refills and didn't seem like she really had a clue about what she was doing.  The food was good, however.  This was only the second time in ten years that I have visited this restaurant.  I hated it the first time I visited and had the same feelings this time around.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This past saturday for dinner was my second time at champs and will say both times have been good experiences. No wait either time. Good menu selection, good craft beer selection, mixed drink selection. You can spend 10.00 for a burger or 30 on a real dinner depending on mood.  Service was good both times.  The chicken pot pie was impressive btw.. Aut the best ive had.  Another plus... When you order your burger \"medium\" it is actually cooked medium!"}
{"text":"Truth be told, we come here because we have some deal where we get $10 off once per month.  So with that in mind, I'm a fan.  Decent selection, good service and portion size.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  At full price, I'd knock it down half a star."}
