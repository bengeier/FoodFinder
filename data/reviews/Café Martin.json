{"text":"Un très beau et accueillant café, la meilleure option dans le coin. Café latté et muffin savoureux!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect, hands down one of the *best* coffee shops in Montreal. Perfect spot to park yourself for laptop work, a meeting, or quiet get-stuff-done time.   Also one of the best cappuccinos I've had in so long, and the baristas are super kind. Thanks, guys."}
{"text":"Finally found my perfect independent coffee shop!  We came today for the first time on a saturday morning.  To make it short: everything that was ever annoying to you in some other coffee shop is finally done properly here!  Prices low, great ambiance, perfect host, good staff, great location, excellent coffee and patisseries.  You want to chill on a saturday morning come here. You will enjoy perfect atmosphere, nice wifi, good snacks and a hostess who really cares about her customers. Check out the pictures I append here."}
{"text":"Quiet, enjoyable place to sit down and sip on your coffee. This cafe is spacious and there's not too much people, which is perfect. The decor is lovely with brick walls and high ceilings with a vintage feel. The atmosphere is calm and just welcoming with the big windows and the confortable seats. The drinks were warm and good, making it feel even more cozy.  The only thing that bothered me a bit is that it didn't necessarily feel your neighbourhood cafe where the baristas talk to people and know people's names. There was a bit of a barrier, but they were absolutely polite so it's fine."}
{"text":"In my desperate attempt to make finals season less depressing, I have been stalking out cafes in Montreal and I think I've found my spot. Cafe Martin has reasonably priced caffeine (only $3.75 for a medium latte) so I can keep myself caffeinated for hours as I type away at my notes and flashcards. The music selection is a great mix of acoustic and soul. Perfect for singing that stress away. The wifi is fast and reliable and the food is great. My only complaint is that the tables are on the small side so if you come with friends, come early and try to grab two tables."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and I thought I would after reading the great reviews that have been posted thus far. However, the latte left a terribly bitter aftertaste and the croissant was too bready for my liking and lacked the crispy-flaky crust that good croissants have...  That being said, I do like the physical space and the ambiance - it's vintage and understated and the music is a perfect soundtrack for a relaxing cup of coffee. I would consider giving this place a second look if I happened to be in the area again... but I don't think I'd make a special trip.  2 1/2 stars (1 star for the coffee and food and 4 stars for everything else)."}
{"text":"Very cute shop with a cozy atmosphere. I adored the interior design and decor. I went with a friend there and I found it to be a very nice place to just chill and chat or perhaps enjoy a coffee with some work to do alone. After reading the reviews I did have higher expectations of the shop but the food was a little disappointing - about average if I had to say though. Had a mango honey smoothie, which ended up tasting just like honey and no mango, and an apple fritter, which I would have liked more if it were toasted. So to me the food wasn't all that great, but I did hear the coffee is quite good."}
{"text":"Excellent calm interior with a piano at the front and lots of window space. Prices are very reasonable. Outlets are on the wall everywhere and lots of small chairs and good music. Menu has lots of different lattes and coffees. Service is excellent. Free wifi and a good quiet place to study."}
{"text":"Their smoothy, sandwich, and coffee are all excellent! This is my favorite cafe in town!"}
{"text":"Wow! I loved this cafe! The coffee was cheap (medium $2 with tax, large $2.50 with tax)! Their coffee wasn't too strong, but it was quite flavourful. The atmosphere was great; there was 70s soul music playing in the background. The cafe was spacious and clean; the very kind and friendly baristas brought our coffee to our table. The washroom was clean and their hand soap smelled amazing. Remember to get the key from the barista to use the washroom. I tried their chocolate cookie, it was pretty good. There were big chunks of chocolate in the cookie, but it wasn't really worth it. The cookie cost $2.50 with tax and it was pretty small too. Their other pastries cost around $2-4. Definitely go for their coffee and atmosphere. It's great to study in and has good lighting!"}
{"text":"Some people are more into trying dessert places or gastronomic restaurants well I have to admit that I'm more of a café kinda girl (well it probably has a lot to do with my love for coffee). Café Martin is located on the St-Laurent Boulevard and what's funny about it, is that I've been passing in front of that place for years and never noticed it, so much that I asked the waiter when was the opening and he replied \"we opened...3 years ago!\" ...How did I miss that?!?  The decoration is a mix of vintage and modern, I loved the ceiling... They also have a terrace. I was just looking for a place to relax while having a coffee so I don't know about the food but the mocha was awesome. I will be back for suuuuure!"}
{"text":"One of the best filter coffee I had, strong but not bitter! Wish this place was on my way to work so I could have their coffee every morning. Sometimes I wake up craving their filter coffee. Makes you feel fresh and energized with the first sip. This coffee shop is really good for studying/working, super quiet and organized. I was impressed at how clean the place was, not a single muffin crumb or loose hair in their fabric sofa; kudos to the staff who maintain such tidiness. Please keep it up, it's one of my favourite reasons for coming to Café Martin.   They also have a good variety of baked goods and I found the price of their coffee and assorted goodies really affordable and I truly appreciate that. Cappucino and Latté are around $3.25 and I had almond chocolatine which was $2.50ish (these are not exact prices). But mind you, be prepared to get a sugar rush from their viennoseries. Most cafes nowadays tend to be overpriced and it's hard to find a down to earth place like this one, a solid recommendation for a refreshing experience.  Only recommendation to owners: I'd prefer if you use a curated playlist instead of radio music"}
{"text":"Comfortable, cozy and friendly. Decided on Cafe Martin for a quick meeting and it was the perfect spot. Friendly staff, quiet and relaxing ambiance, and great coffee!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I'm really excited about this place. Not that the food is anything amazing. It's good but conventional. I think it's because they created a really nice space. The metal works on the ceiling, the old piano, the cute little toilet, the openness, the light, the wood floors, the beautiful plates, the large window.... (See the pictures I posted. ) There is a lot to like here! It was pretty quiet around 4:30pm on a Tuesday; I would totally go there to work for an hour or two. Moreover, it is surprising to find a spot like that on a relatively ugly area of St. Laurent blvd. Reminds me of Bouillon Bilk in that respect. Nice staff and last but not least, good prices!"}
{"text":"A lovely place to spend a few hours drinking coffee, eating some food, and reading, working or catching up with a friend. I loved the atmosphere and decor; I also liked that the tables weren't jam-packed together. The coffee was great, and the sandwich I got (chicken) was good, too (nothing special about it, but good price for the size)."}
{"text":"Affordable prices, beautiful place and really nice owner. I really recommend this place. It's got a great vibe. Accidentally stumbled onto this place during pouring rain. So worth it!!"}
{"text":"Who needs ****bucks when you can go to Cafe Martin?  Great coffee! Friendly staff! Zen ambiance... perfect experience. When I'm in the ''hood, I always stop by."}
{"text":"The quietest café I've ever been to in Montreal! It's quite new so it's probably still undiscovered by most people, but I'll definitely come back here before people start finding out about this place!  I ordered a vanilla latté with a raspberry muffin. The latté is bit sweeter than the other ones I've tried around town but it's quite satisfying for my sweet tooth. Great service from the girl who served me but I wish she would've amped up her game on the latté art!   The decor inside is right up my alley. Very homey and a piano at the front. Not sure if we're allowed to play it but it adds an artistic touch to the atmosphere. They have couch seating on the side but I wish the tables  there were bigger and movable. Other than that, a great discovery!"}
{"text":"One of my fav coffee shop in town, very nice coffee, good price, friendly services. I also love their decoration, cozy and peaceful :) Summer time you also can have seat outside, enjoy sun and coffee, and have a good start of your wonderful day."}
{"text":"Café sympathique dans ce désert des amateurs de caféine. Le latte est savoureux, crémeux et a la bonne température. Comparable aux autres cafés indépendants. Vendredi en fin de journée c'était très calme et parfait pour terminer la semaine."}
{"text":"I first discovered this little coffee shop when studying at the nearby Goethe Institute. The space offers a few tables and benches where you can grab a coffee or a baked good, sit quietly, thanks to the low music, and enjoy the space. There is an outdoor terrasse as well but seeing that the cafe is located on a busy street and on a block where there is not much happening, I would opt for the inside with its nice lighting, clean decor, and comfy space.   The coffee here is great! I always get a perfect latte; great espresso, good milk combo and cute latte art. The baked goods are a hit and miss though seeing that my chocolatine was perfect while the muffin my friend was having was dry and seemed more than a day old."}
{"text":"Their coffee is great! The place is soft and theres enough room for cafe martin not to be loud while having people conversing there, so its really easy to get some work done! Their mango honey smoothie is delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly barista who allowed up to stay passed closing hour.  The cappuccino was good, lots of foam, just like the way I like mine. However, dessert was ok, not perfect. But it is a nice place to hang out with friends and spend a afternoon."}
{"text":"There is a difference between moist and soggy. Their pastries are soggy. At first I thought it was the timing of the day cause I got an almond croissant close to the closing time, but it was still soggy the next time I tried right after it opened.   I still liked their coffee and the ambiance. The seating capacity is probably around 15-20."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with an extremely relaxed atmosphere. Coffee was great and staff were friendly. Found it really easy to relax after a busy day."}
{"text":"Happened to walk by and dropped in a few minutes before closing hours. We ordered iced americanos and found them to be watered down. Most iced americanos I had in Montreal were served in little glasses with the espresso shot, water and ice. But our drinks were served in a bigger plastic cup, so that's why it tasted watered down. But maybe the other drinks are better? I liked the interior and that it was a quiet and spacious cafe."}
{"text":"Sitting on the outside deck and enjoying an iced coffee in a beautiful Montreal day.  Located right around the corner from Hotel 10 where we were staying for the week this coffee shop is a wonderful reprieve to while away some time and relax under the shade while sipping on a tasty iced coffee.  They have one of those streetside outside deck seating areas which seems to be a really cool thing in Montreal. Wish they did this in NYC. We took our drinks and pastries and sat here for an hour or so conversing and checking our emails. Relaxing and chilling.  Nice inside decor, bright, spacious, clean, and quiet. Polite and friendly staff. Free wifi. Good prices on coffee drinks.  Very nice coffee joint off a side street and in a great location by the hotel. Worth a visit if staying there."}
{"text":"Enfin un café indépendant dans ce \"no man's land\" sur Saint-Laurent entre Ontario et Sherbrooke, latté correct, y'a des sandwichs, des viennoiseries + wifi gratuit, les prix sont corrects et le service est courtois avec un sourire. Ils utilisent des grains de café ''Patera'' importé d'Italie. Bel intérieur industriel, genre de café 3e vague. Pas encore connu, l'endroit est tranquille, parfait pour étudier/travailler. Ils acceptent, les cartes débits et crédit."}
{"text":"I went in to grab some lunch, and they were out of many options by the time I arrived (Wednesday afternoon -- odd time to run out of food). They were out of my first choice, so I asked for the chicken sandwich, which is supposed to come on whole wheat bread. They were out of whole wheat bread, so I got it on baguette. The sandwiches come with a choice of a side salad or chips and salsa. I asked for the salad, but they were out of that as well. I asked if I could have the soup as my side, but they were out of the soup too. I did not want the chips and salsa, so I said I'll pass on those, and I was still charged the full price including the side. If they don't have the options they are supposed to, then they shouldn't be charging for a side when I'm not getting one. Also, the \"chicken\" was slices of lunch meat. All in all, at $8.50 it didn't seem worth it. To the manager: make sure to stay stocked with your menu options!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe. Small, but super cosy and has a very relaxing atmosphere. I stopped in and had the green tea latte and it was excellent. The barista was super nice and friendly. The free WiFi is also a nice touch."}
