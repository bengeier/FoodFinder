{"text":"Can't believe the high rating. Worse food, has nothing to do with Iraqi, Lebanese or any middle eastern food. Service is very poor. Place is not clean. Neighborhood is not safe."}
{"text":"We were travelers who came to eat at that street and randomly picked this restaurant for lunch. 

Not good: The meat wasn't fresh except the Tekka. We also had dolma stuffed with regular basmati rice not short thick rice. 

Good: The best thing that we had is the tea with mint (excellent) and the staff was friendly we had a woman.

Overall, we eat it all :) but wasn't satisfied much."}
{"text":"great restuarant .... It is a great apportunity to try the iraqi food in an excellent way....
I went to alot of restaurants in detroit looking for iraqi food and found this as the best here in ohio ....
I tried turkish , persian , lebnanease but this was the best...."}
{"text":"Stopped in mid-afternoon. Charming boy took my order. Twenty minutes later I asked about the status of my order. Five minutes later he shows up with a cold sandwich full of wilted salad and microwaved beef. Never again."}
{"text":"Can't find anything nice to say. When I walked in nobody greeted me or helped me. We waited half hour for our\"sandwiches\" and when I asked where it was they said it's been ready and it was sitting on a counter in the chefs area. The sandwiches didn't consist of much and I could've made a better one at home. The lamb was a lil undercooked. The bread was stale and made it hard to chew. I ordered fries also and they forgot it but asked if I wanted to wait extra 5 minutes which I didn't. Once the heavy set lady swiped my card she walked away before handing me the receipt so i walked behind the counter and grabbed it myself. It should not be legal for people to eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a late Valentine's dinner tonight, and we loved it. Portions were large, and the lamb kabobs were delicious. We especially liked another dish that had a lamb leg on a bed of rice, but can't remember the name. The meat melted off the bone! The owner of the restaurant thought we had ordered hummus with pita when we had not; when we brought this to her attention, she gave it to us at no additional cost. Just a small note - you will not be able to buy water there, so we shared a bottle of coke. We also wouldn't recommend the okra soup, but the stuffed grape leaves are perfect. Wouldn't have spent Valentine's any other way!"}
{"text":"Not good. When this place very first opened I loved it. The fattoush was so close to my family recipe it made me nostalgic. Now you can taste the fake lemon juice in it. The portions are soo small and the salads (fattoush, tabouleh) are very bland. They should NEVER BE BLAND. I though when they re opened it would be business as usual. Not so much."}
{"text":"Overall: the food is good, but kind of bland.

My wife and I got takeout from Kabab Station on Saturday night.
We got the kabob over rice, a grilled half-chicken over rice, and a side of hummus. The hummus was delicious.

The kabob was great, although the meat seemed a little grainy at times. 

The grilled chicken was succulent and meaty, but other than some sumac sprinkled on top, it seemed completely unseasoned. 

The same goes for the rice that came with both dishes. At a lot of Middle Easter places, the  rice is buttery and delicious, but the rice was completely  bland. Well prepared, great texture, but not much flavor. 

Owners, if you're reading this, please use more seasoning with rice and chicken."}
{"text":"Not gonna go there again , the smallest kabob and the worst quality ever . Good for those who don't know the real taste of middle eastern food ."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall but the food is awesome. Had the Shwarma and chicken platter. The rice is great, and I'm not a rice eater. The falafel was good and the hummus was better than my moms (we're Lebanese). The did forget our pita bread, I didn't care but my fiance was annoyed."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner tonight. Kabab station has been open for four months and serves middle eastern cuisine. This is a true hole in the wall with extremely reasonable prices. Sandwiches are $4 and dinner plates are between $10 - 13. Portions are extremely generous - be prepared to take plenty of leftovers home. Or better still, eat family style so that you can sample more of the menu.
We ordered the mixed grill (4 skewers of kababs - beef, lamb and chicken tikka, rice, salad and pita), lentil soup and kibbe. Once we took our first bites, neither husband nor I could pause long enough to take pictures between shoveling forkfuls of rice, melt in the mouth kababs and soup into our mouths. I flashed back to childhood and sharing a bowl of ice cream with my sister, each one of us swallowing large spoonfuls as fast as we could. (brain freeze? Who cares about brain freeze when the alternative is your sibling eating one more bite of ice cream than you?)
Om nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Do not go here! We were visiting from California and found this place close to the place we were staying. It was bad from the minute we walked in. The girl was mopping and it was very wet and soapy everywhere. Then we sit down and ordered our food. She seemed to understand, but when our food came, they gave my husband the lamb plate when we orfered a sandwich. We found a baby cockroach running across the table which my husband killed. We should have left, but it was late. My chicken sandwich was horrendous, it tasted like gasoline. Save your money and order Papa John's from down the street instead of eating here!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend at all. Really expensive for the price. Minimum tip is 20%. Asked if they could make it spicy and they said they could, but tasted no different from the normal spice. Completely forgot an entire dish we ordered and had to wait on that. Lack of seasonings, virtually no salt at all. The salad was a big pile of glob. The wrap was runny with their white sauce, leaking all over the place. Lack of customer service is also a really big complaint I had as well. Try some other halal place, don't waste your money and appetite here."}
{"text":"Are here a few nights ago and had the Iraqi Kabab dish.  It was very tender and juicy.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is not sure of what to order.  Their tea is also very good.  Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Rice was good but thats about it. service was extremely slow, salad looked like something you would get at a fast food restaurant and the meat had no flavor and did not seem fresh at all and they forgot my potato stew that came with the meal"}
{"text":"Hands down the iraqi kabab is the best i have ever had... it was juicy and tender.. very tasty and delicious... if i lived on the west side it would be my daily spot.. Please go check it out"}
