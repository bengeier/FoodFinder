{"text":"Great beer selection. Good food. Good service. Great environment. I just wish it was a little larger."}
{"text":"For a deli this place was amazing and they had really good service. I ordered the turkey club and it was delicious with very generous portions."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!!! I love this place! Now they have a great bar too! They use great ingredients, and fresh bread too. The staff is friendly, and treat you well."}
{"text":"Mount Nebo needed another family restaurant and bar. So far good food good pricing wide variety of beers. It's definitely worth checking out if you not been here, and since it just opened you probably haven't been here yet. :-)"}
{"text":"Two words: fried pickles! Not just any fried pickles, either, amazingly tasty ones with a fiery ranch sauce. After meeting up with a friend who lives in Sewickley, she highly recommended we head here for dinner. It was a super yummy dinner with great appetizers, an incredibly tasty burger, and great beer. Our server was very knowledgeable about what beer would be best for both our meal and our preferences. After leaving, I kept thinking about how amazing everything was. It had been a long time since I've had such a great burger. When hanging out with friends last week, I was willing to drive 40 minutes out of my way to make another trip to Goodfellas. This week, with a birthday celebration on the to do list, I suggested yet again that we make another bit of a trek. I am definitely hooked and the short drive of 40 minutes seems totally worth it! With three visits under my belt, I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the greatest sandwich shop within 200 miles - I kid you not. There is nothing I can say that can accurately portray how good their sandwiches are.  Turkey Club is my go-to sandwich, and I have had them from coast to coast from a hundred different sandwich shops. In my opinion, the turkey club is the measure of a sandwich shop, and demonstrates their full capabilities: Three slices of bread, so it has to be perfect, and perfectly toasted for the center slice to withstand the onslaught of deliciousness Bacon, which must be perfectly crispy so that you don't take a bite and end up dragging a piece of bacon out with your teeth and subsequently screwing everything up Turkey, which must be thinly, AND FRESHLY shaved, for the perfect texture and flavor A rich, sharp cheddar, fresh, crisp lettuce, and fresh tomato with a soft red core - not some unripe, pumped-full-of-red-dye piece of garbage.  Goodfellas has produced one of the top three clubs I have ever had, and I don't say that lightly.  They have a full spread though - don't stop yourself at the club. They have multiple Italian varieties that will absolutely make your lunch perfect."}
{"text":"Good luck getting a table. Sat there for almost an hour when we were told it was a 25min wait.  Wish we could have tried the food."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I will go back.  Food was good.   Beer selection is good.   Atmosphere was horrible!    I was surprised to see a high top table of 3 young boys (maybe 10 years old) and their mom's sitting at the bar.   The boys were so loud and disruptive, my husband and I couldn't enjoy ourselves.   We couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there.   The mom's were completely oblivious (enjoying their drinks) that their boys were acting like they were at Chuckie Cheese.    At one point our waitress made a comment that \"they were in there all the time\".    That's when I was pretty sure I wasn't coming back.    Who wants to listen to other people's kids run around at dinner????"}
{"text":"We come here pretty frequently (almost weekly), and have never been disappointed. Not sure what to say, other than every dish we've gotten has been excellent and high quality. The service is always friendly and top notch.  Great burgers (recommend their gouda); terrific pizza (highly recommend the peppadew). Never been disappointed in their sandwiches, including their hot roast beef and rachel. For apps, we really love the fried pickles, buff chicken dip, and all of their wings.  This place is a hidden gem. My only complaint is the lack of seating when they are busy!"}
{"text":"I had my eye on \"Goodfellas Deli & Drafthouse\" after I noticed that this establishment had a rating of almost 5 perfect stars!!!!  Well yinz... did it live up to the hype!??  YOU BETCHA!!  Me and a dear friend of mine -coolest cat on the planet \"Joe\" arrived on a Thursday night around 6:30 - Pens game yet too.  The parking wasn't too bad in front and noticed there was a sign for more parking in the rear.  Walking in ..  was told there was a wait for a table -three people in front of us. Ok - no problem..so we headed to the bar.  Approaching the bar.. I noticed it was packed and usually takes a few minutes to get waited on.. but this wasn't the case since we were immediately waited on!   I need to point out that there was only 1 bartender working too... so impressive.   Usually, I am a politely aggressive at any bar when ordering a drink and typically there's a wait when ordering a drink but not this time. Being that there was no bar stools available we hung out at the side of the bar near the back wall... theres a little black ledge there to chill.. which is hard to see from the front angle but was a nice spot to wait until our table was ready.  So right after we finished our first beer.. a booth opened up (which was perfect!)  Our waitress appeared a few minutes later and we placed our drink and food order.  Our food came right away too!! It seemed like it was just five minutes and it came.. appetizer first and not a moment later the food..   Gorgonzola burger:  It tasted like a gourmet burger.. very delicious and different.  I was weary about the balsamic drizzle on it - but it was good.  Beer Battered Onion Rings:   Flavorful - Outta Sight ..  dipped in Heinz Ketchup. .. oh yea.   Wing Dust Wings (Crispy):    Were really good and so much meat on the wings.. loved that.   The wing orders are 12 only - not 6.  It would have been better if you were able to order 6 at a time because then you can sample more flavors:  Chipotle BBQ, Parm Herb Butter, and Sesame Asian.  I thought the wing flavors were different but 12 to an order - forced to decide on 1 flavor... I didnt like that being a wing lover. The restaurant itself was comfortable and very clean.   I have plenty of left overs for work the next day...The food and service was outstanding.  Goodfellas Deli & Drafthouse deserves 5 stars.   I will no doubt be back to visit."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are super and the severs is great to. Order the onion rings there yummy. I also had a roast beef and cheddar cheese roll which was tasty. Chicken salad looked good and so did the cheese burger. They make homemade chips too there so good. You should give this place a try. I would come back here !"}
{"text":"I came to Good Fella's with my son, daughter and her husband for a late lunch.  We had to wait a few minutes to be seated but it wasn't a problem. Once we sat down our waiter immediately came to our table to get our drink order.  The beer selection is impressive and extensive. I had a White Lightning which was served just how I like it, ice cold.  I ordered the Cheddar Melt Roastbeef as did my son. My daughter ordered the Gorgonzola Roast beef sandwich and her husband ordered the Reuben.  The roast beef sandwiches were served on Asiago cheese ciabatta and had delicious horseradish mayo.  Ask for extra sauce on the side for dipping the delicious homemade spicy chips. I could just eat those for lunch and be happy they are so good.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and they have 6 TV's playing the days games.  I would definitely eat here again and recommend it to anyone who likes an ice cold beer with their sandwich while watching your favorite team."}
{"text":"Have been here 2x, and loved it both times.  My husband had a burger this week and loved it.  I don't even eat burgers and I thought it looked good.  Salads are great.  The best thing is the homemade potato chips -- seasoned perfectly and are just delicious!!!  Trust me, I am the potato chip queen.  I ate so many I couldn't even eat my entr√©e.  Can't wait to try the pizza.  I plan to visit again soon while bringing other family members."}
{"text":"Upon arriving at the draft house, we noticed that the parking lot was a bit cramped. The interior of the restaurant was small, but it was quite busy. The staff was pleasant and welcoming. A friend and I both decided to order the honey turkey wraps that were accompanied by seasoned potato chips. When the wraps arrived, they were prepared exactly as described on the menu and they looked great. The wraps were tasty, but rather dry and lacking the honey mustard dressing. We asked the server if we could have more dressing for our wraps. She happily provided us each with a very small plastic cup of dressing. When we received our bill, we were shocked that each of us had been charged an additional 50 cents for the additional dressing! If the wraps were prepared with an insufficient amount of dressing, it seems that a few more teaspoons of dressing could have been provided as a courtesy! The chips were fresh and crispy, but the iced tea tasted as though it was served from a fountain dispenser."}
{"text":"Good Fellas is a great place to meet friends and eat. It is more than just bar food. The menu selections are an up twist on the standard American fare. The wings are great as is the pizza. The beer selections are nice and change with the seasons. They don't mind when you ask for a taste before a full pour. It is small inside but they do keep things moving. Great place to sit at the bar and watch the game."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner on a snowy, icy night. The weather did not stop anyone as the restaurant was packed! I gathered that this place was one with regular customers. We were able to get a table right away and our waitress was quick to take our drink orders. My friend and I ordered the same meal: Honey Turkey Wrap with a side of homemade chips. While the wrap was good, it was nothing extravagant; just a wrap. The chips, however, we're fantastic! They were fresh and covered with tons of seasoning.   The restaurant had several televisions, however, the layout of the tables make it challenging for all guests to watch them. Employees were engaging and quick to serve and provide the check. For the price, the food was just ok.   For a quick bite to eat or to sit and enjoy a game, give Goodfellas a try!"}
{"text":"Decent happy hour spot in a conveniently accessible area of the north hills. Close proximity to I-79 and I-279. The burgers and sandwiches are very well priced and portioned. The service is friendly and excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, friendly, good. I haven't had a Pastrami on rye like theirs in a long time....ask for the 'Wiseguy'. Not a huge menu, but big enough to find....hell, I'm gonna try everything at some point it's that good. 66 beers on draft helps out too. :)"}
{"text":"This was a terrific place for excellent sandwiches at a low price. My Deli Lama was quite good and my wife enjoyed the two sandwiches she had on our two visits this week while we were house hunting in the area.  Good food, prices and wait staff.  We highly recommend and look forward to eating here again when we move to the area."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall? More like hidden gem. I had The Rachel on toasted whole wheat and it was slamminnnn."}
{"text":"Really good food! Great service!!! Lots of sports on 5 TVs. 20 beers on tap. Just what we needed in OT!"}
{"text":"Small parking lot and a decently long wait but excellent food and great service. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great little \"deli\" that has a bar!!  Friendly service, good food.  Margherita pizza was delicious (a tad pricey for what you get), as was the chicken caesar wrap.  A burger went by that looked fantastic....need to return to try one!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened. The last couple of visits we have noticed that they quality of the food seems to be going down hill. Looks like smaller portions too, but still charging the same price. Beer selection is great and they have decent wine too. Will we give them another try, probably not for food."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch today with friends. We all ordered burgers and they were really good. I had the short rib burger.  Flavor city! Tender, juicy and quality all the way.   Fries were a bit dry, but not a deal breaker.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a quick bite to eat after some friends suggested it.  As soon as I walked in I knew this place was for me.  They don't have a ton of seating but do have a decent size bar so we sat there.  The beer selection on tap was very good, and they also have a great cooler section of bottles.    The staff was friendly and chatty and provided excellent service.  I asked some of the regulars what to get there and was told \" I've never had a bad meal here.\"    I opted for the blackened chicken wrap and Megan got a Burger (onion, cheese, and balsamic).  Wow was the burger good!  The chicken was delicious as well, but the tortilla itself was nothing to write home about.  If I did the blackened chicken again I'd do a salad or sandwich for sure.    Fries were good and Home made chips have this heavenly seasoning on them!  I will try one of the more typical deli sandwiches next time (pastrami, Reuben, etc).  Great place for a cold beer and a quick bite!"}
{"text":"They have some very good food that is reasonably priced. I got the lox sandwich that came on marble rye and it was really good!  They also have signature sandwiches that are delicious.  The part that did it for me was the wings!  They bread them and fry them so they are crispy. They even stay crispy after the sauce is on there!  Service is good but table space is limited. The bar is always an option to sit at. Good list of beers they offer too!"}
{"text":"Flew in from Dallas and stopped here on our way out of Pittsburgh.  Didn't know what to expect but we tried The Godfather and Rachel (like a Reuben except with turkey and coleslaw instead of corned beef sauerkraut) Sandwiches.  Both were awesome!!  Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Simple menu, reasonable prices, sensible options, friendly staff, healthy drinks. My kind of place. I'm tough to please...this dos not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great corned beef and pastrami sandwich. Excellent and attentive service even though they were busy as hell!! Thanks to our server, Sofia  for putting up with 5 adults and a kid...we'll be back."}
{"text":"A larger beer selection that changes with the season. The price of beer is about average to a little bit high. They have a decent sized menu. Their pizza is fantastic and so are their fried pickles. I've been here a few times during different times of the day and their service is always good."}
{"text":"I've been interested in this place for a while. They serve sandwiches pizza and salad - bar food.  We went on Saturday night at around 630. The restaurant has a real neighborhood feel to it. We only had to wait a few minutes for a table. When we were seated, our waitress took our drink orders in before we could add anything ran away. We are going to order an appetizer then. Basically most of the evening, She was leaving us as fast as she could.  We started with house made potato chips. They were excellent with a side of fiery ranch dressing. There are not vegetarian sandwich options to speak of So the vegetarian turn to the pizza section and ordered one with olives onions and artichokes that's preset on the menu. Also ordered a salad which when it came tasted fine but at eight or 9 Bucks Was Way overpriced for the size. Turns out this is not a nine dollar for salad kind of place unless they're going to make it a big salad. The other guest ordered a hamburger with bacon and cheese. These are also called bacon cheeseburgers.  We got some onion rings which are plentiful but just completely battered. Some people like that -personally I prefer them breaded. if you like  them battered these were probably good.  The pizza was  overpriced. It would've been price fine if it were a particularly good pizza but despite the things on it it lacked flavor. It was supposed to have roasted garlic on it although I neither saw nor tasted any.   So the pizza was very disappointing to the point where I did not take any of it home. There are plenty of TVs to watch sports and if you're looking for bar food in a low-key atmosphere,certainly go to here if you're in the mood for something a little Better, skip it"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to stop in. Around 2pm on a Sunday.  They had most of their booths filled, plenty of non booth seating available. Husband and I sat at the bar. He had the Rueben and I had the corned beef Rachael. So good! Here's why: this grilled sandwich was more toasted than grilled which made the marble rye light and crisp. Ruebens can get messy and soggy but how they treat the rye made it the best Rubeben/Rachel I've ever had. The sandwiches come with really good thick BBQ seasoned chips. Very good. The bar girl was nice and tentative. We will return."}
{"text":"Don't go to Subway or Jimmy John's - this place is a small hole in the wall that you've probably driven right past after getting off 79 but take the time to stop in next time. Fresh sandwiches, great people - it's my go-to pickup dinner place after work."}
{"text":"Goodfellas is top notch when it comes to a local bar/restaurant. The food is always tremendous. They have an excellent beer selection. The staff is beyond friendly, and they provide great service. My only dislike is that it is 15 minutes from my house, and not closer!"}
{"text":"Always top notch. Comfortable neighborhood bar with the best draft selection, plus bottle to go. But the beer is just to pair up with your awesome sandwich. I enjoy The Godfather, Cheddar Roast Beef or the Rachel Ruben . The burgers are great too...and the pizza..and the salads. Staff is great and friendly. Very little turnover so ask them what to eat, drink. It's small so be prepared to wait a half hour for a table. The bar will be packed too but the locals are friendly.  Oh, and they have take-out."}
{"text":"Goodfellas is right up the road from my parent's home and offers a refreshing alternative when there is little in their home for lunch. They do offer some dine in seating, but we typically do carry out. They have 6 packs to go and usually around 20 beers on tap, which is an excellent amount for the size of the place. Most recently, my mom and I split the gourmet roast beef cheddar melt, which comes with carmelized onions, Vermont cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and horseradish mayo on Asiago ciabatta. This sandwich, along with all of the others I have tried, are substantial in size and perfect for sharing. The carmelized onions added a sweet touch and the horseradish mayo gave the sandwich a nice kick. I love Asiago bread so this was a winner for me. The bread/meat ratio was on point with equal amounts of both. Homemade chips come with the sandwich and they are stellar- crispy and well seasoned. I have also had the Rachael, the California chicken wrap, and the Gorgonzola roast beef melt, all of which I enjoyed. They also have wings, pizza, salads, and burgers. I'd definitely recommend checking them out. Oh, and happy hour is 4:30-6:30 Monday through Friday!"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner yesterday    Coco, my waitress suggested the NYC Pizza and sesame wings both  were fantastic !   Service was spot on!!   Def on the go back to list."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch. My friend had the bacon burger and was very impressed. And it takes a lot to impress him.  I had the Pittsburgh salad. Minus the meat. Since I'm vegetarian. It was ok. It could have been much better. Since I didn't want the steak or chicken I asked for extra veggies. But there were more French fries than actual lettuce.  And the lettuce was mainly iceberg.  Over all good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The selection of beers is very good and the food is excellent for the price. Reasonable amount of TVs and service was excellent.  nothing fancy but truly worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Wings ok mediocre  Bacon Burger no complaints to me just another overpriced burger substitute a side salad for 2 upcharge very small ! Voices carry and place is loud and relatively small. Server was decent Beer selection decent  Not raving nor complaining about this place anh- ok"}
{"text":"Seriously wish I would have known about this place long ago. It's exactly the type of place anyone would love to eat at. It's ridiculously clean and upbeat in there. Staff seemed friendly and polite and the food was amazing. Will be back to try the rest of the menu items because they all looked so good!"}
{"text":"I can't believe we waited so long to try out Goodfella's!  From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome. Seated within 30 seconds of walking through the door, beers served within 4 minutes, appetizer served so quickly that I was actually surprised, and entrees perfectly timed.  I ordered a burger medium-well, and it was done exactly medium-well -- this seems normal, but honestly doesn't happen all that often.  The Spicy Fella pizza was actually spicy! Again, this seems intuitive, but as fans of truly spicy food can attest, it's difficult to actually get truly spicy food. \"Spicy\" tends to mean \"not mild\", which is nowhere near the same thing.  The beer selection on draft was excellent and varied, and the bottled selection was terrific. I now follow their draft and bottled beer updates on the Untapped app, and the attention to new offerings is refreshing and the selections carefully curated.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and even better food.  Fresh sandwiches with awesome looking pizza. My husband had the wise guy and loved it.  I had the gorgonzola roast beef which was also delicious. My sister had a wrap which she said she would order again.  Her boyfriend had the buffalo chicken pizza.  We live in an area with a lot of chain resteraunts.  It was refreshing to find this bar with excellent food nearby."}
{"text":"Goodfellas used to be a five star deli, now they have moved and become a \"deli\" and draft-house.  The food quality has gone downhill since they moved.  It is still ok, but not like it used to be.    Parking situation is a little tough and there always seems to be a wait with no where to wait but at the front door.  So it is popular right now. However, food is not as good as it used to be.    Pizza is slightly better than the pizza joint next door.  Wings seem to be breaded, and every time we have got them they are soggy.  The real shame is the sandwiches have gone down a few stars.  They used to be amazing from first bite to last.  Now I would rate them slightly above your standard.  We are really disappointed.  Also, I don't think they have breakfast anymore, but not completely sure.  On the plus side, you can get a beer there."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The staff is always friendly and the food is great!  The blackened chicken wrap is my go to here, along with the seasoned house chips.  The prices are reasonable and they have a good selection of beer.    The only drawbacks are the size (it's small inside) and the parking (not terrible but not great).    Bottom line: highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying their food out and was not impressed! Ordered a fish sandwich to go. The fish was a big portion but wasn't crunchy as most fried fish are. The French fries were not hot and quite soggy. The girl who rung me out was not really personable And pretty much just rushed through my transaction as though I interrupted what she was doing."}
{"text":"Food, service, & beer selection is great.  Sandwiches are awesome, great salad choices, and pizza is best in area...only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star rating is I wasn't a big fan of the breaded wings...it's a personal choice, but I like traditional non breaded style wings, although the sauce selection is great."}
{"text":"Amanda the bar tender was kind and courteous. Although she forgot what beer I was drinking I still appreciate her smile and fun atmosphere she creates. Thank you, I will be back with friends! Sorry I was dirty from work. Not sure if you read this."}
{"text":"I got an absolute monster of a sandwich on delicious ciabatta bread for lunch. We were seated, beered, and fed very quickly. Definitely going to go back as there are a few more items on the menu I'd like to take to the gizzard."}
{"text":"We stopped in Sunday night for a sandwich.  This is one of those places that I'm sure is more \"fun\" on Fri/Sat night.  Sunday was sorta dull minus seeing Jordan Speith chip in that playoff bunker shot....only two people yelled.  Now, the reuben sandwich I had was quite nice.  Well toasted, and that's unusual, because most toasted sandwiches are just barely hit with some heat.  Side order of chips were not good.....just not good at all.  Sandwich was good....beer was good (local red ale).  I wish there was a 3 1/2 stars.....that's what they really deserve.  Doubt I'll ever be back because I was travelling, but do check them out if you're nearby."}
{"text":"Solid!!! We were greeted immediately upon entering and taken to an empty booth. Small place and I could see how they could get really busy. Our waiter immediately came over and got our waters leaving us time the peruse the menu, both food and beer. We decided to get wings and both got a sandwich as well. The menu isn't huge, sandwiches and burgers and a few pizzas but what we had was fantastic. The hubby noted that the deli mustard was entirely TOO hot which is why they don't get the other star. Our waiter had a great knowledge of the beers on the menu, which was incredibly helpful! Our wings arrived first as requested. We chose the Asian sesame. They were phenomenal. Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy,  and cooked on the inside. And the flavor, Soy with sesame and just a nice underlying heat. Scrumptious! I got the Deli Lama with sweet potato fries. The fries cooked perfectly. My sandwich corned beef and pastrami on rye with Cole slaw, Swiss, and thousand island dressing. The meat was so tender and just solidly good. The bread, fresh and yummy! The hubby got the wise guy minus the coleslaw. It is pastrami brisket, Swiss, deli mustard, on rye. He said the deli mustard was too hot but he liked the bread and thought the brisket was solid. We had cheesecake for dessert and it was rich and delicious! Overall solid and we will certainly go back, especially for the wings!"}
{"text":"This place is a good reason to skip subway for lunch and grab a quick sandwich from an actual deli."}
{"text":"Excellent joint!  We sat at the bar and got friendly and fast service.  Beer list is above average but wish they had more options for Browns and Porters.    Wings - good but they lightly bread them.  A true wing is never breaded.  I don't know if they bread in house or they get them from their supplier that way.  Either way, skip the breading... trust your wing!  :-)  I ordered the Spicy Fella pizza.  I kept calling it the Spicy Benny after a pizza I get regularly when in Charleston SC (D'Allesandro's).  It was excellent.  The crust was amazing and the toppings were delicious.  If you live in this area or visit... a must try."}
