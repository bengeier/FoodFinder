{"text":"I honestly don't know how it can get 4.5 stars.  I saw the Yelp rating and went there to try it out.  It is just ok.  The noodles is not that great, it is a bit soggy not chewy at all.  Taste is just ok too. 
 Ambient is below average, service is fine.  Not going to return."}
{"text":"I was just looking at the menu outside and decided to pop in for a quick bite. Seriously delish noodles that I, sadly, had to take-out so I don't have a pretty picture. The cook doesn't speak a lick of English, so just point to an item on the menu and expect the best."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of the plaza, this tiny restaurant faces Markham Road, so if you're not paying attention, you'll never find it. The main floor has limited counter top seating and patrons order take out and pay for their meals here. 

We visited around 7pm on Friday. The owner led us to the second floor for dine-in visitors, approximately 15-20 seats. He turned on the AC and lights just for us (... that should have been a sign, really). 

We ordered the spicy noodles and the shredded chicken cold noodles. The spicy noodles had good flavor, but there was no meat or toppings other than a few leaves of bokchoy. The noodle texture is chewy and smooth, but tastes like something you could cook at home. 

The cold chicken noodle was disappointing. The dish was too sweet and the first couple bites we could feel the sugar crystals crunching while we chewed. They used the same type of noodles for both. There was a reasonable amount of chicken and way too much cucumber. 

For the price ($8.99, $9.99), Szechuan Noodle House is not worth the fare they offer. Even for take out, they've out-priced their competitors in th area."}
{"text":"The fish did not taste fresh, wasn't flavourful at all. The portion size was mediocre."}
{"text":"Traditonal and authentic food of my hometown. Just opened after the new year. The chef is also the owner. They couple are running this small cozy restaurant. I have tried several times and did not loose any faith. Noodles are good and the roasted fish is better."}
