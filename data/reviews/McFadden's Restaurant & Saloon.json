{"text":"Should have trusted the 2-star yelp review & tried another place at Westgate. We went here to grab a bite before an event at Jobing.com arena. There was no wait & we sat down outside. We ordered beers which were $6 and $7 a pint. We asked about HH while I turned around & read the sign saying HH from 4-7sign. They took it down after explaining there weren't any specials. The fact that there was an \"event\" meant NO happy hour specials.... Zip, zero, none! Really you can't have even one beer on special? Lame.  Wing orders have to be ALL one flavor & you get 8. You can't get two \"flavors\". I guess that would be too complicated. A bit later we ordered a burger & a club sandwich. I kid you not, they came out in under 2 minutes! Obviously not made fresh for \"our\" order... Big disappointment. And even though the menu reads, \"all burgers cooked to medium\" it was well done.  Honestly the soft pretzel twist & the chocolate dessert stand inside the venue concession area looked better than what we ate at McFadden's. We won't be going back to this joint. If you don't have drink specials your food better be darn good..."}
{"text":"I'd give this place NEGATIVE stars.  Waited in line for a seat for about 15 mins-understandable, it's right by a stadium. Waited for our order to be taken & delivered-again, understandable it was busy. Food was about Applebee's quality on a bad day.  No ketchup, no napkins, no utensils-no service or ran by without noticing my flag down.  I grabbed my own ketchup and napkins. Proceeded to get scolded by the manager for getting our own napkins.   Poor service, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I do not party. I do not club. I no longer frequent establishments with the intent to get drunk and kiss men many years my senior. Those days are long gone, and this review reflects a chaste,  Labor Day lunch experience. No one peed their pants, or vomited $2 well drinks into the fountains outside. Be forewarned.   My boyfriend decided that he wanted to take me to Cabela's...not because I am a camper or outdoorsy girl, but because I have a love for all things elaborately themed. After traipsing through a delightful faux wilderness of guns and taxidermied animals, we were famished and ready to go just about anywhere to eat just about anything. We ventured across the street to Westgate, and McFadden's is where we happened to end up.  We walked in, and the place was just about empty. A courteous -  if a bit disconnected - hostess seated us at a table for two with big, comfy leather armchairs. Soon after, we ordered some nondescript beverages and surveyed the scene. Pretty classy interior for something set up like a sports bar/grill combo. No complaints about the atmosphere...lots of TVs, if that's your thing. \"If that's your thing\"...I use that phrase a lot in reviews. It's annoying. Sorry!  My boyfriend ordered the Pit Burger, and I ordered the Turkey Club. I can't speak for the millieu in the evenings, but we found the restaurant during the day to be very conducive to conversation, and enjoyed ourselves while we waited for our food. My Turkey Club was incredibly delicious...like, I want to eat another one. Right now. The fries were great...they are seasoned, but the menu doesn't tell you that. My boyfriend loved his burger, and the mashed potatoes he got to go with it...but I found them to be a little flavorless, and too buttery.   It's not a cool, hipster-points-hole-in-the-wall place, and nothing about it was special or gimmicky, but the food really was excellent for being something simple and unpretentious. Just regular lunch fare, at good prices and in a pleasing environment. The staff, as I mentioned before, was friendly enough, if a bit restrained. I wouldn't tell you to go out of your way to try it, and it really should be 3 stars, but that Turkey Club is still on my mind. Mmm."}
{"text":"Arrived at Midnight on a Thursday to have some martinis with my girlfriend. Bartenders were very nice however the bouncer (short black guy) was extremely rude. Music selection was really good and the drinks were decent. It was 12:45 and they called out last call so we ordered a martini. 15 minutes later the bouncer starts trying to kick us out. He was super rude and said that if we don't chug our drinks he would take them away. I did not appreciate his behavior due to the fact that you enjoy a martini not chug it. I was planning to celebrate birthday here but I will be taking it elsewhere. If you want people to drink in your establishment don't kick them out when they just ordered a drink."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We were here for the super bowl and paid a ton for the \"privilege\" to have a table for 8. Despite having that coveted reservation we still had to wait in line for over an hour. They clearly had no clue how to manage a crowd and provided a buffet for the $200 per person that was full of crappy choices. I would NEVER come here again. Do yourself a favor and stay away. The only reason they deserve one star (besides the fact I can't give zero) is that they have plenty of TVs- lots of places have those though, most likely your home included, so do yourself a favor and stay there."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!  Everything started out alright, our server Alayna was nice and did a fine job.  Then came the rude comments and trash talk from the other members of the wait staff.  This happened several times in the hour or so we were there.  When I'm a visiting football fan in another city I expect to hear it from opposing fans, but not from the wait staff at a place where I'm a paying customer.  I found it uncalled for and completely unprofessional.  Never done this before, but thought it was worth mentioning to management.  When we mentioned it to the \"GM\", Joe Keefe, he denied it ever happening and told us we were wrong.  Seriously, why would any of us lie about something like that!?!  I was appalled at his incompetency as a \"GM\".  All he had to do was acknowledge the problem and and take care of it.  Instead, he called us liars.  Then he had the nerve to try and make us feel guilty for not leaving a tip.  First time in my life that I didn't leave a tip.  The service was that bad.  Staff was disrespectful, unaccountable and just plain rude.  DON'T GO HERE!  Had a great time at Calico Jack's across the way.  If you're in Glendale go anywhere but McFadden's!  The place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Walked in today for lunch. I literally stood there for 10 mins waiting to be seated and I saw a few employees see me and no one came to seat us."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of friends.  All in our mid 40s.  The Bouncers were rude, the Bartenders didn't care to serve us.  Terrible experience, definitely won't be going there EVER again.  There were a few security guards that thought they were \"something\".  With this economy, it's a shame that rude employees are still working.  Management needs an overhaul at this place."}
{"text":"How are you an Irish Bar and out of Corned Beef?  Wow, that is not a very good first impression."}
{"text":"We tried this place because we got 'free' drink coupons at a spring training game. They were only good for light beer even thought they said any domestic beer.   The burgers were flat and dry and the tater tots tasted like they were from a frozen bag.   Sorry. Would not recommend this spot. Lots of other good restaurants in the plaza."}
{"text":"We went here on Jan 1st before the Fiesta Bowl, not to busy when we arrived at 8am.. Ordered from a special menu ( extra high prices ) for breakfast the food wasn't that bad, compared to the C rats we had in 1969. We asked for butter for our toast and water by the time we were almost done we asked another employee and he finally brought us some. When the bill came I didn't notice the 20% tip was included, I tipped $8.00 on a 35.00 charge plus the 20%.we would have done better having breakfast inside the stadium.  Interesting comment from above, our credit card was also compromise 9 days latter for $230.00 at two locations in the area, not pointing any finger, just saying. I suggest the manager spend some time at Ri Ra's in Las Vegas, now that's a real Irish bar with great food and great service."}
{"text":"1 star for drinks. 2 stars for everything else.   My husband and I went here because we had a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate. I've been to Westgate numerous times, but never McFaddens. We went during happy hour, & knew we couldn't use it on anything happy hour, but it was ok, because none of our drinks or food were on happy hour anyway. We'd be getting $25 off of our bill of $50, so half off. The place was dead. There were 2 other tables with people.   The mixed drinks, horrible. My husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea. A Long Island has 4 different kinds of alcohol in it & a splash coke. His drink looked like pink lemonade.  He cringed when he drank it. Me, I hate the taste of liquor. I tried his drink knowing it's supposed to have 4 kinds of alcohol in it. It tasted exactly like peach juice. There was no alcohol in the drink. I would say zero alcohol. No coke either. It was peachy tasting water. We waited and waited on the waitress to come back to send the drink back. She didn't come back. He went up to the bar and told the bartender to remake the drink while he was standing there watching him. The bartender made a new drink. It was an actual Long Island, and looked completely different side by side to the original drink. It tasted like it should have. My husband told the bartender that the next drink he orders, he wants him to make it. My husband orders drink #2, from the same bartender who he already complained to. The drink was just as bad & awful as the 1st one he sent back. He took the drink back to the bartender, again, and told the bartender it was peach juice. The bartender complained, and copped an attitude, saying they don't over pour their alcohol. We weren't asking them to over pour. We were asking them to make a Long Island, that contains alcohol, and not serve watered down peach juice.   The tvs were good. The food was average tasting. The menu food was about $8-$14. They have happy hour pricing on some appetizers, and some drinks.    We were so angry about the drinks and attitudes, we had to leave. The $25 off didn't matter. I'm giving them 2 stars because we did get half off the food, my beers, and peach water.   If you're going for mixed drinks, don't go here. It's the worse mixed drinks we've had. When you complain, they turn it around on you, like it's your fault."}
{"text":"They were wonderful! So friendly! Served quickly and efficiently! Great experience! They were busy, but made us feel very attended to. Everyone from the hostesses, waitress, and busboys were polite and accommodating!"}
{"text":"If this establishment were located anywhere else it would die the death it so much deserves.  We waited for over an hour to be seated only to be served the worse bar food we have ever encountered, it's hard to screw up chicken wings but mcfaddens did a fine job in doing so. Not only was the food bad but we were offered plastic dinner ware because they ran out of the metal forks and knives. There are to many other choices in the area to try,stay away from this place at all cost you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Terrible and unprofessional service. I work in the industry so I tend to be more lenient than others because I understand the inter-workings of a bar. However, I still expect to be treated with respect and professionalism. Upon entering I was just stared at by 3 workers but was not greeted at all. The \"manager\" if you could call her that was bad mouthing some of her guests to other bar guests. I found this appalling! If I were the owner I would be reading these awful reviews and making some changes. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that steals your credit card information look no further. If you have dined here in the past check out your credit card statements. You will see fraudulent charges on your account following dining at this dump. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for bike night! 1/2 off beers and apps!  Our go to place when we come here! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I will never eat at any McFadden's again. We waited for almost 15 minutes before we were even able to order waters. The Fish and Chips I received were so disgusting I actually lost my appetite. They were covered in so much batter most of it wasn't cooked and they were so soggy. I had to peel off the batter layer just to eat the fish. The Caesar Salad was miserable, hardly worth paying $5 for it but ended up costing $14. The menu stated the Caesar Salad without chicken is $11 but we were charged $14 because the menu and our waitress neglected to tell us that their menu prices are wrong. Aside from the fact that their food is gross, the place was so warm, smelt horrible and had flies all over the place. Don't eat here, it's an overpriced dump."}
{"text":"Came on January 9th.   Paid $35 cover for my group of family / friends. Seated at a table. After 15 minutes we asked the bar to have a server come by. Waited another 10 minutes, still nothing.   25 minutes with no recognition of us being there.   We spoke with the front attendant about being there 25 minutes already without a hello. One laughed, said keep waiting. At that point, I asked for our cover back. He laughed again.   Won't be back, our group ended up spending $1250 at a nearby establishment that night.   I now see the great Yelp reviews they have reflect our similar experience."}
{"text":"I would not recommend or ever go back.  Seemed dirty and unorganized. We went for lunch, at 2pm, and everything seemed disheveled from the night before.   Our waitress was unattentive and lingered coming back to the table. They were out of the fish and chips, so I ordered a burger. My husband ordered the Shepherds pie, and we had the jalapeño poppers. The poppers were ok, my burger was cooked correctly but lacked flavor.  My husband ate his shepherd's pie out of hunger. This is not a good restaurant and bar.  No wonder it was almost completely empty when the other restaurants/bars who busy. Never again!"}
{"text":"I walked into here lastnight with my sister sat down , got up after 5 minutes and asked for a waitress, one finally came got our water and order of chicken fingers after the fingers I wanted the check so  I  tried asked for the check but the waiter just fast paced walked by(let me mention it was slow not busy) so I asked another girl and she went to the back so I asked another waitress, she went and sat down but repeatedly looked back at our table?? So I asked another waitress which she finally grabbed my check & brought it back. I left a comment on the receipt, I was pretty upset, did not want to order anything else from the poor service from the brunette waitresses. After walking out I stood on the other side of the street waiting for some friends and looked towards McFaddens and noticed her doing motions towards me like if she was calling me out to fight which in my case is not what a waitress should do on the job , so completely poor service and poor behavior. Nice scene but poor poor wait staff and service."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. We had a party of 25 before a football game at University of Phoenix stadium and 4 of our cards have fraud alerts and we're used in various states around the country within 5 days. Manager said they \"We're aware of the problem because of a dated credit card system.\"  Stay away and BEWARE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had to share our terrible experience with this restaurant, looking at their listing for yelp, obviously we are not alone so I will keep it brief.   Food, pedestrian at best, although as expected for a glorified sports bar.  Wings were as dry as the desert we live in, worst we ever had, but after interacting with \"management\", and trust me I use that word loosely, it was probably by design to increase beer sales. My wife ordered a glass of wine, received something that was not close to what she wanted and the only response from our friendly but utterly incompetent food server was \"what do you want me to do about it?\", and \"maybe you can reconsider on your second round\", like we were actually going to keep throwing good money after bad and actually risk ordering anything else from this place.  Again, kind of expected from a place like this so we laughed about the odd response from the waitress and asked for the check.  We have always purchased an Entertainment Book, it gets us to try new places and you save a buck or two which is always a nice plus.  We gave it to her on the mobile app, she took the phone to the \"manager\" (again loosely used) and came back saying we cannot use it because the wings were considered an appetizer not a main course and you have to have two main courses to get the one free per their offer.  The wings were about the same price as my chicken sandwich any other real restaurant would have gladly taken off the least expensive item and moved on with everyone happy.  Not this place, even though it would have cost them the same or less than any other main course they refused to honor it.  OK, we laughed again and paid.  Then my wife noticed that they executed the coupon offer on the phone, you can only use it once so not only did they not accept it, it is now invalid for any future use.  Obviously we will never go back here again, even if it were totally free, but the point is they had no right to take the coupon and then not honor their offer.  We explained to the waitress about all of this and that we were upset about the entire experience and she just basically smiled and told us to have a good night.  At the hostess stand on the way out I asked to see the \"manager\" to let him know of our experience and the issue with the Entertainment card, he just stared at me blankly as I went through all the issues and, like the waitress, said nothing except OK.  His name is Baron, in defense of the restaurant I am not really sure he is a manager, looks and acts more like a bouncer and he seemed more interested in impressing the young hostesses as to how rudely he could treat me then actually acting like a manger and trying to resolve any of the issues I raised.  He gave me the General Managers card and told me to call him and deal with it, just what any GM wants in his manager.   Obviously I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, I think we would have been better off going to Jack in the Box, the food would have been about the same quality, if not better and less expensive, the service would have been much better, and at least the Clown would have smiled....."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the worst meals I've ever eaten. My wife ordered fish & chips, I had a burger. Both thought we'd be up with food poisoning. Generally you have an idea how good or bad a restaurant is by amount of people there. Well it was a Friday night at 6pm and there were less than a dozen people dining. If we didn't have Restaurants.com 25 off a 50, we would NEVER eat here. This has to be the red headed step child of Westgate!! Keep walking and find a dozen other places to eat."}
{"text":"Mediocre says it all.... food, service, atmosphere....1 star for being near the stage"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing happy hour and with the economy in a state of CRISIS I would much rather pay $2 bucks for a cocktail than $7. We have been in multiple times and we have a blast every time. We generally sit on the outside patio bar where Jay works on Saturdays. He is a hoot and has had us coming back for months now (We just moved here). It's always great to see a bartender with a sense of urgency. We still get the club feel outside with as busy as it gets, it's just not quite as loud on the patio. We had the fried fish this last weekend and would say its one of the best meals we have had in some time. Thanks Mcfadden's for being our favorite place to hang."}
{"text":"This place has the rudest most unprofessional bartenders I have ever dealt with, no wonder they get tipped pennies...and the DJ that tries to DJ is horrible, definitely needs to shut up and play music instead of talking nonsense for most of the night. Worst place ever and why would anyone even think throwing napkins just for fun is kool? Ridiculous Lol..McFadden at Westgate will never be recommended by me."}
{"text":"How disappointing is this place. Don't ask the waitress if you can substitute their burgers or wraps with chicken without getting a blank stare (even though it says on the menu substitute with chicken). Then she came back and told me the chef can do a chicken wrap like she did me a favor. Give her a pat on the back please!  Molly's tater tots on the apps menu was simply a pile of frozen tots, blob of sour cream, sprinkled with cheese, and there ya go. Overpriced, grumpy waitresses, not coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Quick to kick people out for no reason. Never coming here again.  Not law enforcement or military friendly. Terrible management."}
{"text":"This bar is extremely lame. All the bartenders except maybe one have horrible attitudes and make your drinks extremely weak. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"EPIC FAIL.   The food - good.  The servers - awful.  the bartenders and management - should be fired.  My reason?  The manager feels it's ok to bring his infant to the bar - I'll give him that it was 6:00pm on a Sunday - HOWEVER I will not give him that he was BEHIND the bar, serving drinks.  His kid was asleep. In a car carrier.  On a table.  about 30' away from him.   When I chose to complain about the level of inappropriate this was - what happened? Oh, we were asked to leave.  3 minutes after our food arrived.  For a party of 8.   I will never step foot in this place again.  At first I didn't blame the guy.  Good for you for not being a piece of s&%* and trying to handle business by doing your job an dsupporting your kid.  But when someone tells you it's inappropriate you have the nerve to kick them out because you dont like it?   I'll never go back to McFadden's or any where else they own.  Clearly they have crappy management, feel it's okay to dosrespect their patrons and that children of any age belong in a bar.  Supervised or not."}
{"text":"We paid over 500$ for a table asked the manager to come out he came and talked to us promised a meet and great with pauly d (that we had paid for) at the end they kicked us out and said we didn't pay for it after the manager chris had promised us we did, I asked for him again and instead we had security escort us out and told us when he was done for the night he would come out and talk to us. They were super rude and We were treated very poor for customers who had spent over 500$ in the facility! I will be contacting higher management."}
{"text":"This place is far worse than just a crappy sports bar with mediocre food.  It's a breeding ground for power-hungry, roided-up bouncers to physically abuse guests under management that has no problem looking the other way.  We watched the Super Bowl there, and look, I get it - it's clearly a challenge for any bar to manage that amount of activity and people.  That said, when they claimed to see my wife cutting in line to use the bathroom (she in fact saw a friend and was going to say hi) -they grabbed her and literally physically slung her out the front door.  She was shocked and ready to go talk to the police about it, but a manager stopped her from doing so and invited her back in. We wish we had left at this juncture.  Instead, after the game finished, the same bouncer approached my wife.  I intervened at this point - asking if there was a problem.  It was at this point that I was placed into a violent choke-hold and forced to the floor.  Other members of my party started video-taping because it was so egregious - other bouncers then screamed at them to turn off the cameras.  And keep in mind, no one in our party was drunk or unruly.  These bouncers simply decided that they wanted to get us out of the bar using a crazy amount of force.  They did the same thing to another member of our party-  who just happened to be the 70-year-old mother of our friend.  They called her a b**** repeatedly and bent her arm behind her back.  We tried to go to police at this point, but the logistics of doing so with thousands of fans emptying out of the stadium at the same time, proved too difficult.  it is our hope to provide local AZ television stations with our videotaped footage to spur potential legal action or at the very least prevent other customers from being physically abused there in the future.  In the meantime - stay far away from this place.  It's awful."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times and did not like it at all. I think what pushed me over the edge was this past weekend.  I was out celebrating my birthday and the DJ y'all had was horrible! He didn't let the song play for more than 15 seconds! I couldn't even enjoy dancing. Also the DJ was telling the ladies to get on top of the bar for a free shot, ghetto I might add, which caused another lady to get upset that she had an ass in her face, pushed her. I understand people act stupid, but the security didn't handle it well at all. I got my foot stepped by them and pushed out of the way. That was my last straw, I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss for sure, not a big fan though. I like to get my dance on and this place isn't that great for it. Drinks are the same as everywhere else but good luck getting one."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had happy hour there so there was no need to pay for cover which was a plus. However just to get a drink it took forever and the order wasnt even correct. Bartender will walk past you and skip your turn at lest five times before you even get a drink. Pretty good sized crowd but service not so great. We even had a table and you get your drink at the table just as fast as standing at the bar.  Haven't had a great Reuben sandwich in awhile and heard from a friend that the corned beef here was amazing so decided to give it a try in the day time.  The sandwich arrived and it looked really delicious and tasted like heaven. I'm big on sauerkraut and McFaddens wasn't stingy at all.  The corned beef wasnt too fatty just how i like it. I got extra dressing on the side to dip my sandwich in. It came with a side of red potato salad that was also mouth watering.   Will return to eat!"}
{"text":"DO NOT use your credit card here.  We were a party of 4, the bill was to be split between 3 credit cards.  Short story, each card was charged SIX times for various amounts.  When the server kept swiping our cards they got declined after the third swipe because the bank recognized it as fraud.  The server then came to our table and loudly announced that our cards were declined.  She failed to mention that she swiped each card SIX times!  She also included a 20% automatic gratuity that totaled $45 which we were never made aware of.  Since when is there an automatic grat for a party of 4? We are now waiting for the restaurant manager to respond.  Stay tuned...  Side note, the service was deplorable.  The food came and we had no silverware.  We had to request place settings and the server returned with a stack of cocktail napkins and no silverware!  The server also couldn't offer us any cocktails because she only knew the beer menu and couldn't give us a list of any other alcohol available. We had to ask repeatedly for water, napkins and all the basics.    They definitely have a good scam going- charge the customers and hope they don't notice or compare bills.  Luckily our banks were smarter than the server, which doesn't require much at all considering she didn't know the difference between a place setting and a cocktail napkin.  Update-.Just this week I was notified by my bank that the same credit card number used at McFadden's was used fraudulently for over $1,000 at another business in Glendale. Since I don't live in Glendale and haven't been there since the incident at McFadden's it seems more than a coincidence.  Some of my family who were charged multiple times haven't had the charges reversed and the manager has been full of promises but no results."}
{"text":"It's only a matter of time before the owner, Joe \"Picicucca\" as found in business registration records for this restaurant, is arrested. The credit card scam being run here is very similar to a credit card scam that was run half a decade ago at Calico Jack's, oddly also located at Westgate, when a manager named Joe \"Picciuca\" was working there. Whatever the man's real surname is, the service here is deplorable even without having to deal with removing illicit charges from your credit cards. The food is actually sometimes passable, although not worth the pricetag."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here on a whim to hang out in Westgate. Wow....it was the dirtiest restaurant Ive ever eaten in. The menu covers were disgustingly dirty and the large leather yellow dining room chair arms were horribly filthy and ripped and torn leather. I do not have small children but I could see the wooden high chairs from where I was sitting, I definatly would not put a child in one,  they were even dirtier than the chairs and menus. The food was so-so. Only nice/good thing I can report was our waitress was nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Place was empty. Table was sticky. Soda was not carbonated. Food took over 30 minutes to be served and everything ordered was only sandwiches and a burger. The waitress was nice but nothing else about the food was worth a second visit."}
{"text":"We've been to this establishment more than a few times always giving them the benefit of doubt that next time our service may be better but nope, not the case. The last visit topped it off for us to not give them anymore of our $. Not knowing that barstools are removed from the bar just before a game is over, my brother met up with another brother there  (Westgate), he is a disabled Navy vet, can't stand too long and asked the bartender if he could pull up a barstool to sit and was given the ok. Minutes later the manager comes up to him saying he couldn't use that stool and said he needed it asap, my brother told him he was disabled and the mgr replied \"I don't care!\" Wth? I was appalled at the treatment my brother received, disgraceful. On anther note, the service has always been bad, one visit we waited an hour for our food only to be told by the waitress she had forgotten to place our order. The bathrooms are always yucky and from what other people have said, their floors are always sticky. So never again will we be going to this place."}
{"text":"This place charged my friends and I 4X the amount expected.  After countless calls and visiting the location we still ended up with 2X the charges for the service provided."}
{"text":"Will never come back, they blast offensive sexual content songs at 8pm with young children in the area, when asked if it could be turned down was told no we are a bar"}
{"text":"This place is completely lame! Why you may ask? Horrible wait staff with bad attitudes, expensive bland unoriginal food. The lamest point of all is the other night before a Coyotes game we stopped in to eat and watch the TNF game. At least half of the TV's were glitching and horrible quality. Stay away, stay far away. Plenty of other places to hang in Westgate. Oh yeah this is probably only on a game night but beers are served in plastic cups only 3/4 full. Did I say lame"}
{"text":"I used to frequent McFaddens pretty frequently, particularly as a go-to place for a good meal at a reasonable price before a hockey game.  I went there last evening though and this was definitely my final trip there.  Just awful experience.  My party was seated within 5 minutes - so far so good.  Our server was pleasant and tried to be attentive.  However, she was spread across at least twice as many tables as a single server can reasonably cover, so her ability to check in with us was hampered.  I don't fault her for any of the adverse experience though.  The management there should be completely scrapped.  it took an hour for our food to arrive and each person in my party had a very simple meal that should have taken at most 10 minutes to make.  The server confirmed that they had only 1 cook working and he was covering the entire restaurant.  The establishment was filled at every table, so obviously this was horrible planning on the management's part.  When the food finally arrived, it was not what I had come to expect.  I and one of my party ordered our old favorite - the fish and chips.  The price had come up about $3/plate on this meal, but hey, whatever.  However, when it was delivered we had half of the fish pieces over before and less than 1/4 of the fries.  The coleslaw was horrible, too - and that used to be my favorite part.  The portions used to be too big but this was an insane swing in the opposite direction to couple with a significant price hike.  $16.99 for a kid-sized meal from McDonalds.  The fish was also undercooked.  The 3rd member of my party ordered a chicken club.  It came out with this 1/4 inch thick triangle of chicken jerky that he literally had to take the bun off in order to find.  The bun was 2 inches thick in total.  Suffice it to say he got bread with a hint of chicken flavoring.  Because of how horribly inefficient the service was, at this point we have 15 minutes until our hockey game started.  We alerted the server to our concerns when going to pay the bill.  She immediately engaged the manager, but after 10 minutes we had to flag her down to find out what was going on - we still hadn't received a receipt to sign.  She server informed us that the manager decided not to charge us but should have been by.  He never appeared.  Upon departing we found him hanging out on the back patio bar area, chatting and laughing with people that were obviously his friends.  I haven't had such a poor experience at any restaurant in recent memory.  Stay away from this place - it used to be pretty decent but has completely fallen apart.  While waiting for our food we observed much the same with other patrons - very unhappy faces and a few groups that just walked out in disgust without having gotten food served."}
{"text":"Our bartenders and servers were fantastic! Our drinks and food were good. The smell in the restaurant and bar area was awful. The bathroom was worse. Shame on the city and Gila River for not resolving the sewer issues"}
{"text":"This could possibly be the WORST venue I have ever been to.   I had an event here with around 50 people 2 groups of 24 plus myself & my assistant.  It's was probably 110 degree outside in the Desert Summer.   They had ALL the doors open. It was well over 90 degrees inside the location.   1 of my guest actually said it was cooler outside.  The paramedics actually had to come cause someone fainted in the bathroom.  The staff was completely RUDE!  Every last one of them!  The security told 3 of my female attendees that everyone was leaving as he was checking their IDs to get in.  Half of the staff were posted up on the back wall, with one foot on leaned up on the wall let they had to hold it up.  The server hardly ever came over to take drink orders let alone clean up!  I was bussing my own tables.   The one time I went to ask the server to come over she was in the back service well.  And not 1 single employee moved from thier wall post so I could get by to ask her to come take care of the group.  When I asked someone to turn the lights up so my group could see papers they were filling out for the event, he made a HUGE deal about it.  Then when I went the second time to ask about the lights again, I stood at the bar and over heard 2 of your employees bad mouthing my request! If you didn't want the group there you shouldn't have booked our event.   Never again will I set foot in this horrible bar even for a drink, let alone bring it a 50 person event."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. The service or lack there of was ridiculous. They just built a new location at Desert Ridge that I will NEVER visit because of this experience. Good luck making it there with service like this!"}
{"text":"30 mins sitting at a table, waitress never showed. Walked out with nothing. Why does this place exist?"}
{"text":"The waitress did not ask if we wanted water or a to go box. When she checked up on us once she didn't stop walking. She just said your still doing fine right and kept walking. When we gave her the cards for the bill she dropped one on the ground and some random person picked it up. The food was not made correctly."}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch the other day expecting good fish and chips...well I was wrong!  They were fish sticks! Who the hell serves those anymore?  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and nice. The highpoint of my lunch for sure.  So MAYBE I had a Guinness for lunch. What I didnt expect was $7 for the pint! Am I seriously back home in NY right now??   FIsh and chips and MAYBE a beer + tip = $32 for lunch!!  Total rip off--never again."}
{"text":"Fun place! Bad smell though.... I love how we can get on the bar and dance for shots lol. My last visit here I was kicked out though. Someone had dropped their *glass* drink on the floor next to me and some of the glass cut my foot. I was bleeding and instead of helping me... they wanted me to leave. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food is not the best. Service is ok but they forgot to give silverware. We had 4 different servers not sure why? Very unorganized."}
{"text":"We (5 of us) went into mcfaddens  on 3/19/14 at approximately 7:13, we were sat and 10 mins went by and nobody saw us. I check the time because I'm a server myself and know about seeing people within 90 secs and we were pressed for time because we were going to a concert. So I went up to bar, after another 3 mins the bartender asked what I need and I said no one has seen us and it's been a while. The bartender came out and offered us drinks, I said we needed to order and she said go ahead. We gave 5 orders of drinks and food and she wrote nothing down. As soon as she walked away I said she would get order wrong, I knew she would because she didn't write it down. At least she made an attempt to help us because a server never did. She brought out our 1st round and some water. Then 20 mins went by and we asked about our food. The restaurant was dead, it shouldn't take that long. We stopped some random host/server and said that we have to leave and to just cancel the order. She went to tell manager after a couple mins a girl came over and said the food is ready, I said we'll take it in boxes because we have to go. Sure enough only 4 orders came out and my order was wrong. The manager said he was comping drinks for the wait and the meal that did not go out so he was going to run the payment for remainder of food. I went to go find him and tell him that my order was wrong as well, he came over and verified it was. He said we could have it anyway, and that the other order that was missing was ready. He brought it out and said he was sorry, I told him that I knew it wasn't his fault but our experience should not have happened this way. So after we left I opened up the box to the order that was missing and the bread was burnt to all 3 sliders. My friend didn't eat that, I ate part of the cold burger that I didn't order and girlfriend ate some of her wings - in the car - because we spent 50+ mins at Mcfaddens for terrible service, incorrect and burnt food that we didn't even get to eat in restaurant. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Been to this bar 3 times now and every time I have had to correct the wait staff when it came time to pay the check. They have added drinks and food that we didn't order all three times. Was there this past weekend and they added a drink we didn't order. Out side of that its a fun place in a great location. 1 star for bad service. Keep track of what you order."}
{"text":"Is less than one star available? No stars. You disgusting food microwaving bad service loud ass stupid people should go on bar rescue  or something. Rubbery fish and chips? 20 dollar microwaved teenie steak with 3 shrimp?  Who microwaves food at a restaurant! A horrid waste of 50 dollars on my birthday. Thanks guys. Oh also tell your DJs. Making the mic louder than the music and loud enough people were leaving. MIIIGHT be a bad idea. Get a new owner."}
{"text":"We went to McFadden's for St. Patrick's Day last year and again a week ago.  Last year was AMAZING FUN!  I would give the place 5 stars.  This year was LAME!  There was a cover charge for a restaurant/bar that was self seating.  There were no tables/seats available at 5 PM.  They were serving hamburgers from the hostess station...?  We were able to finally find a waitress for our standing only bar table.  The food was great, but I may have been intoxicated by that time.  After we finished our food they removed our table to make room for a dance floor.  The whole experience was nothing compared to last year's celebration that included bag pipes, bands, and great service.  Not sure what happened to McFadden's AZ."}
{"text":"We drove  3 hours to see a hockey game and met up with a friend that was visiting the Phoenix area. We chose McFadden s because it wasn't crowded so we could visit. It was just 4 of us and very few other patrons. I.had to look for a chair that wasn't broken and after 4 attempts I found I felt safe to sit on. We only ordered beers and when we asked for a 2nd round we waited 20 minutes and still our beers weren't delivered. I searched for our waitress and she was just standing at the end of the bar on her cell phone and when I asked her if she was bringing our beers she just so said \"oh sorry I forgot\".  At 6.00 dollars a beer this was disappointing!  Broken chairs, ash trays and tables outside were dirty. This place is a disaster and will never go back. Oh, and the smell of sewage from the bathrooms was horrible!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food is horrible and the drinks are way overpriced."}
{"text":"Terrible!  First visit was a train wreck. ..literally out of 3/4 of their menu...was overcharged for what we did order, spoke with the manager who seemed sincerely apologetic and explained they had several people walk out and not show up that day along with a few other problems. Decided to give them another try since we had a $50 gift certificate for them... never, ever again!!! The place smelled like it was having sewage issues, it was completely empty of customers except us. We were given menus, spent 10 min deciding what we wanted and then the hostess came back and said she had mistakenly given us the regular menu and that they were on \"event\" menus this week because of all the extra games going on.  She explained that the event menu was just a condensed version of their regular menu... um NO, that was not the only difference. ..the event menu is more expensive and does not include happy hour (which we were there for). Apparently the manager was the one to direct the hostess to replace our menus. Clueless! We walked out, spent $60 at another restaurant despite having the gift card for this joke of a place and won't be back!"}
{"text":"12/13/2015 - Really poor food choices - for an Irish restaurant, the menu only has 2 'possible' Irish dishes, though the staff had no idea what the ingredients were nor how they were prepared. They served Guinness in a Smithwick's 12 ounce glass (not even a pint glass), the floor was filthy, littered with food droppings, napkins and other garbage, the servers and manager were rude (they correct us for ordering the wrong tator tots) and the place smelled like grease. Will never go there again and will warn all my family and friends to stay away. If a place could get negative stars, this place would qualify. Really bad restaurant experience."}
{"text":"My wife bought a half off deal coupon before I got a chance to review this place on Yelp. (Something I always do.) But I thought I'd look anyways before we went and it looked pretty dismal. I didn't even want to go. I had assumed from walking by in the past it was a reputable establishment but the poor reviews were so numerous.  Boy, was I surprised! Now granted it was a Sunday late afternoon and it was dead. so we were seated promptly. Classic rock played medium-softly in the background. Lots of TVs with sports shows surrounded us.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Our drinks arrived in a couple minutes. (They had happy hour pricing. Buds $2, well drinks $3, some appetizers $4.) Some drinks are limited as they don't have a blender. So you won't get a frozen margarita but one on the rocks. Our food arrived in several minutes. Everything was hot. In fact we had to wait for it to cool off!  My Reuban sandwich ($10.99) was big and piled high with tender corned beef on thick marbled rye. Seasoned steak fries were hot and crispy. My wife's BBQ wings ($9.99) were big and meaty and the honey BBQ sauce made them look like jewels. All was good. I'd go back.  Maybe all the bad reviews made them change their ways. I did take away one star due to high prices. They could stand to take a couple bucks off."}
{"text":"Went there after a concert.  We were asked if we want outdoor or indoor.  It wasn't too cold out so we said out.  We were not asked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking and never having been there before I didn't know there were two sides.  They sat us in smoking so we had to go back inside and ask for another table.  Attitudes were not very nice.  It took forever to place an order and when it finally arrived, it was cold.  We tried to get someone's attention a couple of times, but finally gave up.  This is one restaurant we won't be returning to.  There are plenty more in that area to choose from."}
{"text":"I visited from California and wanted to check out a fun bar to dance at with my 4 friends. The two boys paid a 10$ cover and we all got drinks immediately. No more then 3 minutes after receiving the drinks, two of them get knocked over from a girl walking by. We immediately go up to the same bartender (as a worker is cleaning up the mess behind us), explain that the brand new drinks got knocked over and he proceeds to say, \"well what if everyone in the bar came up to me saying their drinks got spilled want wanted a new free one??\" So we order another drink expecting not to be charged for it. A couple minutes later we were still upset and decided to leave. Receive our bills and were charged for the spilled and new drinks. On the way out, we are trying to finish the drinks fast and a girl bumps into my drink and it gets spilled AGAIN. We find a manager and explain the story and his response was \"sorry a lot of our bartenders act like assholes.\" As if that made it okay? So he gets us one free drink and then we explain what happened earlier about the first two drinks had spilled and he goes \"wait outside and I will get you guys covered.\" We waited outside and we see him chatting away with the hostess at the front for about 10 minutes hanging out. Basically he had no desire to help us, he shooed us away outside so he didn't have to deal with us.   I've been in the service industry for 9 years and this was the absolute worst customer service I've experienced in a long time. I'm understanding of drunk rude people trying to get free things but this was our first bar and were completely polite. Even worse that we were visiting and this was our first impression of the city. If I could I would give it zero stars."}
{"text":"IF you are a wanna be gansta, like rude service and poor quality, over priced food......MAN, You are in for a treat. EVEN the security guards have bad attitudes!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a 2nd try - still terrible.  We went to the Westgate area to eat at one particular place, but it was closed.  I had my ent coupon book with me and this place is in it so I thought might as well try it one more time since it is a BOGO.  The 1st time we went the food was OK but the service was terrible.  I thought the place was a bit run down but to be expected in the area w/ folks only frequenting it as a place to get loaded on game days.  It was a bit busy that night and they were clearly short staffed so I thought to give them a break.  So when our 1st choice was closed tonight - I thought we would give it another try.  Still terrible facilities...this time there was so much dirt on the ledge beside our table I could write my name in it.  There was only one server working as waitress and hostess - OK I guess since we were only one of 3 tables the whole time we were there.  The tea was clearly old (or from an unclean musty dispenser) and I had her take it back & give me a soda instead.  When she went to bring my soda back, she delivered my coke to another table and returned their credit card to us...I would have been HOT if I was the other guests - it was really shocking - very careless service!  We placed our order including the appetizer and waited.  Waited  Waited  finally our food comes - and we just said take the appetizer off the bill.  She was surprised that it never came out....Really? your are the only server in the place - do you think it grew wings and brought itself to our table?  Ordered traditional Pub faire - Bangers & Mash.  Hubby had Corned beef.  It was OK - the Corned beef was tough - I can make it better at home.  All in all - once again - disappointing.  Above all I can't believe how dirty this establishment is.  Obviously you are slow on non-game days....you have plenty of time to clean and GET ORDER RIGHT!  Will Not be returning ever!  even with a coupon!"}
{"text":"So disappointing, it states that McFaddens is a 49ers bar but then they play the Colts volume in game on the big screen and refuses to turn the volume on for the 49ers. And I've had nothing but issues with food 3 weeks in a row Joe the manager did make the food right took a couple of tries. Just so disappointed will not be back if your 49ers  Niner fan don't come here."}
{"text":"This is an over priced sudo pub that used to be a sports bar and should be closed. The service always sucks - day or night . I've been dragged there several occasions   by friends who \"wanted to check it out\" each time was worse than the time before. I guess having staff that is almost nude is better than having staff that actually will bring you your order.  Some one told me it was supposed to be an Irish Pub... it's not even close."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago,  I was quite happy to see a familiar name. Good sized place, and the music was great all night. It got a little crowded, and I bumped into the guy next to me and spilled some of his drink. I apologized, bought him a new one and shook his hand. 5 minutes later 3 security guards walk up behind me and tell me I have to leave. No one can tell me what I did, but I wasn't going to get belligerent or argue with them, but being totally classless they kept shoving me as the bartender who was closing my tab was running my card. Even he asked what happened, and was just as dumbfounded as I was. So, if you come here, be careful."}
{"text":"One word......WOW!!!!  My family and I dined at McFadden's yesterday afternoon and I have a few things I would like to bring to everyone's attention. First of all I ordered the chili cheese nachos and the actual tortilla chips were horrible. I'm not sure if they are freshly made but if they were they were probably fried in rancid oil possibly. Secondly, while my wife was in the restroom, one of the waitresses came into the restroom while holding a customers dinner.  She went fully in and once she saw my wife she exited as fast as she could. I truly cannot believe that happened.   Stay far away!!!!! Trust me!!!"}
{"text":"This place charged me for stuff I didn't even buy. Never again. Watch your wallets around here people"}
{"text":"Maybe a Sunday night of a Cardinals home game is not the best night to experience McFadden's but if they can't handle the football crowd then maybe they shouldn't have opened their doors at Westgate.   The female bartenders were RUDE. They passed my friend up several times before letting him order his drink. And, they got snarky with people sitting next to us. They seem to be cut from similar cloth and it ain't pretty.   The 30-45 minute wait for a table turned out to be more than an hour. No surprise, but they didn't bother to tell us we could have gotten a table on the patio off of the bar right away.   Ordered the turkey club sandwich which was supposed to be served with bacon and cranberry mayo on Texas toast. Guess I looked like I need to trim the fat from my diet because my sandwich was baconless. And, they ran out of sliders, buffalo wings and boneless wings BEFORE 7 p.m. What kind of bar runs out of bar food before the peak dinner crowd has even arrived???? The fries were pretty good and our table service was very friendly at least.   There are lots of TVs all tuned to the game and the Cardinals and Vikings fans all seemed to be getting along well. No pushing, shoving or name calling. So, the first impression was not great but I'm willing to give it another chance ... maybe."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down- they are essentially thieves. Had a horrible time here.. Overpriced, poor service, meathead staff"}
{"text":"Horrible. Sports bar/club? It's a good thing the investors own other establishments that make them able to keep this crappy place open. Either the ownership doesn't care or they are that dumb. The overall cleanliness is 2. The service was 3. At any moment there were 4+ associates standing around chatting it up. I understand over staffing for busy hours and having downtime, but when the business is failing so bad at cleanliness it's not acceptable. There seemed to be no supervision nor did any associate seem concerned about the well being of the patron. Good luck with your future business decisions as I do hope they improve and there is some accountability with the management."}
{"text":"The Shepherd's Pie listed on the Irish Faire section of the menu was mediocre, at best. It was soupy and greasy. It was basically ground beef soup. The vegetables were almost nonexistent. There were only a couple of bits of carrot. Peas, a customary ingredient, were missing. For $14.99, I expected a large serving and expected to take some home. The serving was less than generous. For a place that claims to be Irish, they need someone to show them how to prepare Shepherd's Pie. The Sam Adams Octoberfest was good."}
{"text":"Don't use your credit card here.  They have a credit card stealing problem from what it seems.  I was there for a Coyote game in December and stopped in for a drink.  A week later my card was compromised.  Too many Yelpers here saying the same thing to be coincidence."}
{"text":"This place is so poorly managed and aweful, it's difficult to make an emphasis. They just don't care about their service. At all... So odd..."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I would give negative stars if I could. Waitress charged me $10 more.  When disputing it, she said that's because of tax, when it clearly said subtotal. It was my birthday and I waited an hour and a half for my bill, missed my movie. The manager is even worse. He slammed the receipt and rolled his eyes. I couldn't believe it. I wasnt rude, I was just disputing the charge. Theres a whole list more to say negative about this place, but it would be 2 pages long. ALSO, check your bill, they will try to charge you extra than what the menu states."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I got engaged yesterday. My new soon to be mother in law happened to be at this establishment and my parents and I happened to be across the way at yard house. We walked over to talk to her for a minute since both the families parents happened to be there. My fiancées mother was a paying customer at the bar, there was one barstool available at the bar next to her so my fiancée sat there and the rest of the family stood and talked to her for about 20 minutes before the bartender told us if the rest of us aren't going to drink we need to leave. There were other spots available to sit in the restaurant. We weren't bothering anybody and we're happy to stand while only taking up ONE barstool. I've never been told to move at a bar before for no reason and I thought that was pretty rude. Don't go here. Go to the yard house. You will have a better experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than a star, I would. I'm not allowed back in here after being kicked out for taking a picture of my friend. Yes, that's exactly why. I was here on a Friday night with my friend, drinking, hanging out. And she asked me to take a picture of her with her drink in hand. So I said of course. I took out my phone and right as I did a security guard came up to me and said no camera. I had never heard of this any of the million times I had been there before. So I simply asked why and he grabbed me by the arm and threatened to kick me out if I didn't calm down. I wasn't being aggressive at all and even the crowd around me was telling the security guards that I didn't do anything to be kicked out. But it didn't matter. They just escorted me out and that was that. I've had multiple incidents here but that one was just too much. So I decided I wouldn't go back anymore. I even had my drink spilled on the floor after a different security guard bumped into me on purpose. There was nobody around me for miles but he chose to walk right into me. I had told the manager about it but he didn't even want to hear me. Do yourself a favor and never come here. Unless terrible service is your thing."}
{"text":"I will NEVER go back to this place again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They aren't even worth the one star that I had to rate them with! My fiance and I went there on a Thursday night to meet a good friend that was in from out of town for just one night. After we waited in line for about 10 minutes, the door guy told my fiance that he wasn't allowed in because of the brand of boots he was wearing! Are you kidding me?! We thought it was a joke at first, but then realized through his douche bag personality that he was being serious. Let me just explain to you that these were new, clean $150 boots that this happened over ... So, he did not look like a bum, or whatever they were implying. We stood outside waiting for our friend to come out and witnessed a guy go in with cowboy boots, probably 10 girls go in with boots on, and a guy wearing a baseball hat with a hoodie on with the hood of it pulled over his hat all allowed in. When our friend came out he was mad and asked the door guy what the reasoning was, and the door guy put his hands around our friends throat and pushed him and told him he needed to get off of the property! 5 minutes later the police arrived b/c apparently the idiots at McFadden's called them on our friend, and then they proceeded to tell the police that we were \"taunting\" them because we were standing out front of the bar!!!!! For any McFadden's employees that read this ... Even the police were laughing at what absolute pathetic douche bags you all were for your ridiculous rules!!!  I have never been treated like this, or seen so much disrespect in my life! I hope everyone reads this and refuses to give that place any business!!!"}
{"text":"Wow it was so bad  We asked to sit on the patio and no one ever came to ask us if we wanted a drink or bring us water !!! Tables were left dirty on the patio as well .. We got up and left  Went across to whiskey rose and the same thing !! Nobody ever came out . We walked out and so did the table next to us ...no service and no customer service. And they could care less"}
{"text":"So I was very skeptical as there were so many bad reviews.....but was glad we tried it out.....this was a super busy night, as this is night 2 of the Taylor Swift concert....traffic wasn't bad headed out this way, parking went pretty smooth, not too crowded....the sign said 30 minute wait (unless we wanted to sit outside) but we got right in...server was very attentive and food came out quickly....pricing wasn't too bad and food was enjoyable....makes me wonder if we went to the same place as others did...lol"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!!!!!! Do not come here for drinks OR food. The place is always dead and it still takes 45 minutes for food to come to the table. The drinks are over priced and they are weak. Hopefully someone will come around and buy out this place and put it out of its misery soon."}
{"text":"I read that they would get my check wrong and sure enough, it was. Wow.  I told her to not even try to explain since I knew it would be an overcharge because they are sort of known to do this.   Wow.  this place is simply not good.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Whats up with this Staind wanna be band on Paddys Day? They arent good for the crowd"}
{"text":"Wow.  I went to McFadden's 4 nights ago and I was still amped to blast them on here.  But after reading all the other negative reviews I see I was just another victim of their standard operating procedure.  I went there twice in the last few weeks(Coyote's games) and I'm done.  On the first visit I ordered a Black and Tan.  After receiving what looked like a Guiness with powdered sugar in it and waiting 10 mins for the bar tender to acknowledge, I was informed that they don't have Bass and use something else in their Black and Tans.  Naturally, I asked why this wasn't brought to my attention at the time the drink was ordered.  To which the bartender offered no apology, but replied: \"It's on the menu\"  Really!?!  First of all a Black and Tan should have separation whatever you use, and second, who uses a menu to order a beer at a bar!?  On the second visit my buddy was told he had won a  free happy hour for ten people, but it was actually a reduced price in drinks.  I don't know what caused the miscommunication but after the way they treated me the first time, they're not getting the benefit of the doubt.  I had about 15 people come from the East side and ended up picking up several rounds to make it worth their trip.  That was just the main peanut in a pile of poor treatment.   The customer service at this place is miserable.  I have no idea how they are staying in business.  That being said, I can concur that the Turkey Club was quite delicious.  That's why I'm giving the place 2 stars.  I suggest getting it to go...."}
{"text":"My TWO STARS is because, seating was ample...NOT due to the food, nor service, nor management....  AS YOU MIGHT NOTCIE, I tried this place and wrote a review last year after (Nov 2014) after I did an ONLINE search looking for a '49ers fan' place to enjoy football season.... Not only did I give this place a second chance, but to be fair I came back three weeks in a row!  FIRST! and foremost, according to Joe, the manager on duty ... this is NOT a 49ers bar/restaurant - ummm? then please remove it from the list!. Joe says the GM likes the 49ers, but Joe will decide what games (sound) is on the big screen...   1st week Nov. 2015: food was room temp., Joe (manager in charge) made accommodations for the food.   Not many patrons but lots of waitstaff ... standing around chatting under the big screen... I would think that with that many employees, the individual guest attention would have been MUCH better.  \"49er VIP section\" empty, and told its for PAY only.  2nd week Nov. 2015: asked to sit in the  '49er VIP section' with a large screen... was told, you have to pay. Waited and watched while others came in and sat there.... Ordered shepard pie (barely room temp.) Again, lots of waitstaff standing around chatting with each other... continually waited for service. We pointed out the chicken bone where we had moved the chair from... our server said 'oh, that happens all the time'... um?  3rd week Nov 8. 2015:  upon entering asked again about the VIP seating... The host said NO, you have to pay for that seating. Asked, Joe about sitting there and he said 'paying/reserved  is only on Friday and Saturday night, YES, go ahead and sit there, I will let the hostess' know'.... he went over and corrected the hostess'. Again, lots of wait staff.... our server was pleasant. Instead of bringing Corona Light for the 2nd & 3rd beer, regular Corona's were delivered ... got that straightened out. Mosquitos were galore in this VIP seating area and we kept fighting them off, even asked if they had a spray we could use. There were only three of us in the VIP seating with large screen... asked if the sound could be turned on THIS TV or if the sound in the restaurant could be changed to the 49ers, again after reading ONLINE that this is restaurant was listed as a 49ers location... it is NOT!!! Joe, the manager adamantly told our server he is NOT putting the sound on for the 49ers... during half-time, I went to the bar where Joe was making drinks and asked, nicely, for him to help me understand.... why the 49ers sound was not and could not be played, if this restaurant is a  49ers sports bar?  Still preparing drinks and walking away, barely giving me any attention, stated that the GM is a 49er fan and he Joe, is not, and that he (Joe) puts the sound on for what he thinks will be the GAME OF THE DAY... as I had already studied the patrons (less than 15 people inside) none of which were following the Bronco vs Colts game.... I pointed this out to Joe, he stated ... I am NOT changing the TVs.... very sad.... He said we could call when the games are playing to check to see what sound/game will be playing...  Very very sad....  Sadly, this restaurant has potential... if the cooks could get the orders right, the waitstaff could deliver it before it is cool (and less chatting with other employees) and decide whether or not they are a 49ers bar ... I think they need BAR RESCUE ... before its' too late... and they join the ranks of other fallen bars/restaurant..."}
{"text":"I am not ok with a bar asking women to get off of their seat to make room for more people. Customer service is not priority here."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! The servers are thieves! Alissa C added money to her tip. When you call to speak to a manager, the hostess tells you they are in a meeting and the manager never returns your call. Garbage establishment."}
{"text":"What a jerk the guy checking ID's is. I'm a 57 YO guy and when I asked why he needed to see my ID he said, \"because I said so.\"  I'm guessing the place got in trouble for underage drinking and they require the guys to check everyone."}
{"text":"Was in to watch some Sunday football today and the bartender's changed shifts at 4pm so we cashed out. No problem.  Had great service and bartender was very friendly.  2nd shift bartender \"not so much\".   When the bill came we pointed out to him that we were overcharged for our drinks and they were the EXACT same drinks we had with the first bartender.  We first confirmed there was NO happy hour just to make sure that wasn't the reason for the price increase.  Bartender says to us ...and I quote \"I don't know what deal you had with the other bartender but these are the prices in the register so I don't know what to tell you\" Excuse me?  We had our receipt right there and we didn't know the 1st bartender from Adam , there was \"no deal\" and you need to make this right.  Overcharged $8.  Go somewhere else.  Why get ripped off? I'm sure you all work for your money too:)"}
{"text":"The food here is great. But the waitress that dance on the bars are ugly. The Asian one is hot and hooks me up with free drinks."}
{"text":"Dear reviewers reading, Went here last night after Whiskey Rose was shutting down for the night it was only 12 am and a lot of people were looking for more drinks good thing this place stayed open. Everything was super great the bartender put together a sex on the beach drink and there's is sweeter than Whiskey Rose which surprised me. A lot of normal drunks hanging out trying to talk and laugh. Nothing unusual next time I'll try the dance floor when its a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"This is located in Westgate, personally i thinknthe place is ok, to watch a game. The beer is normally just average and the food DO NOT EAT, we have tryed 3 different items and they are awful. Like i said its ok to watch a game and thats about."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Seattle and went to this restaurant tonight with friends. It was an absolutely terrible experience.   The service was incredibly slow and unattentive. We waited about 40 minutes for our food to come and we only ordered 3 appetizers to share. Our drinks took a good 10 minutes to arrive and when we asked for extra sauce or a drink refill, it never came. As we looked around, we noticed many other tables scanning the room looking for their servers as well.    The food itself was disgusting. I'd compare it to gas station cuisine only it was served on a china plate and we paid 4 times as much for it. We ordered the \"Irish Nachos\" which was supposed to be crispy fries with melted cheese and other typical nacho toppings. What we got were soggy steak fries (which also ended up coming with the two other appetizers we ordered-fry overload!) soaked in fake cheese sauce with some dried up chunks of tomato. The boneless wings looked and tasted like they were straight out of a frozen package and the sliders must have have been brought over from the local fast food joint...actually, I would have preferred a fast food burger to the measly meat patty on stale bread that we were served.   We ended up cancelling the next round of drinks that we had ordered and left very unsatisfied. An Applebees would have been a serious step up from McFadden's. DO NOT EAT HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good service...but...it sucks that everyone by passes this place to go to the Sandbar for weak drinks and horrible service. Hoping the best for this place!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the night scene here, I have never ate here/been here during the day.    This place has a lot of potential but the security/staff kills the vibe.  It's just typical Glendale bar BS where they kick everyone out for \"looking drunk\"/just not liking you.  Other people I've talked to have had similar experiences here.  Even though they have a DJ and go-go dancers on the bar, you should not dance because they will kick you out for that too.  One time a bartender poured me a beer that was all head and then just gave it to me like that was normal.  I noticed that in the past year it has gone from being relatively crowded every Friday/Saturday night to almost empty whenever I walk by.  Based on that and the fact that the yelp rating is so low, I'm guessing that I'm not the only one who has had a bad time here.    I don't know who is in charge of the staff for all these bars at Westgate, but they should probably re-evalute their training and policies or else nobody is going to want to come back again. It's not like it's even cheap to go out there, and they try to charge a cover every weekend.  I live on the west side, but I'll gladly spend another $15 to take an uber downtown instead of having to put up with bad customer service and the threat of having security kick me out suddenly when I'm just minding my own business and trying to chill out."}
{"text":"We are Seahawk fans and wanted to come to this so-called Seahawks bar to watch the Superbowl to be with other Hawks fans. Here was our experience:  1) We paid $105 per person for standing space since the place was fully booked. It said the price included a buffet of food. They had a couple trays of nachos and wings for hundreds of people.   2) Waiting in line was so confusing. We were supposed to have access to it from 4pm-end of the game. Waited for an hour; fought through the line to ask the host, he had no clue of what was going on and said we were in the right line. Found out later that we were in the walk-in line, not the line with people who had reserved a spot (this was a blob of people, not a line). We finally fought our way into the bar.  3) Whenever the Patriots scored, someone blew a horn.. Seahawks bar?? Not to mention some Pats fan (a guy) pushed me when I fought my way to the bathroom.  4) When we lost the game, they played the song \"We are the Champions\".. WTF. I would rather they just slap me in the face directly.  The whole experience was awful. At some point some punk Patz fan threw (Yes, he really threw it!) a tray of unfinished food on a large table of Seahawk fans and then wanted to fight. Sauces and food went flying everywhere and got on people's shirt. After the game, not only they trash talked, they also took off their shirts (the guys) and flung it around and wanted to fight.   The whole reason we picked a Hawks bar was because we want to be with other real Hawks fans. This is a flip-flopping bar. Whoever wins, they support. Overpriced, overcrowded, rude staff. Never again..."}
{"text":"I'd come back every night for the sexy Asian dancing on the bar! Drinks were ok, not very strong, but other than that, very cool environment. They gave away free shots! Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"A small group of us ate here before an event over at the stadium and it was terrible. There were a few issues that we had throughout our dinning experience but what really ruined it for me was the food and the way it was handled.  I ordered the Beef sliders, which is listed on the menu as \"topped with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle ranch on brioche buns\".  What came out though was a very sad and flat looking patty on a bun with a tiny dot of chipotle sauce. I pointed this out to the waitress and asked where the rest of the toppings are, most impotently the caramelized onions, she told me that they were out of them!   If they are out of the toppings then why wouldn't they tell me this? Our event was about to start at the stadium so I didn't have time to order anything else, not that they even asked me if I would like to.  So I ate the Beef Sliders and they were horrible, the patties were too dry, thin, and plain. I had to cover them in A1 sauce to eat them.   Of course I was still charged and paid full price for these sad Beef Sliders even though they didn't come as advertised.   With the over all dinning experience I can see now why everywhere else around the stadium had a wait and this place didn't."}
{"text":"They like the Chickenhawks..they must suck..stay away! Anyplace that doesn't favor the home team sucks!"}
{"text":"My family and I attended the final four games this past Saturday and Monday and spent our pre-game time at McFaddens.  We had a wonderful experience; between discussions with Scott (manager) regarding reserving a table prior to the events, to being greeted and escorted to our tables promptly upon arrival by Mariah, to Mariah helping my 70 year old mother find a stool with a seatback and adjusting our table location, and with wonderful service from both Kelsey and Liz both days. We had a very enjoyable and pleasant experience with all of their staff, including people not mentioned here simply because we did not catch their names. I will definitely be making McFadden's our go-to location before Cardinals games, the Fiesta Bowl, and any other events in the area.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Probably the absolute worst customer service I have ever received and that was before we got in!! Not only did they make my friend take his hat off but he couldn't just hold onto it. They wanted him to go put it in the truck!! I'm telling everyone I know not to waste their time here. So hypocritical because there was a guy on the patio with a hat on and when we asked they said \"it's ok he's an older gemtleman\" you kidding me?? I thought  we were going to an Irish pub, but this place is trying to make itself a night club. Then after waiting in line for a while to get into what seemed to be a packed place, we get in and the place is empty. Come on McFadden's get serious."}
{"text":"We stopped here after working a show at the Phoenix stadium on a Sunday night. Beers were cold and the service was good. My wife and I had burgers that were ordered medium. When they came out they are obviously frozen patti burgers and were over cooked to well done. Now that I have read the reviews I wish we had not gone their. Better choices around the corner. It sounds like I need to watch my card for extra charges from earlier posts."}
{"text":"I swear I think one of the bouncers stole my wallet. Luckily I had nothing in there. There are also bouncers in the bathrooms being weirdo's...

Did I mention? She was D.D that night....  NEGATIVE 10 STARS   GO LOOK AT ALL THE REVIEWS AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE GOT KICKED OUT FOR NO REASON. I will never go to this place again...."}
{"text":"Ummmmmmm not the best thing that has ever happened to me, but fun for a girls night out.  I would not recommend this place for a date-- it seems to be better for groups and hoes.  Yeah, definitely groups and hoes.  I have never tried the food here. Ever.  This last time there was no cover since a buddy did the happy hour route-- which is: if you have like 8 people total, give them your name and guarantee those people will be there, they will give you a \"host bracelet\" and free drink coupons, and the rest of your group will get bracelets which gives them $2 well drinks and $2 beer (nothing fancy, so you've got to like Bud Light)  It is right across from this country themed bar with a mechanical bull, so that's a fun distraction for a while... but it's not like either of these places are Vegas-class or anything.  additionally...  Do NOT drink and drive. Like ever. But ESPECIALLY from this place-- there are cops EVERYWHERE. Cops standing right outside the doors looking for the drunkies... cop cars parked all over the parking lot.  Don't be afraid to get into the passenger seat of your car, toss those keys into the backseat and take a niiice looonnng nap until you're sober, or someone comes to pick you up.   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot if you don't want to wait the hour it normally takes to get a table at Yard House (which should be your first option in Westgate). It's noisy and it's loud with all the hockey fans and hockey games on all of their screens. Being a hockey fan myself, I do enjoy that atmosphere, but I know it's not for everyone. Go Coyotes!"}
{"text":"Worse bar EVER! I got kick out for nothing and for the wrong guys?WTF? They told me that \"I was asking girls to flash\" and I told them I just got in.  I remember the guy that kicked me out. I want to sue the place for hear/say. I am a criminal justice student and they didn't prove it was me. I spent over 200 plus in this bar, wish I didn't,  because it was my friend birthday. I will be back and there will be some talk with the BOSS.   THEN AGAIN WORSE BAR EVER!  People if you're going to have a birthday party... DON'T"}
{"text":"You know how you get those certificates on restaurants.com for places that are trying to drum up business? Well, the question is usually, \"Is it because nobody has heard of the place or because it's just that bad?\"  In this instance, it was the latter. They only have what, 5 real entrees on the menu, and couldn't serve 2 of them; 1 was out and another wasn't prepped.  The food didn't taste bad but was far from impressive. The Shepherds Pie was bland and was made with canned peas and carrots and plain ground beef, and the corned beef was dry and had little to no seasoning. At least the bread pudding was good. The bathroom had no soap in any of the four dispensers nor paper towels in either of theirs. I suppose the best thing I can say is that at least half of what we got was free thanks to the certificate we got online.  I feel bad for the poor server who looked pretty embarrassed when she repeatedly had to tell us what they couldn't serve."}

The list goes down 50/50 with goods/bads but the bads for me because of what they are & where they are located @ Westgate won't have me darkening their door again for another year or so because food can improve & so can cleanliness but this bar hasn't yet so that's why I'm mentioning it finally.   Goods -Jameson on special all day every day - bartenders quick  - DJ on the weekends  Bad - The food is Meh at best - Ladies bathroom had toilet water on floor, no tp in holder & soap MIA on a primetime Sunday Football Game day - Wants to be a club on the weekends & charges a cover"}
{"text":"We usually end up here because we are able to grab a quick bite to eat or drink before a coyotes game or cardinals game. However, tonight I just got served the worst burger of my life. It was like a hockey puck honestly. Order something else the nachos as an appetizer we're okay. Just stay away from the rock solid burgers. :("}
{"text":"McFadden's is a fun place to grab a beer before Coyotes games during the week. It has a good vibe and the servers are all really nice. For the west valley, it is what it is. Don't know why people are complaining. We just go, get a beer, and then go to the game."}
{"text":"If i could give a negative star it would be negative 100!!!  Worst place ever!!! They over charged then blamed us for not reading menu when we were right? Do not come here!!

My family/friends and I were there a couple weeks ago and several of our group had credit card information stolen (and multiple cross-country charges were made) after using the cards at McFadden's in Westgate. They refuse to rectify the situation, and have made excuse after excuse about it... so a news team from ABC15 took up the case. Reading some of the other recent reviews, this is not the first time this has happened. Such a disappointment for all of us."}
{"text":"This place really is what the reviews say. Napkin throwing didn't get any reaction but they kept doing it. I just had to laugh because it was just like the reviews. I think if I was a bar noobie at 21 I would have loved it because there was lots of people out to have a fun time and the atmosphere was really hype. I would never go back because I can't justify paying for alcohol served in small plastic cups- I'm a grown man. But I can't say I didn't have a great time dancing with my friends- because we did."}
{"text":"Our group ate here during the day on a Sunday and expected to get reasonable service, reasonable food in reasonable amount of time. What we received was horrible service, nasty food and a hellish wait for it. Yes I know McFadden's primary service is that of a sports bar, but I can name 20 sports bars around the valley providing much better service and food. People are still paying for service and food and should be treated as such.   The Sunday we went we had went around 1pm. We were waiting to be seated by the hostess who had her purse slung around her shoulder as she was ready to leave. She said \"Well, I guess I can seat you\". Sorry, all we wanted to do was pay for lunch and drinks. Sorry for the inconvenience. We were sat in a section with about 2 other tables (the bar and restaurant was 'dead') and thought to ourselves, this should be quick. WRONG.   We ordered drinks and it took about 15 minutes to receive them. Then we put our order in. We had ordered items off of the happy hour (chicken strips and soup) and a sandwich. It took 45 MINUTES to receive these items. The Irish Potato Soup was separating and it looked like it had been maturing under a heat lamp for about 30 minutes. The French Dip sandwich was dry as a bone. Despite complaining about both of these items they were not taken off of our bill.   As we walked out I warned a couple going in to make sure they have hours of time to waste if they want food. The guy asked if I was serious due to the small amount of people inside. I reaffirmed him and he and his girl were on their way elsewhere. The least I could do was prevent someone else from experiencing McFadden's service and food. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other restaurants in Westgate City Center, McFadden's doesn't deserve your patronage."}
{"text":"Can't recommend this place to anyone. The staff treats you as if they are doing you a favor to serve you, the food is less than typical bar style food, and I challenge the cleanliness standards. Get a sandwich from the gas station that's close by, you'll be happier with the food quality and their gas pumps are cleaner than McFadden's bathrooms."}
{"text":"Was so nervous to come here after reading the reviews, but IGNORE them!!! Came here on St. Pattys day and it was a blast!! Our food was good, atmosphere was awesome!! If you're looking for a fun atmosphere with good food this is the place! Service was also great as well! Do not get what the bad reviews are about!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got a real night out and wanted to go dancing. I had seen the bar on Saturday (for Halloween) but there was a line so long, I knew I wasn't getting in haha we came back this Wednesday and were not disappointed. The atmosphere was amazing, the bartender was generous and cool, the security guards were on point, and their DJ knew how to get people moving. I drank more than I could handle,  (as I am a new drinker and had never been drunk). I didn't know my limit. They took care of me and made sure my husband got us home safe. I think this is my main spot now."}
{"text":"This place disappoints more & more. It's so pathetic now that they have the staff dress like prostitutes to try& get any business. Sad!  So empty.... Hopefully they shut down soon so something better can open up."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give this place negative stars. My son, my boyfriend, my best friend and I came to get some lunch. I'll start by saying that the appeal of this place is on point. I am Irish. I was excited to find an Irish pub/restaurant. I was horribly disappointed by what we experienced.   Upon entering we were sat by a female I could only assume was the hostess. She informed us our \"server\" would be with us shortly. We waited, used the rest room, took photos and read the entire, less then impressive one page menu. We were finally greeted by our waitress and she took our drink orders. I said waters all around and my boyfriend and I ordered beers. 20 min went by and we finally got our beers. No water. My friend orders her beer after she returned from the rest room and another 20 min goes by and she finally gets her beer. Still no water. We waited and waited for her to return and take our food order and bring the waters. My boyfriend finally got up and asked where our waters were and if we would be able to place our food orders. A few minutes after he sat back down the \"hostess\" comes over and slams four waters on the table, didn't say a word just slammed them all down and walked away. I shouted \"THANK YOU\" and she didn't even knowledge me. Our waitress came and took our food order, which consisted of some appetizers and a kids burger, didn't write anything down and walked away.   We sat there for another 20 minutes. After watching the family next to us get there food and drinks promptly we decided that we no longer wanted to wait there for the crap service to get worse so we paid for our drinks and left. I wrote a note on my sons kids menu that read, \"horrible service\" left that next to the 12$ for our beers and waters and we took our business elsewhere.   This place has potential, I was honestly excited to find a nice Irish bar and restaurant. obviously the management isn't managing ANYTHING, and the criteria for wait and bar staff is bottom barrel. Being attractive doesn't make you a good waitress/hostess. A good attitude and a passion for great customer service are things this place and its employees are seriously lacking."}
{"text":"Quiet possibly THE WORST restaurant on the planet.   Should've seen the red flags when this place was empty and everything else nearby was an hour plus wait.  Food overpriced and horrible.....presentation of the \"chicken sandwich\" made me depressed...looked like waitress dropped it on floor then, after a quick trip through the dishwasher/blender, it ended up on a plate and served to lucky me.  Worse part is how overpriced their garbage is--daylight robbery.  Entire wait staff was on the rag.  Not only was the music absolutely horrid, their volume goes to 11!  #disaster"}
{"text":"This place pretty much sucks. Been forced to come here twice due to the lines at the other restaurants and bars at Westgate having over an hour wait. We didn't have to wait here and I can see why! People know better than to come. Calling this place an \"Irish Pub\" is like calling my Chrysler a Porche. There isn't one Irish thing about it, except they serve Guinness. Big whoop! Almost all bars do. The service is terrible and everyone seems to have a major 'tude. Gee sorry for interrupting your social time of you chatting away with your buddies on the staff. The food is average in taste I guess. There were ZERO veg options so I had 3 sides, which was interesting. Everyone else's food seemed okay, except for my husband who ordered honey medium wings and they were making ME sweat just sitting next to him. He suffered through them, but was for sure not what were ordered. When we mentioned it to our server she basically gave us a blank look and did nothing. We had quite a few drinks here before a concert thinking it would save a little money from buying 11 dollar beers in the arena. How wrong were we!? Plus, they ran out of pint glasses and had to use plastic. The place was maybe half full? We split our check in half for the 2 couples and my mouth hit the floor! 75 bucks was HALF!?! For 3 sides, an entree, 3 wines and 3 beers. Just...wow. Lastly we were in this awkward table that lined square up to the server station, and made me feel really claustrophobic sitting inches from this giant awkward wall.  I read in some reviews this place turns into a club later at night! This made me LOL literally. I can't even imagine. Save your money and pride and stay the hell away from here. Seriously.  I have to say, the management must not care. 99 percent of these reviews are horrible and nothing has been done. Oh well, guess they will learn when they shut down, because I can't imagine that's far away!"}
{"text":"Smells like stank old stinky beer from right when we came in. Couldn't mix Manhattan or a car bomb. They got the beer right. Manhattan was undrinkable car bomb was missing Jameson. Gave us the wrong ticket and just charged a different amount for a different ticket without saying anything went up another $15. We talked to the manager and he gave us a dollar off on a $40 ticket."}
{"text":"Sub par. I knew I should have just listened to the other reviews, but I had to see what was true. Had the blt, not bad, but cold fries. Honestly, you can't screw up a blt, but McFaddens did. Cheap pub grub, at 10 bucks a plate... Sorry ass place, dead lunch crowd. Seems like the only thing that keeps it in business is the  booze."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS... You want HORRIBLE food, mistake after mistake on your orders and service that is worse than the food."}
{"text":"Came here for a VIP event and Id have to say that's was the best all around experience I've had at west gate. Brianna was our server and she went above and beyond for everyone in my group. The music was good and the crowd was friendly. If you haven't stopped by here yet its definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar.  Several of the TVs are messed up and the infield dirt is the same color as the grass and all the people are green. The guy said someone sprayed Champaign on the HDMI cords.  Stupid and weak."}
{"text":"Mcfadden's? An IRISH Bar? In name only. Didn't eat here - met a friend for drinks and to watch some sports - He was in town staying @ the Marriott next door. Anyway, high prices for drinks and what really makes me laugh is the \"Nightclub\" it transforms into...Again an IRISH Bar becomes a night club? The transformation started by taking away all of the chairs around the bar and then abruptly shutting off power to 90% of there TV's - in mid game!   At first I was a little pissed but, I honestly just laughed as we got our bill. It really was a joke! I will say the bartenders were very good and the gals were very hot - especially the plaid stripper skirt the one bartender changed into and gave us all a nice view every time she went into the lower coolers for beers! Thank You...  Overall, I will pass. Many better options in Westgate. Unless you are a 20-something guy looking for a late night sausage fest - then it might be for you...."}
{"text":"The most disgusting shepherds pie on the planet! Service sucked, prices were ridiculous drinks were watered-down. Who's  running this place? Will never be returning!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for Saturday Night before game.  Paid $200 online.  They refused to let my 22 year old cousin in due to his ID being from out of state and vertical and that apparently is against the law in AZ.  Even with a long line, they refused to refund us for the table that we did not use.    Besides that, heard from several people that they raised prices to Vegas level $45 for a double absolut diet.  Were not truly a Seahawk bar and also did not deliver on promised rallies=)     I will tell anyone I know going to Phoenix to avoid this badly managed bar!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 0 stars. I met up a girl here to have a Guinness. I had one, she had one. I order her a shot. The bartender said she couldn't serve us anymore because she put her head on my shoulder. Yeah, cuz it was 1 in the morning on a monday and she was tired. She called security and he escalated the situation and then the police were called. Over a shot. I hope this place catches on fire. I am embarrassed that Guinness is served here. Not only that, the bartenders don't even properly pour it."}
{"text":"Slightly better than Whiskey Rose but that ain't saying much.  At least the bartender and waitresses acknowledge you here and force a smile out.  The place is a mess with napkins and beer spilled all over.  There are a bunch of idiots that patron this place but they should at least clean up a little.  No idea about the food or anything else."}
{"text":"Well I was worried coming here after all the bad reviews. I was meeting people for the Ama motor cross ...westgate was packed. But we only had a 15 min. Wait the waitress was attentive and she told us what to not order to avoid a long wait. I had the shepards pie. It really wasn't that bad , not mind blowing but not your typical bar food . One friend ordered the wings and he liked them the other got a burger, he said it wasn't too bad either . I would give them another try. I hope the other reviewers who said their cc info was stolen work out... Yikes ."}
{"text":"This place SUCKSSSSSSSS. Drinks are expensive and they charge a cover sometimes. A cover!?!? Idk if they still but last time I was there they did and I was like wtf. Only paid it cuz a few friends were inside already but never again.   Service is horrible and then they allow people to dance on the bars which was gross and almost knocked over my drink. Skip this place."}
{"text":"I could go anywhere from 1 to 5 on this place.  First, they have a new menu with prices that are more aligned to what is normal and reasonable.  I've always liked their food.  Last visit I got the fish and chips.  They really aren't chips, they are shoestring and I had to send them back for being cold.  We got an appetizer that was supposed to be 50% off but they charged us $5.50, original price was $7, so half of 7 is 3.50.  Had to bring that to their attention.  Service was good, but we've never had a service issue here.  The ugh.  The place is looking tired.  The booth we were at had a slit in the bench-pretty significant.  The place looked a little dirty.  If they can get it fixed up and cleaned with the new menu and food I think they will be full again.  So McFadden's is on our keep list-just need to keep working out little things.  However, the biggest thing that kept us from making a frequent place was $21 for bangers and mash which are now priced at $13."}
{"text":"Hit McFadden's last night at Westgate when there was no game at the arena.  The service was great but the food was horrible.  We got the tater tots.  When they came to the table I asked what was supposed to be so special about them.  I was told they are tater tots and that was what they were.  I will save my $10 and cook them at home next time.  We got the BBQ burger to split.  The hamburger was something I would expect from the school cafeteria and bacon on top was obviously cooked a couple days ago and kept in the warmer.  When we sent it back the waitress politely told us that she didn't think they would do anything since we had eated over half it.  I pointed out we each had 1 bite to confirm one of use wasn't being too picky. Sounds like they have a bunch of food sent back. They did end up removing it from the bill. The Onion rings were good but that is it.  It is too bad I bought a reward package to this restaurant before checking it out.  Going to check out the one in Scottsdale.  Hoping it is much better."}
{"text":"Basically, they don't give a crap.   Dirty, horrible service, watered down well drinks,  and the food was awful.  I don't even know why they bother serving food.  The servers aren't interested in serving it and the cooks could give a damn about what they throw on a plate.   I wouldn't go back if I was starving."}
{"text":"If there were a negative Or a minus star that's what I would rate it. Please do not waste your time here, the staff is so unprofessional, from their security to their managers. Had a security guard call me a \"bitch and a motherfucker\" for no reason, and when confronted with the manager at the time he instead of fixing the problem decided to impersonate me, it was really all a circus. They have clowns trying to lead other clowns, please avoid this place if you want to have a good time."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I were on a date and trying to decide where to eat. Neither one of us have ever been to McFaddens so we decided to try it. Worst decision we made. There was no one in the restaurant which now after leaving makes sense. We sat down and had to wait 10 minutes before having our drink orders taken. The place is infested with mosquitos. We were sitting there talking and just kept getting bit. When we finally got our drinks, they were in small plastic cups and my fiancees root beer tasted like seltzer water. We decided to just cancel our food and leave. We told the hostess we wanted to pay for the soda and leave. She said she told our server but our server avoided us at all cost. We finally got sick of waiting and went to the bar to pay but the manager took care of it. I made she contact with our server before we left and she just walked away without saying a word to us. If I could this review no stars, I would. This was the worst service we have ever received and will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I was in the area for business last week and came into McFadden's for lunch on Tuesday. It wasn't too busy and I didn't have any issues with service or prices- both were great, in my opinion.  I ordered the Reuben and it was fantastic. The sandwich was huge, piled high with corned beef and kraut. The bread was toasted perfectly and didn't get soggy which was a MAJOR plus.   I also had the bread pudding, because duh. If it's on the menu I have to order it, so I did, and YUM. The caramel whiskey sauce knocked my socks off, and the consistency of the bread pudding was great. I'm not sure where all these crappy reviews came from, but maybe they have a new kitchen staff or something?  Either way, I'll be back the next time I'm in Glendale."}
{"text":"This is my third time here.  Every time it gets worse.  Their food is mediocre,  service is non existing.  Today is Saturday,  they have no specials.  We end up here because everything else is busy. And this is why, poor service and food that is so so at best.  The place is falling apart, the bathrooms are missing faucets  everything is barely ok.  This is the last time we spend time and money here, even my biker BF that spends time at sketchy bars is dissatisfied .  Such a waste"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times before and was ambivalent about food, drinks, & service, everything was just ok. Most recent visit my food & drinks were again ok, but others in my party were dissatisfied. In addition, service was so abysmal that the manager took off 50% off the bill for our entire party of 15. Who can stay in business doing that? I don't understand why servers are not better trained. There is no excuse for not providing a better customer experience! Also, do something about the disgusting restrooms!"}
{"text":"To me this is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde establishment.  Sometimes it's fine and other times, it's scary. For big events this place can be the place to be. The Seahawks take it over for away games in Phoenix. Ohio State took over for the football playoffs. My Gonzaga friends had fun there for the final four. Without big time events, this place is dog shit. Went in on a normal Wednesday night during old car night and there were about 4 people in the place. Sat at the bar 10 minutes with no bartender in sight. 2 cocktail waitresses stood in the service area totally ignoring our presence. The bartender finally surfaced and was an ass hole. Got a beer and moved to the patio where we were again invisible. Sat with empty glasses as a waitress wiped down some tables not seeing our hails for more beer. Hint - look at the customers. Those tables aren't going anywhere. Especially when there are 4 people in the place. Try to sell something! We shouldn't have to beg for service. There are 4 people in the place!  We finally got a beer and put a $20 down for the $12 dollar tab and the inattentive waitress actually asked us if we wanted change? No, Honey, we're dying to tip you $8.00 for being completely shitty. You and the ass hole bartender.   Next time I stopped in for a non-event beer, the place stunk so bad with a sewer smell, we left. Hostess said they had a \"deep cleaning\" the day before and that was the smell. They must have deep cleaned the sewer.  Maybe this place makes enough money on the special events at the stadium, hockey arena and Westgate to keep in business cause I don't see it on an everyday basis. The place sucks."}
{"text":"good drink specials. the riff raff seems to come out about 10:30-11 o'clock."}
{"text":"If I could I would give the place negative stars. The staff was EXTREMELY rude not just one but all 5+ that we encountered. It was not for a lack of trying on our part... We were friendly tried to make conversation and tipped well but still couldn't even get a smile out of the staff.  The later you are at this place the more questionable the crowd becomes. Felt VERY unsafe. I will never return and have told all my friends to do the same. Sucks to have to post such a negative review."}
{"text":"$52 with tip for 2 bud lights and 2 things of wings. I saw low reviews before going and thought I'd just try it cause it's St. Patrick's Day.   No matter what holiday it is I won't be back. They are too proud of their boneless wings. The sauce was tasteless. I can get literally the same wings/chicken nuggets at Sonic for 1/5 the price.   For 2 green bud lights it was $16! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went here before a hockey game, and got wings and a local beer, I think it was the Kiltlifter.  The prices were reasonable, the wings were just spicy enough, and the beer was good.  The beer was recommended by a bartender when I told him that I usually drink Stone or Sam Adams.  Can't complain."}
{"text":"The service was fine,  the food was tasteless. I've never had fried mozzarella that had no flavor or seasoning. We tried to order surf and turf but they WERE OUT OF STEAK. Who puts steak on the menu and let's it run out.  The fries were like McDonald's fries with no salt. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Snitch ass bar with bitch ass tendencies. Been coming here for 4 years. Cought my best friends boyfriend on a date with another woman. Told my friend. He starts snapping on me. And I get put out like a drunkard even though I'm sober and have a winning fish. Because he told security if she comes up to me kick her out. I was just trying to use the bathroom.  The punk ass DJ don't even know who Janelle Monae is. On dirty computer night. Pathetic. And second time I've been mistreated by this bar and they kept my five dollars for the fish. Needs to go out of business to make room for a real bar. #getdaterapedhere #djstrappedinthe90s #looserassracistasssecurity"}
{"text":"Not a great place to go before a Coyote's game, despite its prime location. As usual, Yard House had a ridiculous wait and McFadden's patio was empty so we headed over there...mistake. Go eat and drink anywhere else. Their service was atrocious and the food/prices don't make up for it. Despite being deserted, we were given a buzzer thing to wait for a table (told a 20 minute wait). We went and sat at the outside bar, which only has 3 beers on tap. After waiting for 45 minutes, we checked in at the front to see how much longer it would be. The lady said she had been calling our names over the microphone...clearly the microphone doesn't work in their outdoor space and the buzzer thing never buzzed. The hostess then told us the buzzers don't work...why give it out then? And why not get us from the bar? Having clearly requested an outdoor table, we were seated indoors. The menu is small and doesn't have much of anything interesting. We ordered onion rings, and a lot of beers. The onion rings came out immediately and based on their sogginess, they obviously had just been sitting out in the kitchen. Beers weren't poured great (small pours)."}
{"text":"I had the Shepard's pie for the first time..... Amazing! Great service! I can't recommend this bar and restaurant enough. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I've only been here when its a \"club\" so no review on the food. On a friday and sat night this place is packed...plus only place i know where i can dance on the bar."}
{"text":"I usually like coming to McFadden's at night for some drinks and I'd have to say my favorite bartender is probably Anela! She gets your drinks out fast and always is very friendly. So when I see her work I only go up to her!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great bar food, and just had the new pizza. Can't believe a bar has this good pizza! It will be recommend to all my friends and family. Thanks for the service too!"}
{"text":"I went with friends to Westgate Center after a mediocre dinner at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, we were wanting to check out the different bars in the center, and came upon McFadden's, it had a line, and it seemed to be happening, so we waited 5 minutes and got in, i was surprised i had to pay a $5 cover but i was okay with that and expected it to be crowded inside but was dismayed that it was only half full, it smelled like dried puke, and it was a total skeeze! ick!   most of the crowd looked bad, and the bar girls in their skimpy outfits did not deserve to wear the outfit. Skimpy isn't bad as long as you fit the image, and these girls did not. Skimpy uniforms work in tempe and old town because you have women that look good for the most part. here the bargirls were tatted up and just didn't look right. Oh and what's with throwing napkins up in the air to act as confetti? it's stupid, and messy, and so the overall appearance of this bar is that it's dirty, with napkins on the floor, spilled beer, some weird funky pukey smell, and the oddest looking crowd. part of me wished i got my $5 back because that was a $3 experience or less. oh and the music was just bad. this is where djs with very little experience must play and practice their skills.   so, to sum it up, it's a hole, and if this is one of the hottest spots Westgate has to offer then someone must have punk'd me coz this is a true joke."}
{"text":"A nearly properly poured Guinness on a Cardinal game day. What could be better. Good service and beer selection in a made-to-sort-of-look-like-Irish-pub. A plethora of TVs to watch whatever you need to see....if you can take your eyes off the cute waitresses."}
{"text":"FOOD REVIEW: sittin at the bar across the 'road' from mcfaddens, a guy in our group went to grab food, specifically molly tots and chicken nachos. Nachos were for me, chicken was cold, cheese ws melted but cold and chewy, chips soggy from the cold cheese. Should've waited to throw together my nachos till the tots were done. First and last time I get food here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are 49er fans and we had heard that there was a very cool 49er club that gathers there so we went to check it out last Sunday. We invited some other friends, most of whom are Cardinal fans. The plan was (as it is every week) to spend the day there enjoying football, food and drink. The food was mediocre at best. The drinks were watered down. Service was slow but we stayed because we had good seats. There were about eight of us. We arrived about 2pm. At 6pm we decided to leave and paid our tab and tipped well despite weak food, drink and service. Half of our group got up and left and the other half started a new conversation. We decided to have one more beer before leaving while we finished our conversation. We ordered, only to have the waitress return a few minutes later (not the waitress that had served us earlier) and tell us that they had decided not to serve us because we had been there too long already and they felt we had had to much to drink. The manager stood behind her. I asked them if we had acted inappropriately in any way to lead them to this decision. They said no. I asked if we were being loud or belligerent. They said no. So i asked, \"why are you treating us this way?\" And they said it's our opinion that you've been here to long. That was their only reply. I had never had anything like that happen to me before. I told them that we had never been there before and were there to checkout a club that gathers there and brings them plenty of business. The manager, a younger kid who called himself, \"Sam\" said he didn't care because he doesn't like that club anyway.  I thought, \"wow, people go there and spend large amounts of money to be treated that way?\" We will never return to this dump and will tell that story to anyone that mentions going there ever again."}
{"text":"Poor service. We thought maybe it was an off night for them after receiving one drink in an hour and waiting on our food for forever. It wasn't an event night or even busy. We were so frustrated having to try to dance on our heads to get a waitress' attention that we left to another place across the way. We went back on another night and still incredibly slow service and staff was so rude. The girls roll their eyes at you and act as if they're doing you the favor by them being there as bartenders. This place is not the cleanest and the food is not good. Never again."}
{"text":"Reservations.. Ha - they don't fulfill their promises. All of the reviews that at above 1 star is a joke. 15 bucks for a vodka redbull and they don't  even put redbull in it lol. Over priced, terrible service, don't recommend.. Stay home if you have the option or don't come here at all. I'm done ranting, just enter knowing you're getting terrible service and overpriced drinks"}
{"text":"The service was horrible... the food was fair, but nothing I would go back and eat. The place (structure) is really nice, but the staff is awful.  Our waitress was really nice and all smiles but her service was still lame, we were not greeted when we arrived, we were not given cutlery, napkins, etc until after the food arrived (like 10 min), we could have left without paying since no one was paying attention to us, and the place was almost empty. The food is not the best, we enjoyed the Irish Fries or something, but we had to lick our fingers, and not because they were so delish, but because the napkins and forks were making their way trough the crowds and to our table. When we left, the hostesses were so into their conversation that they didn't see us leave... oh, well! That's what we get for wanting to try something new!"}
{"text":"McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon? It should be ashamed to call itself a restaurant, and even they'd tell you it isn't a saloon. You'd expect a place like McFadden's to be Irish. There's nothing Irish about a very dark place playing overly loud ghetto music. We sat ourselves on the patio to get away from the loudness. We counted 4 security guards, 3 waitresses, and 2 bartenders. 9 Employees and it took 10 minutes to get someone to ask us if we wanted a drink. Then it took another 10 minutes to get the drink and I think there were only about 6 other customers. Most of the employees stand around and play with their phones.   There are much better places to go in Westgate. We went to McFadden's our first night in Glendale and it became the punchline for the rest of our trip."}
{"text":"All the other reviews hit all my complaints. Poor service, horrible stench and waaay over priced drinks.   The only think missing was noting that I have TWICE seen a freaking baby/toddler in McFaddens well after the appropriate hour. If the 'bouncer' is checking ID's at the door....there should not be small children in the freaking place.   I wish I could go back and say sorry to all my hotel guests that i've sent there in the past.   I couldn't help but laugh at loud at the many tables w/  \"reserved\" signs on them.  The bar was half empty LOL"}
{"text":"Let's me just start with a WOW! From the start of walking in the host granted us with a warming welcome. The server we had never left us without a refill. Never had to flag our server down. This places food is sooo yummy for a club/sport bar. I ordered a Ruben. Pretty tasty man!! My man ordered the mac and cheese, It has a spice to it and  we both LOVED it.  so yummy. I will come here for ALL cardinals games coming up."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I don't usually write bad reviews, but there was something really not good about this place.  We wanted to like it...but didn't.  The food was tasteless, with the exception of the fries that our daughter had, she said those were good.  Definitely not worth what we paid for it, and some items we got were at happy hour price!   The whole place had a very funky vibe to it.  Almost to the point of uncomfortable.  The bathrooms stunk to high heaven, it smelled like the dumpster outside...nasty.  Our server was good, very nice and attentive, if it wasn't for her, I probably would have given it one star.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Music and bartender WAY too loud with terrible blaring sound system. No drink menu with specialty cocktails. Food sub par. One word for the bartender with the GoPro strapped to his chest: CREEPY."}
{"text":"I've given McFaddens two chances, both at incredibly slow times and both times, the service was terrible and slow.  The first time we were there, I'm pretty sure our server didn't realize she was supposed to be working and it was NOT busy in there.  I wish the food was good enough and it outweighed the bad service but it's just typical bar food."}
{"text":"First time and last time.  Went for dinner with friends with a $50 restaurant card. Had to have a $100 bill to use. Started with nacho appetizer,  was ok. The entrées were not worth the price! I had the gaelic chicken. Not sure what the sauce was but it was tasteless! The guys had hamburgers with maybe 7 fries. So we decided to try a dessert after a bland dinner. Nope worse than the entrée.  The chocolate mousse literally had NO flavor!! How does that happen.  Service was ok. Would never recommend and will not go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star. This place is the shadiest bar I have ever been to. The staff/management is very unprofessional and will \"remove\" you from the bar for no reason whatsoever."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today with my wife and her parents.  It was 11:30 and there were no other customers in the restaurant.  It took a couple minutes for anyone to notice us at the door.  The person that seated us was also our server.  He was cool and the bright spot of this visit.  We found it weird as we were sitting there that an employee left, went to another establishment, and came back with food from there.  That just seemed rather odd.  The carpets were very dirty in this place.  The food itself was not bad.  Their fries actually are pretty tasty.  My mother in laws caesar wrap was really dry.  Very, very pricey for what it is though.  Maybe at night if you are looking for the bar scene it is not a bad place.  As a casual meal with your family it is overpriced, mostly tasty, and the server we had was very cool.  I cannot figure why an employee would leave a restaurant to go to another one to get food and openly walk back in with it?  That's like promoting weight watchers while eating nutrisystem food or drinking soda while trying to sell lemonade.  Not sure if we would come back to this place."}
{"text":"Bad business practices. Came here with a Groupon to try the place. We received the wrong food, bill was not corrected because we did not receive correct hamburger ( there are only 3 on the menu ), and then they refused the alcohol on the Groupon even though it Groupon includes. No happy hour specials... would not return."}
{"text":"Stopped back by there Wednesday and was told AGAIN by my server that they are going to change the menu in a few weeks. Seems like every 6 months or so they say they are changing the menu and then the fire the chef and start with a new one. This guy is the 4th one that I know of. Hope they keep him around because his jive white ass is pretty funny and the food seemed better than the last time I was there..."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have visited McFadden's twice in the year.  Our first visit we meet with a few coworkers to grab a couple drinks. I asked for a Bloody Mary and received horrible concoction which would have been better off down the drain.  Our second visit was last night before a coyotes game. Every restaurant in West Gate had a 45 min to an hour wait but McFadden's was able to take us in as soon as we walked in the door. (That should have been warning  #1). The restaurant was uncomfortably warm, smelled like stale beer and was sticky and filthy. Our waitress was kind but when it came time to order beer, she had a list with 8+ beers that they have ran out off. (I hope they restock quickly because the Fiesta Bowl is right next door tomorrow). I feel that all the menu items are over priced for what you get.  After 40 minutes of waiting, the bacon in my BLT tasted a little strange and the fries were under cooked. The quesadilla was okay but very flimsy.  The restrooms were disgusting and I honestly did not like being bothered by the \"restroom attendant\".   Overall- service- pretty good food- poor drinks- poor cleanliness- very poor  *** We noticed that this establishment will be a Penn State hub for the Fiesta Bowl, if you are Penn State fan, save your money, time, and taste buds and go to another restaurant in West Gate."}
{"text":"Wait staff was great cook and bar tenders were poor we were watching a hockey game while dining and they just changed the channel and would bot put the game back on. Food was very sub par also"}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option, this would be my grade for this smelly, dirty club.  Arrived post concert venue next door to find long entry line with not that full of a club.  Our drinks were all ice and watered down in small Dixie cups. The front tables were roped off for the fools buying bottle service... only one table filled with two lonely dudes....After only 2 rounds of drinks the bouncer/security came over to some other friends in our group and called out one in their group that was as he described as \"having wobbled\"... she was the most sober in the club, and after now reading other posts now I feel like there is a fishy pattern here. Fishing for bribes?  Not sure what the bouncers are trying to accomplish."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for a birthday, and that calamity was bad enough.  I held off on the bad review until I gave them another shot.  Well I did and they failed even harder.  1st trip -- we had reserved a table for a birthday, and as reservations were made it was made clear to us that if we weren't there by 9:00 they would give our table away.  So we arrive at 8:45 and they make it out to be a big inconvenience to them that we arrived......15 minutes early.  Nothing was setup, and they scrambled to get a \"party\" table put together (which I don't think ever reached the size we had reserved).  All decorations became \"we could put ________ on the table but........we'd need for you all to get up\".  So after all this I thought it could be a fluke, so we gave them another shot last night......  2nd trip -- Had a friend come in from England and he wanted to go to the bars at Westgate.  God forbid he wore shorts on his trip to.........Arizona, so we weren't allowed in.  It's Thursday night. And no matter how hard you try, you are not a Scottsdale bar.  Choke on your impending failure."}
{"text":"Yep No shock here why the owner of Calico also owns McFaddens and guess what? They both suck! The staff is run by bimbo teens who couldn't tell you there ass from there head ...when you say you can have your burger cooked to how you like (medium) and then when I bite into it it's cooked fully through...that's not cooked to order (waitress was also some teen bimbo) between McFaddens and Calico Jacks they are the eye sore of Westgate ...avoid going to either at all costs.....and when it's night time and it turns into a \"bar\" watch out for the asshole security ppl at the front door and throughout the place they take there jobs way too serious"}
{"text":"Thee worst bar at west gate. Service all around is awful and the \"FBI\" agents aka bouncers are the absolute worst. So very rude. I will never go back due to the mistreatment."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I remember I went to there to have a great time, but a security guard came by that I've been taking pictures which I really didn't at all. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Stick to Calico Jack's, Saddle Ranch, and Hell's Half Acre."}
{"text":"This review is LONG OVERDUE. When you read reviews saying this is quite possibly the worst restaurant/bar, they are not exaggerating. I have been here MANY times.. Mainly because it's convenient for my friends who live on the west side, and also because it's easy to go to after the coyotes game.   Don't get me wrong, this place used to be mediocre a few years ago, and it wasn't dreadful. Now I am seriously SHOCKED when I hear it is still open.  Let me give you a little run down of the experience here...   They are DESPERATE to get people in. If you are on their \"VIP\" email list they will legit email you every weekend and say you have won, and you can get free drinks from 9-11.   And when you get there... They don't have the AC on and they will have all the doors open so it's 115 inside. You will be sweating and crying and wondering where your life went wrong that you had to come to mcfaddens.  The music is usually good.. That's the ONLY plus.. And I mean ONLY.   They give free shots to girls every Friday and Saturday and usually it's fireball. They will make them get on the bar and dance.. It's usually pretty entertaining to watch. The drinks are WEAK.   They have this Asian male bartender who will ALWAYS get on the bar and take his shirt off and do some sort of weird breakdancing. He thinks he is God's gift to earth. this is also very entertaining.   They like to throw hundreds of napkins in the air and scatter the entire dance floor. Not only is this extremely annoying, it's also disrespectful and wasteful. It's makes me cringe. And they get stuck to your shoe and you look like a teenager from a bad 90's movie who is coming out of the bathroom with toilet paper on her shoe.  If you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, go in and order a beer, stand in the corner and watch the shit show commence. You're welcome."}
{"text":"We thought we would get a beer and catch part of the hockey game from the patio bar.  First, they have bouncers and card you as you go in- classy. Second, the staff just stared at us as we tried to find our way to the patio. When we got there finally, it was a mess and there was only a handful of customers and tons of staff. So we just left and went to the faithful stand by at Westgate- Yardhouse."}
{"text":"Went here before Amy Schumer for dinner and drinks. Because the line/wait was the shortest. There's a reason it was the shortest wait in the area. Its awful!  The service was awful, the server delivering our sloppily made apps, tots a toddler wouldn't touch, she dumped half the plate on the table and then tossed out a half ass \"sorry\".  Before she left we asked if we could get some ice water and she instructed us to \"ask your server\". Ummmm, ok. Thanks. Onto the drinks. We ordered a beer tower. They brought it to our table...filled with hard cider. Not beer.  They fixed that somewhat quickly. Then our main courses. Looking around the table at everyone's plates you would have thought we were at cheap McFastFood establishment. It was a total fail, wilted lettuce (not supposed to be wilted) waterlogged tomatoes. Questionable \"fish\" and chips and a lovely turkey wrap that looked as though it came straight off a costco platter full of those little wraps you get for big parties when you dont want to do any prep work. Yep. Awesome. Never going back. Recommend you skip this place and wait in line for one of the better restaurants."}
{"text":"Yelp forced me to give a star before posting my review. However, ABSOLUTELY NO stars for this hot mess! I've seen bad meals, bad service & bad management before, but this one was epically bad! Should've known better when the apathetic waitress stated today was the first day of the new \"brunch\" menu. Red flag ignored - my bad. Ordered the corned beef with poached eggs over potatoes, green peppers & onions. No toast or coffee included for $10.99.  What I got was a lot of onion (cheap veggie cost) with very little pepper over a frozen hashbrown pattie (think McDonalds) with corned beef that had been over-boiled (God knows when) which left it tough, stringy & flavorless with 2 poached eggs....really more hard-boiled than poached.  I requested 2 new poached eggs which were perfectly cooked, but served floating in a bowl of water. I had a fork & knife, but no spoon so, I managed as best I could to get the eggs onto the aforementioned dish without including the pool of water. Unfortunately, I failed adding more soak to an already soggy situation. I picked at it until finally giving up and asked, via one of the young bussers, to see the manager. The poor young man came back to my table and said, \"He asked me to ask you what you wanted.\"  Uhhhh.....just forget it.  I have more sense than to put a busser in the middle of a situation that should be handled by the manager. Hello? McFadden's corporate office??!!  BTW: $9 Bloody Mary served in a plastic cup with no celery, olives or even a cocktail napkin (pet peeve) etc. For $9 bucks you'd better add some veggies!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  TOO MANY OTHER OPTIONS!"}
{"text":"Good times!! Entry was free and it was water party night. They had girls in bikinis with a variety of water party favors. They had some ladies dancing on the bar and passing out free shots. Good blend of music from old school to new school. I'll be back"}
{"text":"When someone tells you you won a free Happy Hour (no cover for you and your party) and $2 drinks the saying \"Too good to be true\" should come to mind here at McFadden's. Only limited well drinks are $2 and they are so watered down you don't taste anything and house margaritas are not included.  I ordered 2 different drinks and they both came with cracked and chipped glasses that leaked all over me and the table. I then thought \"ok, Irish pub\" so I ordered a Jameson's and it was awful!  I asked what they gave me and the waitress couldn't tell me, I asked what Irish whiskey they had and she told me 1 type of Jamison's and that's it!!!!  Please save yourself the time and effort to come here, it's not worth the \"free\" drinks!  If I could give this place negative stars it would be the full 5 negative."}
{"text":"Didn't stay long so not much to say except it was the worst smell every when we walked through the doors. It was like a sewer.  We saw drunk people playing beer pong and we just had to leave.  If you are really drunk this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Everyone was right, but for different reasons.  Most of our food was cold and our beer warm. Guess at half price, you get what you pay for.  Even bathrooms rivaled Circle K - gross."}
{"text":"We went there after purchasing something from restaurants.com. UGH!  We went around 6 on weeknight and it was DEAD.  We stood there for quite awhile before being seated.  The keep the doors open, so there were flies everywhere.  There were TONS of open seats, and they sat us next to this completely obnoxious set of 20 something girls.  The chairs were weird.  When you sit in them you sink down so low the table comes up to your chest, I felt like I was 5 years old.  The food was NOT good.  This place needs to close up so a better place can move in.  With competition like the Yard house and Margaritaville....it won't last.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Tonight I heard they were holding a Seahawks Pepper alley, and I was told that they would not be holding a Cardinals pep rally the same. Why would I as in Arizona resident ever want to go here?"}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of bad reviews, so I must have lucked out on my day. I went there with two friends for a late lunch on Thursday. The service and the quality of the food was outstanding. I had the Shepherds Pie and one of my friends had a Sausage and Cabbage dish that we both loved. I will defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"The worst bar I've ever been to. Food was awful.  Service was slow. Then the waitress added gratuity to our bill and didn't tell anyone in our party.  She open up her iPad to run our credit card, handed the iPad to me and said \"if you would like to add a tip, you're welcome to.\" No mention that gratuity was already included.  I wasn't able to view my bill either to see that the gratuity had already been added because the iPad screen only showed the tip screen and the total.   Please don't patronize this place. First and LAST time I'll spend my money there.  The manager did offer a $30 gift card, which was nice, but that waitress pulled one of the shadiest moves I've seen in a while. I hope you enjoy the $33 in tips you stole from me, jerk.  Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"One of the worst bars I've ever been to. Been here several times on the weekend and hated it more and more every time. It's a frat party atmosphere with less class. Every Saturday same routine weird shirtless Asian guy spits fire during Pitbulls fire ball song while they pour fireball all over thirsty 22 year old who can't think of a better drink than a free one. A couple hours later the fights start breaking out and the bouncers start forcibly removing anyone with a buzz that doesn't have a pair of breast. I've actually watched a bouncer fight a guy because the bartender put a spot light on him for not tipping, all the while getting the entire place to boo the guy and call him a cheap a$$. The guy \"for some odd reason\" got upset by this. Overall this place is a trashy somewhat seedy place. Pretty sure the bathroom attendant was selling Coke on one of the busier nights I was there. I think Mcfaddens is single handidly responsible for west gates bad image."}
{"text":"Pros: My experience, Fun environment, great location, good food..  Cons: My experience, first off my friends and I all got card info stolen here so be careful take cash, male bartender was rude and wasn't constant on prices they switched up every time we ordered the same extract drinks. Overall it's ok but there's so many other bars around the area that have great customer service and won't have to worry about your  card info getting compromised. I won't ever ever go back to this mcfaddens."}
{"text":"Husband & I stopped here for lunch after meeting about season tickets for the AZ Coyotes. Hubs had the Reuben which only had meat on 1 side of the sandwich. I had a chicken Caesar wrap that was below average taste. I'm not sure if it was because of the off season of sports or what but we were not impressed & will probably not go back. Even the draft beer & water tasted like the tubes hadn't been cleaned in a while."}
{"text":"The worst place ever. We paid $200 per person for a buffet and Super Bowl party, there was no food on the buffet and we tried to order some and were told they were too busy. We did eat some food early in the day there and it was cold and dry, nasty food,We bought raffle tickets for a drawing that cost $100 and they never drew winners. We kept asking the employees when they would draw and no one had an answer. We requested a refund and they refused. Bad service, bad overpriced food and the management was no where to be found, they overbooked the party and ran out of food, we didn't get anything we paid for, very disappointing,,,,, I would never go back there, terrible place and filthy bathrooms too!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks with an out of town friend. Not a good first impression for Arizona. The food was subpar and drinks were average. I ordered the Molly Cristo and she got the chicken wrap. Our whiskey sours were 99% watered down whiskey and a splash of sour. Pricing was okay but our waitress was not attentive, served our food and walked away without asking if we needed anything- we waited 10 minutes for her to walk by so we could get condiments. Took another 20 for us to grab her to get our bill. Food = C+, Drinks = B-, and Service = D"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times.   The first time i went, my husband and I went it was for a date night. We waited for a table and our buzzards never went off and there was obviously 4 tables open. I finally asked and the woman said \"oh, I'm sorry\" and actually put us next to the bar. It took forever to get food... and when it came out it was cold. But our server she was awesome. The food was cold and it I just was not seeing what all the talk was about.  The 2nd time myself and some other military wives came last night. Although it took forever to get a drink which I was not understanding why because not a lot of people were ordering drinks. I often order the same drinks... and I ordered a \"Pink Pu**y\" which it did not taste like it at all. I felt there was more juice than anything.   It mostly felt like a boring bar... there was water on the floor when I was walking out ans nearly busted my bottom. (Can you guys mop?)"}
{"text":"Went here with friends July 3rd and it was packed and every time I would ask one of the bartender to make a drink he was rude and complained while making out drink. He was a white dude with curly hair."}
{"text":"The cute waitresses are usually the only draw to this bar. The food is sub par bar fare. The drinks are always weak. If you are destined to dine at Westgate I recommend the sushi joint or Yard House."}
{"text":"shot shot shots for birthday girl. Fun bar for girls night out. They could use better drink specials."}
{"text":"Tonight was the most horrific night of my life. When I tell you I have never left an establishment so infuriated in my life I don't know what to say. I was kicked out for being nothing more than a black woman in a white establishment. I will NEVER darken this doorstep again. The security couldn't even explain why I was kicked out. They claimed I was drunk. As an educator I've never been drunk in public. I'm always aware of my demeanor. But the racists within this place decided I'd been here too long and needed to go. This review is the first of my complaints. I have never felt so segregated and disrespected in my entire life. Just know that I'm so not done with this organization. As a black person in Phoenix please understand that your money and presence is not welcome here. Find somewhere else to use your buying power."}
{"text":"This bar is always busy on the weekends and I have no idea why. There's a cover to get in, the staff is cocky, and the drink prices are insane I got charged $12 for a loaded beer. Never again!"}
{"text":"No big deal, only reason why there are so much people eating here is because of the location. With all the bad ratings, if this place was somewhere else. They might not be able to survive? With that said, its not a bad place to go before your event starts. I had the chicken quesadilla. It was OK, nothing special. Chicken was grilled, with peppers and cheese. Wife had the hamburger, she said it was good. Service was actually pretty good, kept our drinks full, and came by to check on us a lot. Like I said, if you have an event to attend at the Stadium or the Arena. This is not that bad of a place, however other restaurants in the area are better."}
{"text":"Service isn't all that great. I still see fights that start in the bar and security \"try\" to push them out. How am I suppose to enjoy my drink if all that happens through out the night is me getting pushed by the person security is pushing out all the time.  I just think to myself, \"I just paid for a full glass yet I get to drink 1/4 of it\". =\"}
{"text":"You know how the guy on ESPN uses the catchphrase \"Useful....useful shot\"?  Well, this review is Useful....if you want a shot. Go here, it suits you well.  ~Fud/Drink~ I smiled when I saw Restaurant in the title for this place. The food is consistently sub-par, even the apps are lackluster. I got sick here prior to a Coyotes game, thank you McFaddens for making me howl PRIOR to the game itself. I thus, never have eaten here again, because why bother when you get sick from an appetizer. Not too appetizing. You go here to get wasted, but where is the fun in that? Speaking of drinking, the drinks are average as well. Its your average bar option, nothing with pizazz. I could recommend it if there was something of note, like Saddle Ranch's Beer Tower, but they aren't even that creative here. The beer's are expensive as well. Why am I paying so much for these suds and wretched food? It's just a lose-lose situation. Also, its a poor choice if you want something Irish, because its a saloon, right? Haha.... If you come here, later, during the game, you will be asking yourself  \"Why did I come here.....?\"  ~Atmosphere/Service Just when the food is bad here come the waitstaff, who are not quite bright in the head. You go in, you sit down, and they do not attend to you quickly. You would think after repeated attempts to waive your hand in the air (I rarely do this, its a necessary evil), that they would see you. They don't. They must have some kind of Ray Charles syndrome. Or Stevie Wonderitis. Can you name another blind person style syndrome? Message me with one and I can add it, because that would be what the waitstaff must have... Actually, the blind are upstanding citizens with amazing senses, they would probably do a better job, hence I feel bad bringing them up. Oh well, anyway....   ~Extras/Rating~ You might be surprised they get even two stars...and heck, they really do not deserve them. I give them one star for the location and another for still, after all the bad experiences, not being the worst bar I've attended to this point. Congrats to that! They are more worthy of 1 1/2 stars, but why not, I have pity on this spot...so two it is. Just stick with me on this one, and stay away guys! Leave this place for the drunks. There are so many better options in this center. I mean, seriously."}
{"text":"I was the D.D. and they kicked me out for \"being too intoxicated\"?!?!?!? THE F*CK, YOU SAY?!?! Do I look like Jesus? Do you think I turned water into wine???? A box of rocks has a higher IQ than the people working here.  I don't recommend coming here, but if it's filth, watered down drinks, thieving bouncers, and stolen credit card info is what you're into...then HEY! COME ON DOWN.  Not really. That was a joke. Please don't go there. You'll be battling with your credit card company forever cause your card was cloned behind the bar and then used for a shopping spree multiple places in the valley."}
{"text":"Went to McFaddens to watch football games. The bar was mostly empty but the service was still pretty bad. We had a hard time getting our waitress to reappear. Drinks were overpriced. I think the worst part was the men's bathroom. There were paper towels on the floor and rags in the sink. When I let the hostess know about it she asked where the attendant was. I did not see an attendant. 20 minutes later, same scenario. An hour later I saw an attendant. But the place was still trashed. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"One star is about right. Terrible food, terrible service. Mashed potatoes were rancid and inedible."}
{"text":"Skip this place. It's crowded, which is cool of that's what you're looking for on a Friday, but it's not worth their wannabe security bullshit. I JUST moved from California and this is my first time in the area. Since this is my first time in the area, apparently not knowing the names of the surrounding bars means you're \"too drunk\". Luckily I came with my bf who is a LEO who explained that I seriously did not know the area and legitimately had two fucking beers and we were permitted entrance. With that in mind, we went to a couple friendlier spots near by so, please, skip this place. They don't need your service and you don't need their attitude."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with group of 12 while attending function at nearby hotel.  Only 1 other table occupied in entire place should have been sign.  Place smelled strongly of disinfectant.  Worst looking bacon (dried out and dark) on BLT, burger raw in spots, fries tasteless and cold.  Server charged us all wrong price on lunch specials.  To top it off took over 20 minutes for him and manager to get new checks and they were still wrong. Made us late for our conference back at the hotel.  Other than possibly a drink before or after a game or concert, absolutely no reason to come here."}
{"text":"This is a great bar atmosphere for before a game, but their food is so mediocre that I would never eat here again. The burgers and sliders were so bland. Fast food restaurants have so much better burgers then here. The prices for food were also outrageous for the quality you get. I would definitely only recommend this bar for drinks before a game, that's the only reason I am giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp because yeah am too lazy to type but this place needs a review coz it's the shittiest bar in the valley! In such a prime location it definitely needs to be shut down. This waitress forgot her name, oh how I wish I remembered the name, but she's not that important obviously, so I get there am the first person on that side of the counter so I sit, two other guys join me one on my right and one on my left. The guy on my left apparently is a frequenter there so he says hi to her n calls her name he gets served first. The other guy on the right gets a hi and how are u doing what would u like me to serve u, he gets his ice tea, all this time am just looking at her waiting on her to even look at me and acknowledge my presence but apparently that was too much to ask. She finally did and served my beer. It was happy hour lets just said I had one beer and tipped $0 because that's exactly what she deserves. I hate to do that but they gotta close the place up no need to go in somewhere n leave more pissed!"}
{"text":"Awful! Went to enjoy St. Patrick's day festivities with some friends, and was harassed by two women at the bar ordering drinks. They called me 2 racial slurs. I kindly asked the ladies if they would like to order before me (as they were clearly angry with my presence of being another ethnicity), and they continued calling me the slur and laughing. My friends came over, I told one what just occurred and she simply asked the women if they called me the said racial slur. One of the girls signals a McFaddens security guard (her friend) who asks to have my friend removed from the bar. I go outside to confront the McFaddens security guard, and proceed to ask him why the ladies calling me racial slurs were not removed, however myself and my friends were. He proceeded to confirm those ladies would also be removed. This never occurred. I have the entire conversation on video, as well as lack of promise that culprits were removed from the establishment. The staff at McFaddens is not a place you would want to give your money to if you're a minority, as they not only promote, but encourage racism."}
{"text":"McFadden's is not really a pub, at least not in the traditional sense.  Really it's just a party place for drunk students, which is fine if that's what you're looking for.  Food and service is average at best, but if you're looking for a party atmosphere, especially at night, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Worst Irish pub I have ever been too. They should label themselves as a regular club because they have no Irish authenticity and have no reason to call themselves an Irish pub. I will never return"}
{"text":"When I first came to Phoenix a year ago I really enjoyed going out on the weekends to Westgate and usually ended up hanging out here at some point during the night. At that point it wasn't too bad, just mainly overcrowded, but it seems like every time I go here lately the place gets worse and worse. The employee's seem to always have a bad attitude and the bouncers are constantly looking for a reason to kick the guys out, as if the girls you're with are gonna stay after they eject you."}
{"text":"My friend and I were going to a concert at jobing.com arena and my friend decided we should have dinner at McFadden's before the show.  Since she was buying I said ok.  Should have looked at the Yelp reviews first.  Also should have noticed that every other restaurant near the arena had a long wait and McFadden's... no wait at all.  This should have been a clear sign to stay away from this place but we went in anyway.  As we walked in the hostesses at the front desk were ready to seat us right away.  The male manager came toward the front desk and said \"Ladies, how are you doing?\"  Both of us said \"Great, thanks\" only to find he was looking at the girls who had walked in behind us wearing skimpy dresses.  He completely ignored us despite the fact that we were right in front of him and talked directly to him.  So rude.  Our waitress came to take our order wearing Victoria's Secret yoga pants.  Really?  I ordered water to drink because I'm not a beer fan.  The water tasted like sewer water.  It was revolting.  It was 110 degrees and muggy outside so for me to choose dehydration over that water, it was truly foul.  Both my friend and I decided to order burgers (the menu has a VERY limited selection).  She ordered hers medium rare and the waitress told her they couldn't cook it less than medium.  She said ok, whatever.  She also asked for a side of ranch and a side of mayo with the burger.  When I went to order my burger I asked for it well done.  The waitress said \"sorry, we can't cook it any way other than medium.\"  What??  I have never been to a restaurant that was unable to cook food the way a customer wants it.  What's the point of being in business if you can't cook meat the way a customer wants it cooked??  She said on event days it's too busy for them to be able to cook anything in any different way.  There were 4 tables in the entire restaurant with patrons sitting at them.  Even the tables in the bar were empty.  So having 4 tables means they're too busy to make food the way a customer wants it.  That is flat out ridiculous.  I will not eat meat that is undercooked so I decided to order the philly cheesesteak sandwich instead after being assured the meat in that sandwich is actually cooked.  Our food arrived... my friend's food arrived with no side of ranch and no side of mayo.  The waitress brought them out later.  My cheesesteak was soggy because they use a runny cheese sauce.  My friend was also disappointed that they don't toast the buns on their burgers either.  The only redeeming thing in our meal were the fries - they were very good.  But you can get good fries anywhere.  I would never go back to McFadden's.  I'd rather wait an hour for one of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Take me off your stupid text message list. Your place is garbage, \"bartenders\" are terrible, I haven't been here for over 2 years ago and was conned into giving my # for upcoming specials, and I still get texts. I'm never coming back to your shit hole so stop texting me."}
{"text":"Something wrong with Irish Pub and Bud Light signs all over.  Walked in and found relatively empty at 830pm and all TV's on UFC fighting.  Turned around and left"}
{"text":"This Irish bar has no horseradish to go with their corned beef.  Blasphemous. Also Guinness was served in a plastic cup in the dining room. So offensive to anyone with Irish blood coursing through their veins.  Not magically delicious."}
{"text":"Need more bartenders! Paid 20$ for a cover charge but got horrible service on st Patrick's day. Yes I am aware of the day but I expected better service. I have gone here pervious days and service always sucks"}
{"text":"Just awful! Especially the bar manager and male Italian bartender.  Beware of what try put in your drinks."}
{"text":"This place is always a great time on a Friday or Saturday night! People everywhere having one hell of a time and DJ always spinning the hip tunes! It's got a great feel once the music gets turned up and the tables clear out for sure! I would say this place is in my opinion the most entertaining place inside Westgate on a Friday or Saturday night.   The only things I dislike about their business operation is the fact that they charge a $5 cover charge to get into the place. I wish I can just tell the door I plan on spending over $100 in booze once I get in and then get a no cover charge. Seriously it's like a slap in the face charging a cover! It's a good way to turn away people. I see it all the time.   Well any-who... Once you get into the joint it's pretty cool. They have a couple beer tub girls serving bottled beers and a huge inside and outside bar. Once this place gets cracking the dance floor can get pretty energetic and intoxicated ladies usually somehow end up on the bar shaking it. Pretty good eye candy I might add! Haha  Staff behind bar seem pretty organized and adequately paced getting and fulfilling drink orders. They have a good amount of security on staff, so if you plan on getting rowdy, you might want to plan on answering to Glendale PD, that is after you're carried out of the place.   If I were to give this business some great advice and a little gem of profitability over the other establishments... Get ride of the cover charge and slightly increase the price on the inventory! ;)  Just a thought... But who am I right?! Haha"}
{"text":"WORST place to go at Westgate! They charge a cover AND their drinks are overpriced. We went there after the cardinals game and the drink menu gave us the price of drinks but they never told us that drinks DOUBLED on game day. For a small crown & Coke that was originally priced at $10 each (still overpriced) it was $20 on game day. For a sports bar, their food is awful and their drinks are watered down. Do not go here. Staff is unprofessional and  waitresses are slow. If you want a sports bar experience, run far away from here. Disappointed."}
{"text":"My review is based strictly on this place as a bar, as I've never eaten here.  It's usually crowded on the weekends and for some odd reason they (staff/bar dancers) like to throw tons of napkins in the air, which is probably cool to the many intoxicated dancers on the floor.The problem is the napkins get all over the floor and mixed in with the spilled drinks, so now everyone is stepping on the napkins and they're getting stuck to everyone's shoes. Music is okay, the layout is pretty cramped... I don't ever go here by choice, only when a group of people I'm with want to."}
{"text":"Would not go back. With an hour wait at Yard House we decided to give McFadden's a try. Due to an event going on at the arena, there were no specials, and a very limited menu. Decided on the sliders, which came out burned to a crisp around the edges. Friend had the BLT and said it was not worth the price. Fries were seasoned well, but if the fries are the only good thing there, I'm not coming back. A busboy came by at least 10 times asking our friends plate. There was still food left, and they kept telling him no. He seemed to be getting impatient with them. When they did finish and he took the plate, I was the only one who heard him say, finally! Um, rude? Bathroom was in a horrible state. I get it, it was busy. But someone should be checking on them every half hour, at least."}
{"text":"Food was good not great. Came in on a Monday and I was 1 of 5 people. So service was good. Cobb salad was fair. Dressing was watered down but was ok. Probably wouldn't come back for food. But maybe for a drink."}
{"text":"This is your typical wanna be Phoenix version of the Irish Bar.  The food was ok.  Typical sports bar fare.  I will say the service was pretty good except for the ditzy hostesses.  Do they really need three 16 year olds manning the front of the restaunt texting and pretending to be listening?    The happy hour on Friday is great, lasting till 9:00 pm which is unheard of.  But dont stick around much longer after that unless you are  into the club scene. Because out come the lazer beams and smoke machines.... Hahaha no not really but they bust out the dance floor and make you move your seat so Glendales finest underage drinkers can shake their groove things.  It is funny how this bar resembles the cheesy old town bars that westsiders always seem to bag on."}
{"text":"Personally had great service here! I loved the shots provided and the music was on point. I'm not sure about when it's busy because I only went on a Thursday but still enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"Why are you charging a $10 cover when the bar is three quarters empty for St. Patrick's Day why don't you give me a drink for over 30 minutes why did my food take over one hour this is the worst Mcfaddens in the history of the Irish bar the unluckiest I was by Bever been to"}
{"text":"Do not eat the shrimp mac and cheese. Went here before the coyotes game. By the time it was over I was sick as a dog. Spent 5 days married to the toilet if you know what I mean. My boyfriend ate a few bites and had a stomach ache that night."}
{"text":"We were on vacation and decided to go to Mcfatten us for dinner. We were told they had really good fish and chips. We walked in there were five girls standing around talking, and after they finish their conversation they decided to seat us. A few minutes later they sat a party of six next to us. We were still waiting for the waitress to come and take our drink order. When the waitress finally came she went to the other table first and took there order. As she started to walk away we called and said, excuse me can we get something to drink we've been sitting here. The waitress told us they didn't have any Chardonnay wine so we ordered something else. When she brought the glasses over one of them had lipstick all over the rim, and one of the glasses was chipped. Since the waitress never came back to check on us, I brought the glass to the bar and asked the bartender if they had Chardonnay and he said yes. When the waitress brought the food over to the table she never said anything to us. We had to ask for condiments. We were on our way to a baseball game and needed to leave so we took The check up to the five girls that were still standing around and they said we had to wait for our waitress to take the bill, which took about 10 minutes. Needless to say this was the first time we did not tip our waitress. We would understand if she was really busy, which she wasn't. On a positive note, the bartender was great, & and the food was OK. Won't be returning there..."}
{"text":"This place is just like the 1.5 stars it has. If your anidiot like me you deserve to find out for yourself. If your smart you'll read these reviews and act accordingly."}
{"text":"4/8/2017 We went there with a group of eight of us all of our orders were messed up besides the slow service and very filthy bathrooms. I would not recommend this place the food was awful and the service was awful awful!! all eight of us were very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Am I getting too old for this?  Me thinks not!  Granted I'm not the youngest cat in the crowd, but I think I deserve some love don't I?  Well I guess not at McFadden's. I might not be that young lad that buys drinks for everyone and continue to pound down shots of liquor in the attempt to get myself drunk anymore.  However, I'm the guy that can actually afford it without burning a hole in my wallet - wink!  Maybe you should be looking my way next time instead of continue to serve the drunk dude down the bar who probably shouldn't be drinking anymore unless tent city is the next destination for him.    Loud obnoxious drunks and college frat party like atmosphere only goes so far.  Let's just keep it where it belongs because I really don't know if it should be public thing unless it's a place called Vegas.  Westgate is no Vegas!    I can party with the best, but even I felt uncomfortable here.  Let's just say if a fight broke out I wouldn't be surprised.  Patio is nice, but without a smoke vent is sucks -- yes I know the \"patio\" needs a smoke vent!  Unfortunately a bad experience this time; we'll see if I ever return to do a follow-up. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This one is pretty simple. Only good to grab a drink, maaaaaaaaybe two, before a game and move on"}
{"text":"The worst service you can ask for. The service is slow, the servers are rude, and the food looks/tastes like it's been blasted dry in the microwave. This place cuts all sorts of corners. I see workers who don't wash their hands and I've seen dirty rags used on the floor then touch the tables and plates without being cleaned. I also witnessed roaches crawling in and out of doors. I would never order anything from this \"restaurant/bar\". They have substandard practices. I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up with profuse diarrhea or projectile vomiting in a few hours. DO NOT COME HERE. Go across the plaza to better quality establishments."}
{"text":"Crowded, messy, inattentive staff. Was asked to leave once when I tripped over a spilled glass. After explaining the situation they still asked me and my party to leave. Drinks not worth the money, warm beer, very poorly made mixed drinks. Beer tub girls are sometimes rude, but I highly recommend going to them as you'll spend 15+minutes at the bar unless you are a scantily clad woman."}
{"text":"We started out our night here at about 9pm.  We got carded on the way in and my brother and husband were immediately told that at 10pm sharp - they had to take their hats off because the pub turns into a night club.  I guess that should have been the warning to just turn around and walk out right there.  But we were meeting some people and we thought we'd try it out.  So we find a table and order a beer.  The waitress says, \"oh can I see your ID's?\"  I explain that we got carded at the door.  She claims she still needs to see them.  Whatever.  So since we are from out of state, she has to get a manager to look at them.    For the love of god, I just want a BEER!  5 minutes later the manager comes by and \"approves\" our ID's.  Thanks dude, we make the over 21 cut by like 10 years.  Seriously.  The other thing that bothers me about this place is that they have a \"DJ\" guy who stands there and plays shitty music, yet likes to hear himself talk more than anything.  Between EVERY song, he has something to say.  This is not necessary, dude.  People don't care what you have to say.  People are here to talk to their friends not listen to you and your shitty music.  Annoying.  At 9:30pm they had a promo where everyone gets a little shot of Guinness to toast to.  But WAIT!  Not without showing your ID for the THIRD freakin time.  Am I in prison here?  10pm comes and the military-like douche bouncers come out.  Yelling at my brother and husband to take their hands off even though we explained that we are leaving.  Other people were wearing flip flops and shorts and other casual attire.  WTH is wrong with a hat?  We didn't want to bring down the atmosphere of their club by wearing a hat, so we left.    Hopefully never to return."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service both!! Went for dinner on a Saturday night around 7, place 3/4th empty, should have beeen a red flag. Waitress does not know what a 7 and 7 is- conversation goes:  \"It's Seagram's 7 and 7-up\". \"What is Seargams 7? I really don't know anything about the drinks\". Takes over 15 minutes to get the drinks. Had checked out the menu online and hubby was ready for corned beef n cabbage. Ooops, sorry, that's not actually ON the menu. After some grumbling, picks the Philly Cheesesteak...Guess what, that's ON the menu but they no longer serve it. \"We're redoing our menu\", sorry. All 5 of us get burgers. After another ridiculous wait period, which we spent watching the manager oogle and fondle all the female waitstaff, the burgers arrive. Two ordered medium rare, three ordered medium.... All burgers are well-done rubber hockey pucks with fake grill marks. Obviously out of a box of frozen burgers. Of the three that had bacon, the bacon on all 3 was stone cold. Two had buns that were cool, one had a bun that actually had a frozen spot in the top if it! The frozen one with ice cold bacon was returned, the rest of us were too hungry so ate. Catsup and mustard on tables, but 8 of the catsup bottles in the immediate area are completely empty! We raid 9 other tables to find one that's half full and present the waitress with the empties as a gift..... And still waiting for that replacment burger. The redone burger still not there by the time the rest of us finished, had to go hunt down the manager because waitress had vanished. Manager solution? \"We can put it in a to-go box for you\". Bartender had thedecency to apologzie and offer a free drink, but too little too late.Absolutely will not give this place a second chance, recommend you steer clear too! Margaritavlle or the Yardhouse would have been a much better bet. :("}
{"text":"Great place, Great location, WORST SERVICE! No one at the door. We waited 20 min to order a beer!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place a couple days ago. The food came out freakishly fast (like, TOO fast!). We got the nachos, which were not very good at all...I've had better nachos at movie theaters and gas stations (should've known better than to order something with \"cheese whiz\" in the menu description). I'll give it 3 stars though because the server was really nice and was able to keep up with refills (which says a LOT since my boyfriend can chug Dr. Pepper like no other), and the goat cheese salad was actually very good. Bf had the shepherd's pie--wasn't bad but we've had better (and for $15 I thought the portion should've been bigger--it's half potatoes, and potatoes are cheap!) The waitress actually came over looking concerned after the first couple bites because \"it's one of the things on the menu that's been really inconsistent.\" Good to know, I guess..."}
{"text":"Leaves a lot to be desired. We went on a night when they had \"parties\" because my boyfriends brother won a \"party\"  The good thing was the 2 dollar drinks.  The bad thing was pretty much everything else.  It turned very skanky at 11:00..  Not my thing..  And the music was too loud.   That's not a pub in my opinion.. Since when do pubs need security and people dance on the bar half naked?  Don't get me wrong, there is a place for that, but I just wish there was somewhere decent at westgate to hang out.. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. Drinks are over priced, crappy music, and slow bartenders make it nearly unbearable. However, the $2 happy hours they pass out like candy make it a good pregame spot. Since it's one of the few dance places it attracts all the scantily clad clubrats. A lot of my friends like it but it's not my thing. It gives pub a bad name."}
{"text":"We should've known to take our business elsewhere by the previous Yelp reviews and the fact that McFadden's was not so crowded.  But I think my group of five was giddy over getting last minute amazing seats to the Bon Jovi concert, that we just wanted to get a quick bite and a beer and head into the show.  The service was ok until the food arrived and it took a good five minutes to get napkins, forks, and water... The food was decent but nothing special at all.  I had the salmon entree (served with mashed potatoes and spinach) and the others went with chicken wings and chicken fingers (both served with french fries).  Needless to say, our time at McFadden's was the lowlight of the evening.  (And yes, I just made up the word lowlight!) The concert was incredible!  I will not be returning to McFadden's since there are plenty of other options to grab a bite before heading in to Jobing.com Arena."}
{"text":"The food was ok and the music very load. Could hardly have a conversation without screaming."}
{"text":"My husband was charged $200 for three drinks(2 beers & 1 cocktail). He didn't notice until it hit his account. This place steals money. He called to retrieve his money multiple times and the manager gave him the run around. They are thieves!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst place to try to have fun.  I realized my zipper was down and zipped up my pants and was kicked out for it. Every time I come to Phoenix and we go to this place I regret it.   The food is horrible the bouncers are fat meat heads.  This place sux."}
{"text":"Had a great time for Fight Night. Got the boneless buffalo wings, they were really good!!"}
{"text":"We got there around noon on a Tuesday.  It was dead, only 1 guy at the bar.  We waited for about 3 mins before someone noticed we were waiting for a table.  I should have known better to dine without checking Yelp first.    We got seated and the hostess notified us that she is also our server.  She took our drink orders.  And she was back right away with our drinks.  She took our food order.  We both ordered a soup and an appetizer for lunch.  We waited 15 mins and our soups came out  within 5 mins our food came out too.  IRISH POTATO SOUP - it came out warm, there was only a few chunks of potatoes, and tasted ok.  CHICKEN FINGERS - the chicken was not crispy but hard.  The fries were  good!  Service was actually good.  The food is not so good."}
{"text":"*Zero Stars* Rude staff, from doorman to Bartendar. Horrible DJ plays the same playlist week after week from 10 years ago. Not a place to dance to hip music and have fun. One of the employees are sure to spoil your night if the music hasn't already. We've been here many times and leave disappointed every visit. We will not return after this last one. Management must breed a culture of bad customer service and poor hospitality."}
{"text":"While I hesitate adding yet another review to this 1.5 star restaurant, I can't ignore the bad experience that I had while I was there. Firstly, I want to make it clear that our waitress was very nice and accommodating, so the service gets 5 stars. However. Upon arriving, I ordered a Long Island and my man ordered a dirty martini. I'm not that picky when it comes to drinks, but the Long Island came VERY watered down. It tasted like water and Splenda. I asked the waitress to switch it out for a glass of wine which they didn't have, so I settled for a rum and coke which was also watered down. At this point I gave up.  My boyfriends dirty martini came without olives. He went to the bar to ask for olives and the male and female bartender ignored him for at least two minutes because they were too busy chatting with each other. He moved to another side of the bar and another server or bartender helped him out and added olives to his beverage.  The food we ordered was sub par. His fish and chips were below average, and my nachos were just soggy beyond the first layer of a few chips, and the chicken was bland.  Overall, I just can't recommend this restaurant knowing that the food and drinks were almost ok awful level. Maybe if we hear that they've made major changes to their kitchen and bar we'll head back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"I was reminded last night of the reason why I strongly dislike westgate late night.  The bartenders pass you by as you are calling their name to get you a glass of water or even an alcoholic beverage and to make matters completely worse had pregnant looking girls with love handles for days shaking their lack of ass on the bar. Ewww. I know it isn't vegas but cmon managers hire somebody who can at least dance and has somewhat of some musical rhythm. I had this urge to get up there and push them off the bar and steal the outfit but why do it if I'm not the one being paid.   As I headed back to our table trying not to step on the endless amounts of dirty napkins that wanted to stick to my pumps last night and took a seat. This annoying females were screaming for no reason. I always run into the worst crowd at westgate for some reason, first some girl wants me to punch her in the throat for stealing my bf''s water and flirting with him and now this girl screaming. Sweet. The bathrooms were a complete disaster and I can tell you right now I highly doubt they have good food with how the ratings are looking already. Good thing my parents always eat at yard house when they drive down so that's hit or miss but probably a million times better than this joint."}
{"text":"The bar has a great location right outside the hockey/football arenas so it makes it really convenient if you are attending one of these venues. The issue I had was with the bartenders...They were way too caught up in their lives and social circles to bother with anything else. It had that feeling to where you are there for them instead of them being there for you. So expect to wait on them and let them finish their conversations, flirt and so on... Too many other good bars for me to return."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and fries, fish and chips were awesome. Our first time here, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Most unpleasant restaurant experience. Well, the food anyway. Top item on the menu is Philly cheesesteak. When it was delivered, it was chicken. Apparently they didn't even inform the waitress that the menu item will no longer be served. Instead of asking if we wanted to order something else, the kitchen brought us a different dish. On top of it all, it did not taste good. The chicken had no flavor, the onions were microscopic and the peppers were also non-existent, like the cheesesteak itself. It happened to the table next to us as well. Poor waitress had no idea because she didn't deliver the food. Not worth my money."}
{"text":"By far the worst service and disrespect I have ever received as an out of towner at a restaurant. The general manager showed little respect for its patrons which is ashame because the waitresses were so nice. I would highly recommend the other bars and restaurants in this little square. This place is ran by a young inconsiderate moron with no concept of the customer experience.  Don't go!"}
{"text":"This place was awful!!!! They we're playing the worst mash up of Christmas music and it was excessively loud. The tots were good but that was all. The roast beef looked and tasted like dog food. The hamburger bun was soggy like it sat in water. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"I went to McFadden's because I was staying at the Hotel across the street, and me and my girlfriend wanted to go somewhere convenient.  When we arrived, even though the Blackhawks were playing the Coyotes(in Chicago) in the playoffs, there were about 13 people (tops) in the place...which seemed strange to me. I then noticed that there were only 2 servers and a bartender working. Shouldn't have been too bad given the few people in there...but it was. It took 10 mins for the server to come to our table, another 15 for her to take our drink order and give us a menu then 20 mins to take our order.  Once the food came it was decent, but nothing special. Your usual Chilis', applebee's or any other chain restaurant fare. Again, nothing special.  The only reason I see that people would go here is because it's close to both stadiums and in the westgate plaza. If you are going there to only drink, fine, but don't expect the food to be great, or to get any service  FYI they don't even try to have an Irish theme at this restaurant."}
{"text":"The place smells like stale beer!  Food sucked couldn't do a side salad it looked like weeds! The place needs to be recused badly! Plumbing in women's room was on the floor. I would not allow my dog to eat there!"}
{"text":"Wow...it looks like this place does not have many stars from other people...I didn't even look at reviews before writing mine. Tomorrow I'm going to try and track down the corporate office. Even one star is too much!  Patron's beware! McFadden's in Glendale, Arizona has hands-down one of the worst customer service policies ever! It is like this bar runs on a crew with their heads up each other's asses! Basically, this place SUCKS!!!   My experience was so terrible the only way to keep it together, without writing a book, was bullet points: * Attempted to organize an event for 20-15 employees. Had an office member contact the restaurant the week before to set it up. Relations person was more concerned with taking the credit card info to charge us if we did not show, or had less people, than sending the agreement. We never got anything in writing with these policies on it! Surprise, surprise...the only thing in the file was the credit card without a booked reservation. * Tried to call the location the day of the event to confirm. Was told by the hostess that I was not allowed to speak to a manager about this issue and she would not find someone for me to check the reservation. Called back with a different name and held for 14 minutes to speak to a manager that just said \"Sarah\" was off and would be coming in...Um, how is her staffing my issue? I had to badger her to even look into the issue. * Finally worked out the details and had tables reserved, the day of the event while my party was on the freeway going to the location. The first guests arrived after making our complaints to the manager and one of the bartenders made the remark \"Those are some big shoes to fill\" to our assigned server in front of guests. What, because we had to call to make sure we had a place to go? * The place smelled like vomit!! (Also noted in another customer's review) * Terrible, terrible, terrible service! Our server would only take one drink order at a time and often left the table without asking the customers with empty classes if they wanted another beverage. Hello...dumb ass...empty glasses means more opportunity to make more money?! Maybe the mandatory 18% tip for the party size blew our chances at having any sort of service.  * Drinks and food were sent to our table that we did not order. Food runners gave us attitude and stormed off when we told them the food did not belong to us. * Bill arrived with over $100 in extra charges for drinks we did not order were on it. We asked the server about it and her response was \"Well, I am NOT taking them off\" and walked off.  * Had to ask for another manager to come over because of the inflated bill. Took 20 minutes for him to get to us and the restaurant was not even busy. Manager was extremely patronizing and was not going to help us at first. After having to re-hash the details he took some of the drinks off, but not all of them. He claimed that the service \"might\" not have been that great because it was St. Patrick's Day that week. Didn't they have like 364 days to get ready for this?  * Waited another 30 minutes to get our change back. After coming back to the table the server put the bill and change in my face, glared at me and walked away. No \"thank you\" or anything for the 18% tip she was guaranteed because the size of the party. In all honesty, I would have totally stiffed her if it were a smaller party.  I was embarrassed that my group had to experience this. The only reason we decided to go there was one of my guests had won a happy-hour event there. My gut feeling when I could not confirm the reservation was to just go somewhere else, but was afraid that the only thing they would do correctly was charge the credit card for a no show. Knowing this I would have taken the group to Applebee's where we would have expected this. Our state relies on tourism and looking at the issue from a higher level the industry decline in does not rest only on the economy, but at these eateries internally. I am starting to point blame at the terrible customer in the service industry, weak and inexperienced restaurant/bar management, and shoddy company policies for their decline. If the industry truly cared about customers it would not be in this predicament.  Did anyone notice that their staff member was the only one to give this place like 5 stars? Maybe she should be a customer in it instead of part of the \"family\"."}
{"text":"music sucks, the dj always play Wobble by V.I.C and is a one tick pony 2nd time I came I swear he played the same songs.. one word. GHETTO(people,music, etc.........)."}
{"text":"Noisy. Crowded. Mediocre food.  I also call their cleanliness into question. Upon attempting to use a mustard bottle at our patio table, a piece of dirt/napkin/dried-out-mustard had jammed the tip of the squeeze bottle. What I thought was just thick mustard exploded all over myself and my wife when whatever was clogging the end was forcibly ejected from squeezing it.  +1 star because the waiter was kind enough to bring towels wet with soda-water for us to clean ourselves up."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here when we occasionally attend a Cardinals game and stay at the hotel next door. We've come in 4 or 5 times now over the last couple years. I'm here to confirm things and give my opinion. Warning, I may offend some people but this is just my observation.  1. Yes, the bathroom is disgusting. The doors are nasty. It doesn't help that its stainless steel and any smudge shows up. And yes it looks like they have not been cleaned in any way for months. Theres never any soap. The toilet seat covers are always empty, and a few of them are hanging off the wall by only one screw. The only good part about the bathrooms is its open, and at times there is a friendly attendant handing you paper towels. But did anyone stop to think that most of the customers using this said bathroom were completely trashed, and the employees are tired of cleaning up after them for the day? Not condoning the employees behavior at all, but you also have no idea what went on in that bathroom before you walked in there. Also.. haven't we all been to a dive that is worse then this?  2. I can only comment on the bartender service as we have never sat at a table and needed a server. I do vividly remember the first time we were there, and yes the service at first was a little rough. But my husband and I are friendly and started talking to the bartender. We were treating him like a human being doing us a service. We were joking, laughing, and having a good time. Sure, he was getting paid to make our visit enjoyable, but it worked. Then our service was wonderful. Our drinks were full and we were happy. Then, every time after that that we visited we got the same service. One specific bartender actually remembers us every time, and remembers what we drink and before we even get a chance to say \"hi! haven't seen you in a few months\" there is two beers sitting in front of us. If thats not service, I don't know what is.  We have been there during busy times as well. People watching is a habit of mine. Yes, I see you.. yes you. The jerk that demands service but then doesn't tip. The \"lady\" that wants the fruitiest drink ever, and because there isn't 5 shots of alcohol in this said drink they consider it watered down. The college kid that orders 5 different drinks for his drunk friends and then tips $1. That bartender you just pissed off remembers you. He or she knows that no matter what he or she does for you, you will only demand more, and tip less. There was a tall guy quite literally hanging over the bar, yelling at the bartender who was busy making other drinks on our last visit. When the bartender continued to ignore him, the guy was getting pissed. Meanwhile, our beers were empty and this said bartender grabbed us two beers before finally helping this person. Do NOT treat your bartender like less than human and then get mad that you get horrible service. Try treating your bartender or server like you were in their position, and maybe, just maybe they will treat you how you expect to be treated.   Now, there is an exception to that because this place has a long of young employees. Some I could swear are not old enough to even work. And unfortunately a lot of people don't really like their job and could care less that they just pissed you off. They just want the paycheck. So then you have a mixture of customers who have extremely high expectations, and employees that hate their job. Not a good mix. But considering this place has MANY reviews that all say the service sucks and it has 1.5 stars out of 5... maybe you shouldn't go in and then judge the place for its faults that you were completely aware that it had.   Now to the food. Well, I'm no chef, so to me the food was ok. I wouldn't recommend anything. And yes it is over priced. But its food, and we were hungry. After a few beers, we just wanted to eat something. The wings are dry, the mozzarella cheese fritters are greasy, the burger isn't seasoned. This isn't a five star food spot. Deal with it.   One last thing and then I will jump off my soap box. The only real issue we had was on our last visit. At a certain time the bouncers take the bar stools out from underneath you to make room for the crowd. For us to have been there for hours before this and then the bouncer very coldly yells at us \"I'm taking the stools now\". I turn around and ask \"seriously?\". And his reply was \"seriously\". I stand up and he takes the chair with nothing else said. Not a \"thank you\" or a \"sorry\". Just need to learn some manners, thats all.   Ok I'm done. I know its a dive, and everybody hates it, but we are still going to go there."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 stopped here on a Sunday prior to a kid's hockey game at Gila River Arena. I had been here once before prior to a Cardinals game and it was OK so we came back.  Restaurant was reasonably busy due to people watching the out of town Cardinals game but we were able to be seated on the patio immediately.   Our server took everyone's order (light lunch items) without writing anything down.  I said, \"I wonder how she does that?\"  Found out she doesn't. One order incorrect, sliders with cheese. Second try, still not hot and cheese slices just thrown on, not melted as you would expect. Server really unaware of the menu items. Slow service, lukewarm food for all items.  Unaware hostess.  No real reason to return so we won't. I don't think the staff here really cares about doing a good job.  Stay away."}
{"text":"What a major disappointment and I will explain why in full detail. Trust me this place deserves not a single star.  Last night my wife and I went to McFadden's and when we walked in I was happy to see UFC on and everyone was watching the fights. This was the only moment in my experience with this place that was a good moment.  This lasted maybe a half of an hour when we heard an announcement that anyone under the age of 21 must leave. Well, this obviously alienated many people who came to enjoy themselves with their family so you basically will lose potential dollars by kicking them out or asking them to leave. To make matters worse, managers / security or bouncers were asking people to give them their seat and table so they can clear the front of the building and make a dance floor. Again, people were not happy to have to get up and leave which includes the bar stools at the bar. I spoke to 4 individuals around me about what was going on and when they told me why they were doing it they showed their displeasure as well. Many people got upset at what was going on and simply left. I can't blame them.  Now the music started thumping and bumping loudly (In a Sports Bar) and some chick wearing practically nothing jumped up on the bar and started twerking. Really, twerking in a Sports Bar? It was such a classless act especially when I came to McFadden's to watch sports with my wife and have a table to sit at.   When my wife went to the restroom, she said there were 3 chicks grinding on each other in the restroom and one of them was a chick that gave towels and gum as you exited the restroom. Just a classless act and what a horrible place this establishment is.  If I wanted to go to a dance club I would have gone to a dance club. If I wanted to see strippers or to be modest, a chick half naked dancing on top of a bar I would have gone to a strip club or Coyote Ugly.  I am never going back to this classless place. The way in which management was telling people to get out of their seats was unprofessional and rude to say the least. Please do yourself a favor and do not go to this place. Go to the Yard House and enjoy great beer and an a great atmosphere and save yourself the headache.  I am glad I left, and will never return!  Dave"}

{"text":"They hosted #wvfn, West Valley Friday Nights. We are a group of Twitter folks who try out resturants every friday night, and just love to socialize offline with one another.  We have a about 20 people there. They had great boneless wings, treated us right!  I discovered their 1/2 off domestic & well drinks as well as their 1/2 off appitizers last until 9pm even on Friday. Best and longest happy hour prices in the west valley.   A must stop and check out."}
{"text":"I wished I never came. The saddest part was, I already spent my money there. This place got the worst service you could ever get. They don't ask for a tip, they actually steal it from you. Not only that, long waits and sub-par food (McFadden's Mac&Cheese and Chicken Caesar). Avoid this place at any cause."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a quiet Saturday. Our server was quick and helpful with menu questions. The food was delivered in a timely manner and warm. Had a Rueben sanwich and fries. The sandwich had potential with thick slices of corned beef inside. The beef was very tenderbut it was lacking flavor and therefore the sandwich flopped.   My lunch companion had a chicken sandwich that was also unremarkable. The fries were pretty good.   The beer was tasty and service was good. Sorry to say it was not worth the trip."}

{"text":"Awesome place! Did St. Patty's and it was amazing. My only issue is because it was an event they have a cover at the door. We bought a lot of food and drinks, so adding a cover bothered me a little. Other than that it is amazing! I would recommend this place if you are in town."}
{"text":"For a place that should be accustomed to dealing with large crowds waiting to get into the nearby arena and stadium, this place is a mess. We tried to get seated for dinner approximately an hour and a half before a concert at the University of Phoenix Stadium. The hostess told us the wait was over an hour so we went to the bar instead. As we stood there, we discovered that the majority of the tables in the restaurant were dirty and not being bussed as the restaurant appeared to be badly understaffed.  Later, as we stood at the bar, we asked the bartender if we could order food there. We were told we could only order food if we were seated. We then asked if we could drag chairs to some empty space at the bar. We were told this was not possible as the space was supposed to be left open. Within five minutes, we watched another guest drag over a chair and sit in the space and the bartender said nothing.  This place is a mess.  Don't even waste your time.  I can't imagine how, in this location, you would not have proper staff to accommodate a large crowd for an event that was announced over four months in advance.  There is another review below that puts this perfectly into context: at any other location, this place would already be out of business."}
{"text":"Ugh...I absolutely hate this place. Not only do the bartenders dress and look like skanks, but their service is terrible. The security guys are extremely rude. Unfortunately, places are limited ta Westgate so I have been here numerous and each time, there is always something wrong. We were there for an hour, my friend literally tripped and almost fell and we were told that we have to calm down otherwise we will get kicked out, as we were all sitting and talking (at 10:00). Sucky place, go somewhere else!"}

Burger seemed to be a prepatty?  Well then it got interesting.  Online menu shows burgers $10. Paper menu shows $11.00 Bill came up as $12.00???  Watch your bill.. seems fishy to me..  Asked waitress about it, no kidding she asks me.... \"Would u like me to take that off?\"  And then we only ordered one soda, ran up as two.. Asked server about it and she said to get the $25 off the bill had to be $50.00 so she just added the 2nd drink on???  So I asked to have the $2.00 off for the Over priced burgers & $3 for the soda.. and I ordered dessert to go to allow bill to be $50.   She brought bill back still with the extra Soda. I asked her about the extra $3..  No kidding she asks again.... \"Would you like for me to take that off\"  Wow... this was crazy..."}

The hostess came and took the sign down...classy. We ordered some appetizers consisting of hot wings, which were not hot and they could not split favors. That was beyond them to do that. The wings were deep fried to the point of being dried and taking on a jerky like consistency. We also ordered some onion rings, which ran $10 for a plate. These were not your hand battered good onion rings-they were straight from the bag frozen and done in two seconds. The ranch dressing served with the wings and rings was about as thick as water and didn't taste much better.   We decided to order a couple of sandwiches, which we figured would be a huge mistake but we were hungry. My wife ordered a club in \"Texas toast\" and I ordered a half pound bacon and blue burger. I kid you not the order came out as soon as the waitress put it in. There is no way this was cooked to order. The menu said burgers are cooked medium, mine was super well done with no hint of juice. I have no idea at what point the meat weighed half a pound because the \"meat\" I got was something McDonalds wouldn't serve. My wife's Texas toast was nothing more than regular dry toast. Pints of beer are no cheaper here than inside the arena. The bottom line....go somewhere else when going to an event here or go inside and eat. There's no pride in the cafeteria food they serve. I can only think that they stay in business since on event days they are bound to get a few suckers in there that haven't tried it before. It's to bad having a great spot and all. The valley is loaded with fantastic Irish pubs and this joint should be embarrassed to even consider themselves one. I hope one day this spot is taken over by someone who actually takes pride in what they serve, even on the busiest of days. A busy event should not be an excuse to serve garbage."}
{"text":"Pros: it's close to the stadium, plenty of seating , nice servers, food is okay. Cons: little pricy and food is okay."}
{"text":"Would give NO star if it were an option. What a disappointment. I traveled 100 miles to surprise my wife who is caring for relatives in the Phx area. After shopping at  a nearby outlet mall in the area, we chose McFadden's for lunch.  We had received a coupon book at the mall that had a discount at McFadden's. I should have checked yelp first. The waitress met us at the door and told us that some of the items had been deleted or altered (chicken instead of beef on their Philly Cheese Steak????) the menu has been changed but they have not come back from the printer. A very limited menu and not very cheap either. Our burgers were obviously frozen preformed patties, like you would get at Costco. Good thing it had bacon and bleu cheese, because the patty had NO flavor at all. To top it all off. The waitress would not honor the coupon. Apparently they are null and void on game days. (NHL Coyotes next door) Won't be going back to this dive again."}
{"text":"Prepaid to attend the StPattys day party, got there and was enjoy the evening with my friends. Then I was in line for the restroom and a manager came over and redirected the men's room line down a hall way and told us if we didn't want to wait we could go outside to the porta Johns and then come right back in. So when I got back in line a bouncer came running over saying I wasn't allowed back in, then refused to say why or get the manager to explain why he wouldn't let me back in. I wasn't drunk, belligerent, or rude to anyone. Was there for about 4 hours had less then a handful of beers, ate food. Just feel it was chicken move to refuse re-entry without a reason. Maybe the management should grow a set and be willing to explain themselves!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, but the service was not very good.  We waited quite a while for every step of our order even though the place was dead.  It may make more sense to put everyone closer to the kitchen to speed up the process."}
{"text":"DO NOT ENTER DONT DO IT!!!!!!! I had written a review about a year ago and somehow it got deleted.  But the first time I had been there was the worst experience I have ever had an establishment. I said I would never go back, so after a long time I finally decided to give it another shot thinking ok hopefully after reading all these bad reviews they have stepped it up. We'll unfortunately things have gone from bad to Omg someone needs to close this place down.  Disgusting environment.  Nasty girls with dirty shoes dancing on the same bar where they are serving drinks and food.  The girl who works there as an overweight gogo dancer actually took her shirt off. Not what everyone wanted to see. Letting napkins fly through the air and sop up all the nasty on the floor is a disaster for shoes as when many people walked out had napkins stuck to them.  I just don't understand how the hell the health department hasn't been alerted. I think a call will definitely be made. For such a great location I would expect higher quality than this disgusting excuse of a so called club,bar, restaurant. I highly recommend you stay away."}
{"text":"I could go into detail as many have about the multiple terrible experiences encountered here, but to keep it as accurate and short.. EVERY ASPECT OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS TRASH.   If yelp had a negative rating this place would not be 1.5 rated, but more like -4 star rated."}
{"text":"Awful food, awful service, dingy atmosphere.  The only reason we stayed is we had a restaurant.com gift card for it.  The prices are pretty high for terrible food and they couldn't get the order right and it was just nachos and a burger!  If you're gonna pay that much go o to yard house instead!"}
{"text":"Well, I had been warned by many people not to come here, as it seems the yelp reviews match what I've been told. So I go on a saturday night for a \"night out\".   In what world is this an irish bar? Tip: turn it into a mexican party bar and you'll do much better. However I fear the the health of the patrons here. But I'll get to that in a minute.  1) wait wait, $5 cover here while no cover at saddle ranch -which has way better service? HA!   2) service was absolutely horrendous. Yes, the bar was crowded on a saturday night, but I'm not a noob to the club scene. It shouldn't take standing at the bar for 10 minutes to get a drink when you're not 3 people deep. I've never seen so many workers behind a bar with such slow service. Everyone looking like they're working but nothing really getting done. Too many bar backs?  3) Here's the most troubling. I saw at least one bar tender scooping ice with a glass. Um, are you retarded? How do you have a job as a bar tender? This is one of the biggest no nos as a bar tender. Hope you like glass shards in your drinks!   Definitely won't be back.  Oh and it looks like many of the TGIF restaurants in the valley are turning into Mcfaddens. Not that I went to TGIF in the first place, but definitely won't anyway."}
{"text":"Really not that good , Food is boring especially for the price , Mix drinks are fair but kind of small .  Service was ok but it was not busy at all ."}
{"text":"Terrible place to go. On a busy night they will 86 someone because they don't like them. The manager will not come talk to you if you have an issue. If you voice any type of complaints, they 86 you. This is the 3rd time I've seen someone get kicked out for absolutely no reason. If you're looking for over priced drinks with terrible food selection, you've found your place. A little bouncer named Patrick bounced me because I didn't like how he talked to me. He's the worst type of bouncer, a chicken s$i@ coward that uses 20 bouncers to defend his honor. Lol. Very pissed with this place. Please avoid and save yourself some misery. The customer does not come first."}
{"text":"Literally the shittiest bar in Westgate. They kicked my friend out because he \"tipped the bathroom attendant too much\" and when I asked them to explain why that was a reason to kick someone out, they told me I was being too aggressive and \"called the cops.\" Fuck them. These bouncers are the dumbest pieces of shit I've ever met."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a star. I've given this place three trys and every time I've been let down. You'll wait forever to get your drink and then it's not always what you order. I hate writing bad reviews but this place really irritated me. This last time really pushed me over the limit to write this review. My girlfriend and a few others wanted to go here lastnight so I went as well. We were there for about ten minutes and I was about halfway done with my drink when a bouncer approached my girlfriend. He told her she had to go and that she couldn't pull one over on him. She asked what he was talking about and he said that she had already been kicked out for the night. We told the guy we just got there and it  must have been someone else. He told us that we were not going to discuss the matter and to leave. I was shocked and didn't show any signs of frustration but boy was my blood boiling. It was our first stop of the night and it was not how I anticipated it to go. Definitely never going back!"}
{"text":"Would give it a zero these pos wouldn't let my friend in just cause he's got face tattoos fck this place don't go there crappy food crappy drinks and shitty management"}
{"text":"Is there a way to give this place a half a star?, because that's what it deserves. This place sucks there staff is horrible almost like the girl hates her job and the food was not only cold but horrible. Monday night and there's only 3 tables here and we order cheese sticks and while waiting we then order our food and everything comes out at the same time over 45mins later come on now on a Monday night and cheese sticks ur telling me cheese sticks take 45mins when there's nobody in this place on a Monday night this place sucks and I will never come back and never reccommend it. We ordered the cheese sticks which took over 45mins to come out, I'm sorry but they take what 3 mins tops, the chicken nachos which the chicken was cold and almost like it was pre packaged and taken right out of the package from the fridge to the plate and the cheese wiz was cold as well and the sliders, which the sliders were great only good thing we ordered. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. The place is just a train wreck. The only saving grace is Amber, one of the servers.   We started at the bar, waiting for friends in a concert that that we didn't want to attend, we had some time to kill. The bartenders were not interested in us or our desire to drink. Bathrooms are just disturbing. But we went outside and had server Amber and she was fast and friendly. Food though, terrible"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars i would. Came here to watch ufc 202. They tried to charge $50 for a table. We sat outside for free. It got rained on and we had to stand inside to watch. Food ans service were both bad. Wouldn't ever come back. The tv stopped worming while  the fight was on too"}
{"text":"It the worst bar ever.  I'm With the band Los Lobos. And security let us in and after 35 minutes a little security guy came and ripped the sun glasses off Cesar Rosas and got there manager Armando Tavares in a choke Hold for no reason.  They refused to give him his credit card back till he called the police. And all of a sudden they found it. We will never go back to this bar Or town no matter how much they pay us!!!"}
{"text":"The experience started out great.  I saw they had philly cheesesteak nachos and I had to try them.  Order the large portion if you have more than two people.  There was plenty of cheese.  They even used Cheese Whiz like a true Philly sandwhich.  There was plenty of cheese, but very little meat.  After eating off the top few chips the meat was gone.  They really need to double the meat.  For dinner I attempted to order the BLT, but they were out of bacon.  I settled for the chicken strips.  It was your standard issue chicken strip meal.  Not bad, but I could do the same on my own from the frozen food section at any grocery store.  Our server was nice, and attentive.  That was easy though because the place was nearly empty."}
{"text":"doesn't deserve a star. Food was awful, screwed up all for orders ! How do you do that! lipstick on 2 glasses. No specials for hockey games , only football so its expensive. Do yourself a favor . Smuggle a cocktail into mcdonalds  and drink it with your mcnuggets off the value menu. It will be a much better experience than here and you wont leave feeling like you've robbed."}
{"text":"Could be the worst bar I have ever been to.  The music is terrible, the service is awful and unfriendly.  I get the feeling that the staff here hates their job.    I wish I could nominate McFadden's for the worst of Yelp!  I don't think this place would even still be in business if it weren't in such a busy area."}
{"text":"I only go there at night to PArtay! Haha. They keep the place moving and as much as their rules can be annoying, Im glad they have something in place to keep ppl in check. I like their one DJ-Tyger, he's the best and he's from 98.3 if you ever wanna hear him before going out. I wouldnt recommend to eat dinner here and their pretty pricey but this is def a good place to go to have a good time!"}
{"text":"Here for the first time and reading the yelps scared me! I ran to the atm lol. My service has  been good.. Ordered wings and fries they were decent... Drinks are so so... The crowd is ok so far..."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF CREDIT CARD FRAUD  This place is currently under investigation. Check out ABC15 news.  It's pretty much a \"nightclub\" masquerading as a restaurant. I use the word night club loosely. The last time I went I was eaten alive by flying biting insects where the staff really didn't care. If you just want to go and get drunk and possibly catch an STD then this is the place if not go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bar review only.  We stopped by to have a few drinks before a concert. The service was slow, but the bartender was always nice when she came over to get our next drinks."}
{"text":"I love the food here!!. As a former employee, I still come to mcfaddens for their great food. the servers are awesome, and do a great job at accomdating customers. The chicken nachos are awesome as the rest of the menu is!. I surely will reccomend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Just want to start off by saying, the bartenders here are amazing and they honestly make this place! They are the ONLY reason why I ever go back! McFaddens has piss poor management and is turning into such a trashy bar! The women's restroom is an absolute embarrassment! Toilet paper rolls on the back of a toilet? Really? The bathrooms are so dirty and literally all the stalls have either a broken lock, no purse hook (I refuse to set my purse on a bathroom floor so yes, it's a big deal to me) or no toilet paper....    Besides the bathroom issue, they also have bottle beer that has a metal taste from being in a metal cooler, or beer trough. They obviously don't rotate their beer in coolers. The whole restaurant is dirty, and I'd never eat here."}
{"text":"Congratulations McFadden's you've done it! You've earned the distinction of worst bar in Arizona. From the dirty(not in a good way) dance floor, awful, negligent(too busy drinking instead of serving) staff, horrible food and the audacity to charge a cover?!? Really, just please make the world a better place and close already. Sincerely, Every Arizona Resident."}
{"text":"Really a bad Irish bar. How long should you sit with an empty beer with 6 bartenders and 12 customers?  They should be busy on St Practice day but I understand why they were not.   They were geared up for business, except they had bad staff.   I walked over to the Yard  House where the place was packed and I received a beer in minutes. They were appropriately staffed, but they can effectively produce quality service with a lower staff ratio."}
{"text":"Overall this place is awful and a place no one should go on purpose. By awful I mean the security always has a bad attitude, the place is always a mess and the layout for the dance floor doesn't make very much sense. Its a dive without dive prices. The only selling points is there VIP program which gives good discounts and makes it a good place to invite people since theres no cover with it.   Sadly its the best place to go in the Westgate complex, but if you have somewhere else to go. Go there."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give negative ratings this would be the place to get them. Food is below average, service sucks. I have been twice.. I thought maybe the first go round was a fluke, but it's the normal thing here. Currently disputing charges on my debit card from 4 days ago, because charging me for shitty food is ok, but charging me twice is just not right. The only thing this bar has to offer is a clean restroom, and the beer was very cold. Every other aspect of this place is just another reason that it should be leveled and something worth wild be put in it's place. McFaddens... should be called McFuckedup."}
{"text":"Don't use you're credit card here. I also had my credit card info stolen here. Even better don't go here at all. Terrible service, horrible food. Every other place in Westgate is way better than this one. I would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ok let's start with the pro's, the place is fun good music, and is a 49ers sports bar which we love.  The Con's, food menu is small not a lot to choose from and a little over priced for what it is but besides the food this bar is the dirtiest bar I have ever been too, sticky disgusting floor, trash everywhere, the bathrooms are completely tore up, messy not stocked. Also service is slow, and make sure to look at your receipt lots of errors, and the waitresses are not to sure about anything."}
{"text":"The food is typical pub fair. The fries were a little underwhelming. The beer is cold and our favorites were on tap.  The turkey chipotle wrap was pretty spicy. My medium ordered burger came out medium rare. But the location is killer and sitting on the patio is awesome."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a drink after a coyotes game on the patio, hostess said about 10 min wait for a table on the patio so after getting sat we waited 10 more mins and finally asked a server to get ours so we could place our order, 4 mins later she says she'll be right with us and the proceeds to help 2 tables (6 top and 4 top) that were sat after us so I went inside and got our beers from the bar when I come back she still hasn't even tried to serve us and about 4-7 min later comes back saying it's a server section so if we are sitting on the patio w bar beers we need to move so we asked for a manager and she shockingly never brought him to us. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Without doubt the worst service I've ever had. 25 minutes for us to even be acknowledged after being sat. Another 25 for 2 waters."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to McFadden's before a recent Coyote game. The place was dead and I now know why. We were seated out on the patio and waited over 10 minutes before our order was taken. We ordered a beer, a glass of wine and an order of nachos. The nachos arrived after about 20 minutes. Our drinks were another 5 minutes after that. The nachos were horrible.  We would have ordered another round of drinks, but did not want to wait another half hour. Poor service + poor quality food =  A bad experience.."}
{"text":"We have come here a few times for bike night and we have always had great food and service! Must try the spicy garlic chicken wings!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken penne. When I received it and half way through eating it I wasn't sure if it was supposed to have chicken in it or not. Sure enough when I got my bill it was a chicken penne. Seeing how I already ate I couldn't really dispute there was no chicken in the chicken penne. How do you screw up something like that? That's like a cheeseburger without the beef patty. Yeah a chicken penne without chicken is totally worth the $15. McFadden's, your food sucks. I can make a much better chicken penne you know why? I actually put chicken in it you lazy bums. I overheard your waiters talk about having bad tips. Maybe the crappy service and forgetting ingredients has something to do with it?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I will NOT be returning here. We decided to stop in for dinner before a Coyotes game. Our waitress was more concerned with the tables full of older men and their fat wallets than ours, even though we had arrived first and were polite. My boyfriend asked if they had Oktoberfest for their seasonal beer and the waitress responded \"No\" without offering up any alternatives. We finally got our food (which was really good!) and we ate for a good 20 minutes. In this time my boyfriend finished his beer and was never asked if he wanted another. We were both finished with our food, no sign of our waitress, no follow up on food quality. We waited and waited and she finally decided to show up and we asked for the bill. We have her a card and when she brought it back, the bill included an 18% gratuity. I consider myself a pretty fair person, and if I had seen the mandatory gratuity listed on their menu or had been notified beforehand, then so be it. This came as a shock to both of us and best believe the service we received was in no way deserving of 18% gratuity. Monica needs some training on how to properly wait tables and should take lessons from the other servers in the restaurant. We saw the other servers surrounding our table more often than we saw our own server. Train your employees so you don't lose business."}
{"text":"The drinks are great and staff is friendly but the DJ only plays Spanish music... so if you're not Hispanic it's meh. - I'm updating this review and adding a star because I've been back a few times since, and the DJs have been so much better. Esp last weekend bc they had Jermaine Dupri!"}
{"text":"Visited this place the weekend before the BCS.  The beer selection was pathetic, just the big name breweries, come on people!!  Also the server thought IPA was a brand name of a beer.  We got our appetizers on the happy hour menu so the price was right, the chicken fingers were good, and the nachos were average.  We tried to watch the Cotton Bowl, but you couldn't hear the game for the music.  Make up your mind, are you a dance club or a sports bar. The fact that you are next to two stadiums should give you a clue.  The service was also very slow.  When people showed up in the reserved area, our server went MIA."}
{"text":"The kitchen seems to run fine but the wait and bar staff are in serious need of training and management.  It is nearly impossible to get a server to come to your table.  Typically, you have to get up and walk over to where they all stand and do nothing to get their attention.  They serve blue moon without oranges, Dos Equis without lime, fries with no napkins, salt, or ketchup.  And the finale is that they bring you your credit card receipt without a pen so sign the tab.  The waitress will bring you a $5 beer, and if you hand her a $10 she will ask you whether you need change!  The prices are horrible, the service is lousy and the only good news is that this place won't be around long unless they hire a manager to run the place.  It's overstaffed, yet nobody is working."}
{"text":"Came here with my family as they were in town and we wanted to explore Westgate a bit more. We chose to come to McFaddens because we believed we had a gift card and figured we'd give it a shot. It was a Saturday at 7pm and as empty as could be. We sat down and ordered our drinks which came out, my step mom ordered a vodka tonic and it came out without carbonation. She politely asked the server for another as this was just a vodka water and she ordered a tonic and they did, brought her out something that tasted the exact same, no carbonation! We finally got to ordering and the food was ok at best. I enjoyed the flavor of my pulled Pork sliders but nobody else at the table (4 others) even finished their plate, and before we had even gotten to our car my boyfriend and I had already begun to feel sick. The service was ok at best. We had a waitress who was new and that was totally ok! She did well, but throughout our time there we were served by 3 different people and all very bland. The only positive is that they have tvs and we were able to at least catch the end of the Warriors/thunder game."}
{"text":"First of all, let me apologize to the authors of half these reviews for actually thinking McFadden's primary function was a restaurant. That's just what they do to get by during the day, and you're damned right they are far from the best at it. Where this place shines is as a bar.  As a bar, this place is pretty two faced. It has an amazing happy hour. I've waltzed in with a few friends and received great service, from bartenders who gave great recommendations and were generally very amiable. It felt like one of those warm, 'hole-in-the-wall' bars where you could just chill and have a great time.  McFadden's does have a wild side. Late at night it is a full blown club. Lots of security is there to check the line at the door. Scantily-clad women (hoes) are paid to dance with their ass cheeks out on the bar, or pump you a draft from a keg. Not my scene, but if it's yours then you'll love it. It has a way of being a little bit skanky, but not sleazy or full of creeps.  As for the security, they (especially the head of it) are really cool guys. Don't throw a hissy fit when they ask you to take of your hat/sunglasses, and you'll be just fine. Overall this is a good place I enjoy chilling in when I have money to burn."}
{"text":"If I could have rated NO STARS I would have.  When we walked in the hostess' are cleaning the menus and rolling napkins(didnt think this was the appropiate place for that).  Asked for a kids menu, they couldnt find them, said would look some more and bring it to the table.  She never came back, had to ask our server, she said she was looking for it. Mean while shes hugging her friends when they come in the door, almost groping lol.  So she walks by I say , hows that kids menu coming? Oh we ran out.  We get out apps, onion rings and irish nachos.  Cold stale fries onion rings barely warm.  I dont send food back because I heard what they do on comebacks at some places.  Get our food, wife had corned beef and cabbage, the cabbage was spoiled , absolutely tasted so bad.  I had shephards pie, came out luke warm, not very good at all. Mother had a cheeseburger. Came out well done and cold. I bought a groupon for this place and wanted my 25 bucks that spend on that back. The hostess sucked the waitress sucked the food sucked. The manager ended up taking care of our bill. But I still had to pay 25 bucks for shiite ! Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"This was so disappointing. The food selection was horrible and the atmosphere was trashy teenage slash young college kid douches and hoes. Not a cool place to go and relax or have a hyped night out with friends. Just bad all the way around."}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm reading other reviews and I am shocked.  I guess if I knew beforehand, I probably would not have patronized this place.  But I will admit I only went there before the Rams/Cards game because it seemed like they least busy place.  I walked in and was told I could sit in the patio area, where the other games were on TV's.  Aside from them allowing smoking in the patio area where people are eating, I found this place to be okay.  My fish and chips were good and my waitress was very sweet.  The band was playing and everyone was in a pretty good mood in the plaza area.  Maybe I got lucky and found this place on a good day.  No theft here, used cash."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. If your here for drinks, and to get saucey- then go on in. Dont mind girl dancing on the bar above your head. BUT- Do NOT eat the food!! :-/"}
{"text":"This restaurant was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had in all aspects. I'm an extremely easygoing customer and I usually like to make friends wherever I go - I'm not a complainer at all. My experience at this restaurant was extremely awful. We were seated for about 15 minutes and no one came to take our drink order, so we had to go seek a server. They said they would have someone come over, but after another 10 minutes I went to find a server again, when finally someone came to take our order. We asked for waters about four times but didn't receive them until we expressed frustration about not receiving waters. We asked for our appetizers first because we were starving but got them out with our meals. They only gave us one of our appetizers and one of my friends didn't even get her meal. We ordered shots and one of them came in a disgusting glass - there was a lipstick stain on one side and I'm pretty sure there was ketchup on the other side. We finally asked to speak to a manager, who came over and listened to our frustrations. He said my friend's entree would be comped and that they would get her a fresh shot. He did not seem apologetic at all or like he was in the wrong at all. If I were the GM of a restaurant I would be so embarrassed about the kind of experience we had. We told him we didn't even want the other appetizer because we were over it, but he brought it out anyway. The food was actually horrible but we were too hungry to care, and the descriptions on the menu did NOT accurately represent what came out. So the tab came and he didn't take anything off - not even the second appetizer that we told him we didn't want anymore. We expected something to be comped, at least our shots. We had to get the bill rectified because he didn't take the entree off that he said he would. My friend also looked at her bank statement the next day and they charged her twice. This was actually the worst dining experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"So the Irish bar that turns into the Hispanic club at night.  My bar seat was taken while I was watching he hockey game. I was told it was for precautionary reasons ...... OMG. It's amazing. All I wanted was shepherds pie and Guinness. Not a chance at this dump."}
{"text":"Depressing. Not a good sign. Completely dead on a Saturday night in the middle of Westgate. I get that there are a couple of other choices in westgate but we decided to pop in here. BIG mistake. Their menu is the typical Irish bar fare,  greasy and should've been perfect after a day of drinking. Unfortunately, this was not the case. All we wanted were pretzels. Seeing they had it on their HH menu we assumed we could just order the more expensive plate not at the discounted HH rate. Ummm, no. They won't serve anything that's on their HH menu unless it's HH. The service was poor-my friend preferred to compare them to a smelly bottom body part. We asked them what beer they had on tap and were told \"we have a lot, do you want them to name them ALL?\" Huh? I'm sorry that we came into your life and inconvenienced you seeing that your only purpose to be in front of us is to serve us and make sure we have a positive experience in your establishment. Clearly, that was too much to ask for at McFaddens. I've never had such a poor experience in my life.   The food was mediocre and the bathrooms were disgusting.   Maybe, this space is cursed. The Other place that was here shut down too.   Seeing all the reviews on here and being at a 1.5 stars should be a sign. Shut your doors and close up all ready."}
{"text":"A table of 18 and a fairly empty restaurant with an over hour wait for food. Its ridiculous, and as our food arrives its overcooked, no condiments, and no food reprieve for the others at the table still waiting. No apologies, no checking in with us. RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"Terrible all around. Totally doing construction and remodeling and I should have run for the door when I saw only 2 people were in the bar. Had a restaurants.com certificate to use for this place specifically so we went. Decided on steak and shrimp and guess what, no steak available. Waitress suggested fish and chips so I went with it. It wasn't actually that bad despite being a bit soggy, fries were crispy and good tasting. My friend ordered a chicken cheese crisp and some wings. Tried the pineapple habanero wings and these were not too bad also. Ordered a Sheppard's Pie to go. HORRIBLE. Looked like a hamburger fell on the floor and picked up some remnants. Waitress was friendly and did a good job apologizing for her lame manager who made a lame attempt to apologize for not having food and the noise. Then the bill came and I tried to pay and what a surprise \"because we gave you 2 $ off the wings and cheese crisp we can't honor a 25$ discount coupon.\" I had already had enough of this place and the waitress again was nice about it. This is the last place anyone should try in Westgate and I promise never to go back again! There are so many other places to spend your money in Westgate!"}
{"text":"This place needs an overhaul.  I hadn't been here ever - and now I know why I avoided it.  D-bag bartenders.  Over-inflated drink prices for underpoured glasses.  Food that looked pitiful.  Mismatched bar stools. A \"buffet\" that looked like it had been there all day on a Saturday.  Do yourself a favor, avoid this place.  Ya know unless you enjoy a bartender that shouts \"Kobe!!\" as he tosses things into receptacles and encourages napkins to be thrown like confetti all over the floor.  Never again."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food and customer service. The prices were high but didn't match in quality. I ordered the Mongolian flavored wings for an app. The flavor was ok but the chicken was dried out. I ordered the fish and chips with regular fries which ended up being a $4 up charge?! I thought fish and chips was fish and fries?! The F&C totaled $17. I could only handle 2-3 bites of the fish and couldn't do all the breading. It was about 15% fish and 85% breading. I ordered the F&C because the server said it was his favorite and recommended it. My fault for taking his word. I was hoping he might comp at least 50% of it but no such luck. Also, we didn't get a refill until we were about to leave. We will never be going back there, even with a coupon/gift certificate."}
{"text":"cool Irish pub.  Server was very friendly.  Busy during bike night."}
{"text":"First and foremost, McFadden's is not an Irish pub.  Also, just judging by the location and the decor of the place, I would expect the food and service to be about the same as any TGIFs or Applebees or some other generic restaurant/bar establishment.  As a bar/nightclub, however, McFadden's is alright.  The DJ played a typical set of music for a mostly young/white crowd, but he could actually beat-match songs suggesting he has more experience than an iPod on shuffle.  The beer selection is nothing special, and the drink prices are nothing special.  The servers are nice, and cute, especially when they are dancing on the bar.  There's nothing extraordinary about McFadden's, but the ladies seem to like this place, which means I would like to come back again."}
{"text":"The place itself was...umm okay. Went on a Saturday night and got up to go to the bathroom when walking the security guard pushed me away in the direction of the bathroom instead of telling me. Physical pushed me. Never being there before I did not know where it was. I thought that was completely rude and out of line. Should consider your staff to treat the guests better. Totally asshole. Not going back just because of him."}
{"text":"Went there after a Cardinal football game.  We waited in line for quite some time.  (which I have no problem with as the game let out)  Once we got close the bouncers were very rude to the group 2 in front of us in line.  They were threatening to them.  The next group of three got waved in.  my group of three was told $20.00 cover charge.  I questioned (in a nice tone) the amount of the cover charge.  One of the bouncers very rudely told me thats the price \"and if you don't like it get the F out of here and go somewhere else\".  I asked why the 3 in front of me got let in for free.  He said \"the must of paid online own advance\".  I asked how he would know that as he never checked or asked.  The people behind us were watching.  They then left.  We left as well.  We told at least 20 people in line what happened and they left too.   There is too many places in the area to go for no cover and great service.  We eat to the Yard House.  Great times there.  Wish I had read these reviews before hand as I never would have tried.  Its evident that management/owners don't care as no replies to reviews on here of Facebook reviews.  I guess they think they that close to the stadium it doesn't matter.  Need will be here again"}
{"text":"Alright, SO this was my first time here since having moved to AZ and I have to say it was pretty fun! It could have just been the people I ended up meeting because I went alone, but I digress, here's my review:  I went on a Friday night, there was no cover for girls, guys were $5 (I only know because I asked) - the place has a small dance floor, an outside patio and plenty of seating! I liked how spacious it was and the setup flowed well!  The music was actually pretty good, steady tunes to dance to and keep the vibe alive. The DJ played to the crowd which is very important! Too often they try to be unique or different and thus end up playing sucky a** music. lol.  I didn't eat here, I just had drinks. The guy bartender made my drink strong, the girl bartender did not so I guess you just have to select who you go to. I had Jack and Coke's that ran about $7 bucks.  The atmosphere was definitely a little more classy feeling than say Calico Jack's down the way, but there were some things about this place that some could call \"ghetto\". Such as....  By the end of the night there were people dancing on the bar with their shirts off and sweating buckets and some girl basically just wearing underwear/booty shorts. I couldn't tell if she was a GoGo dancer or just a patron who took her skirt off! Bleh!! Also the girls that work here wear skimpy clothes, but I guess don't believe in going to the gym?? I'm all for people being comfortable in their own skin, but if you're hiring people to be half naked at least make sure they're in shape! They jiggled and wiggled all over the place!  NOT cute. lol   The bathrooms had an attendant, but she just seemed to give you soap and paper towels and not do much else as it was kind of a mess. I went into one stall and there was no toilet paper on the roll so I went out and asked her for some. She came over looked under the stalls and handed me a roll that had fallen on the floor!!! I seriously was like hell to the NO! I told her, \"I am not using that!\" She looked at me like I was being a diva and gave me a fresh roll. lol really?  They stayed open all the way until 2am, but once it was over, it was OVER! We wanted to take a picture before we left prompting a security guard to yell, \"take your pictures and get out!\" lol it was actually kind of funny.  Anyhow, if you're around check this place out. It might not be your regular thing, but it was fun and worth a shot if you're up for an 'interesting' crowd!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! If you go on an event night, they charge an each dollar for everything WITHOUT TELLING YOU!! And the manager just shrugged his shoulders. Our waitress kept rolling her eyes at us, not sure why. Her attitude was so unnecessary. Awful experience :("}
{"text":"So normally I do not post rants or negative status but this I have to vent . I went out with my friend and boyfriend  . We were all having a great time and hanging out and decided to go to McFaddens in Glendale .   We were dancing an enjoying ourselves when all of a sudden the bouncers grab Cameron and pull him to the side . After him not coming back after a few min , I went and followed . Next thing we know they kicked him out . For literally no reason , there was absolutely not reason .   I went back to the guy that grabbed him and ask \" why did you kick my boyfriend out and his reply was \" it doesn't matter , it doesn't matter \"   Now how the hell you going to tell me your a legitimate establishment when you can't give a reason for kicking someone out ? I mean he could have said he was too drunk ( if that were the case ) but the guy literally gave me no reason , wtf ? And to top it off Cameron was the lightest person in their , could I say this guy was racially profiling him ? I won't because at the end of the day I think the guy was just a plain ole deuce bag . But this has got to stop people need to learn respect and to communicate . You can't just tell someone to leave because you don't like them ect . If we were loud and bothering people I could understand but literally all Cameron did was have his arms around me as he was talking to me about if ever had a \"future daughter ..\"\"  When they pulled him aside .   I am writing this post in hopes that it finds people that will follow in suit in not giving this place business because  they obviously decide who can stay and who cannot , without a valid reason . After leaving I checked yelp and they are rated 1.5 stars , which now I understand why . I also want to add I was sober this whole time , not one drop of alcohol so this isn't some drunken misunderstand"}
{"text":"Real classy place let me tell you. Tables are filthy. Paper towels all over the ground. A hand written paper says \"this area is for bottle service only\" and of course no one is in there. Cover charge at this place?? You know they are dying. Jon Taffer needs to come in and over haul this place if they ever want customers again. It's very ghetto so stay away if you are looking for safety!"}
{"text":"The service was great don't get me wrong but the food was flat out bad. I tried the hamburger and fries and it was like fast food. I could have gotten a better hamburger at In n' Out. The fries looked like something out of a grocery store frozen bag and they were soggy. I was here going to the Taylor Swift concert and I would recommend any other restaurant in the WestGate area before this place."}
{"text":"One Star is not low enough for this place. Never have I ever been served with such disrespect in my life. The bartenders here at ridiculous. The drinks are weak. I can't believe I even went here."}
{"text":"Dirty, dark, gloomy restaurant. Horrible service. Servers were young girls who only cared about chit chatting among themselves. The food was so-so. They added 20% gratuity for 7 people with TWO separate checks. They didn't deserve even 5%. Let alone the 20%. We went there because we had a coupon. Never going back there again. WOULD NOT recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The food is a joke. The service is a joke. The biggest joke is the security who, in their mind, think they are above all authority. I hear horrible things about this place all the time and I should have never went. I don't understand why there is always a line Friday and Saturday nights. It sucks!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple years ago and it was a classy lounge.  So after the opening coyotes game I was excited to go have a couple beers with my husband.  After paying the 5 dollar entery fee for my husband we walked in and immediately walked back out! Napkins all over the floor and what smelled like a toilet all around us we couldn't even attempt to get a drink. It seemed like a pick up joint for low rent hookers.  No wonder the police hang out outside! Disgusting! The place should be closed down.  If I could give it less than 1 star I would!"}
{"text":"McFadden's found away to make a novelty out of an Irish pub.  Although they didn't do a very good job as Irish pubs are usually awesome.    The service is OK.  Our waitress was really nice.  We had 3 by the time the night was over.  The food is not terrible and is eatable but if you are looking for something worth the money you will be disappointed.  The portions are fine but a ten dollar burger is just a ten dollar burger.  Flavor was over salty and too much pepper.  The BBQ sauce sugary and the cheese lacked flavor even though it goop-ed off!  The French Fry portion was nothing to write home about either.  A plastic cup of beer (Stella) will set you back 5 bucks for maybe 12 oz.  They do have days with drink specials but I went to one of these and they water down the drinks.  I also went to a party where the drinks were only 1 buck and again it was a weak drink.    Bottom line is this place over priced, over hyped, and over used as a meeting spot."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Beer in dirty glass. Sewer like smell on the inside. Ordered burger medium rare, came out medium well. My wife thinks she found a hair in her food. No real reason to come here. Go to BWW if you're at westgate."}
{"text":"Never have I been treated so badly. It seems every time I eat here I get treated like I am a bother.  Why have honey hot as an option if I cannot order it. I will not be choosing mcdaddens ever for my future needs."}
{"text":"I had dinner with about 20 women here last night. I would say this place was okay, but there was nothing memorable that would make me want to go back. The service was average. We were a large group and our server seemed to disappear for quite awhile at the end of the evening and forgot to refill drinks, never asked if we wanted dessert, and I had to ask for the bill after we'd been sitting there finished with dinner for about a half hour. The food was good, but again, nothing memorable. I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap with onion rings. It was good and priced well, but not special enough to brag about."}
{"text":"It's Always Cloudy in Glendale  I imagine the imaginary Paddy's Pub would serve better food. As long as Charlie Day isn't at the grill, that is...  The first sign of \"Uh-oh\" at McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon (2/5 Stars) was the electronic menu outside that was displaying a Windows error in digitally showing said menu. Still, I'd like to give it a shot.  Inside I was floored on how plain it was. Mostly, it looks like a restaurant, but it hints at being a night-club following after (dinner) hours. It wasn't dirty or run down, just mediocre.   After being encouraged to sit at the bar, my friend and I asked for a table. It was a Saturday afternoon and virtually no one was in the place. (Eventually, other patrons came in, but not enough to fill the place. I even quietly joked on the way to the table that the place was too loud...but the hostess heard me. Of course she did.) The waitress was prompt and extremely energetic and enthusiastic, two pluses in my book. She was also patient since this was my buddy and I's first visit.  I ordered the \"Classic Burger\" since I wasn't hungry, but I love a great burger. (Side Note: Why do they always call it \"Classic\"? Is that the polite and professional way of saying: you have no real taste in food, so just order the easiest and most clichéd menu item?) My friend ordered the Mozzarella Salad and the waitress successfully up-sold him on adding chicken. I included fries and an iced tea to my order.  The wait was not uncomfortably long, but then me and my friend love talking movies and getting carried away with film-tangents, so I admit I lost track. But, I do know it wasn't that long of a wait.  Sadly, the plate that arrived had absolutely no presentation. Just the typical toppings on a boring bun (which I wasn't given the option of the type) and seasoned steak fries.  And the silverware was grossly stained - probably hard water, but I refused to use it, just in case. Sadly, there wasn't a steak knife to cut the burger.  My friend said the salad was just \"okay\" but the chicken dry. My burger and fries were just as they looked: boring. Not necessarily bad, but far from \"Classic.\" And the tea was slightly sweetened - a negative for me. But, even if I liked sweetened tea, it was rather weak.  We were invited to fill out a survey from our waitress encouraging us to return to the \"nightclub\" the place transforms into following dinner hours...I was right! Ha! Unfortunately, it sounded like their version of a \"hot spot\" wasn't really clicking with the customers - they're willing to give out gift certificates to get people to show up by filling out the comment card. Only, they wanted to call me to give the award so they requested my phone number. Yeah. Right. Well, it's not 1992. I'd much prefer them email me and I'd reply or respond with a call if I'm interested.  Overall, in this economy (hopefully, we won't have to use that phrase sometime soon) and in the WAY UNFORTUNATE status of the Westgate shopping district, McFadden's isn't doing much to make sure their seats are filled. I wouldn't completely discount it, but I wouldn't completely recommend it either.  Full review condensed just to two letters: Eh."}
{"text":"Great place for a few pre-game day brews.  Never seen so many Redskins fans in one place in AZ.  Rough game though. HTTR"}
{"text":"Terrrrrrrrrible service. Cheap frozen food. Never got the sides we asked for 3 times from our waitress and the hostess."}
{"text":"Shortage of menus with 1/2 empty restaurant so we're seated w/1 menu to share! Waitress huffs when she's asked what's on tap! Food is ok at best. This place needs to step it up or they'll be closing"}
{"text":"Went here to pregame before the Cardinals season opener. Was crowded but that was expected. The waitress took forever but i'm certain it's because of how large the crowd there was. A little over priced, the sandwich wrap i had was decent. Probably won't go here again if im in the area"}
{"text":"It's been over a week and I still have not received a response.  On Super Bowl Sunday we were never even able to get inside McFaddens and you were letting people in and only charging them $20. I think that is extremely unfair especially considering that I payed 10 times that amount. I understand the fire marshall not letting us in immediately, but I don't get why you let a ton of other people in who didn't have tickets. What was the point of the tickets? The tickets were under Laura Lee Dootson and Susan Nguyen. Please let me know if there is someone higher up I can talk to as I refuse to be charged for an event that I didn't even attend. Thank you, Laura Lee"}
{"text":"Not even nice for a sports bar. The bathrooms could use a lot of work. The stainless steel stalls of the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Seat cleaners were empty and one door was had duct tape holding it together as a repair job. Seems like any chain restaurant should have better standards than this.  The bar was not busy but we waited forever for drinks, appetizers and refills. I was not impressed and my boss who suggested McFadden's after our event at UOP stadium, was very displeased.  We had a group of no more than 8 people, who arrived one by one. The server was unable to get drinks and orders taken in a timely manner for new guests. We ordered hummus for the table and when the pita and cucumbers were all gone, by boss asked for more pita to finish our hummus. There must have been some sort of mixup with another order that was placed because the pita still didn't show up after 20 minutes had passed. The manager had an excuse about the server ringing in an order as an appetizer vs. entree. I'm aware this mistake happens in serving. I was a server for years, but in this situation I feel that if you ask the kitchen for some pita, it shouldn't take that long even if the server made a mistake with the order. It only takes a minute to heat up and put on a plate. We could have been satisfied with a simple we are sorry and we are working on fixing it right now.   It seemed like even the manager would rather make an excuse than just get the job done. A manager should set the example and level of customer service for the whole restaurant. It was a sad display.   I don't see myself returning to McFadden's for any reason in the future."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. So an Irish..Saloon?? The service was good but the food was not. A new York steak that had to have been the absolute worst thinnest cut of steak ever, full of fat and if it didn't have the sauce on it (what kind of sauce I have no clue) it would've been completely tasteless. So not worth it. Glad I had a buy one get one free coupon."}
{"text":"A group of friends, my husband and I went to McFadden's for Talk Like A Pirate party earlier this month.   Our friend reserved a table for us.  When our friends arrived they were told there was a $50 reservation fee.  I'm guessing this is how they make money now because the place was dead, including the bar during their happy hour.  We were there to participate in the event going on as well as eat.  So we decided to eat.  We told the waitress we needed separate tickets and she never mentioned they wouldn't do it until we got the bill.   Let's talk food.  The food is mediocre at best, even for bar food and extremely overpriced.  I had a salad that I paid $10.99 for that I could have gotten at Wendy's for $4 and the Wendy's salad  would have more flavor.  My husband said his food was okay but he too has also had better burgers.    Now I realize that McFadden's gets most of his revenue from the football, hockey and other events going on around it but if they don't do something with what they serve and the prices they won't last long, even with a football stadium 500 feet away.  I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Only during early evening hours and have sat at the bar. My review is based solely on sitting at the bar and before it turns into the \"club\" atmosphere. Food is ok nothing special for what they serve seems a little pricey but going to west gate you should expect that. The high reviews are for the bartenders. Times I've been there the bartenders are on top of it. Make sure you have a cold one in front of you and friendly. I will say we stayed a little late one night and the nightlife crowd there seems like a bunch of douce bags. So we just left but I can see why a lot of the reviews complain about the bouncers. If you had to put up with these s&$theads hanging out here you would probably not want to put up with much crap either."}
{"text":"They most overpriced bar food I've ever seen.   $15 for a burger???  I don't think so."}
{"text":"I stared at the outdoor patio full of empty tables and wondered why the 1 hour wait was necessary. I had really low expectations and assumed I was going to get some pretty standard \"pub\" food but I was proven wrong.   A 2 HOUR wait for our burger and fish n' chips.  I thought to myself, \"Wow, maybe they make things from scratch\" but no. They just don't seem to care, no apology, no explanation, just a plate of cold food.  Was it at least good? Yea, maybe if I ordered about 6 beers beforehand, it might have been half decent.  I'd rather starve next time."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner on a Sunday night and the place was empty - should've been the first warning sign.  We were seated and the waitress gave a good beer recommendation and seemed pleasant. We ordered our food and when it came out the server checked on us a few times but then towards the middle/end of the meal didn't check on us again.   I had a polish with fries and some bangers and mash. My wife had steak and shrimp and the food tasted pretty good and the beer the waitress recommended was also good but the service was subpar. It seemed like the waitresses wanted to sit in a booth at the back and hang out rather than work. They all seemed to look forward to their break to go shop at the outlet stores. Anyways for being one of only a handful of tables, we expected much more attentive servers and better service. We were even thinking about getting dessert but ended up going to ask for the check since nobody checked on us."}
{"text":"This place is just boring.  The staff is attractive, but not friendly or outgoing, kind of snobby like Scottsdale.  You have to line up so the bouncers can pretend it's really busy but then you get in and it's dead.  There is no dance floor, band, karaoke, large TVs, or anything special.  Everyone just kind of stands around and picks their nose.  Pretty boring."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I have ever received in my life. The bartender threw my fiancée's card at him because she brought him out a beer he didn't order (he literally already had a beer in his hand), and when I preceded to explain to her that there was some sort of miscommunication, she called me out of my name. And this was just the tip of the iceberg. I have free drink cards and I still will never visit this place again. This is my first yelp review because it was that bad."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for the Red Wings versus Coyotes game. We originally went to two other restaurants before the game because McFadden's got bad reviews on Yelp. When the other two places were too busy to get in to, we tried here, and were thrilled! We got two seats at the bar and were served drinks and had our food order taken immediately. We were very concerned about the length of time for the food, or the quality, considering the place was packed. The food came out right on time, and was delicious (two Southwest burgers). The two bartenders (a guy and girl) couldn't have been more attentive, asking multiple times if everything was OK, and getting us glasses of water when we didn't even ask for them. We've been traveling full-time in an RV for almost 2 years and have visited a LOT of bars and restaurants, and very few rise to the level of competence and quality that we found here. If we get back to the Phoenix area for another game, this will be our go-to spot."}
{"text":"This place was terrible, the service was bad, waited 20 minutes just to get water the place was empty on a Saturday and it took an hour to get our food witch wasn't worth the wait, would of left but we had a Groupon will never go back."}
{"text":"We all thought that going to McFaddens to watch the NFC Championship Cardinals game would be the perfect spot. Throughout the night we had bad service, cold food and the wait staff was awful. Brought out the wrong beer twice, and wrong mixed drink once. The food wasn't great by any means. And to top it off they messed up my bill when they overcharged me, then took more than 30 minutes to correct it. Yes I'll never go back here!!! Service, food not recommended!!!"}
{"text":"What horrible owners and managers. It is 106 outside. They have the doors open and are saturating the air with misters. It is bad for the customers. But seriously how dare they treat their staff this way?!?! Never again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service.  The only reason they have business is because they are located by jobing.com.  There is nothing Irish about this place.  We got there and were given a buzzer which required us to give them our drivers license.  Then apparently the buzzers were not charged up so they skipped us until we asked them.  We finally got seated where we waited 15 minutes for a waitress.  When she finally showed up, she waited on the table next to us first and they had been seated long after us.  The waitress said that they changed the seating chart and she didn't know.  Then the food comes out and we ask for silverware and mayo.  It took 3 times and 10 minutes to get the silverware.  We finally asked for a manager.  The food was disgusting.  The fish was dripping with grease and the philly cheesesteak had horrible flavor.  The manager did give us a discount but really this place needs an overhaul!"}
{"text":"Absolute trash place. We called twice during the day to ask what the cover was and we were told free for ladies and $10 for guys. We made a reservation and confirmed it. We then called again before leaving the house and were told that the reservation is confirmed and the cover is the same. We arrive and the nasty girl at the door tells us that the cover JUST changed to $10 for girls & $20 for guys AND our reserved table is taken and they only have standing room the rest of the night. We drove 45 minutes to be told something opposing to what we were told multiple times the entire day. We were with a group of 5 so we were not about to pay $80 to get into a bar to stand. I will never return here and neither will anyone else I was with."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Glendale for a hockey game. We stopped here for lunch because our hotel gave a 20% discount coupon. Wish we had checked Yelp first.  Great service except for the fact that my husband didn't get what he ordered. Mediocre bar food. Poor beer and wine selection AND they don't honor the discount on game days. Be warned."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the service was mediocre... I would probably give this place three starts but...  I checked my credit card statement a few days after going to this place and found that I had been charged and extra $20! I called to try to get that taken care of. I was told that the manager was unavailable and would give me a call back. I did not receive a call back, so I called again two days later. Still no call back. I called again today and nobody answered, so I chose the option to leave a message for the general manager. His voicemail is full!  Sooo now I guess I'm left with the option of filing a police report and contacting my credit card company.  McFadden's, that's STEALING and it's wrong! I will not be going back here, and I recommend anyone who goes here pays cash!!"}
{"text":"Never been to McFadden's but a coworker suggested it for lunch on 4/3/2015.  When we arrived, I was surprised to see there were only about a dozen customers scattered throughout the huge dining area.  We sat ourselves, (two of us), at a high top table.  When I sat in the first chair, the bottom seat cushion was unattached and sank into the frame of the chair.  No problem, I'll grab another chair.  The second chair had part of the frame missing and was so wobbly that I couldn't use it either.  Third chair was the charm.  Now I must admit that I watch some of these restaurant programs on TV and perhaps it makes me biased, but I don't think so.  Anyway, we were greeted by a male server who provided us with the simple one page menu.  He also took our drink order.  A minute later, a female server arrived to say that she would be our server and if we would like to order drinks.  We told her that the other server already had that under control. Not bad so far, other than the chair thing.  As I looked around, however, I started to notice how beat up the place looked.  Seemed dirty to me as well.  So, after perusing the menu, I decided I would ask the server if she would choose the fish and chips or the bangers with mashed.  Her response should've given me a green light to get the hell out of there, but so it goes.  Anyway, she said she was concerned about what she eats and hadn't had either, so she couldn't offer a suggestion.  Alrighty then.  I ordered the fish and chips.  By the way, looking at the prices I expected much better quality.  $16 for fish and chips and $20 for the bangers with mashed.  Yikes!  Pricey lunch menu.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  The fish and chips came with three decent sized pieces of fish, fries, coleslaw, and tartar sauce.  The fish was seemingly battered mush.  It had no flavor at all.  The fries were luke warm.  The coleslaw had no seasoning and tasted bland.  The server came by at least three times to see \"if we needed anything\".  I assume she was choosing her words carefully, because if she asked if everything was alright, she would get an earful.  No, everything was not \"alright\". As a matter of fact, most everything was sub-standard and there is no way I will go back to spend that kind of money for something with so little care in preparing.  By the way, with a gratuity, the bill for the two of us was $45.  Two orders of fish and chips, a diet soda, and a glass of water.  Not awesome.  How does a place like this stay in business?  Oh yeah, nightlife partiers who only care about the alcohol selection.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Got there on a Saturday afternoon around 1 p.m. and the place was empty. The hostess wasn't very friendly and acted as if we were bothering her. Friends and I expected quick service since the place was empty, but ended up taking longer than expected for food. The fish and chips were good, although the fries could've used more seasoning. Once we finished and expected the check, it took about another 20 minutes to get our bill. Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them zero stars. There is not a single redeeming quality about this place. Dirty, rude employees, nasty food, etc. Then they topped it off with the Seahawks pep rally. Never spending money here again."}
{"text":"This place was an absolute joke!  We came down from Washington for the super bowl and paid $1000 for a table.  They said there would be VIP quick lines for people with reservations. This did NOT happen we were practically trampled at the door with such utter disorganization.  Then only to not have our name on the list. After 20 more minutes of waiting and been shoved by the crowd they finally got us in but the tables were not ready.  Once in the bar itself looked cool but that's pretty much it.  The service was lacking and we could not even order food until half time are you kidding me! We have a few buckets of drinks so not to have to wait and a couple shots and the bill was way over priced.  Again with No food.  It took over 30 minutes at the end of the night to speak with someone in charge and then they sent what I think was a bus boy.  The best part of the experience was all the Seahawks fans but I can have that at home I will never recommend nor visit this bar again.  If they have big events there WAtCH OUT it is a rip off!!"}
{"text":"A pitiful representation of the other McFaddens that spot the country. At CHICAGO's McFadden one can dance on the counter top, bargain shots with the bartender, and dance to Journey until you slip on the beer-slicked floor....  NOT the case at Glendale's pathetic \"irish pub\" creation. The happy hour is the ONLY time worth going to this establishment. Any other time is a WASTE of your time. I literally wasted a whole hour at McFadden's watching a tramp-stamp competition at 10:30pm on a Saturday...  The bathrooms are nasty. The music is the worst... usually just techno and trance crap that is NON-danceable!  Additionally, there is no dancing allowed on the counter-tops...WTF."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Service was HORRIBLE. The women's bathroom was disgusting. There was a giant roach on the patio. Our waitress acted like we were bothering her. They messed up our food order 3 times. Waited an hour for our shitty waitress to return with our check. I actually went in the bar area to hunt her down and seen her and all the waitresses behind the bar not doing anything. Just standing around stuck on stupid. Told them we were ready for the check. She said she would be right out. Waited another 10 mins for her to return and another waitress returned. I'll never come here again. Waste of money go to any one of the other places around the area."}
