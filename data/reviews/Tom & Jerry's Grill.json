{"text":"Possibly one of the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The food was absolutely horrible. It did taste like very old frozen food put in a microwave . Remember if the restaurant is dirty, the kitchen must be disgusting  and  sadly The restaurant was dirty, tables were dirty and the glasses had so many chips around the rim that you had to use a straw. They charged the kids dinners as adult dinners until we pointed out all the mistakes made on the bill. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!!  Not a large menu, but certainly adequate.  Fun place to be on Wednesday Old Cars Days!!!"}
{"text":"Never. Ever. Going Back. Stopped by after hearing nothing but good things and instantly regretted it. We walked in, and no one greeted us or looked in our direction. We found our semi-large party a couple tables to push together and waited for someone to help us. My coffee was warm and tasted so burnt I smothered the taste in cream, and there was only one waitress, and one chef in the whole place. It took over an hour for some fries and a couple hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches.. Not a good experience. Maybe it was a bad day for them, but it's not something I want to repeat."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Burton!  A must visit!"}
{"text":"the food is fantastic, I just wish the owner wasn't such a jerk. Its hard to support a place that you know is run by a complete jerk."}
{"text":"The food is frozen, probably microwaved and the service is awful.   There aren't many dining options in Burton but you'd be better off going hungry than eating here.  Fortunately a Subway opened a couple doors down."}
{"text":"I was not aware that the official name was Badger Canteen.   Tom and Jerry's is your average local burger joint that serves many different types of americana type food for a good price. Burton Ohio is a small town in Geuga County that is a great place to raise your kids, but not a good place if you are a kid because there isn't much going on.   Located right next to Berkshire Highschool, this place used to see lots of business because half the store was filled with arcade games and kids would come in after school and get fries and coke and play some video games. Sadly the ownership has changed and there isn't much there anymore, but food.   The food is pretty good, they have three different types of fries you can get with your \"basket\" Fair Fries ( freshcut), Waffle, and Wedges. All can be served with cheese, and bacon but are great just on their own.   The prices are decent, and the burgers are made fresh and are hot, they have a wide ranges of wraps, and other types of \"healthier food\" but it is easier to just stick to the basics.   Sometimes its good to go back to the basics and enjoy some diner style food that  just hits the spot. This is not a place that stands out in my mind, but its been around for a while, and I'd rather eat here then at a fast food joint."}
