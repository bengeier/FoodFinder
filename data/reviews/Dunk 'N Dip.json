{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for a quick brunch - ordered a savoury dish and one pancakes special. The prices are quiet unreasonable for the quality of food (not the quantity). Our pancakes were dense in texture and extremely soggy - almost uncooked, not the fluffy texture you would expect from any standard pancake. 

The sandwich was equally bland with nothing but roast beef between three dried up waffles.  

My 2 stars are strictly for the service only. Don't let the chocolate factor wow you too much."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dessert  time in here tonight. Rosanna is one of the best waitress I have ever meet. And I already booked my birthday  party in next week."}
{"text":"We tried their Lakeshore location and remember liking it.  Since it's a little too far for us, we were excited when they opened up their Burnhamthorpe location.  But once we got inside, our  opinion changed.  Even though the decor is nice, it wasn't kept organized and clean.  What really disappointed us are the prices on their menu.  $20 for a crepe or waffle with a couple pieces of fruits on it and a scoop of ice-cream?!  no thanks.  The taste is not bad, but it looks like something I can make at home.  If the service and environment is top notch, we won't mind paying $20+ for one crepe.  But when it feels like eating at a food court, never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday night to have some desserts. I ordered the chocolate crepe and also the morrocan tea. Absolutely love this place, the ambience is very nice ad so is the food. Desserts and the main course are all very delicious.The only thing I would say is that the service is something they need to work on. Other than that really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Such an overly expensive place for no reason, they charge $6.99 for a marshmallow? You gotta be kidding

The \"freshly baked\" cookies were days old it seems, and the 1 inch width slice of cake was over priced

And on entry the cougar waitress greeted me in an awkwardly flirtatious way."}
{"text":"My God this place has horrible horrible horrible service !

Go to the lakeshore location if anything they are also a little slow but atleast competent and bearable.

This place messed up my order and then took 45 minutes to bring me my bill on top of the hour and a half they already wasted on trying to fix my order which they never did."}
{"text":"Like many others, the service we received wasn't the greatest. The staff were friendly but unorganized and slow. One meal came out long after the other, leaving me watching my partner eating without me.

The food is very expensive for what you get. Crepes are nothing more than flour, eggs and milk yet they charge upwards of $15 for one. The portions however, are quite large, possibly too large.

I was very disappointed by their sweet selection. Not only was it overpriced, the chocolate fountains were very oily. For those that don't know, if you don't have enough cocoa butter in your chocolate, you must add veggie oil to it to make the fountain flow. They had too much in there and both of us could taste it. My \"fettuccine crepes\" were sadly drenched in it. And the crepe strips were cold and hardened, not fresh like I expected. My dish looked like greasy poo noodles. Stay away from that one.

Overall, this could have been a much better experience. The decor is cool, the staff are nice if not efficient, and the menu showed promise but failed to deliver in the value, taste and creativity departments. I would save my money and go to Toronto for a better chocolate experience."}
{"text":"Can't eat here because all they serve are animals heavy dishes. Get with the times and start offering vegan breakfasts and lunch options."}
{"text":"Food was average! They forced us to have a sparkling drink and chocolate dipped strawberries that we didn't want as justification to the $15/person policy!!!
Dirty glasses when complained they took them back whipped them with a dirty cloth!!
Don't recommend at all!!"}
{"text":"So I went with my friends to dunk n dip we ordered gelato and it came with a waffle and fruits so we started to eat after the second spoon my husband notice a hair in his gelato which was covered in the chocolate and it wasn't his ... so we called the waitress and she told us that's normal to have sometimes hair in the chocolate which totally shocked us after the manager came and apologized we just went out of the Café.... that's not acceptable that the waitress is telling us that's totally normal to have sometimes hair in it :s I don't wanna know how long the chocolate stays in the fountains that's unacceptable never gonna go there again"}
{"text":"The place was decorated beautifully. That's about the only postive thing I can say about it. 

The waitstaff seemed bored and wasn't engaged in the least. A few times there would be 3 of them chatting near the cash instead of paying attention to their customers. Each time I had to flag down someone as they were rushing elsewhere. 
That could be overlooked too if the food was good. However it is grossly overpriced. I got a salad bowl that a 6yo could toss together better and it was over $10. The crepes were cold and again, looked like they were thrown together in 5 min. Plates were not appetizing. The dessert was also meh. Essentially I feel like we flushed $50 down the toilet (for an adult and teen!)  and neither of us liked anything. The only reason this review has 2 stars instead of 1 is because the ambience was nice and perhaps there is some better dessert on the menu (snow white was a bust)"}
{"text":"I've visited Dunk N Dip at the Lakeshore location quite a few times in the past and have had generally good experiences.

My favourite is the Frozen in Time, however at my latest visit at this location we found a hair in the gelato, noticeable right upon opening the jar. We brought this to the attention of our waitress, who kind of just stood there without any response as if she were puzzled as to why were were telling her this? I guess realizing that we had expected a solution, she hesistantly just asked if we wanted a new one, no other acknowledgement or anything - as if it was acceptable to just start eating the one with hair in it???? 

I do think their dessert offerings are more unique and the gelato and chocolate quality is good (however in recent times I think competitors have caught up in this aspect). Their prices are more expensive and portion sizes aren't as large as most dessert places. Although I have enjoyed Dunk N Dip a lot in the past, the customer service in our experience with the hair was pretty off-putting. Would not recommend, especially at this location - there are more cost-effective dessert options with better customer service."}
{"text":"This place is in small plaza in mississauga. Quite hard to find. It's expensive but super busy when we came. It's surprising filled for a Sunday evening. There's a 10% discount but use it before because they don't make any adjustments after you pay."}
{"text":"Nice place for dessert. Love the interiors in this place. Very well done. You have a huge selection of dessert and savoury items on the menu. 
Was craving some nice cake after dinner and so I dropped in. Ordered a red velvet cake. It was delicious and left me feeling satisfied. Serving sizes are huge in this place. 
The waiters are so friendly and efficient. Would come back for the cake."}
{"text":"This was terrible. My 5 year old brother could have made a better crepe than the garbage they served me!! Waste of my money!"}
{"text":"I went over the weekend with my family. The servers didn't know their menu very well, so had to check on what certain desserts included or did not include. But when our order arrived, it was missing both the chocolate sauce and the brownie. And when we asked about the missing items, the server some time to figure out what we wanted. And then, rather than fix the dessert and bring it back, the brownie was just added on top of the dessert. 

With their high prices (almost $50 for two small items)  and \"high end\" image, I expected high quality food and excellent service. Not the case. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Still my kids option to celebrate any birthday night out with my sweet family. Pricy but portions are big. I checked in several times never been disappointed from taste it's always the same delicious sweetie chocolate . This time I taste waffles were amazing good. Ready for kids and always waiting for lights up to serve you. Washrooms small no place for baby board but very clean."}
{"text":"Nothings changed!, it's been a year and the place is still super expensive to eat at with very little give. 

6 dollars is not worth 1 cup of cold tea, no teapot and 3 cookies.

WHEN asked for a refills they just gave me another cup of hot water? Who's smart idea was it, now I have 4 empty cups on my table.

The food is enormous, with no ability to customize your entrees, for a dessert place to only have 8 ice cream flavours is a joke.

I wish they spent less money on the decor and branding into the quality of food they put out, and have a chef time their menu.

The food itself is fine, but I wouldn't recommend anybody coming. It's not worth your money."}
{"text":"The desserts here are awesome!!!  The must try's are back to the future, waffle on a stick, dunk in dip speciality. The soups are also very good.  A grey place with great service. 
Overall a good place to have desserts and my kids love the place."}
{"text":"I love Dunk'N Dip. Great staff and great food. Their crepe desserts are out of this world. Portion sizes are generous as well. Their coffee, tea, and other drink collection is not bad either. I would recommend trying the Morrocon green tea."}
{"text":"It was a bit late and we had already had supper. It was Friday night so thought of going for coffee and a dessert. 

The location is really odd. The noodle place next door has been there for at least two and a half decades and was a favourite hole in the wall when we had no kids. The place has no proper exit and entry. 

The restaurant decor is set up really nice. The entry has a marshmallow tile (pictured). The tables, the lights, the ceiling is nicely done. The table that we sat had a table so close to us that we could hear all the conversations. 

Asked if they could make a cappuccino without dairy (almond, soy...) - sorry can't do. I asked for a sorbet - sorry can't do. I guess they haven't heard of people with dairy and egg allergies/vegans. 

Ordered a black coffee and a Back to the Future - three mini waffles topped with brownies and chocolate sauce. 

The coffee really good dark and strong. But not hot enough. One mini cookie served with it. A biscotti would have been better. The cookie was good though. 

The waffles were crisp on the outside and soft inside, with buttery taste. The brownies well made as well. The brownies seemed almost as they had been baked in the waffles. The chocolate drizzle was a nice touch. Overall it didn't taste too sweet which was preferable. 

For the price the dessert it was no value for money. The Demetre's of the world offer a more compelling value, quality, quantity and price. The service did come to par as well. Had asked for water when ordering and came 20 minutes later after asking two more people about it. The bill also had to be asked twice and second time, we were asked if we were paying by a card. We said yes. The bill came without the machine and the reaction was ooops forgot.

And yes don't forget to Check In through Yelp and get 10% off, I know I did!!"}
{"text":"I used to love Dunk 'n Dip's brunch at Lakeshore, but this store was not as appealing as the Lakeshore one."}
{"text":"We normally love this place. We love the food here.  Except for tonight. I always call and make reservations because we always come in a bigger group.  It was never a problem until today. I called and tried to make reservations earlier and left a voicemail.  We came here thinking we had reservations but turns out that they didn't check the voicemail.  If my niece wasn't so dead set on coming here for her birthday, I wouldn't have waited 45 minutes for a table. It is almost 930pm and I am starving. Not a happy camper right now."}
{"text":"NOTE: There's a Yelp check-in offer

Really surprised at the overall 2.5 rating of this place at the time of my review. 

It's definitely on the expensive side, but the taste, portion size, ambiance, and location (central Mississauga/close to Square One, without having to deal with mall parking) more than make up for it in my books. 

You do need to know what to order though - drinks/slice of cake aren't worth the price since there's not much of a unique factor, but the waffles/crepes have never disappointed me. My favourite dish is the waffles with brownies on top + added scoop of gelato. Appealing to both the eyes and stomach!"}
{"text":"Very busy place that's WAY over priced!  I had \"everything but the kitchen sink\", it was ok but not worth $16.  Too many employees standing around and staring at your table, felt uncomfortable.

However, the dinner menu looked really enticing, would go back just to try that but skip the desserts."}
{"text":"Tried Dunk n dip for the first time. It was the only place open near to mid night and near to our apartment. Was a nice experience, we tried the milk shakes and the Godiva Cheese cake etc. we loved the Godiva Cheese cake. The waitress was quick and helpful. I will try their hot main courses sometime too."}
{"text":"I always enjoy their crepes, mystery crepes are a must try. They come with a shot of your choice of chocolate too."}
{"text":"Such a good place for dessert. Absolutely loved their puffs and waffles with Belgium chocolate. 
I was also really surprised by their interior decor. 
Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"This place is really nice looking it has marshmallows all over the place, and a great decor. The place in my opinion can be a lot more cleaner; it is smelly, the forks and knifes are not really clean which is disgusting and makes me feel like I don't want to use them.

The food is good, regarding savoury there is nothing special, but sweets are mostly very good, I really like the chocolate they have. The place is so overpriced and I don't think what they have is worth all of this money! 

There service is kind of slow, like we waited for ages for extra chocolate! 

I would like to go there again because I really loved the chocolate but cleanliness is a huge issue that they need to fix it."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the abundant amount of free parking in the back. Place is well decorated and I would not be in the least bit surprised if the owner invested $300K+ on renovations alone. Interior is well lit, feels like you entered candy land, and the ambiance is there...if they had the right clientele. Initially when there was no one there, I thought to myself that I would love to bring my boyfriend here next to have a ronmatic date and fun outing sharing ice cream and all. The fantasy got shattered pretty fast by a shriek and screaming children. Funny thing is they attracted a large student group and children, and when I say children, I mean children that run around, yelling around scream while the tv's rolled lion king and cartoons on a cycling basis. So yes, Wily Wonka Candy land is real here, but sexy aromatic date, not so much. Could be different at night, I don't know, but have yet to do another visit when the moon hangs high to see the crowd this place attracts. 

Food is somewhat descent. Can't say it's jaw dropping delicious but easily consumable. Prices are reasonable given the portion size and the wide selection everything from eye-popping desserts to falafels to crepe and chicken sandwiches. Wanted to try the desert but because the helpings of a main was so large, even with someone that has a sweet tooth like me, couldn't bring myself to a helping of dessert between me and my girlfriend. Come here for the playground fun and the great location and interior design, or just a fun hangout spot with friends. You could sit there for hours and they don't rush you or make you feel stressed out to help their table turnover rate. 

Overall, would come again with friends or if and when I have children. Quite the candy land and love the interior decor."}
{"text":"The lakeshore location is way better! This one treats customers like shit and makes the deserts differently. Don't order your food and desert at the same time. If you do they will put your desert in a fridge. I told the waitress to bring our desert after our food when I ordered. She confirmed with me before leaving our table. Then the first thing put on our table was desert and I told her I had told her I wanted it after our food. Which makes sense like come on! I'm usually really patient with servers but then she started giving attitude and treating me like I had caused the  issue. She asked me if I wanted it put in the fridge. Lmao who does that? To make matters worse her manager and her are pointing physically pointing at our table and at my family during this whole ordeal. So I'm trying to keep my cool and stay patient. We had to ask for water 5 times before we got it. Once we finished our food and asked for our desert she took 20-30 minutes to bring a desert from a fridge!!! When I complained to the manager she lied and said she threw out the one from the fridge. The chocolate was hard on the crepe lol. Blatant lie! She didn't even apologize. We still tipped even though it was small because I know what it's like to have a horrible manager which is clearly the  main problem. Staff generally follows a managers lead. Get someone that actually cares about customers. I'm sharing this story with everyone. Boycotting this place after I thought it was so amazing I'm so disappointed. The waitress won't last long with her attitude of not caring at all and only being willing to be fast when it comes to getting her tip. Demetres and Spin are cheaper and the staff there treat their customers well. Don't go here  unless you wanna get treated like shit."}
{"text":"Long waiting line at night. There was no sign to wait to give your name to sign up. The attendant was really nice.
Gave our orders and didn't receive any cutlery to eat with it. Had to ask for it.
The tiramusi cheesecake was amazing,the surprise me desert wasn't so enjoyable/ it didn't gave me the good surprise i was waiting for
Overall great place just need to be more organized for the service."}
{"text":"Do not, I repeat, DO NOT eat the savory foods here.... or better yet don't eat here AT ALL.

I'm not usually a negative reviewer but I've never been so irate at the quality of food in all the years I've been reviewing or eating out. I've held back from using four-letter words all over this review, so you can liberally add them in to get the full effect of my displeasure. They get one star because our server was good through this whole nightmare experience, and because Yelp won't let me give negative numbers.

We wanted something savory before having dessert and tried their very popular (as per our server) waffle burger. I asked our server if they made the waffles in house, and she gave a convoluted answer of how they don't make it fresh but it's done earlier and then frozen. Fine, we give it a try since it was the recommended item on the savory menu. We basically paid $20 for a main course that was a complete disaster. 

The menu says \"double home-style juicy burger, three toasted waffles\" with the associated image. So one would expect two patties and three waffles at the very least. We got ONE Licks burger patty in between TWO Eggos with some pre-cut lettace in between. I confirmed with the waitress that this was what we were suppose to be served, and she LOOKED US IN THE EYE and said yes. 

First, you didn't give me what you advertised both in writing or in pictures (see images). Second, I know what it costs to buy those items frozen in the super market, heat and assemble, and it is no where NEAR $20. Third, you didn't even put in the effort to toast the frozen eggos so they were mushy, flaccid, and disintegrated into a paste as we choked down the rubbery burger. Forth, see the pile of potatoes in the picture? That was wrong also because I ordered SWEET POTATO FRIES. 

To seal the deal, we also ordered a soft drink and they handed us a room temperature can of pop with a straw stuck under the tab. No glass, no ice. 

Needless to say, we didn't order dessert here.

I am still getting angry thinking about the memory of this meal. Gah!!"}
{"text":"This location opened recently in the past week and coming here on a Sunday night was still very busy populated from teenagers to young adults mostly. First impression from the menu items are actually very expensive and I personally believe it is overpriced.

Though the atmosphere (the interior designing) had some pretty unique sightings - that may have 'justified' the high cost associated with the not-so-special deserts.

I had the volcano pancake which was 13 bucks - gave 4 pancakes with berries (raspberry, strawberry, blueberries, and a blackberry). The pancakes were extremely sticky - constantly stuck to my teeth. And we had apparently ordered a \"shot\" of chocolate dipping. Which I guess was the equivalence to extra sauce. 

Apart from the fact that we didn't order this extra shot, we had to be patient in debating back with them that we, did not order this shot nor know it was a shot as it's our first experience here. Eventually they removed it off the bill but didn't care to apologize for their mistake as customers are always right, if they really cared about customer experience.

I would most likely not come back in a short period of time, nor would I suggest to come here to my friends and family. The portions are not fair, and the price doesn't justify for what you get. I would say heading off to Demetres is the better option for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a new dessert place in mississauga when existing locations haven't impressed me much. My excitement however was short-lived, although the place is decorated really nice and we had a really nice server, the food was way too expensive and unfortunately the quality and quantity did not justify the price. I have never seen a banana split for over $18! the lonely banana came with the icecream scoops so small, it can put Baskin n Robbins kid scoop to shame! Will definitely not be returning to these money hungry owners!"}
{"text":"Ordered the surprise me this time around. Couldn't finish it and there were two of us- but it was right after dinner so that may be a reason why. Decently sized crepes, filled with a brownie, fruits, and just strawberries and then folded to resemble pockets. Cute presentation, I think they should fill one of the crepes with marshmallows or cookies instead of filling two with fruits. Best time to go if you want to avoid waiting is by 8-8:30 on a weekend, by 9 it is pretty busy."}
{"text":"Walked in, nobody greated us except for the open kitchen staff seated us in this rather isolated spot. So isolated that none of the waitress saw us. After about 10 mins one of the waitress finally saw us and handed us a menu.  After another 20 mins my boyfriend gets up and ask if they could take our order. Another 5 minutes before the waitress came and the place was half empty! Anyways the waitress wasn't very happy and she inisted we should use this lamp thing (sort of like asian restaurant door thing). But seriously how am i suppose to know? Food was a bit overpriced. Asked for water, nope nothing."}
{"text":"Came here when I was visiting Canada. Loved everything from main course to dessert. And the ambience. They serve halal. I wish there were halal restaurants like these in the US. Please please open your franchise in US."}
{"text":"food is ok, but not good service, they take too long and they don't like there customers there always mad. And the food is great but the fruits that they but on ur plate are like 2 months old or somthing"}
{"text":"This place is serving freshly made crepes with Belgium chocolate, what's not to like. It's better than it's contemporaries, and it's open when other place are not. Nice and bright for a fun evening with the family or friends."}
{"text":"I was really excited about going to this Dunk n Dip area since i'm a big fan of the Port Credit location. When my friends and I arrived it was a little busy, but not enough to be greeted in a nice manner by the hostest. When we sat down, we were served and got our order in. Within 10 minutes all of our orders came but they gave one of my friends the wrong order and fixed it. We all enjoyed our meal but when we were done our food, we had to wait another 30 minutes before we could pay. It was really annoying and took too long. Love the way the place looks but the service could be improved a lot."}
{"text":"SECOND VISIT 

Came here again to give the place another try. However the service I received is still the same. The waitress here provide horrible service. Besides getting my order wrong they are still very disorganized. One thing that bothered me the most is the fact that when we were ready to pay the lady comes and cashes my friend out and then tells us that she will be back. But she ends up going to the other table to let them pay for their bill.. like how can you just leave to cash someone else out when you're not even done with cashing out one table. That's very rude and people don't have time for you to partially do things and make them wait ... We asked for the bill first and when you started servicing us you should've finished our table and then go on and do whatever you need. But even after she finished cashing the other table out she didn't come back to let us finish paying. We had to call her over again. Horrible experience ever. 

Never coming back. Avoid this location. Go to Port Credit!"}
{"text":"The decoration in this place and ambience is great. Always makes coming here a great option for families and young groups. The hostess and service was great and they try to accommodate people on a busy Friday as much as they can! Unfortunately however the food quality isn't as good as the original dunk'n'dip on Lakeshore! None the less, it's still a good place to enjoy and spend some premium quality time!"}
{"text":"Visually appealing place, decked out with candy and is a bit more upscale than their competition, however, their prices are outrageous! A small scoop of gelato and piece of red velvet cake are approx $15.. There's nothing remotely special about this place.

Such a shame cause it has potential but unfortunately is run by corporate greed!"}
{"text":"Came to Dunk N Dip with my family for a nice sweet treat after a day at the park and I was disappointed to say the least. The service was terrible, and so slow. The menu items are very open priced. I ordered the speciality crepe, and it was mediocre. Crepe got cold very quickly. All in all, I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I read the reviews for this place and personally I don't really know what they're pissed about. 

Went there for the second time yesterday (a year and four months since my last visit). I knew how they work so I had no problems with service whatsoever but I did witness couple of customers not used to the \"lamp system\" (using the lamp to alert the servers) and got pissed that servers didn't respond to the customers calling them verbally. 
The portion size was still huge with price that is appropriate for their size so the menu didn't change as much in the last year and a bit. I did see the table next to us not being able to finish their crepes (not even half way done) and left it and paid for the full price rather than taking it home. 

I can see why they're pissed about customer service because it's different from traditional restaurant setting but it's not 1 or 2 star rating bad."}
{"text":"This place has nice decor and great for Instagram photos but when I opened the menu I was shocked to see some of the prices of the food.  

$19 for a waffle burger and the vegetarian meals are over $18 made not want to order anymore.

I had the morrocan tea special and my niece had the fettuccine crepe.

The fettuccine crepe was way too sweet that I got sick from eating it. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Service here is extremely poor. The place is so poorly managed, the employees are everywhere. Visited this Dunk n dip location a few times and all those times the service is still bad. They either don't seat you, don't give you a menu or don't give you utensils... i've even experience a time where they don't even finish letting our table pay. The waitress ran away after letting half our table pay and they went to cash out another table. 

Dessert here pricey and is a hit or miss. The gelato here is pretty good but sometimes the gelato has sugar bits inside. The gelato sometimes tastes really grainy.

Save yourself sometime. The place is really unorganized. It's better to go somewhere else for dessert."}
{"text":"I was here last night with my girlfriends for a late birthday celebration over dinner and dessert.  Sadly to say, it was a little disappointing.

We ordered 2 orders of the Dunk'n Dip Club and 1 order of the South of the Border crepe. They messed up one of the club orders twice (wrong side and then overcooked the boiled egg) that my very hungry pregnant friend didn't start eating until long after our other orders arrived. Either way, there was nothing special about the club sandwich. It didn't taste bad but definitely not worth the $18 it costed even if the portion size was decent. My other friend wasn't very impressed with her crepe. Neither of us finished our dishes completely. The potatoes, however, were tasty.

My dinner plate stayed on our table for about 20 minutes long after I was done eating and it shouldn't have been sitting there that long.

For dessert we ordered the waffles on a stick and red velvet pancakes.  The pancakes, although tasty (as it was covered in chocolate sauce and strawberries), weren't really red velvet. And for $15 the pancakes should be close to perfect. I had a hard time choosing a dessert because nothing seem to be worth the price they were charging.

Overall, the ambiance was nice, servers were friendly but slow and not really attentive, and the food was nothing outstanding so in my opinion you're not really getting good value for the price you pay (this place is not cheap).  I wouldn't go back here and I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Love this place, I usually get the fettuccine with gelato. Absolutely delicious! Staff is always very polite and quick. We also tried the waffles, very fluffy and delicious! Favorite dessert place!"}
{"text":"Great Crepes and waffles! It was so good! Quick service and deserts. Don't know how this place has any negative reviews because they are amazing ! Owner even came out to make sure that everything was good"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Dunk 'n Dip's second Mississauga location despite the low reviews. 

We were seated as soon as we arrived without menu's. The server didn't realize this until I got her attention and asked for the menu's. It seems like there were not enough iPad's for them to place orders. The server had to wait for another server to input an order before she could take ours. Cleanliness wise, our table didn't seem very clean and there was lettuce under the table. 

Not sure why their desserts are so overpriced for what we got. We shared a small red velvet cheesecake and he got a cappuccino on the side. I couldn't believe the cheesecake was approx $15! We finished that in less than five minutes. My fiancé was not impressed with his cappuccino at all. It was very small and was about $5-6. At that price he could've gotten a good coffee at Starbucks.

There was nothing that made this dessert place more appealing than others. This will be a one-time visit.

PS: If you check-in on Yelp you will get 10% off at Dunk 'n Dip."}
{"text":"My review is based only on the desserts. I have been here a few times usually with friends. The desserts here are fairly standard with regular portion sizes, however the prices are extremely steep. A slice of cake can cost about $11-$15 and a fruit platter with the chocolate starts at about $20. The portion size here is not large enough to compensate for the higher price. I would not return here unless they were to change the price or portion size. I have to add though that the decor was really nice."}
