{"text":"Food is good. But every time I call for delivery which they advertise they never have a driver disappointing"}
{"text":"Simply the best sushi in Medina. Delicious, fresh, and fantastic atmosphere. The staff are so friendly and willing to answer any and all questions. Hands down, my favorite place!"}
{"text":"I walked into this place without seeing any reviews and instantly thought--oh no, I have made a mistake.  This place is fast-casual and I wasn't prepared for that.  I was incredibly pleasantly surprised.    The store is brightly lit, very clean, and decorated with surf-culture stuff.  There was coverage of some surfing competition on the television. There were lots of tables but also an area with comfy couches and chairs.  We ordered a Reef Roll, veggie stir-fry bowl with the chili-garlic sauce, and the veggie tempura.  Everything was delicious!  The veggies--in both the bowl and the tempura--were not overcooked.  The tempura in particular was excellent--super crispy, flavorful, a good variety of veggies without getting crazy (green beans, broccoli, onion pieces, carrots).  It came with a wasabi sauce to dip it in but I didn't even use it--the tempura was so so good on its own.  The reef roll was wonderful.  Beardyman took a long time to contemplate it. The stir-fry bowl was good. I liked that you had several options of sauces and rice/noodles.  I anticipated the chili-garlic sauce to be spicy but it was not. It was good but next time I will probably try something else.    My only hold-ups about this place is that they have no recycling option for all of the plastic dishware they give you.  Also--one of the guys behind the counter was snarky at his mom when she came in to get food.  Otherwise, the service was excellent, quick and high quality.  I liked that they had loads of veggie options and that they weren't more expensive than the meat options like some other places.  The food was great quality and we will definitely come back.  I would be super ok with more of these stores popping up."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved everything about our experience! The sushi was tasty, the staff and John took great care of us, and the decor made us feel like we were back in Hawaii. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Super friendly staff! Jon is patient and kind. Jeremy makes the roll perfectly. And Smiling Matt has a big grin on his face while he's making your food. I love this place. Great rolls, and an amazing staff makes this place my favorite place to go for sushi. I highly recommend coming here and checking out Project Sushi. Thanks for the awesome service guys! See you soon :)"}
{"text":"Good sushi. Always a lot of seating, fast service, and if you ask nice they will let you sample something before ordering.  They do mostly catering so they are usually empty. A lot of foods to sample from, and they can add or remove ingredients from the meal if you have allergies. Spicy or bland if you want it. The volcano is a good choice for lunch.   Fountain sodas, most meals about $10- $14 each.   I eat here a lot. Lots of easy parking just off the highway."}
{"text":"My first experience with the volcano roll wasn't good, but they have changed the way it's prepared and the crawfish on top is delicious. Great improvement. The staff is friendly and helpful. Maybe they were just working out the kinks when I first went in, but it is a great spot to grab some sushi!"}
{"text":"This is why I miss Dallas so much.  I was just informed that my order which was over $15), was not a \"big\" enough order.  I live in Medina, but this is just another reason why I don't eat in Medina."}
{"text":"Thank you Project Sushi! You've rescued sushi in Medina. Fresh and perfectly delivered. First time we've tried you and it won't be our last! The Volcanoe roll was great, never been a big crawfish fan but I am now."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My sister and I decided to try it after running errands in the area and decided that we did not want to cook lunch. I will admit I was not expecting much but I soon realized this place truly is quality. We ordered about 5 different rolls but my favorite are the Crunch and the Crabby rolls- delicious! They have some fun twists on your average sushi rolls along with more traditional items. All of the staff was very friendly and eager to answer any questions we had. Their ingredients are fresh and taste great. We will definteily be returning whenever we are in Medina, and I highly recommend this place to anybody who might be hesitant- you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great, presence of food on a bamboo surfboard was super creative. Though it is definitely a little pricier than it could be."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! We are hooked! Food,staff and decor were all great!! Fairly priced as well!!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Food quality seemed to be low for the price point. I got the reef which has crab and it tasted very rubbery and just not as fresh as sushi should be. Ginger also appeared to have had the look like it had been sitting out for some time. Perhaps my favorite local spot from Orlando has spoiled me because everyone else had good things to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great team of staff. Best sushi of Medina, hands down. Fresh ingredients and presented creatively. Fair pricing, fun decor, and very clean. Located in a very ideal area between Medina and Fairlawn."}
{"text":"Food is really good. When I walked into the place it seemed like a lunch place only, cafeteria style order at the counter. I was tempted to leave, but decided to stay and try it out. I ordered the hurricane sushi platter and the squid salad. Both were fantastic. I.would have given them a 5 out of 5. That is still the case for th quality of food. The only negative thing was the person taking the order at the counter. I walked in a good half hour before they close. Instead of explaining the menu, he was more interested in letting me know that they are closing in 30 minutes.    Good place overall. Recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi Project - what a great little gem in Medina. Wish we had something comparable on the West Side of CLE, because it would become a go-to place for me and the Mrs. We had the Ridiculous, the Hurricane, and the California rolls with an edamame appetizer. The Ridiculous is aptly named given that it has a million different ingredients, but maybe it should be the Delicious Ridiculous instead. The decor is comfortable and makes me want to go surfing."}
{"text":"Good sushi for a good price. The rolls were big enough that one order was enough food for a light lunch. The food was also prepared quickly. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated - Medina appears to have a quality sushi place at last."}
{"text":"Consistent great food, friendly staff, wide variety, never ceases to impress. Good portions too. Is up there with other pricey sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Really nice place! Huge rolls at a good price! Never thought Medina would have a nice sushi place, however even if I didn't live there I would still come out to have sushi here.   Tried three different rolls, one being the \"Ridiculous\". All were extremely delicious. This is a legitimate sushi joint, not just \"good sushi for being in Medina\"."}
{"text":"Simple menu but a good range of options, also a good craft beer selection.  A great addition to an area that has few if any healthy options!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. They have an extensive list of sushi rolls they have created. Each roll is unique and presents a lot of different yet wonderful flavors. Their tempura vegetables are great too. In my opinion the prices are low compared to the quality of the food. The environment is clean and modern. The staff is exceptionally friendly and welcoming. If you're looking for sushi in Medina, I would highly recommend Project Sushi. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at Project Sushi and my first impression was how wonderful and nice the staff was! Smiles on everyone and three different people asked if I needed anything. The excellent customer service was enough for me to rate them so well but just the sushi was JUST as good as the staff. The salmon and Tuna were both super fresh and the ginger dressing and miso soup were soooo good! I will absolutely be going back. It's so nice to have an in-and-out sushi place around the Medina area. Five stars across the board!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Modern, fresh, hip food and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!  Creative combos, loved the soy sauce!  Very earth friendly. Support local businesses and get here for a great meal!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick bite. We ended up getting the Tuna/Scallion rolls which were good. We also got shrimp spring rolls, which were interesting but we wouldn't get again. My boyfriend also had a chicken teriyaki bowl which he liked. Then, for dessert we had the banana tempura which we liked very much. Overall, we would visit again."}
{"text":"I discovered this little place on google! Decided to give if a try and I'm glad I did!! Great sushi every visit! The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars was because the one and only time I've actually eaten inside the restaurant the employees were talking loudly about how they cheat on their girlfriends, which is something my family and I didn't really appreciate hearing during our lunch! The guys are friendly and have great customer service but I thought that was very unprofessional to let your customers hear personal conversations, especially of that nature!"}
{"text":"Great product served fast at reasonable prices.  May be the best miso soup I have ever had."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here tonight and had a great experience. Spicy crab roll, daves fave roll, shrimp California roll and need stir fry with white rice and chili garlic sauce. The sushi was very fresh and delicious! The stir fry bowl was very filling. Beef cooked perfectly and all vegetables very tasty as well!   Highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good sushi"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to give Project Sushi 1 star, I have eaten here alot of times and never had a problem until last night. Went to pick up my to go order which wasn't ready, No big deal. While I was waiting for them to finish make the order one of the workers picked up a piece of garbage on the floor with gloves on but never changed them while making food. Sad to see this as the food has alway been good. My opinion is It seems more like a party place when the owners aren't there, than a restaurant. Hope they clean the place up before it get any worst."}
{"text":"Great sushi, squid salad, seaweed salad. Miso soup is good but could use dashi broth to lighten the flavor of the miso paste that's used to make the soup. I have not been disappointed with their sushi, a couple times they forgot my sauce for the sushi but the roll still tasted great without it. Would love to see different dishes, maybe some ramen added to the menu. Their specialty rolls are huge and will get one person full. I love this restaurant, easy pickup and great food for the price. If you are in need of sushi now and don't want the horrible grocery store stuff, it's just like getting sushi from any restaurant. Their Wasabi is real and not the fake horseradish stuff, that you get from the store. The wasabi you get in grocery stores is fake, but the wasabi that's mostly used in restaurants is either the freeze dried wasabi powder that you mix with water or the real wasabi root ground up. Their is fake dried wasabi powder and real dried wasabi powder. If you think some white guys can't make sushi, think again."}
{"text":"Great spot for fast casual lunch. I got the chicken and veggies bowl with brown rice and the house and chili sauces. Hot, tasty, healthy, quick.  Service was very kind and attentive. Brought my food out and made sure I had everything I needed, offered to refill my drink. The place is also exceptionally clean.  edit: I've now gotten the sushi a few times. The sushi is only just okay. There are a ton of sushi restaurants and this place comes in right around average, especially at this price point. Despite the fact that I'd recommend it for a quick lunch, I would not recommend it for sushi.  I will say, they are NOT kidding about the spicy rolls. Whatever spicy sauce they use has some serious kick."}
{"text":"What a great find. I'm in the only sushi lover in the house so it's a great and quick place to fulfill a craving. Staff is great and helpful. My favorite is the orange with avocado"}
{"text":"I LOVE PROJECT SUSHI! I'm a new fan, but the first time I went there I was sold. The customer service is amazing, everyone is very nice. The place is so clean and so well-decorated. Their sushi is a different story. Their sushi tastes like It has a special ingredient in it! They can make a simple California roll taste spectacular. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Great place! I highly recommend it. Was home for the holidays and stopped in twice. Live in NYC area and must admit the sushi here was just as fresh as the best places in NYC, at half the cost. Will definitely stop in the next time I'm back."}
{"text":"Solid sushi place.  I know its scary to order sushi where the people making it aren't of Asian decent, but maybe that's just racism on my part.  It's not that quick because they're making it from fresh the whole time.  It was kind of funny, the first time I went in there I said I wanted to spend about $30 and I like everything, surprise me.  It was like no one had ever asked of her opinion.  There are probably way better places in the world, but for Medina, not bad."}
{"text":"It's ok, it's good but nothing special. I think the Sushi game is flooded and with all the competition this isn't \"the spot\" for great sushi. I've had it a few different times because it's convenient, both times I went there wasn't a customer in the place. It seems to be more of a take out situation based on the Moto on the wall and that they actually do delivery which is a bonus. I haven't had anything bad, just pretty standard run of the mill stuff. The Volcano roll is probably my favorite I've tried."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! They have a lot of great options. My boyfriend never liked sushi until he had it from here! I also love the decor and vibe of this place. Come here for your sushi!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a try because of their delivery option. That is about the only thing that would cause me to choose Project Sushi over other local sushi joints. The food here is mediocre.  Both times I have ordered Project Sushi, my sushi has come without sauce on it. Who wants to eat dry sushi? The first time I thought it was an accident. I tried to give them another chance by ordering a few weeks later. This time I even made note on my order in two different places to please add spicy mayo and eel sauce. After receiving my order... no sauce. Unfortunately, this is the type of sushi that needs sauce for it to be good so I was disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now, never disappointed. The sushi has been super fresh, great flavor, and the veggies super fresh as well. The spicy shrimp, the spicy tuna and then yellow tuna are unbelievable. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Beer is a little over priced, so if you're looking for reasonably priced beer move on, but if you want phenom sushi this is the best in Medina."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Super fresh. Friendly staff. The Shack Crab salad is outstanding. The sushi rolls are huge. Great price. Great food. We will come again and spread the word."}
{"text":"Traveling from Cleveland airport to Wooster for work and stopped here on the way. Great place! Sushi was fresh, staff was friendly and it was quick and delicious! Wish there was one near me!"}
{"text":"The sushi is so good.  Probably the best I have had in Ohio.  My husband and I love the hurricane roll with its fire sauce.  While the prices are maybe slightly higher than other places, the portions are very generous; I never finish what would be a normal order at a different sushi place.  The service is also great.  They bring out the food and check in depending on how busy they are.  They have always boxed up our leftovers too.  I have brought my baby there 3 times and they always are welcoming and accommodating.  They have given us a half of an avocado and white rice for him to snack on while we eat at no charge.  They also wave off attempts to help them clean up after the baby.  No one cares if he yells or gets a bit fussy.  Definitively a laid back place with great food."}
{"text":"Great sushi, The Roller, Close Out are probably my two favorite, love Dave's Fav for a smaller cheaper roll. Awesome other options, the stir fry bowls are great, edamame is really good. Can't say I have had a bad item off the menu. Awesome staff - super fast delivery and very friendly. The atmosphere is one of a kind for North East Ohio. I love going here."}
{"text":"I loved this place until I got an order of sushi with 3 different hairs throughout. Super yuck! I feel like I ate at a dirty persons house where hair floats about. They remade it but I had a hard time ordering more. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I called Project Sushi one fateful afternoon after I read a rumor that they delivered to my work. Turned out that the rumor was not only true, but the sushi was pretty damn good.   I'm not a huge fan of the overall California/Chipotle-style fast-casual. However, I am a big fan of the owner, the cleanliness of the place, the quality of the food, and that they, in fact, deliver to my office. It really makes me wish they'd open up a spot in Akron that could deliver to my house.  Love the following rolls: The Roller, The Cutback, and The Southend. As you may notice looking at the menu, I love spicy. I'm not a huge fan of their seaweed salad (I think House of Hunan's is better), but their crab salad is fantastic and really light on the dressing.  Additionally, they do cater for corporate lunches! Really refreshing change from the usual Jimmy John's and Panera catering."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago on business and saw this place on yelp. This sushi place blew me away. The sushi was fresh and made to order. The owner/manager was very knowledgable and attentive to his customers. The crunch crab roll was really good. This owner knows his sushi. Nice clean place. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Try this place. You won't be sorry. They deliver and do carry out as well. It was some of the best sushi I have had!!!  Don't pass up this place."}
{"text":"I've been a sushi junkie for about 15 years now, and have been looking for the next place central to my heart since Sushi on the Square in Shaker Heights closed 10 years ago. Project Sushi is that place for me.  The menu is varied, but not so immense that you get choice paralysis. They have the standby favorites essential to a sushi menu, and a few twists that a sushi bar needs to brand themselves. Everything tastes fresh and bright, and I have yet to find anything that isn't impeccably prepared.  Let's also talk about branding: Project Sushi has the urban, trendy feel that you don't typically get for Medina, and I think that's a good thing. It feels like a restaurant you'd find on E4th in downtown Cleveland, without having to go all the way downtown. I'm also a big fan of the sustainable ethos the restaurant promotes: it's nice to see a bedroom community have businesses as forward-thinking as Project Sushi.  I will continue to go to Project Sushi because of the menu, the service, and style. I'm really glad that they're here."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot after reading reviews on Yelp...SO glad we did. Seriously one of the best sushi places I have found in Northeast Ohio. Project Sushi has gone right to the top of our \"let's-order-something-because-I-don't-wanna-cook\" list. Hurricane roll, Spicy tuna (add cream cheese), and Shrimp tempura roll were ALL delicious. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I live in the Medina area and was very excited to have a sushi restaurant close by. However, I cannot give Project Sushi a good review. The service was the slowest I've experienced and me and my friend were the only two in the restaurant. Once we got our food it was delicious, however my friend and I both proceeded to get sick a few hours after we got home. We both ordered the same roll so I am assuming that it was food poisoning due to it only lasting a day for both of us. I wanted to love this place but I ended up being disappointed."}
{"text":"Great sushi every time. Always fresh so expect a few minutes wait time if you order a lot like I do."}
{"text":"Great Sushi! Everything I have tried has been excellent. I could eat their crab salad everyday of the week. :) Awesome atmosphere, music, and owners!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Our first time here, we will be back. It is order at the counter eat in or carry out Sushi and salads (rice bowls too, though I didn't try one on this visit). The Sushi was prepared very well, very fresh and delicious. We had the Ridiculous Roll and the Rainbow Roll which were excellent. The nigiri was also excellent as well as the dinner salads. They the ginger salad dressing ( almost as good as Kasai's). Nice to have another choice for Sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Heard good things, and wasn't disappointed. Brought my Japanese mom, the real judge, and she agreed.  Very fresh, flavorful fish, and generous sized.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Project Sushi was good, but I wouldn't call it exceptional. Each order is made individually. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. I got the orange sushi and miso soup. The soup was excellent. The sushi may have been made by someone who was just training, because it was very loosely rolled. When I picked them up with my Chopsticks, each and every piece broke into crumbles. It was good, but not the best presentation."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went to Ohio for winter break (I'm originally from California) and decided to check around Yelp for some good sushi. Knowing my options would be limited, I feel as if I made the right choice for picking project sushi! This place is legit. My boyfriend is super picky about sushi places and he loved this place also. We even got his family to try it the next day! I can't wait to come back to Ohio and get me some project sushi again!!"}
{"text":"I went there last night with some girl friends. If you are looking for pins and needles in your stomach the next day then this is your place. Ugh..."}
{"text":"Great sushi and stir fry bowls. Staff is super friendly and helpful. I try to come here at least once a week. I live over 25 minutes away from here. But it's so good I will take the time to drive here."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Best sushi I've had in a long time and incredible service!! I had the chicken tempura roll and it was heavenly. Super crunchy and super fresh!"}
{"text":"Found Project Sushi about 6 months ago. I love sushi, but another restaurant was nearly twice the price. I told them how that place made my roll and they made a roll specifically for me - it's great (try the KP Roll). At least one or twice a week I stop by on my way home coming off of the highway. Great sushi at a great price. Never had a problem. The staff is friendly, and, since I always get the same thing they know what to make when they see me. It's like Cheers but as a Sushi Bar and without Norm."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in town! Consistently great, never a bad experience. They'll customize your rolls to suit you, or recommend something if you aren't sure. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the California vibe! Favorite rolls we ordered: Crunch and Hurricane. Fast and fresh ... and friendly chefs! Definitely will come back if I'm in Medina!"}
{"text":"Love the surf theme!  Reminds me of Hawaii! Great sushi, creative and ....well...Fun! BUT don't  forget the noodles! Awesome staff! These folks KNOW sushi."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and reasonably priced for the quality. Project Sushi has a lot to offer, the stir fry is incredible for anyone who isn't a sushi fan, and anybody who is on the fence about seafood should definitely try the Chicken Tempura roll or a Crunch roll, both are delicious and you wouldn't even believe you're eating sushi. Oh and they deliver in Medina too!"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, friendly, clean what more do you need to know about a restaurant?!  Good portion size and good value for your money!"}
{"text":"Love the asparagus tempura roll and Dave's fave! Love the many other rolls as well as the salmon & veggie brown rice bowl with house house sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"Found looking for dinner off of 71. On right in shopping center near Mexican restaurant. Miso soup was delicious a great way to start. Four sushi rolls delicious. See posted surf board picture. Big take out business. We will stop again."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the price vs quality of Project Sushi. The staff is always very friendly, there's a reward program through using the same card on their square register. The sushi is always fresh and flavorful. Definitely the best in Medina, by my opinion."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great prices. One of our favorites in Medina.Try the secret Hot Sauce!"}
{"text":"When going for sushi at lunch, this is my spot in Medina. Usually a weekly Friday visit for a spicy tuna or yellowtail roll, some nigiri (tuna, yellowtail, and eel) or one of their creations (the volcano has become a favorite).   If I'm eating sushi I want to know the ingredients are fresh and quality is consistent. In my opinion, Project Sushi does just that with reasonable prices and fast friendly service. It's an excellent lunch spot to pickup or dine in. The creations are a unique twist on normal sushi and fun to add (especially if splitting with a friend).  If you like fresh sushi, you have to try Project Sushi at least once (but probably more)."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Medina and they deliver! The owner is a great down to earth guy and is passionate about customer service and quality of the food. The sushi was fresh and good portions. The noodle bowls were equally as good."}
