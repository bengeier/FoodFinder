{"text":"This is a review on the overstuffed sandwich. This sandwich is amazing. I love sandwiches and am a self proclaimed connoisseur. 

I stopped by this place a year ago when I was in town for work. Stopped by on the way to see the tribe play looking for a quick bite. The bar tender suggested the turkey sandwich. It was delicious. So good I got one the next day. 

TL; DR: the over stuffed sandwich might be one of the best sandwiches I ever had."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had. Waited almost an hour for food. When we asked if they could check into it or bring kids food waitress was rude and dismissive. We left without getting our food and with very cranky kids. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I had a chicken salad it was so good!! I can't wait to order food from here again. The salad was fresh, plenty of meat with cheese and banana peppers."}
{"text":"Great paninis!  French fries and cole slaw on the sandwich.  Good food for watching a ball game."}
{"text":"I was in a bad mood for various reasons. After two minutes the staff had me smiling. Beer was a great price too. Food good too!"}
{"text":"Steer clear of the #1 cheesesteak. If you're thinking you're getting a nice filet on this sandwich, think again. After a night of drinking, nothing goes better in the gut then a Panini's sandwich!!! The set up alone is mind boggling delicious! So I stumble in thinking \"God a steak sounds great\". Boom, Paninis offers a steak on a sandwich!!! Except God sent Panini's an imitation \"meat\" that could be used as a door wedge. Started second guessing every decision I made while I polished off this sandwich. Hopefully the meat is upgraded. Needs to get on par with Morton's and other steakhouses around town."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences my wife and I ever had.stop after Indians game for a slice of pizza and beer and we're harassed by bartenders four friends.never go here"}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in the C L E... Also a great place to watch a game with solid drink specials.  Finally, I lost my wallet downtown on a Friday and they had the courtesy to contact me at work via a business card (in the wallet) to return it.  Cannot recommend Paninis enough."}
{"text":"In town today for sneakercon. Drop my son and buddies off and hoofed it through the below zero wind chill to this place. Why?  Because some friends told me it was awesome. It was worth the walk. Had regular sized turkey and I was stuffed. What a unique sandwich.  Had the bread been grilled I would have given five stars. Very friendly service. Stop by and try it.  Warning--come ready to eat.  You will be full when you leave"}
{"text":"I went here before and after an Indians game...$4 tall boy beers (24 oz.) out on the patio before the game are a decent price compared to what you pay once you are inside the stadium.
The sandwiches are hard to get your mouth around...meat, cheese, slaw, french fries all slapped together between two pieces of freshly sliced french bread...for $6.
I tried the capicola ham one day and then the roast beef the next day. Both were delicious. An awesome sandwich!"}
{"text":"This location (among others) should not be allowed to carry the paninis name. Nothing like the west 6th location, which is the only one worth going to. Forget all those suburb locations they just don't have the turnover to keep the food fresh. Pizza here was very middle of the road partly uncooked. Beer tap a bit too warm for summer. On a good note everything is a little sticky so you don't have to worry about losing your  $$ falling off the tables and onto the floor. Do yourself a favor and go to the w. 6th location where the pizza is thin and bubbly and the sandwiches are fresh! Also your arms won't be sticking to the bar! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The original! An old favorite for before the game or after a rock show. Had the No. #1 Cheese steak this week for the first time in eons, and it was like reconnecting with a long lost best friend. You may regret it the next day (I.e. the pepperoni pizza), but in the moment, there's nothing better."}
{"text":"Best patio for all Indians and Cavs pre-game festivities!  The only gripe I have about this place is I wish they would add more tables and chairs to the patio to accommodate more people."}
{"text":"BIG OL RIDICULOUS AND DELICIOUS SAMMICHES. Just do it. Whether it is the Covenrty location, West 6th or Gateway.  I am always satisfied! Alot of food for a little money."}
{"text":"Panini's goes hand in hand with Cleveland sports.

I stop in before every Browns/Indians game I go to.  

It's a simple place but the giant sandwich, pizza and beer selection are great.  The pre-game energy always gets me excited for the game.  

I always feel at home with a bunch of rowdy Cleveland fans and am  still comfortable taking the kids in the soak up the fun."}
{"text":"If you leave this place hungry then you must not have had the overstuffed sandwiches.  I am a creature of habit and tend to stick with my tried-and-true turkey. However, there are times when I feel like diving into the crazy and getting an egg thrown in top...today was one of those times. After a long day and a late lunch oh man this really hit the spot. The guys manning the grill are friendly and have your sandwich done in 3 mins tops. I work across the street and I was away from my desk for maybe 10 minutes. How can you beat that?? Big thanks to the friendly fellow that gave me a big side of hot sauce!"}
{"text":"1st time therein 15 years...bread smaller, less meat on Capicolla sandwich...place is dirty....very disappointed"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Cleveland I always stop at the Gateway Paninis!  Always friendly, very reasonable beer prices, and good sandwiches.  In the summer they have an outside area too!  Great pregame start for Indians or Cavs games."}
{"text":"Came across the country for the best sandwich on the planet!! Ate one on the shuttle for the rental car the airport!!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was surprised it wasn't more packed b/c there was an Indian's game about to start. They have a big, open space inside and great patio. Seems like a great place to have a few beers before a game or whenever. Had one of their overstuffed sandwiches and it was great and very filling. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here before the Tribe game and have no qualms besides a slightly above-average glass of Summer Shandy. Nonetheless, this is to be expected from a sports bar just a quick walk from the stadium. The crowd was great, just a bunch of hearty crews, eager to imbibe before heading to the game. I did not expect such, shall we say, \"ambitious\" bussers, but otherwise the service was prompt and friendly.  

My colleagues at work praise the panini (surprise surprise), but I did not indulge in the bar food."}
{"text":"The climate in Cleveland is unfortunately not very conducive to outdoor patios, especially downtown, where space is valuable. I typically think Paninis is a mediocre-at-best local chain of bars. Most suburban Paninis locations are worth visiting only because they are the only place around (what did you expect in the suburbs?).

The East 9th Paninis get's my stamp of approval because it's the best patio in downtown Cleveland. It can be easy to get cabin fever in Cleveland, so when the weather turns, there's nothing better than sitting outside after work drinking a beer. Paninis is one of the few places downtown where that happens."}
{"text":"Panini's is one of my favorite restaurants to go to for dinner before an Indians game. Their sandwiches are reasonably-priced and big enough to share with someone else if you're not starving. The turkey is my favorite although they offer sandwiches with almost every other type of meat and taste great with the coleslaw and fries that come in the sandwich! They have many great beer choices as well. 

It's usually very busy the nights of sports events, but it's the type of place where you can find an open spot and stand while eating.  They also have a great patio space that's open in the summer."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are fine, no complaints. But one problem: the menu contains ... not a single panini!  The closest item, called the Panini Boy, turned out to be a cheeseburger!  So how does a restaurant named Panini's not offer its namesake food? The manager explained that \"panini\" is Italian for \"sandwich\".  (Not exactly: the actual Italian word is \"panino\" - \"panini\" is the plural - and even in Italy, it refers to a specific sandwich, one made with something other than sliced bread and then grilled in a press.)  So for basic \"bar & grill\" fare, you can do a lot worse -- but if your taste buds are craving a genuine panini, you won't find one here, despite the name on the sign."}
{"text":"Have been a long time patron of Panini's Bar and Grill, usually i go there before or after Tribe games since it is literally about a block away from the Jake(still call it the Jake, Progressive Field ehhh). Ventured to Panini's after watching the Tribe win it's 18th straight game (currently 19!!), on a Sunday night, wasn't too crowded, ordered my staple cheesesteak panini with an egg....if you haven't had a panini it is a big sandwich...seriously, it is a stuffed sandwich with french fries, vinegar based cole slaw, cheese and whatever meat you decide on stuffed between italian bread. The balance of salt with the fries and in this case steak and cheese with the acidity of the slaw takes this sandwich over the top...this sandwich is not for the faint hearted, definitely have to eat this sandwich with 2 hands and trust me it is not a neat eat, you will have slaw/fries spilling out of your sandwich as you pick it up and engage in conquering this bad boy...I have had the Pizza, and it is delicious, NY style large slices - can't go wrong with either accompanying your favorite adult beverage!!! do yourself a favor and get to the iconic  Panini's Bar and Grill on Huron/E 9th...take in the atmosphere and root for your favorite Cleveland teams....Oh and check out the patio, awesome in the summer, tubs of cold beverages..fills up quick before and after Tribe games....."}
{"text":"The bar tender was extremely friendly and the sand which was very good. They also had a very good beer selection. I would recommend stopping in here before an Indians game."}
{"text":"I just had the best sandwich I've ever eaten! I live in California, just passing through and yelped \"sandwich\" which led me here........suprised it's not all 5 stars. The help were friendly and polite, service was fast, food was cheap. Best of all the sandwich is spectacular (I got the turkey) and it's big enough to feed a family. No complaints at all here"}
{"text":"This is a good spot to hit before an Indians game. It's close to the stadium, good crowd, attentive staff. Go see Flash!"}
{"text":"Panini's definitely outdoes \"Primanti Bros\".  I've tried them both....Panani's for the win.  Great ingredients, great taste, filling, and a classic in Cleveland.  Must try Panini's now."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place. I come here before all the Cleveland home games. For all of you Judgy McJudgesters out there, save it. I already feel your sarcastic comments and I have enough of my own. One day Joe Thomas will walk in here and be like, \"Oh, there's my biggest fan and she is eating her go to bacon egg and cheese sandwich with her 5 dollar 24 oz. beer and wearing my jersey\". Since this will never happen and I may or may not have dreamed this, please continue reading.

This place has the best staff esp. my man Kevin behind the bar/ front of grill, and the owner is always there, which I Love,  and the bartenders are super fun and friendly and they always give you a koozie if you ask for one, even for the big cans. 

So if you love the Panini sandwich this is the spot to get one. Bacon egg and cheese is my go to with a cold beer. Always a great place to be before any sporting event. They also have a kick ass patio to enjoy! Decent parking all around, you can usually park around this one for about 10 bucks. Easy walk to the Q to the Jake (I know it will always be the Jake to me) and a quick 15 min walk to the Browns Stadium. I suggest eating here instead of the Browns stadium where it will cost you 7 dollars for a 3 week old hot dog and 11 dollars for a skunk beer. Here we go Brownies!! WOOF WOOF!!"}
{"text":"Panini's is my go to location before and sometimes after any Cleveland sporting event. The restaurant/bar is a decent size as well as the outdoor patio. Panini's can get VERY crowded so keep that in mind. The beers are pretty cheap and there are always shot specials. The food is typical bar food but tasty."}
{"text":"This place gets packed during games! It is right by the progressive fields .  We always stop by because this is where our friends like to eat and drink. They are really more of a drinking spot but my friends love their paninis. It is really not that good . It is more of drunk food . I had their pizza and it was way too thick .  The prices are awesome though. I wish they can do so more cleaning of the floor and restroom .  It would make it more appealing, because it is in a great location ."}
{"text":"It's not gourmet, and it's pretty much a facsimile of Primanti's in Pittsburgh, but it really hits the spot sometimes. This location has always been fast and friendly for me. It helps to be drunk or hungover to fully appreciate the food."}
{"text":"Great place to go when either going to a tribe or browns game.....sandwiches amazing, like primanti bros restaurant in pittsburgh. Good beer selection, good service, good prices."}
{"text":"When we got here we were literally the only ones in the bar. The staff was quick and friendly but the yuengling i ordered tasted hoorible. The tap must have been very old."}
{"text":"Like Jason S. below said, \"Panini's goes hand in hand with Cleveland sports.\" You cannot go to a sporting event, especially the Indians, without stopping at this Panini's. The vibe is all Cleveland. It feels like everyone is just one big family drinking together and celebrating Cleveland. 

Now lets talk about these crazy sandwiches. Last night was the first time I've had a panini from here and it was delicious. I usually get a slice of pizza but this time I needed to try to panini. 

All in all, great place to be a Clevelander."}
{"text":"I've said this before and I'll say it again, \"Get drunk.  Go to Panini's and eat a huge sandwich.\"  Work paid for us to go to a Tribe game during business hours, so we decided to stop at Panini's for a huge beer on our way to the Jake.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  It's called Progressive Field.  But I prefer the bi-syllabic \"The Jake\" instead.  It just sounds better.

This place is in a prime location in Cleveland since it is close to all the major sports arenas.  

The sandwiches are amazing.  If you haven't had one, stop in and grab one, you'll be surprised how they serve them.  You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"LOVED the atmosphere of this bar! Definitely a ton of fun, good music, and also the patio is awesome!!!!!! We came back after our show at the Q for a drink and some pizza. The beer was cold! Buuuuuut the Pizza was awful!!! Giant ball of grease, no flavoring, and just all around bad. Even after quite a few drinks for the day I couldn't stomach it. Great bar for grabbing a drink and to hang out before a game or a show!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. The only bar to go to in the Gateway District."}
{"text":"It was a great place to go when my sisters and I were looking for bar food and drinks while enjoying downtown Cleveland! Our bartender also made the experience that much better, since the place was pretty empty when we arrived he was very lively and attentive and even engaged in our silly conversation for awhile!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! It was a busy Friday night before a Cavs game and I brought several friends who were unfamiliar with Cleveland. The food was great and they have a pretty good beer selection on tap. I had the triple grilled cheese and I loved every bite! The house made chips are great too! My friend ordered a cheese pizza and she gave it a hearty approval, which is big because she orders cheese pizza basically everywhere and not just anyone makes the cut. Although they were understaffed for the large groups that came in (3 people working the bar and the grille was definitely tight), the food was great and it came out in a reasonable amount of time. Thanks again for a great meal, Paninis!!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was probably the worst I have ever . It had no flavor at all. It was cheesy bread with some pepperoni added. I have heard the sandwiches are good?"}
{"text":"Really not thrilled that a bartender physically removed a nearly full beer from my hand and threw it away ten minutes before cut off--when I wasn't remotely intoxicated or obnoxious.  Seems like theft to me."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! Nothing is better than a big Panini's sandwich or slice of pizza after a night out in Cleveland!!  Add a 24 ounce beer and what more could you want??  It can get very crowded as the hungry drunk crowd rolls in so you need to be prepared to elbow your way to the front!"}
{"text":"Surprised there was two Panini's within a few miles of each other but I would commend that it was done so strategically. One for the drunken West 6 party people and another (this one) in close proximity to the baseball and basketball games. Love this place because even if you don't get a ticket to the game, you still enjoy the tribe vibe. Large pizza is only 12 bucks and is one of my favorite CLE pizza places. Thin crust, good sauce and great price. As was the beer. There is indoor and outdoor patio. Staff was attentive and fun. No close parking that was free but that would not stop me. I heart you paninins."}
